Questions: 

* Matchings 

	- Is it a graph or a hypergraph (matching)?
	- Is the graph bipartite?
	- What type of a matching problem? Can each vertex be matched to more than 1 edge or not? (b-matching for b>1 or not)
	- Should the matching respect some preference order on the neighbors of each vertex?

* Flows
	- single commodity or multi being shipped?
	- capacities on edges and/or vertices? (fuzzy arc lengths)
	- is the problem to find the max flow or report min cut?
	- Bounds or exact solutions desired?
	
* Routing
	- Digital or Physical goods? (Packet routing versus other types)
	- How many sources, how many destinations? 
	- (Dial-a-ride or not -- how to ask?)
	- Direct routing or are buffers allowed?
	- Which of congestion/dilation is more crucial to minimize?
