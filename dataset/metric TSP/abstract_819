I consider a semiclassical expansion of the scalar field in the warm
inflation scenario. I study the evolution for the fluctuations of the metric
around the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker one. The formalism predicts that, in the
power-law expansion universe, the fluctuations of the metric decreases with
time.
