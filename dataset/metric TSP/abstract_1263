We study the limits of sequences of spheres and complex projective spaces
with unbounded dimensions. A sequence of spheres (resp. complex projective
spaces) either is a Levy family, infinitely dissipates, or converges to (resp.
the Hopf quotient of) a virtual infinite-dimensional Gaussian space, depending
on the size of the spaces. These are the first discovered examples with the
property that the limits are drastically different from the spaces in the
sequence. For the proof, we introduce a metric on Gromov's compactification of
the space of metric measure spaces.
