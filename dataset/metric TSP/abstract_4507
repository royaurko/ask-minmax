One of the most important aims of the fields of robotics, artificial
intelligence and artificial life is the design and construction of systems and
machines as versatile and as reliable as living organisms at performing high
level human-like tasks. But how are we to evaluate artificial systems if we are
not certain how to measure these capacities in living systems, let alone how to
define life or intelligence? Here I survey a concrete metric towards measuring
abstract properties of natural and artificial systems, such as the ability to
react to the environment and to control one's own behaviour.
