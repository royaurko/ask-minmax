The known static isotropic metric of Schwarzschild solution of Einstein
equation cannot cover with the range of r<2MG, a new isotropic metric of
Schwarzschild solution is obtained. The new isotropic metric has the
characters: (1) It is dynamic and periodic. (2) It has infinite singularities
of the spacetime. (3) It cannot cover with the range of 0<r<r0; On the other
hand, r0 can be small discretionarily. (4) It seemed as if the range of
negative r could be unavoidable, although this range is meaningless for the
Schwarzschild metric.
