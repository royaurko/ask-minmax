For the massive gravity, after decoupling from the metric equation we find a
broad class of solutions of the Stuckelberg sector by solving the background
metric in the presence of a diagonal physical metric. We then construct the
dynamics of the corresponding FLRW cosmologies which inherit effective matter
contribution through the decoupling solution mechanism of the scalar sector.
