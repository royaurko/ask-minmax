It has been recently claimed that the initial singularity might be avoided in
the context of rainbow cosmology, where one attempts to account for
quantum-gravitational corrections through an effective-theory description based
on an energy-dependent ("rainbow") space-time metric. We here scrutinize this
exciting hypothesis much more in depth than previous analyses. In particular,
we take into account all requirements for singularity avoidance, while
previously only a subset of these requirements had been considered. Moreover,
we show that the implications of a rainbow metric for thermodynamics are more
significant than previously appreciated. Through the analysis of two
particularly meaningful examples of rainbow metrics we find that our concerns
are not merely important conceptually, but actually change in quantitatively
significant manner the outcome of the analysis. Notably we only find examples
where the singularity is not avoided, though one can have that in the regime
where our semi-classical picture is still reliable the approach to the
singularity is slowed down when compared to the standard classical scenario. We
conclude that the study of rainbow metrics provides tantalizing hints of
singularity avoidance but is inconclusive, since some key questions remain to
be addressed just when the scale factor is very small, a regime which, as here
argued, cannot be reliably described by an effective rainbow-metric picture.
