The hidden symmetries of higher dimensional Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics are
investigated. In certain scaling limits these metrics are related to the
Einstein-Sasaki ones. The complete set of Killing-Yano tensors of the
Einstein-Sasaki spaces are presented. For this purpose the Killing forms of the
Calabi-Yau cone over the Einstein-Sasaki manifold are constructed. Two new
Killing forms on Einstein-Sasaki manifolds are identified associated with the
complex volume form of the cone manifolds. Finally the Killing forms on mixed
3-Sasaki manifolds are briefly described.
