We give a brief survey of thermodynamic metrics, in particular the Hessian of
the entropy function, and how they apply to black hole thermodynamics. We then
provide a detailed discussion of the Gibbs surface of Kerr black holes. In
particular we analyze its global properties, and extend it to take the entropy
of the inner horizon into account. A brief discussion of Kerr-Newman black
holes is included.
