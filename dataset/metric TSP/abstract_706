IAs is well known, when D6 branes wrap a special lagrangian cycle on a non
compact CY 3-fold in such a way that the internal string frame metric is Kahler
there exists a dual description, which is given in terms of a purely
geometrical eleven dimensional background with an internal metric of $G_2$
holonomy. It is also known that when D6 branes wrap a coassociative cycle of a
non compact $G_2$ manifold in presence of a self-dual two form strength the
internal part of the string frame metric is conformal to the $G_2$ metric and
there exists a dual description, which is expressed in terms of a purely
geometrical eleven dimensional background with an internal non compact metric
of Spin(7) holonomy. In the present work it is shown that any $G_2$ metric
participating in the first of these dualities necessarily participates in one
of the second type. Additionally, several explicit Spin(7) holonomy metrics
admitting a $G_2$ holonomy reduction along one isometry are constructed. These
metrics can be described as $R$-fibrations over a 6-dimensional Kahler metric,
thus realizing the pattern Spin(7) $\to G_2\to$ (Kahler) mentioned above.
Several of these examples are further described as fibrations over the
Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instanton and, to the best of our knowledge, have
not been previously considered in the literature.
