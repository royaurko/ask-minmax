We investigate a scenario with two four-branes embedded in six dimensions.
When the metric is periodic and compact in one of the dimensions parallel to
the branes, the value of the effective cosmological constant for the remaining
five dimensions can assume a variety of values, determined by the dependence of
the metric on the sixth dimension. The picture that emerges resembles the
Randall-Sundrum model but with an extra warped dimension that allows the usual
brane-bulk fine tuning to be satisfied without finely tuning any of the
parameters in the underlying six dimensional theory. Although the action
contains terms with four derivatives of the metric, we show that when the
branes have a finite, natural thickness, such terms have only a small effect on
the Randall-Sundrum structure. The presence of these four derivative terms also
allows a configuration that resembles that produced by a domain wall but which
results from gravity alone.
