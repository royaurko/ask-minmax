Hash chains provide a secure and light way of security to data authentication
including two aspects: Data Integrity and Data Origin Authentication. The real
challenge of using the hash chains is how it could recover the synchronization
state and continue keeping the hash link in case of packet loss? Based on the
packet loss tolerance and some accepted delay of video delivery which are
representing the permitted tolerance for heavy loaded applications, we propose
different mechanisms for such synchronization recovery. Each mechanism is
suitable to use according to the video use case and the low capabilities of end
devices. This paper proposes comparative results between them based on the
status of each one and its overhead. Then, we propose a hybrid technique based
Redundancy Code (RC). This hybrid algorithm is simulated and compared
analytically against the other techniques (SHHC, TSP, MLHC and TSS). Moreover,
a global performance evaluation in terms of delay and overhead is conducted for
all techniques.
