As a special class of conformal metrics with negative curvatures, SK-metrics
play a crucial role in metric spaces. This paper concerns the variants of
Ahlfors' lemma in an SK-metric space and gives a higher order derivative
formula for the logarithmic potential function, which can be applied for the
estimates near the singularity of a conformal metric with negative curvatures.
