In this paper, we find all the Conformal Killing Vectors (CKVs) and their Lie
Algebra for the recently reported [cqg1] spherically symmetric, shear-free
separable metric spacetimes with non-vanishing energy or heat flux. We also
solve the geodesic equatios of motion for the spacetime under consideration.
