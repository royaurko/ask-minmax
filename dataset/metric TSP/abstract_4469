In this paper we construct a family of ways in which matter can couple to one
or more `metrics'/spin-2 fields in the vielbein formulation. We do so subject
to requiring the weak equivalence principle and the absence of ghosts from pure
spin-2 interactions generated by the matter action. Results are presented for
Massive, Bi- and Multi-Gravity theories and we give explicit expressions for
the effective matter metric in all of these cases.
