The localization of metric fluctuations on scalar brane configurations
breaking spontaneously five-dimensional Poincar\'e invariance is discussed.
Assuming that the four-dimensional Planck mass is finite and that the geometry
is regular, it is demonstrated that the vector and scalar fluctuations of the
metric are not localized on the brane.
