We prove that the deformation theory of compactifiable asymptotically
cylindrical Calabi-Yau manifolds is unobstructed. This relies on a detailed
study of the Dolbeault-Hodge theory and its description in terms of the
cohomology of the compactification. We also show that these Calabi-Yau metrics
admit a polyhomogeneous expansion at infinity, a result that we extend to
asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics as well. We then study the moduli
space of Calabi-Yau deformations that fix the complex structure at infinity.
There is a Weil-Petersson metric on this space which we show is K\"ahler. By
proving a local families L^2 index theorem, we exhibit its K\"ahler form as a
multiple of the curvature of a certain determinant line bundle.
