We introduce a new method to calculate the multi-scale 3D filamentation of
SDSS DR5 galaxy clusters and also applied it to N-body simulations. We compared
the filamentation of the observed vs. mock samples in metric space on scales
from 8 Mpc to 30 Mpc. Mock samples are closer to the observed sample than
random samples, and one of the mock samples behaves better than another one. We
also find that the observed sample has a large filamentation value at a scale
of 10 Mpc, which is not found from either mock samples or random samples. Key
words: filamentation, metric space, galaxy clusters, SDSS DR5.
