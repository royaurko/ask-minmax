In this paper we introduce generalized symmetric Meir-Keeler contractions and
prove some coupled fixed point theorems for mixed monotone operators $F:X
\times X \rightarrow X$ in partially ordered metric spaces. The obtained
results extend, complement and unify some recent coupled fixed point theorems
due to Samet [B. Samet, \textit{Coupled fixed point theorems for a generalized
Meir-Keeler contraction in partially ordered metric spaces}, Nonlinear Anal.
\textbf{72} (2010), 4508-4517], Bhaskar and Lakshmikantham [T.G. Bhaskar, V.
Lakshmikantham, \textit{Fixed point theorems in partially ordered metric spaces
and applications}, Nonlinear Anal. TMA \textbf{65} (2006) 1379-1393] and some
other very recent papers. An example to show that our generalizations are
effective is also presented.
