The purely affine Lagrangian for linear electrodynamics, that has the form of
the Maxwell Lagrangian in which the metric tensor is replaced by the
symmetrized Ricci tensor and the electromagnetic field tensor by the tensor of
homothetic curvature, is dynamically equivalent to the Einstein-Maxwell
equations in the metric-affine and metric formulation. We show that this
equivalence is related to the invariance of the Maxwell Lagrangian under
conformal transformations of the metric tensor. We also apply to a purely
affine Lagrangian the Legendre transformation with respect to the tensor of
homothetic curvature to show that the corresponding Legendre term and the new
Hamiltonian density are related to the Maxwell-Palatini Lagrangian for the
electromagnetic field. Therefore the purely affine picture, in addition to
generating the gravitational Lagrangian that is linear in the curvature,
justifies why the electromagnetic Lagrangian is quadratic in the
electromagnetic field.
