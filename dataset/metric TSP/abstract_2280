The Hessian's determinant for a version of massive gravity given by an
infinite expansion of a square root function of the induced metric, vanishes.
We show that it allows us to eliminate one of four scalar fields used to
generate the graviton mass. This, however, gives rise to the appearance of
extra terms in the action with the squared time derivative of the metric, thus
signaling that a nonlinear ghost survives.We demonstrate this phenomenon
considering a simple system with constraint, which is supposed to reduces the
number of physical degrees of freedom, however, we explicitly show how the
constraint forces the metric to propagate an extra tachyonic state.
