We study the propagation of neutrinos in gravitational fields using wave
functions that are exact to first order in the metric deviation. For
illustrative purposes, the geometrical background is represented by the
Lense-Thirring metric. We derive explicit expressions for neutrino deflection,
helicity transitions, flavor oscillations and oscillation Hamiltonian.
