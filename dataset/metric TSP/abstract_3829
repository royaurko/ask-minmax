We prove existence and uniqueness of foliations by stable spheres with
constant mean curvature for 3-manifolds which are asymptotic to Anti-de
Sitter-Schwarzschild metrics with positive mass. These metrics arise naturally
as spacelike timeslices for solutions of the Einstein equation with a negative
cosmological constant.
