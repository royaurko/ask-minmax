A physical metric is constructed as one that gives a coordinate independent
result for the time delay in infinite order in the perturbation expansion in
the gravitational constant. A compact form for the metric is obtained. One
result is that the metric functions are positive definite. Another is an exact
expression for the gravitational red shift. The metric can be used to calculate
general relativity predictions in higher order for any process. A relationship
between the spacetimes of the physical metric and the Schwarzschild metric is
discussed.
