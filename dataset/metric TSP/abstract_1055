The nonanalytic property of metric resulting from the presence of
gravitomagnetic monopoles is considered. The curvature tensors, dual curvature
tensors, dual Einstein tensor (and hence the gravitational field equation of
gravitomagnetic matter) expressed in terms of nonanalytic metric are analyzed.
It is shown that the spinor gravitomagnetic monopole may be one of the
potential origins of the cosmological constant. An alternative approach to the
cosmological constant problem is thus proposed based on the concept of
gravitomagnetic monopole.
