In this note, we obtain existence results for complete Ricci-flat Kahler
metrics on crepant resolutions of singularities of Calabi-Yau varieties.
Furthermore, for certain asymptotically flat Calabi-Yau varieties, we show that
the Ricci-flat metric on the resolved manifold has the same asymptotic behavior
as the initial variety.
