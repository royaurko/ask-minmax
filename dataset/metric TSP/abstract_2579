We construct metrics of positive Ricci curvature on some vector bundles over
tori (or more generally, over nilmanifolds). This gives rise to the first
examples of manifolds with positive Ricci curvature which are homotopy
equivalent but not homeomorphic to manifolds of nonnegative sectional
curvature.
