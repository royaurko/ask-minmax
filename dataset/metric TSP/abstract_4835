We consider the k-server problem under the advice model of computation when
the underlying metric space is sparse. On one side, we show that an advice of
size {\Omega}(n) is required to obtain a 1-competitive algorithm for sequences
of size n, even for the 2-server problem on a path metric of size N >= 5.
Through another lower bound argument, we show that at least (n/2)(log {\alpha}
- 1.22) bits of advice is required to obtain an optimal solution for metric
spaces of treewidth {\alpha}, where 4 <= {\alpha} < 2k. On the other side, we
introduce {\Theta}(1)-competitive algorithms for a wide range of sparse graphs,
which require advice of (almost) linear size. Namely, we show that for graphs
of size N and treewidth {\alpha}, there is an online algorithm which receives
$O(n (log {\alpha} + log log N))$ bits of advice and optimally serves a
sequence of length n. With a different argument, we show that if a graph admits
a system of {\mu} collective tree (q,r)-spanners, then there is a
(q+r)-competitive algorithm which receives O(n (log {\mu} + log log N)) bits of
advice. Among other results, this gives a 3-competitive algorithm for planar
graphs, provided with O(n log log N) bits of advice.
