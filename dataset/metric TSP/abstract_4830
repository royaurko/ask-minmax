The abelian Higgs model on a compact Riemann surface \Sigma supports vortex
solutions for any positive vortex number d \in \ZZ. Moreover, the vortex moduli
space for fixed d has long been known to be the symmetrized d-th power of
\Sigma, in symbols, \Sym^d(\Sigma). This moduli space is Kahler with respect to
the physically motivated metric whose geodesics describe slow vortex motion.
  In this paper we appeal to classical properties of \Sym^d(\Sigma) to obtain
new results for the moduli space metric. Our main tool is the Abel-Jacobi map,
which maps \Sym^d(\Sigma) into the Jacobian of \Sigma. Fibres of the
Abel-Jacobi map are complex projective spaces, and the first theorem we prove
states that near the Bradlow limit the moduli space metric restricted to these
fibres is a multiple of the Fubini-Study metric. Additional significance is
given to the fibres of the Abel-Jacobi map by our second result: we show that
if \Sigma is a hyperelliptic surface, there exist two special fibres which are
geodesic submanifolds of the moduli space. Even more is true: the Abel-Jacobi
map has a number of fibres which contain complex projective subspaces that are
geodesic.
