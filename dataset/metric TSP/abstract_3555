This paper will present the exact solution for the stress-energy tensor of a
spherical matter shell of finite thickness that will patch together different
metrics at the boundaries of the shell. The choice of vacuum field solutions
for the shell exterior and hollow interior that we make will allow us to
manipulate the inertial state of an object within the shell. The choice will
cause it to be in a state of acceleration with the shell relative to an
external observer for an indefinite time. The stress-energy tensor's solution
results in zero ship frame energy requirements, and only finite stress
requirements, and we show how any WEC violation can be avoided.
