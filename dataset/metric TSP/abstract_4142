Using a rigorous method of matched asymptotic expansions, I derive the
equation of motion of a small, compact body in an external vacuum spacetime
through second order in the body's mass (neglecting effects of internal
structure). The motion is found to be geodesic in a certain locally defined
regular geometry satisfying Einstein's equation at second order. I outline a
method of numerically obtaining both the metric of that regular geometry and
the complete second-order metric perturbation produced by the body.
