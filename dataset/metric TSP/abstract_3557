We present an analysis of a n-dimensional vacuum Einstein field equations in
which 4-dimensional space-time which is described by a Friedmann
Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and that of the extra dimensions by a Kasner type
Euclidean metric. The field equations are interpreted as four dimensional
Einstein equations with effective matter properties. We obtain solutions for
the cases when the effective matter is described by imperfect fluid. We
consider the theories of imperfect fluid given by Eckart, truncated
Israel-Stewart and full Israel-Stewart theories and obtain cosmological
solutions for a flat model of the universe.
