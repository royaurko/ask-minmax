The structure of polyhomogeneous space-times (i.e., space-times with metrics
which admit an expansion in terms of $r^{-j}\log^i r$) constructed by a
Bondi--Sachs type method is analysed. The occurrence of some log terms in an
asymptotic expansion of the metric is related to the non--vanishing of the Weyl
tensor at Scri. Various quantities of interest, including the Bondi mass loss
formula, the peeling--off of the Riemann tensor and the Newman--Penrose
constants of motion are re-examined in this context.
