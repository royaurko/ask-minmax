We show by an example that the (equivalence class of) singularity of a
plurisubharmonic function cannot be determined by the data of its Lelong
numbers, in a nontrivial sense. Such an example is provided by Siu-type
singular hermitian metrics associated to an effective line bundle. We also show
that a Siu-type metric has analytic singularities if and only if the section
ring of the line bundle is finitely generated.
