Smooth deformations of a Minkowski type metric in a four-dimensional
space-time manifold are considered. Deformations of the basic spin-tensorial
fields associated with this metric are calculated and their application to
calculating the energy-momentum tensor of a massive spin 1/2 particle is shown.
