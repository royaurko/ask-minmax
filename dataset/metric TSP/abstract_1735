In the present work we construct a lift of a metric $g$ on a 2-dimensional
oriented Riemannian manifold $M$ to a metric $\hat{g}$ on the total space $P$
of the orthonormal frame bundle of $M$. We call this lift the \textit {Wagner
lift}. Viktor Vladimirovich Wagner (1908 -1981) proposed a technique to extend
a metric defined on a non-holonomic distribution to its prolongation via the
Lie brackets. We apply the Wagner construction to the specific case when the
distribution is the infinitesimal connection in the orthonormal frame bundle
which corresponds to a Levi-Civita connection. We find relations between the
geometry of the Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and of the total space $(P,G)$ of
the orthonormal frame bundle endowed with the lifted metric.
