We identify the holomorphic de Rham complex of the minimal extension of a
meromorphic vector bundle with connexion on a compact Riemann surface X with
the L^2 complex relative to a suitable metric on the bundle and a complete
metric on the punctured Riemann surface. Applying results of C. Simpson, we
show the existence of a harmonic metric on this vector bundle, giving the same
L^2 complex. As a consequence, we obtain a Hard Lefschetz-type theorem.
