The presented paper is devoted to study the curvature and torsion of slant
Frenet curves in 3-dimensional normal almost paracontact metric manifolds.
Moreover, in this class of manifolds, properties of non- Frenet slant curves
(with null tangents or null normals) are obtained. The achieved results are
illustrated by examples.
