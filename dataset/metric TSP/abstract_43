We prove that there are 0/1 polytopes P that do not admit a compact LP
formulation. More precisely we show that for every n there is a sets X
\subseteq {0,1}^n such that conv(X) must have extension complexity at least
2^{n/2 * (1-o(1))}. In other words, every polyhedron Q that can be linearly
projected on conv(X) must have exponentially many facets.
  In fact, the same result also applies if conv(X) is restricted to be a
matroid polytope.
  Conditioning on NP not contained in P_{/poly}, our result rules out the
existence of any compact formulation for the TSP polytope, even if the
formulation may contain arbitrary real numbers.
