The note describes the cones in the Euclidean space admitting isotonic metric
projection with respect to the coordinate-wise ordering. As a consequence it is
showed that the metric projection onto the regression cone (the cone defined by
the general isotonic regression problem) admits a projection which is isotonic
with respect to the coordinate-wise ordering.
