We prove that the space of smooth Riemannian metrics on the three-ball with
non-negative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary is path connected. As
an application, using results of Maximo, Nunes, and Smith [MNS13], we show the
existence of properly embedded free boundary minimal annulus on any three-ball
with non-negative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary.
