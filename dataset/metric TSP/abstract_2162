In a metric space, such as the real numbers with their standard metric, a set
A is open if and only if no sequence with terms outside of A has a limit inside
A. Moreover, a metric space is compact if and only if every sequence has a
converging subsequence. However, in a general topological space these
equivalences may fail. Unfortunately this fact is sometimes overlooked in
introductory courses on general topology, leaving many students with
misconceptions, e.g. that compactness would always be equal to sequence
compactness. The aim of this article is to show how sequences might fail to
characterize topological properties such as openness, continuity and
compactness correctly. Moreover, I will define nets and show how they succeed
where sequences fail.
