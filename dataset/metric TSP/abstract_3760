By using asymptotic Morse inequalities we give a lower bound for the space of
holomorphic sections of high tensor powers in a positive line bundle over a
q-concave domain. The curvature of the positive bundle induces a hermitian
metric on the manifold. The bound is given explicitely in terms of the volume
of the domain in this metric and a certain integral on the boundary involving
the defining function and its Levi form. As application we study the
perturbattion of the complex structure of a q-concave manifold.
