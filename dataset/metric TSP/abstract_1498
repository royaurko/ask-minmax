We introduce a class of hermitian metrics with {\em Lee potential}, that
generalize the notion of l.c.K. metrics with potential introduced in \cite{ov}
and show that in the classical examples of Calabi and Eckmann of complex
structures on $S^{2p+1}\x S^{2q+1}$, the corresponding hermitian metrics are of
this type. These examples satisfy, actually, a stronger differential condition,
that we call {\em generalized Calabi-Eckmann}, condition that is satisfied also
by the {\em Vaisman} metrics (previously also refered to as {\em generalized
Hopf manifolds}). This condition means that, in addition to being with Lee
potential, the torsion of the {\em characteristic} (or Bismut) connection is
parallel. We give a local geometric characterization of these generalized
Calabi-Eckmann metrics, and, in the case of a compact threefold, we give
detailed informations about their global structure. More precisely, the cases
which can not be reduced to Vaisman structures can be obtained by deformation
of locally homogenous hermitian manifolds that can be described explicitly.
