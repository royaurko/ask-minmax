The intrinsic metric symmetries for energy-momentum in warped space-time
universally reinforce strict spatial flatness in the GR metric formalism. The
passive/active energy-charge for the 1686, 1913, and 1915 gravitational laws
maintains the universal free fall in non-empty material space of nonlocal
elementary (radial) energies. The known planetary perihelion precession, radar
echo delay, and gravitational light bending can be explained by the
singularity-free metric solution without departure from Euclidean spatial
geometry. Non-Newtonian flatspace precessions are expected for non-point
orbiting gyroscopes exclusively due to the GR inhomogeneous time in the Earth's
radial energy-charge. The self-contained SR-GR relativity of {\it gesamt}
particle-field carriers of inertial energy relies on the Principle of
Equivalence for geometrization of the r^{-4} continuous particle without
references to Newton's mass-to-mass attraction. The post-Newtonian logarithmic
potential for distributed particle densities is also the exact solution to
Maxwell's equations with the analytical r^{-4} electric charge density instead
of the delta-operator density.
