We compute the axial anomaly for the Taub-NUT metric on $R^4$. We show that
the axial anomaly for the generalized Taub-NUT metrics introduced by Iwai and
Katayama is finite, although the Dirac operator is not Fredholm. We show that
the essential spectrum of the Dirac operator is the whole real line.
