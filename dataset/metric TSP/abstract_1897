A four-dimensional differentiable manifold is given with an arbitrary linear
connection $\Gamma_\alpha^\beta=\Gamma_{i\alpha}^\beta dx^i$. Megged has
claimed that he can define a metric $G_{\alpha\beta}$ by means of a certain
integral equation such that the connection is compatible with the metric. We
point out that Megged's implicite definition of his metric $G_{\alpha\beta}$ is
equivalent to the assumption of a vanishing nonmetricity. Thus his result turns
out to be trivial.
