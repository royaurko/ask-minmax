It is found the most general local form of the 11-dimensional supergravity
backgrounds which, by reduction along one isometry, give rise to IIA
supergravity solutions with a RR field and a non trivial dilaton, and for which
the condition $F^{(1,1)}=0$ holds. This condition is stronger than the usual
condition $F^{ab}J_{ab}=0$, required by supersymmetry. It is shown that these
D6 wrapped backgrounds arise from the direct sum of the flat Minkowski metric
with certain G2 holonomy metrics admitting an U(1) action, with a local form
found by Apostolov and Salamon. Indeed, the strong supersymmetry condition is
equivalent to the statement that there is a new isometry on the G2 manifold,
which commutes with the old one; therefore these metrics are inherently toric.
An example that is asymptotically Calabi-Yau is presented. There are found
another G2 metrics which give rise to half-flat SU(3) structures. All this
examples possess an U(1)x U(1)x U(1) isometry subgroup. Supergravity solutions
without fluxes corresponding to these G2 metrics are constructed. The presence
of a $T^3$ subgroup of isometries permits to apply the \gamma-deformation
technique in order to generate new supergravity solutions with fluxes.
