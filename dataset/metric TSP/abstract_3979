We calculate the expectation value of one circular Wilson loop and the
correlator of two concentric circular Wilson loops in AdS/QCD using the
modified AdS_5-metric given in Ref.[1]. The confinement properties of this
metric in AdS/QCD are analyzed and compared with QCD and Nambu-Goto theory in
four dimensions.
