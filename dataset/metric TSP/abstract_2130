In this note, we show that small complex perturbations of positive matrices
are contractions, with respect to a complex version of the Hilbert metric, on
the standard complex simplex. We show that this metric can be used to obtain
estimates of the domain of analyticity of entropy rate for a hidden Markov
process when the underlying Markov chain has strictly positive transition
probabilities.
