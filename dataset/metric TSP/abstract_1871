In this article we perform a fourth order perturbation analysis of the
gravitational metric theory of gravity \( f(\chi) = \chi^{3/2} \) developed by
\citet{bernal11a} and \citet{mendoza13}. We show that the theory accounts in
detail for the mass from the observations of 12 {\textit{Chandra}} X-ray
clusters of galaxies, without the need of dark matter. The dynamical
observations can be synthesised in terms of the metric coefficients of the
metric theory of gravity to the fourth order of approximation \(O(4)\), in
perturbations of $v/c$. In this sense, we calculate the first relativistic
correction of the theory, which is relevant at the outer regions of clusters of
galaxies, in order to reproduce the observations. Also, we extended the
computational MEXICAS (Metric EXtended-gravity Incorporated through a Computer
Algebraic System) code, publicly available, developed for its usage in the
Computer Algebraic System (CAS) Maxima for working out perturbations on any
metric theory of gravity.
