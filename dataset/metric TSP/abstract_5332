Although General Relativity (GR) has been tested extensively in the weak
gravity regime, similar tests in the strong gravity regime are still missing.
In this paper we explore the possibility to use X-ray spectropolarimetric
observations of black holes in X-ray binaries to distinguish between the Kerr
metric and the phenomenological metrics introduced by Johannsen and Psaltis
(2011) (which are not vacuum solutions of Einstein's equation) and thus to test
the no-hair theorem of GR. To this end, we have developed a numerical code that
calculates the radial brightness profiles of accretion disks and parallel
transports the wave vector and polarization vector of photons through the Kerr
and non-GR spacetimes. We used the code to predict the observational appearance
of GR and non-GR accreting black hole systems. We find that the predicted
energy spectra and energy dependent polarization degree and polarization
direction do depend strongly on the underlying spacetime. However, for large
regions of the parameter space, the GR and non-GR metrics lead to very similar
observational signatures, making it difficult to observationally distinguish
between the two types of models.
