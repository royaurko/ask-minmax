We extend the ideas of using AdS/CFT to calculate energy loss of extended
defects in strongly coupled systems to general holographic metrics. We find the
equations of motion governing uniformly moving defects of various dimension and
determine the corresponding energy loss rates in terms of the metric
coefficients. We apply our formulae to the specific examples of both bulk
geometries created by general Dp-branes, as well as to holographic superfluids.
For the Dp-branes, we find that the energy loss of our defect, in addition to
the expected quadratic dependence on velocity, depends on velocity only via an
effective blueshifted temperature - despite the existence of a microscopic
length scale in the theory. We also find, for a certain value of p and
dimension of the defect, that the energy loss has no dependence on temperature
or velocity other than the aforementioned quadratic dependence on velocity. For
the superfluid example, we find agreement with previous results on the
existence of a cutoff velocity, below which the probe experiences no drag
force. For both examples we can easily extend the equations of motion and
energy loss to defects of larger dimension.
