We reveal the non-metric geometry underlying omega-->0 Brans-Dicke theory by
unifying the metric and scalar field into a single geometric structure. Taking
this structure seriously as the geometry to which matter universally couples,
we show that the theory is fully consistent with solar system tests. This is in
striking constrast with the standard metric coupling, which grossly violates
post-Newtonian experimental constraints.
