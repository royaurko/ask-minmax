We adapt the notions of stability of holomorphic vector bundles in the sense
of Mumford-Takemoto and Hermitian-Einstein metrics in holomorphic vector
bundles for canonically polarized framed manifolds, i.e. compact complex
manifolds X together with a smooth divisor D such that K_X \otimes [D] is
ample. It turns out that the degree of a torsion-free coherent sheaf on X with
respect to the polarization K_X \otimes [D] coincides with the degree with
respect to the complete K\"ahler-Einstein metric g_{X \setminus D} on X
\setminus D. For stable holomorphic vector bundles, we prove the existence of a
Hermitian-Einstein metric with respect to g_{X \setminus D} and also the
uniqueness in an adapted sense.
