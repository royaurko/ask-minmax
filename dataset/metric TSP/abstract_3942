Maps between Riemannian manifolds which are submersions on a dense subset,
are studied by means of the eigenvalues of the pull-back of the target metrics,
the first fundamental form. Expressions for the derivatives of these
eigenvalues yield characterizations of harmonicity, totally geodesic maps and
biconformal changes of metric preserving harmonicity. A Schwarz lemma for
pseudo harmonic morphisms is proved, using the dilatation of the eigenvalues
and, in dimension five, a Bochner technique method, involving the Laplacian of
the difference of the eigenvalues, gives conditions forcing pseudo harmonic
morphisms to be harmonic morphisms.
