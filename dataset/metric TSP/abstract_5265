Applying the Hamilton--Jacobi method we investigate the tunneling of photon
across the event horizon of a static spherically symmetric black hole. The
necessity of the gauge condition on the photon field, to derive the
semiclassical Hawking temperature, is explicitly shown. Also, the tunneling of
photon and gravitino beyond this semiclassical approximation are presented
separately. Quantum corrections of the action for both cases are found to be
proportional to the semiclassical contribution. Modifications to the Hawking
temperature and Bekenstein-Hawking area law are thereby obtained. Using this
corrected temperature and Hawking's periodicity argument, the modified metric
for the Schwarzschild black hole is given. This corrected version of the
metric, upto $\hbar$ order is equivalent to the metric obtained by including
one loop back reaction effect. Finally, the coefficient of the leading order
correction of entropy is shown to be related to the trace anomaly.
