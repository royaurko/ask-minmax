We study distributions of persistent homology barcodes associated to taking
subsamples of a fixed size from metric measure spaces. We show that such
distributions provide robust invariants of metric measure spaces, and
illustrate their use in hypothesis testing and providing confidence intervals
for topological data analysis.
