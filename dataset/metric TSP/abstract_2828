By a Cantor group we mean a topological group homeomorphic to the Cantor set.
We show that a compact metric space of rational cohomological dimension $n$ can
be obtained as the orbit space of a Cantor group action on a metric compact
space of covering dimension $n$. Moreover, the action can be assumed to be free
if $n=1$.
