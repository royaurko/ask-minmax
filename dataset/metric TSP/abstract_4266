In this paper asymptotic equalities are found for the least upper bounds of
deviations in the uniform metric of de la Vallee Poussin sums on classes of
2\pi-periodic (\psi,\beta)-differentiable functions admitting an analytic
continuation into the given strip of the complex plane. As a consequence,
asymptotic equalities are obtained on classes of convolutions of periodic
functions generated by the Neumann kernel and the polyharmonic Poisson kernel.
