Consider a compact manifold with boundary $M$ with a scattering metric $g$
or, equivalently, an asymptotically conic manifold $(M^\circ, g)$. (Euclidean
$\mathbb{R}^n$, with a compactly supported metric perturbation, is an example
of such a space.) Let $\Delta$ be the positive Laplacian on $(M,g)$, and $V$ a
smooth potential on $M$ which decays to second order at infinity. In this paper
we construct the kernel of the operator $(h^2 \Delta + V - (\lambda_0 \pm
i0)^2)^{-1}$, at a nontrapping energy $\lambda_0 > 0$, uniformly for $h \in (0,
h_0)$, $h_0 > 0$ small, within a class of Legendre distributions on manifolds
with codimension three corners. Using this we construct the kernel of the
propagator, $e^{-it(\Delta/2 + V)}$, $t \in (0, t_0)$ as a quadratic Legendre
distribution. We also determine the global semiclassical structure of the
spectral projector, Poisson operator and scattering matrix.
