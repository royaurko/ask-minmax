For a k-flat F inside a locally compact CAT(0)-space X, we identify various
conditions that ensure that F bounds a (k+1)-dimensional half flat in X. Our
conditions are formulated in terms of the ultralimit of X. As applications, we
obtain (1) constraints on the behavior of quasi-isometries between tocally
compact CAT(0)-spaces, (2) constraints on the possible non-positively curved
Riemannian metrics supported by certain manifolds, and (3) a correspondence
between metric splittings of a complete, simply connected, non-positively
curved Riemannian manifold and the metric splittings of its asymptotic cones.
Furthermore, combining our results with the Ballmann, Burns-Spatzier rigidity
theorem and the classical Mostow rigidity theorem, we also obtain (4) a new
proof of Gromov's rigidity theorem for higher rank locally symmetric spaces.
