Software design is one of the most important and key activities in the system
development life cycle (SDLC) phase that ensures the quality of software.
Different key areas of design are very vital to be taken into consideration
while designing software. Software design describes how the software system is
decomposed and managed in smaller components. Object-oriented (OO) paradigm has
facilitated software industry with more reliable and manageable software and
its design. The quality of the software design can be measured through
different metrics such as Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) design metrics, Mood
Metrics & Lorenz and Kidd metrics. CK metrics is one of the oldest and most
reliable metrics among all metrics available to software industry to evaluate
OO design. This paper presents an evaluation of CK metrics to propose an
improved CK design metrics values to reduce the defects during software design
phase in software. This paper will also describe that whether a significant
effect of any CK design metrics exists on total number of defects per module or
not. This is achieved by conducting survey in two software development
companies.
