Consider a complex line bundle over a compact complex manifold equipped with
an infinitely differentiable metric with strictly positive curvature form.
Assign to positive tensor powers of this bundle the associated product metrics
and Bergman projection operators. Zelditch has conjectured that if the Bergman
kernels, away from the diagonal, decay exponentially fast to zero as the power
tends to infinity, then the metric must be real analytic. Moreover, this is
conjectured even if exponential decay is assumed to hold merely for some
arbitrarily sparse subsequence of powers tending to infinity.
  Previously the contributor has constructed examples in which the metric is
infinitely differentiable, but exponential decay does not hold. These examples
are within a framework in which a certain degree of symmetry is present. In the
present paper we prove the conjecture for all structures within this framework,
thus providing evidence in favor of the conjecture. The analysis is carried out
for base manifolds of arbitrary dimensions, rather than only for dimension one
as in the contributor's previous work.
