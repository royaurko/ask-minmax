We construct a closed-form, fully analytical 4-metric that approximately
represents the spacetime evolution of non-precessing, spinning black hole
binaries from infinite separations up to a few orbits prior to merger. We
employ the technique of asymptotic matching to join a perturbed Kerr metric in
the neighborhood of each spinning black hole to a near-zone, post-Newtonian
metric farther out. The latter is already naturally matched to a far-zone,
post-Minkowskian metric that accounts for full temporal retardation. The result
is a 4-metric that is approximately valid everywhere in space and in a small
bundle of spatial hypersurfaces. We here restrict our attention to quasi-
circular orbits, but the method is valid for any orbital motion or physical
scenario, provided an overlapping region of validity or buffer zone exists. A
simple extension of such a metric will allow for future studies of the
accretion disk and jet dynamics around spinning back hole binaries.
