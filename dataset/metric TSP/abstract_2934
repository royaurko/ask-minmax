We derive a generic identity which holds for the metric (i.e. variational)
energy-momentum tensor under any field transformation in any generally
covariant classical Lagrangian field theory. The identity determines the
conditions under which a symmetry of the Lagrangian is also a symmetry of the
energy-momentum tensor. It turns out that the stress tensor acquires the
symmetry if the Lagrangian has the symmetry in a generic curved spacetime. In
this sense a field theory in flat spacetime is not self-contained. When the
identity is applied to the gauge invariant spin-two field in Minkowski space,
we obtain an alternative and direct derivation of a known no-go theorem: a
linear gauge invariant spin-2 field, which is dynamically equivalent to
linearized General Relativity, cannot have a gauge invariant metric
energy-momentum tensor. This implies that attempts to define the notion of
gravitational energy density in terms of the metric energy--momentum tensor in
a field-theoretical formulation of gravity must fail.
