In this paper we aim to present two general results regarding, on one hand,
the openness stability of set-valued maps and, on the other hand, the metric
regularity behavior of the implicit multifunction related to a generalized
variational system. Then, these results are applied in order to obtain, in a
natural way, and in a widely studied case, several relations between the metric
regularity moduli of the ?eld maps de?ning the variational system and the
solution map. Our approach allows us to complete and extend several very recent
results in literature.
