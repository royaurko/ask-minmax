We show that the metric for the singularity free family of fluid models [3]
can be obtained by a simple and natural inhomogenisation and anisotropisation
procedure from Friedman--Robertson--Walker metric with negative curvature. The
metric is unique for cylindrically symmetric spacetime with metric potentials
being separable functions of radial and time coordinates. It turns out that
fluid models separate out into two classes, with $\rho \not= \mu p$ in general
but $\rho = 3p$ in particular and $\rho = p$. It is shown that in both the
cases radial heat flow can be incorporated without disturbing the singularity
free character of the spacetime. Further by introducing massless scalar field
it is possible to open out a narrow window for $\mu, 4 \geq \mu \geq 3$.
