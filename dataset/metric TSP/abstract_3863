We bound the value of the Casson invariant of any integral homology 3-sphere
$M$ by a constant times the distance-squared to the identity, measured in any
word metric on the Torelli group $\T$, of the element of $\T$ associated to any
Heegaard splitting of $M$. We construct examples which show this bound is
asymptotically sharp.
