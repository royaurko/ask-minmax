We study Graev ultra-metrics which were introduced by Gao. We show that the
free non-archimedean balanced topological group defined over an ultra-metric
space is metrizable by a Graev ultra-metric. We prove that the Graev
ultra-metric has a maximal property. Using this property, among others, we show
that the Graev ultra-metric associated with an ultra-metric space $(X,d)$ with
diameter$\leq 1$ coincides with the ultra-metric $\hat{d}$ of Savchenko and
Zarichnyi.
