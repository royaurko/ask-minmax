We construct explicit left invariant quaternionic contact structures on Lie
groups with zero and non-zero torsion, and with non-vanishing quaternionic
contact conformal curvature tensor, thus showing the existence of quaternionic
contact manifolds not locally quaternionic contact conformal to the
quaternionic sphere. We present a left invariant quaternionic contact structure
on a seven dimensional non-nilpotent Lie group, and show that this structure is
locally quaternionic contact conformal to the flat quaternionic contact
structure on the quaternionic Heisenberg group. On the product of a seven
dimensional Lie group, equipped with a quaternionic contact structure, with the
real line we determine explicit complete quaternionic Kaehhler metrics and
$Spin(7)$-holonomy metrics which seem to be new. We give explicit complete
non-compact eight dimensional almost quaternion hermitian manifolds with closed
fundamental four form which are not quaternionic K\"ahler.
