By using our recent generalization of the colliding waves concept to
metric-affine gravity theories, and also our generalization of the advanced and
retarded time coordinate representation in terms of Jacobi functions, we find a
general class of colliding wave solutions with fourth degree polynomials in
metric-affine gravity. We show that our general approach contains the standard
second degree polynomials colliding wave solutions as a particular case.
