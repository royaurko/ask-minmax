A new prescription, in the framework of condensate models for space-times,
for physical stationary gravitational fields is presented. We show that the
spinning cosmic string metric describes the gravitational field associated with
the single vortex in a superfluid condensate model for space-time outside the
vortex core. This metric differs significantly from the usual acoustic metric
for the Onsager-Feynman vortex. We also consider the question of what happens
when many vortices are present, and show that on large scales a G\"odel-like
metric emerges. In both the single and multiple vortex cases the failure of
general relativity exemplified by the presence of closed time-like curves is
attributed to the breakdown of superfluid rigidity.
