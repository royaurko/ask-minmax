We introduce the notion of a special monopole class on a four-manifold. This
is used to prove restrictions on the smooth structures of Einstein manifolds.
As an application we prove that there are Einstein four-manifolds which are
simply connected, spin, and satisfy the strict Hitchin--Thorpe inequality, and
which are homeomorphic to manifolds without Einstein metrics.
  In the Appendix, written with J. Wehrheim, we use special monopole classes to
discuss the classification of Ricci-flat four-manifolds.
