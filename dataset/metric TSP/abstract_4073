We have investigated the magnetoelectric coupling in the lone pair containing
piezoelectric ferrimagnet Cu2OSeO3. Significant magnetocapacitance develops in
the magnetically ordered state (TC = 60 K). We find critical behavior near TC
and a divergence near the metamagnetic transition at 500 Oe. High-resolution
X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements show that Cu2OSeO3 is
metrically cubic down to 10 K but that the ferrimagnetic ordering reduces the
symmetry to rhombohedral R3. The metric cubic lattice dimensions exclude a
magnetoelectric coupling mechanism involving spontaneous lattice strain, and
this is unique among magnetoelectric and multiferroic materials.
