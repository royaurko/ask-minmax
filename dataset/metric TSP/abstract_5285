In this paper we prove the non-linear asymptotic stability of the
five-dimensional Schwarzschild metric under biaxial vacuum perturbations. This
is the statement that the evolution of (SU(2) x U(1))-symmetric vacuum
perturbations of initial data for the five-dimensional Schwarzschild metric
finally converges in a suitable sense to a member of the Schwarzschild family.
It constitutes the first result proving the existence of non-stationary vacuum
black holes arising from asymptotically flat initial data dynamically
approaching a stationary solution. In fact, we show quantitative rates of
approach. The proof relies on vectorfield multiplier estimates, which are used
in conjunction with a bootstrap argument to establish polynomial decay rates
for the radiation on the perturbed spacetime. Despite being applied here in a
five-dimensional context, the techniques are quite robust and may admit
applications to various four-dimensional stability problems.
