We discuss photon and test-particle orbits in the Kehagias-Sfetsos (KS)
metric. For any value of the Ho\v{r}ava parameter $\omega$, there are values of
the gravitational mass $M$ for which the metric describes a naked singularity,
and this is always accompanied by a vacuum "antigravity sphere" on whose
surface a test particle can remain at rest (in a zero angular momentum
geodesic), and inside which no circular geodesics exist. The observational
appearance of an accreting KS naked singularity in a binary system would be
that of a quasi-static spherical fluid shell surrounded by an accretion disk,
whose properties depend on the value of $M$, but are always very different from
accretion disks familiar from the Kerr-metric solutions. The properties of the
corresponding circular orbits are qualitatively similar to those of the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om naked singularities. When event horizons are present, the
orbits outside the Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole are qualitatively similar to
those of the Schwarzschild metric.
