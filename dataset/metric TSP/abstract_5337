Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a generalisation of Linear Temporal Logic in
which the Until and Since modalities are annotated with intervals that express
metric constraints. A seminal result of Hirshfeld and Rabinovich shows that
over the reals, first-order logic with binary order relation < and unary
function +1 is strictly more expressive than MTL with integer constants. Indeed
they prove that no temporal logic whose modalities are definable by formulas of
bounded quantifier depth can be expressively complete for FO(<,+1). In this
paper we show the surprising result that if we allow unary functions +q, (q
rational), in first-order logic and correspondingly allow rational constants in
MTL, then the two logics have the same expressive power. This gives the first
generalisation of Kamp's theorem on the expressive completeness of LTL for
FO(<) to the quantitative setting. The proof of this result involves a
generalisation of Gabbay's notion of separation.
