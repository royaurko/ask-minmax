The "dancing metric" is a pseudo-riemannian metric $g$ of signature $(2,2)$
on the space $M^4$ of non-incident point-line pairs in the real projective
plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$. The null-curves of $(M^4, g)$ are given by the "dancing
condition": the point is moving towards a point on the line, about which the
line is turning. We establish a dictionary between classical projective
geometry (incidence, projective duality, differential invariants of plane
curves...) and pseudo-riemannian 4-dimensional conformal geometry (null-curves,
self-dual 2-planes, parallel transport, Weyl curvature...). There is also an
unexpected bonus: by applying a twistor construction to $(M^4,g)$, a
$G_2$-symmetry emerges, hidden deep in classical projective geometry. To
uncover this symmetry, one needs to refine the "dancing condition" to a
higher-order condition, expressed in terms of the osculating conic along a
plane curve and its Cartan's development. The outcome is a correspondence
between curves in the projective plane and its dual, a projective geometry
analog of the familiar "rolling without slipping and twisting" of a pair of
riemannian surfaces.
