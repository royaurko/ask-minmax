The first aim of this study is to define soft sequential compact metric
spaces and to investigate some important theorems on soft sequential compact
metric space. Second is to introduce net and totally bounded soft metric space
and study properties of this space. Third is to define Lebesque number and soft
uniformly continuous mapping and investigate some theorems in detail.
