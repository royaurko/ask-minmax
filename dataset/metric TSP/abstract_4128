Using the model theory of metric structures, I give an alternative proof of
the following result by Thomas: If the Continuum Hypothesis fails then there
are power of the continuum many universal sofic groups up to isomorphism. This
method is also applicable to universal hyperlinear groups, giving a positive
answer to a question posed by Thomas.
