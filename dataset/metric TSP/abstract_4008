We compute the gravitational Chern-Simons term explicitly for an adiabatic
family of metrics using standard methods in general relativity. We use the fact
that our base three-manifold is a quasi-regular K-contact manifold heavily in
this computation. Our key observation is that this geometric assumption
corresponds exactly to a Kaluza-Klein Ansatz for the metric tensor on our three
manifold, which allows us to translate our problem into the language of general
relativity. Similar computations have been performed in a paper of Guralnik,
Iorio, Jackiw and Pi (2003), although not in the adiabatic context.
