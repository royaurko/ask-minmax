We consider the problem of determining which conditions are necessary for
cobordisms to admit Lorentzian metrics with certain properties. In particular,
we prove a result originally due to Tipler without a smoothness hypothesis
necessary in the original proof. In doing this, we prove that compact horizons
in a smooth spacetime satisfying the null energy condition are smooth. We also
prove that the "generic condition" is indeed generic in the set of Lorentzian
metrics on a given manifold.
