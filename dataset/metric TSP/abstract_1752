We present a systematic study of causality theory on Lorentzian manifolds
with continuous metrics. Examples are given which show that some standard facts
in smooth Lorentzian geometry, such as light-cones being hypersurfaces, are
wrong when metrics which are merely continuous are considered. We show that
existence of time functions remains true on domains of dependence with
continuous metrics, and that $C^{0,1}$ differentiability of the metric suffices
for many key results of the smooth causality theory.
