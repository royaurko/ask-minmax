We present an exact stationary {\it axially symmetric} vacuum solution of
metric-affine gravity (MAG) which generalises the recently reported spherically
symmetric solution. Besides the metric, it carries nonmetricity and torsion as
post-Riemannian geometrical structures. The parameters of the solution are
interpreted as mass and angular momentum and as dilation, shear and spin
charges.
