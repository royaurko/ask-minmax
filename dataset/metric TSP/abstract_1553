This paper focuses on the study of open curves in a manifold M , and its aim
is to define a reparameterization invariant distance on the space of such
paths. We use the square root velocity function (SRVF) introduced by Srivastava
et al. in [11] to define a reparameterization invariant metric on the space of
immersions M = Imm([0, 1], M) by pullback of a metric on the tangent bundle TM
derived from the Sasaki metric. We observe that such a natural choice of
Riemannian metric on TM induces a first-order Sobolev metric on M with an extra
term involving the origins, and leads to a distance which takes into account
the distance between the origins and the distance between the image curves by
the SRVF parallel transported to a same vector space, with an added curvature
term. This provides a generalized theoretical SRV framework for curves lying in
a general manifold M .
