We introduce the notion of weakly locally Lipschitz contractibility for
metric spaces. Many fundamental objects in metric geometry, for instance,
normed spaces, CAT-spaces and Alexandrov spaces satisfy this condition. We
consider the category of all pairs of weakly locally Lipschitz contractible
spaces as objects together with all locally Lipschitz maps as morphisms. A main
purpose of the present paper is to prove that the singular Lipschitz (and usual
singular) homology is naturally isomorphic to the homology of integral currents
with compact support on this category.
