A group action on a metric space is called growth tight if the exponential
growth rate of the group with respect to the induced pseudo-metric is strictly
greater than that of its quotients. A prototypical example is the action of a
free group on its Cayley graph with respect to a free generating set. More
generally, with Arzhantseva we have shown that group actions with strongly
contracting elements are growth tight.
  Examples of non-growth tight actions are product groups acting on the $L^1$
products of Cayley graphs of the factors.
  In this paper we consider actions of product groups on product spaces, where
each factor group acts with a strongly contracting element on its respective
factor space. We show that this action is growth tight with respect to the
$L^p$ metric on the product space, for all $1<p\leq \infty$. In particular, the
$L^\infty$ metric on a product of Cayley graphs corresponds to a word metric on
the product group. This gives the first examples of groups that are growth
tight with respect to an action on one of their Cayley graphs and non-growth
tight with respect to an action on another, answering a question of Grigorchuk
and de la Harpe.
