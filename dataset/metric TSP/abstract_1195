In this paper we build a mapping between two different metrics and embed them
in a flat manifold. One of the metrics represents the ordinary matter, and the
other describes the dark matter, the dark energy, and the particle-antiparticle
asymmetry. The latter was obtained in a recent paper. For the mapping and
embedding, we use two new formalisms developed and presented in two previous
papers, Mapping Among Manifolds and, Conformal Form of Pseudo-Riemannian
Metrics by Normal Coordinate Transformations, which was a generalization of the
Cartan's approach of Riemannian normal coordinates.
