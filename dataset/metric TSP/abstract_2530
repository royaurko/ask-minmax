Let (M, g) be an (n+1) dimensional space-time, with bounded curvature with
respect to a bounded framing. If (M, g) is vacuum or satisfies a mild condition
on the stress-energy tensor, then we show that (M, g) locally admits coordinate
systems in which the Lorentz metric is well-controlled in the (space-time)
Sobolev space L^{2,p}, for any finite p.
