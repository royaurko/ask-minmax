Let f : X --> Y be a holomorphic map of complex manifolds, which is proper,
Kahler, and surjective with connected fibers, and which is smooth over Y-Z the
complement of an analytic subset Z. Let E be a Nakano semi-positive vector
bundle on X, and consider direct image sheaves F = R^qf_*(K_{X/Y} \otimes E)
for q \geq 0. In our previous paper, we discussed the Nakano semi-positivity of
F with respect to the so-called Hodge metric, when the map f is smooth. In this
paper, we discuss the extension of the induced metric on the tautological line
bundle O(1) on the projective space bundle P(F) ``over Y-Z'' as a singular
Hermitian metric with semi-positive curvature ``over Y''. As a particular
consequence, if Y is projective, R^qf_*(K_{X/Y} \otimes E) is weakly positive
over Y-Z in the sense of Viehweg.
