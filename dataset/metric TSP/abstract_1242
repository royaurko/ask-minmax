The purpose of this paper is to establish an injectivity theorem with
multiplier ideal sheaves of singular metrics. This result is a generalization
of various injectivity and vanishing theorems. To treat transcendental
singularities, after regularizing a given singular metric, we study the
asymptotic behavior of the harmonic forms with respect to a family of the
regularized metrics. Moreover we give a method to obtain $L^2$-estimates of
solutions of the $\overline{\partial}$-equation, by using the
$\rm{\check{C}}$ech complex. As an application, we obtain a Nadel type
vanishing theorem.
