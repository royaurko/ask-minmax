The class of poset metrics is very large and contains some interesting
families of metrics. A family of metrics, based on posets which are formed from
disjoint chains which have the same size, is examined. A necessary and
sufficient condition, for the existence of perfect single-error-correcting
codes for such poset metrics, is proved.
