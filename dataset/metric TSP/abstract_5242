We consider the case of a deformable material interface between two
immiscible moving media, both of them being magnetiable. The time dependence of
the metric at the interface introduces a non linear term, proportional to the
mean curvature, in the surface dynamical equations of mass momentum and angular
momentum. We take into account the effects of that term also in the singular
magnetic and electric fields inside the interface which lead to the existence
of currents and charges densities through the interface, from the derivation of
the Maxwell equations inside both bulks and the interface. Also, we give the
expression for the entropy production and of the different thermo-dynamical
fluxes. Our results enlarge previous results from other theories where the
specific role of the time dependent surface metric was insufficiently stressed.
