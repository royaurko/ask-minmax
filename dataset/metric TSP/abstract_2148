We study the Hausdorff measures of limit sets of weakly controlled Moran
constructions in metric spaces. The separation of the construction pieces is
closely related to the Hausdorff measure of the corresponding limit set. In
particular, we investigate different separation conditions for semiconformal
iterated function systems. Our work generalizes well known results on
self-similar sets in metric spaces as well as results on controlled Moran
constructions in Euclidean spaces.
