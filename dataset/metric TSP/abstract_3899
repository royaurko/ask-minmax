A generalized connection, including Christoffel coefficients, torsion,
non-metricity tensor and metric-asymmetricity object, is analyzed according to
the Schouten classification. The inverse structure matrix is found in the
linearized regime, autoparallel trajectories are defined and the contribution
of the components of the connection are clarified at first-order approximation.
