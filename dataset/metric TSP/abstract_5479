We consider a random walk on a random graph $(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of
open sites under i.i.d. Bernoulli site percolation on the multi-dimensional
integer set $\mathbf{Z}^d$, and the transition probabilities of the walk are
generated by i.i.d. random conductances (positive numbers) assigned to the
edges in $E$. This random walk in random environments has long range jumps and
is reversible. We prove the quenched invariance principle for this walk when
the random conductances are unbounded from above but uniformly bounded from
zero by taking the corrector approach. To this end, we prove a metric
comparison between the graph metric and the Euclidean metric on the graph $(V,
E)$, an estimation of a first-passage percolation and an almost surely weighted
Poincar{\'{e}} inequality on $(V,E)$, which are used to prove the quenched heat
kernel estimations for the random walk.
