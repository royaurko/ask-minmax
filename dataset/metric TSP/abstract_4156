A new variational approach for general relativity and modified theories of
gravity is presented. In addition to the metric tensor, two independent affine
connections enter the action as dynamical variables. In the matter action the
dependence upon one of the connections is left completely unspecified. When the
variation is applied to the Einstein-Hilbert action the Einstein field
equations are recovered. However when applied to $f(R)$ and Scalar-Tensor
theories, it yields gravitational field equations which differ from their
equivalents obtained with a metric or Palatini variation and reduce to the
former ones only when no connections appear in the matter action.
