We provide a metric-like formulation of the spin-3 gravity in three
dimensions. It is shown that the Chern-Simons formulation of the spin-3 gravity
can be reformulated as a Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory coupled with the
higher-spin matter fields. A duality-like transformation is also identified
from this metric-like formulation.
