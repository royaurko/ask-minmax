We present a consistent truncation of IIB supergravity on manifolds admitting
a Sasaki-Einstein structure, which keeps the metric and five real scalar
fields. This theory can be further truncated to a constrained one-parameter
family that depends on only the metric and one scalar, as well as to a theory
with a metric and three scalars. The reduced theory admits supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric AdS_5 and AdS_4 x R solutions. We analyze the spectrum
around the AdS critical points and identify the dual operators.
