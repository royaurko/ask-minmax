Perturbation theory of rotating black holes is described in terms of the Weyl
scalars $\psi_4$ and $\psi_0$; each satisfying the Teukolsky's complex master
wave equation with spin $s=\mp2$, and respectively representing outgoing and
ingoing radiation. We explicitly construct the metric perturbations out of
these Weyl scalars in the Regge-Wheeler gauge in the nonrotating limit. We
propose a generalization of the Regge-Wheeler gauge for Kerr background in the
Newman-Penrose language, and discuss the approach for building up the perturbed
spacetime of a rotating black hole. We also provide both-way relationships
between waveforms defined in the metric and curvature approaches in the time
domain, also known as the (inverse-) Chandrasekhar transformations, generalized
to include matter.
