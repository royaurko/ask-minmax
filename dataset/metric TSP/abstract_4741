We consider the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,p) inside the critical window,
where p = 1/n + lambda * n^{-4/3} for some lambda in R. We proved in a previous
paper (arXiv:0903.4730) that considering the connected components of G(n,p) as
a sequence of metric spaces with the graph distance rescaled by n^{-1/3} and
letting n go to infinity yields a non-trivial sequence of limit metric spaces C
= (C_1, C_2, ...). These limit metric spaces can be constructed from certain
random real trees with vertex-identifications. For a single such metric space,
we give here two equivalent constructions, both of which are in terms of more
standard probabilistic objects. The first is a global construction using
Dirichlet random variables and Aldous' Brownian continuum random tree. The
second is a recursive construction from an inhomogeneous Poisson point process
on R_+. These constructions allow us to characterize the distributions of the
masses and lengths in the constituent parts of a limit component when it is
decomposed according to its cycle structure. In particular, this strengthens
results of Luczak, Pittel and Wierman by providing precise distributional
convergence for the lengths of paths between kernel vertices and the length of
a shortest cycle, within any fixed limit component.
