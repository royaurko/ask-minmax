The distance from the origin in the word metric for generalizations F(p) of
Thompson's group F is quasi-isometric to the number of carets in the reduced
rooted tree diagrams representing the elements of F(p). This interpretation of
the metric is used to prove that every F(p) admits a quasi-isometric embedding
into every F(q), and also to study the behavior of the shift maps under these
embeddings.
