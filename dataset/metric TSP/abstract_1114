As a sequel to (Berman, 2008a), we show that the rotation of the Universe can
be dealt by generalised Gaussian metrics, defined in this paper.
Robertson-Walker's metric has been employed with proper-time, in its standard
applications; the generalised Gaussian metric imply in the use of a
non-constant temporal metric coefficient modifying Robertson-Walker's standard
form. Experimental predictions are made
