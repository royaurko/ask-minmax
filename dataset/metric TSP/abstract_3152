In this paper such Riemann metrics are established whose Laplace-Beltrami
operators are identical to familiar Hamilton operators of elementary particle
systems. Such metrics are the natural positive definite invariant metrics
defined on two-step nilpotent Lie groups. The corresponding wave and
Schroedinger operators emerge in the Laplacians of the static resp. solvable
extensions of these nilpotent groups. The latter manifolds are endowed with
natural invariant indefinite metric of Lorentz signature. Thus, these new exact
mathematical models provide a relativistic theory for elementary particles. On
the solvable extensions these models look like Friedmann's expanding universe
being adopted to the microscopic level. Like the macroscopic one, also these
microscopic expanding models obey Hubble's law. The microscopic models,
however, offer much more complex structures with much more subtle explanations
for some of those phenomena which have originally been clarified by the
Friedmann model. One of the most important new features of this theory is that
the electromagnetic, the weak-nuclear, and the strong-nuclear forces emerge in
a unified way.
