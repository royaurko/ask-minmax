We reinterpret the proof of the Riemannian Penrose inequality by H. Bray. The
modified argument turns out to have a nice feature so that the flow of
Riemannian metrics appearing Bray's proof gives a Lorentzian metric of a
spacetime. We also discuss a possible extension of our approach to charged
black holes.
