An exact charged solution with axial symmetry is obtained in the teleparallel
equivalent of general relativity (TEGR). The associated metric has the
structure function $G(\xi)=1-{\xi}^2-2mA{\xi}^3-q^2A^2{\xi}^4$. The fourth
order nature of the structure function can make calculations cumbersome. Using
a coordinate transformation we get a tetrad whose metric has the structure
function in a factorisable form $(1-{\xi}^2)(1+r_{+}A\xi)(1+r_{-}A\xi)$ with
$r_{\pm}$ as the horizons of Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m space-time. This new
form has the advantage that its roots are now trivial to write down. Then, we
study the singularities of this space-time. Using another coordinate
transformation, we obtain a tetrad field. Its associated metric yields the
Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black hole. In Calculating the energy content of
this tetrad field using the gravitational energy-momentum, we find that the
resulting form depends on the radial coordinate! Using the regularized
expression of the gravitational energy-momentum in the teleparallel equivalent
of general relativity we get a consistent value for the energy.
