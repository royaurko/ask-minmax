We present a renormalized Gauss-Bonnet formula for approximate
Kahler-Einstein metrics on compact complex manifolds with pseudo-Einstein CR
boundaries. The boundary integral is given explicitly, and it is proved that it
gives a pseudo-Einstein invariant, which generalizes the Burns-Epstein
invariant.
