It has been known that the Cartesian product of two Suslin non-sigma-porous
sets in topologically complete metric spaces is non-sigma-porous in the product
space. The main aim of the present paper is to answer the natural question
whether a similar result can be proved for lower porosity. It apears the answer
is no, as we construct closed non-sigma-lower porous subsets of the real line A
and B such that the Cartesian product of A and B is lower porous. In the
present article we provide an example of two closed non-sigma-lower porous sets
with lower porous product. On the other hand, we prove the following: Let X and
Y be topologically complete metric spaces, let A be a non-sigma-lower porous
Suslin subset of X and let B be a non-sigma-porous Suslin subset of Y. Then the
product of A and B is non-sigma-lower porous. We also provide a brief summary
of some basic properties of lower porosity, including a simple characterization
of Suslin non-sigma-lower porous sets in topologically complete metric spaces.
