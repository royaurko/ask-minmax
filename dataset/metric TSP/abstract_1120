The purpose of this article is to review some recent results on the geometry
of neutral signature metrics in dimension four and their twistor spaces. The
following topics are considered: Neutral K\"ahler and hyperk\"ahler surfaces,
Walker metrics, Neutral anti-self-dual 4-manifolds and projective structures,
Twistor spaces of neutral metrics.
