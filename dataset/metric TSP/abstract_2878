It is well known that a hyperbolic domain in the complex plane has uniformly
perfect boundary precisely when the product of its hyperbolic density and the
distance function to its boundary has a positive lower bound. We extend this
characterization to a hyperbolic domain in the Riemann sphere in terms of the
spherical metric.
