The solutions of vacuum Einstein's field equations, for the class of
Riemannian metrics admitting a non Abelian bidimensional Lie algebra of Killing
fields, are explicitly described. They are parametrized either by solutions of
a transcendental equation (the tortoise equation), or by solutions of a linear
second order differential equation in two independent variables. Metrics,
corresponding to solutions of the tortoise equation, are characterized as those
that admit a 3-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing fields with bidimensional
leaves.
