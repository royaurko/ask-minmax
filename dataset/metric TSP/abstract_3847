The main aim of this paper is to present an overview of the need of a new way
of coping the fundamental equations of physics, see the references. Our main
aim is to build a new metrics in which both time and space are included, but in
some sort of minkowskian union of the two and in such a way that that union
preserves an independent reality, and where energy, can be taken as the real
fundamental issue of that metrics, instead of the particle concept. A departure
from General Theory of Relativity is clear, but then the BUS concept behaves
itself as a fundamental string.
