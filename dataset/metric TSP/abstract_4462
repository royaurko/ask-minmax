We present a new adaptive sorting algorithm which is optimal for most
disorder metrics and, more important, has a simple and quick implementation. On
input $X$, our algorithm has a theoretical $\Omega (|X|)$ lower bound and a
$\mathcal{O}(|X|\log|X|)$ upper bound, exhibiting amazing adaptive properties
which makes it run closer to its lower bound as disorder (computed on different
metrics) diminishes. From a practical point of view, \textit{NeatSort} has
proven itself competitive with (and often better than) \textit{qsort} and any
\textit{Random Quicksort} implementation, even on random arrays.
