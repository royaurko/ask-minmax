Let $M_i$ and $N_i$ be path-connected locally uniquely geodesic metric spaces
that are not points and $f:\prod_{i=1}^m M_i\to \prod_{i=1}^n N_i$ be an
isometry where $\prod_{i=1}^n N_i$ and $\prod_{i=1}^m M_i$ are given the sup
metric. Then $m=n$ and after reindexing $M_i$ is isometric to $N_i$ for all
$i$. Moreover $f$ is a composition of an isometry that reindexes the factor
spaces and an isometry that is a product of isometries $f_i:M_i\to N_i$.
