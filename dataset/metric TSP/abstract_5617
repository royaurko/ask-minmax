We describe the statistical properties of light rays propagating though a
random sea of gravity waves and compare with the case for scalar metric
perturbations from density inhomogeneities. For scalar fluctuations the
deflection angle grows as the square-root of the path length $D$ in the manner
of a random walk, and the rms displacement of a ray from the unperturbed
trajectory grows as $D^{3/2}$. For gravity waves the situation is very
different. The mean square deflection angle remains finite and is dominated by
the effect of the metric fluctuations at the ends of the ray, and the mean
square displacement grows only as the logarithm of the path length. In terms of
power spectra, the displacement for scalar perturbations has $P(k) \propto 1/
k^4$ while for gravity waves the trajectories of photons have $P(k) \propto
1/k$ which is a scale-invariant or `flicker-noise' process, and departures from
rectilinear motion are suppressed, relative to the scalar case, by a factor
$\sim (\lambda / D)^{3/2}$ where $\lambda$ is the characteristic scale of the
metric fluctuations and $D$ is the path length. This result casts doubt on the
viability of some recent proposals for detecting or constraining the gravity
wave background by astronomical measurements.
