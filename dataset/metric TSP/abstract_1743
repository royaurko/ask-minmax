Let $D$ be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbf C^n$, $n > 1$.
Using $G(z, p)$, the Green function for $D$ with pole at $p \in D$ associated
with the standard sum-of-squares Laplacian, N. Levenberg and H. Yamaguchi had
constructed a K\"{a}hler metric (the so-called $\La$-metric) using the Robin
function $\La(p)$ arising from $G(z, p)$. The purpose of this article is to
study this metric by deriving its boundary asymptotics and using them to
calculate the holomorphic sectional curvature along normal directions. It is
also shown that the $\La$-metric is comparable to the Kobayashi (and hence to
the Bergman and Carath\'{e}odory metrics) when $D$ is strongly pseudoconvex.
The unit ball in $\mathbf C^n$ is also characterized among all smoothly bounded
strongly convex domains on which the $\La$-metric has constant negative
holomorphic sectional curvature. This may be regarded as a version of Lu-Qi
Keng's theorem for the Bergman metric.
