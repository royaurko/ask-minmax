In this paper we introduce a row version of Kadison and Kastler's metric on
the set of C*-subalgebras of $\mathbb{B}(\mathcal{H})$. By showing C*-algebras
have row length (in the sense of Pisier) of at most 2 we show that the row
metric is equivalent to the original Kadison Kastler metric. Ino and Watatani
have recently proved that in certain circumstances sufficiently close
intermediate C*-algebras occur as small unitary perturbations. By adjusting
their arguments to work with the row metric we are able to obtain universal
constants independent of inclusions.
