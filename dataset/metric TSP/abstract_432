In this paper, we prove that evry 3-dimensional manifold M is a ?- recurrent
N(k)-contact metric manifold if and only if it is flat. Then we classify the
?-recurrent contact metric manifolds of constant curvature. This implies that
there exists no ?-recurrent N(k)-contact metric manifold, which is neither
symmetric nor locally ?-symmetric.
