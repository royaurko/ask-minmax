We construct the first examples of families of bad Riemannian orbifolds which
are isospectral with respect to the Laplacian but not isometric. In our case
these are particular fixed weighted projective spaces equipped with isospectral
metrics obtained by a generalization of Sch\"uth's version of the torus method.
