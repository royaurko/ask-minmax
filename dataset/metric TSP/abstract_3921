By matching the $Dp-Dq$ system in type II superstring theory with the Regge
trajectories of vector and axial-vector meson spectra, a possible 5-dimension
metric of a $Dp-Dq$ soft-wall model has been determined. The dependence of the
metric parameters on Regge trajectory parameters has been demonstrated. It is
shown that the models defined in $Dp$ brane background for $p=3$ or 4 can be
consistent with experimental data.
