The construction of conformally invariant gauge conditions for Maxwell and
Einstein theories on a manifold M is found to involve two basic ingredients.
First, covariant derivatives of a linear gauge (e.g. Lorenz or de Donder),
completely contracted with the tensor field representing the metric on the
vector bundle of the theory. Second, the addition of a compensating term,
obtained by covariant differentiation of a suitable tensor field built from the
geometric data of the problem. If the manifold M is endowed with an
m-dimensional positive-definite metric g, the existence theorem for such a
gauge in gravitational theory can be proved. If the metric g is Lorentzian,
which corresponds to general relativity, some technical steps are harder, but
one has again to solve integral equations on curved space-time to be able to
impose such gauges.
