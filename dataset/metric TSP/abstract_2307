In a paper published posthumously, P.S. Urysohn constructed a complete,
separable metric space that contains an isometric copy of every complete
separable metric space, nowadays referred to as the Urysohn universal space.
Here we study various convexity properties of the Urysohn universal space and
show that it has a finite ball intersection property. We also note that Urysohn
universal space is not hyperconvex.
