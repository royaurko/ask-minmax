We develop \emph{Fra\"iss\'e theory}, namely the theory of \emph{Fra\"iss\'e
classes} and \emph{Fra\"iss\'e limits}, in the context of metric structures. We
show that a class of finitely generated structures is Fra\"iss\'e if and only
if it is the age of a separable approximately homogeneous structure, and
conversely, that this structure is necessarily the unique limit of the class,
and is universal for it. We do this in a somewhat new approach, in which
''finite maps up to errors'' are coded by \emph{approximate isometries}.
