We investigate in this paper the existence of a metric which maximizes the
first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on Riemannian surfaces. We first prove that,
in a given conformal class, there always exists such a maximizing metric which
is smooth except at a finite set of conical singularities. This result is
similar to the beautiful result concerning Steklov eigenvalues recently
obtained by Fraser and Schoen. Then we get existence results among all metrics
on surfaces of a given genus, leading to the existence of minimal isometric
immersions of smooth compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension 2 into
some $k$-sphere by first eigenfunctions. At last, we also answer a conjecture
of Friedlander and Nadirashvili which asserts that the supremum of the first
eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a conformal class can be taken as close as we
want of its value on the sphere on any orientable surface.
