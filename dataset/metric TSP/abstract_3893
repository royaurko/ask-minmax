A definition of space-time metric deformations on an $n$-dimensional manifold
is given. We show that such deformations can be regarded as extended conformal
transformations. In particular, their features can be related to the
perturbation theory giving a natural picture by which gravitational waves are
described by small deformations of the metric. As further result, deformations
can be related to approximate Killing vectors (approximate symmetries) by which
it is possible to parameterize the deformed region of a given manifold. The
perspectives and some possible physical applications of such an approach are
discussed.
