We consider optimization of generalized performance metrics for binary
classification by means of surrogate loss. We focus on a class of metrics,
which are linear-fractional functions of the false positive and false negative
rates (examples of which include $F_{\beta}$-measure, Jaccard similarity
coefficient, AM measure, and many others). Our analysis concerns the following
two-step procedure. First, a real-valued function $f$ is learned by minimizing
a surrogate loss for binary classification on the training sample. It is
assumed that the surrogate loss is a strongly proper composite loss function
(examples of which include logistic loss, squared-error loss, exponential loss,
etc.). Then, given $f$, a threshold $\hat{\theta}$ is tuned on a separate
validation sample, by direct optimization of the target performance measure. We
show that the regret of the resulting classifier (obtained from thresholding
$f$ on $\hat{\theta}$) measured with respect to the target metric is
upperbounded by the regret of $f$ measured with respect to the surrogate loss.
Our finding is further analyzed in a computational study on both synthetic and
real data sets.
