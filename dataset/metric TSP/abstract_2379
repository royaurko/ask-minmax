Consider a sample of $n$ points taken i.i.d from a submanifold of Euclidean
space. This defines a metric measure space. We show that there is an explicit
set of scales $t_{n}\rightarrow0$ such that a coarse Ricci curvature at scale
$t_{n}$ on this metric measure space converges almost surely to the coarse
Ricci curvature of the underlying manifold.
