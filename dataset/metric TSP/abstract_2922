We provide physical interpretation for the four parameters of the stationary
Lewis metric restricted to the Weyl class. Matching this spacetime to a
completely anisotropic, rigidly rotating, fluid cilinder, we obtain from the
junction conditions that one of these parameters is proportional to the
vorticity of the source. From the Newtonian approximation a second parameter is
found to be proportional to the energy per unit of length. The remaining two
parameters may be associated to a gravitational analog of the Aharanov-Bohm
effect. We prove, using the Cartan scalars, that the Weyl class metric and
static Levi-Civita metric are locally equivalent, i.e., indistinguishable in
terms of its curvature.
