I study a stochastic approach for warm inflation considering back - reaction
of the metric with the fluctuations of matter field. This formalism takes into
account the local inhomogeneities fo the spacetime in a globally flat Friedmann
- Robertson - Walker metric. The stochastic equations for the fluctuations of
the matter field and the metric are obtained. Finally, the dynamics for the
amplitude of these fluctuations in a power - law expansion for the universe are
examined.
