We study the amplification of large-scale magnetic fields during preheating
and inflation in several different models. Preheating can resonantly amplify
seed fields on cosmological scales. In the presence of conductivity, however,
the effect of resonance is typically weakened while the amplitude of produced
magnetic fields depends sensitively on the evolution of the conductivity during
the preheating and thermalisation phases. In addition we discuss geometric
magnetisation, where amplification of magnetic fields occurs through coupling
to curvature invariants. This can be efficient during inflation due to a
negative coupling instability. Finally we discuss the breaking of the conformal
flatness of the background metric whereby magnetic fields can be stimulated
through the growth of scalar metric perturbations during metric preheating.
