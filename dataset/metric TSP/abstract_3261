We obtain and analyze an exact solution to Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory in
$(2+1)$ dimensions, in which the scalar field couples to gravity in a
non-minimal way, and it also couples to itself with the self-interacting
potential solely determined by the metric ansatz. A negative cosmological
constant naturally emerges as a constant term in the scalar potential. The
metric is static and circularly symmetric, and contains a curvature singularity
at the origin. The conditions for the metric to contain 0, 1, 2 horizons are
identified, and the effects of the scalar and electric charges on the size of
the black hole radius are discussed. Under proper choices of parameters, the
metric degenerates into some previously known solutions in $(2+1)$-dimensional
gravity.
