We prove that a crepant resolution of a Ricci-flat K\"ahler cone X admits a
complete Ricci-flat K\"ahler metric asymptotic to the cone metric in every
K\"ahler class in H^2_c(Y,R). This result contains as a subcase the existence
of ALE Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics on crepant resolutions of X=C^n /G, where G
is a finite subgroup of SL(n,C).
  We consider the case in which X is toric. A result of A. Futaki, H. Ono, and
G. Wang guarantees the existence of a Ricci-flat K\"ahler cone metric if X is
Gorenstein. We use toric geometry to construct crepant resolutions.
