The paper proposes extensions of the usual notions of Finslerian volume to
Finsler metrics of Lorentzian signature. The basic idea is to replace, in the
classical Busemann-Hausdorff and Holmes-Thompson definitions, integration on
the indicatrices of the given metric (which are, in Lorentzian signature,
non-compact, generally leading to infinite integrals) with integration on
ellipsoids. These ellipsoids can be canonically attached to the given
Lorentzian Finsler metric by means of a variational procedure. While the
construction of the Holmes-Thompson volume form requires the determinant of the
Finslerian metric tensor to be defined and smooth on the entire slit tangent
bundle, the Busemann-Hausdorff-type volume form can be constructed even if the
metric tensor is not defined or is degenerate along some directions - which is
the case with the large majority of the known Lorentzian Finsler metrics. This
feature makes it possible to build well-defined field-theoretical integrals
having such metrics as a background.
