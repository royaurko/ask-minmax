We construct a fully analytic, general relativistic, nonspinning black hole
binary spacetime that approximately solves the vacuum Einstein equations
everywhere in space and time for black holes sufficiently well separated. The
metric is constructed by asymptotically matching perturbed Schwarzschild
metrics near each black hole to a two-body post-Newtonian metric far from them,
and a two-body post-Minkowskian metric farther still. Asymptotic matching is
done without linearizing about a particular time slice, and thus it is valid
dynamically and for all times, provided the binary is sufficiently well
separated. This approximate global metric can be used for long dynamical
evolutions of relativistic magnetohydrodynamical, circumbinary disks around
inspiraling supermassive black holes to study a variety of phenomena.
