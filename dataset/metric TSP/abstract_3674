In a previous article it was proved that the extensions of the Taub-NUT
geometry do not admit Killing-Yano tensors, even if they possess St\"
{a}ckel-Killing tensors. Here the analysis is taken further, and it is shown
that, in general, this class of metrics does not even admit f-symbols. The only
exception is the original Taub-NUT metric which possesses four Killing-Yano
tensors of valence two.
