Statistical methods for analyzing large-scale biomolecular data are
commonplace in computational biology. A notable example is phenotype prediction
from gene expression data, for instance, detecting human cancers,
differentiating subtypes and predicting clinical outcomes. Still, clinical
applications remain scarce. One reason is that the complexity of the decision
rules that emerge from standard statistical learning impedes biological
understanding, in particular, any mechanistic interpretation. Here we explore
decision rules for binary classification utilizing only the ordering of
expression among several genes; the basic building blocks are then two-gene
expression comparisons. The simplest example, just one comparison, is the TSP
classifier, which has appeared in a variety of cancer-related discovery
studies. Decision rules based on multiple comparisons can better accommodate
class heterogeneity, and thereby increase accuracy, and might provide a link
with biological mechanism. We consider a general framework ("rank-in-context")
for designing discriminant functions, including a data-driven selection of the
number and identity of the genes in the support ("context"). We then specialize
to two examples: voting among several pairs and comparing the median expression
in two groups of genes. Comprehensive experiments assess accuracy relative to
other, more complex, methods, and reinforce earlier observations that simple
classifiers are competitive.
