Consider a quasiconvex uniform metric measure space supporting a local weak
$(1,1)$-Poincar\'e inequality. We characterise the vanishing of the fundamental
class in the controlled coarse homology of P. W. Nowak and J. \v{S}pakula on
spaces of this type by a global weighted $(1,1)$-Sobolev inequality, hence
establishing their quasi-isometry invariance. As an application, we show that
every visual Gromov hyperbolic space of this type with connected Gromov
boundary containing at least two points supports a global weighted
$(1,1)$-Sobolev inequality, and use this to solve the Dirichlet problem at
infinity.
