Global two-monopoles are unstable in their simplest formulation. We construct
a model with a metric-like prefactor which we show can stabilize the global
two-monopoles. The stabilizing construction is realized with a Skyrme sector
where the metric-like prefactor is a function of the Skyrmion profile.
