In this paper, I give a new construction of a K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics on
a smooth projective variety with ample canonical bundle. This result can be
generalized to the construction of a singular K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric on a
smooth projective variety of general type which gives an AZD of the canonical
bundle. Also the variation of Bergman kernels and K\"{a}hler-Einstein volume
form have been considered.
