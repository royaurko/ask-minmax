In this paper we extend the coupled fixed point theorems for mixed monotone
operators $F:X \times X \rightarrow X$ obtained in [T.G. Bhaskar, V.
Lakshmikantham, \textit{Fixed point theorems in partially ordered metric spaces
and applications}, Nonlinear Anal. TMA \textbf{65} (2006) 1379-1393] by
significantly weakening the involved contractive condition. Our technique of
proof is essentially different and more natural. An example as well an
application to periodic BVP are also given in order to illustrate the
effectiveness of our generalizations.
