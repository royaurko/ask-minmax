A popular approach to solving large probabilistic systems relies on
aggregating states based on a measure of similarity. Many approaches in the
literature are heuristic. A number of recent methods rely instead on metrics
based on the notion of bisimulation, or behavioral equivalence between states
(Givan et al, 2001, 2003; Ferns et al, 2004). An integral component of such
metrics is the Kantorovich metric between probability distributions. However,
while this metric enables many satisfying theoretical properties, it is costly
to compute in practice. In this paper, we use techniques from network
optimization and statistical sampling to overcome this problem. We obtain in
this manner a variety of distance functions for MDP state aggregation, which
differ in the tradeoff between time and space complexity, as well as the
quality of the aggregation. We provide an empirical evaluation of these
trade-offs.
