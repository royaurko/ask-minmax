In this paper we propose the toy model of the closed string tachyon effective
action that has marginal tachyon profile as its exact solution in case of
constant or linear dilaton background. Then we will apply this model for
description of two dimensional bosonic string theory. We will find that the
background configuration with the spatial dependent linear dilaton, flat
spacetime metric and marginal tachyon profile is the exact solution of our
model even if we take into account backreaction of tachyon on dilaton and
metric.
