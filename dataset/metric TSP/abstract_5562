In this paper we show that if a K\"ahler manifold is furnished with a closed
conformal vector field, then, in suitable open subsets, its K\"ahler structure
can be deformed into a different one. This deformation can be applied to the
whole class of K\"ahler manifolds that arise as Riemannian cones over Sasaki
manifolds, and gives an infinite family of new examples of K\"ahler manifolds,
in each complex dimension greater than $2$. Moreover, if we deform the K\"ahler
metric of the cone over an Einstein-Sasaki manifold, then we get an
Einstein-K\"ahler manifold, and a particular class of such deformations
presents the same phenomenon of sectional holomorphic curvature decay that
takes place when we deform the metric of the complex Euclidean space into that
of the complex hyperbolic space. Two infinite families of such deformations
arise by taking any of the two infinite families of Einstein-Sasaki manifolds
constructed by Cvetic, Lu, Page and Pope.
