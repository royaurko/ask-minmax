We define shadowable points for homeomorphism on metric spaces. In the
compact case we will prove the following results: The set of shadowable points
is invariant, possibly nonempty or noncompact. A homeomorphism has the
pseudo-orbit tracing property if and only if every point is shadowable. The
chain recurrent and nonwandering sets coincides when every chain recurrent
point is shadowable. Minimal or distal homeomorphisms of compact connected
metric spaces have no shadowable points. The space is totally disconnected at
every shadowable point for distal homeomorphisms (and conversely for
equicontinuous homeomorphisms). A distal homeomorphism has the pseudo-orbit
tracing property if and only if the space is totally disconnected (this
improves Theorem 4 in \cite{mo}).
