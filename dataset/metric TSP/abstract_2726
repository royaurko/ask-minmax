Affine metrics and its associated algebroid bundle are developed.
  Theses structures are applied to the general relativity and provide an
structure for unification of gravity and electromagnetism. The final result is
a field equation on the associated algebroid bundle that is similar to Einstein
field equation but contain Einstein field equation and Maxwell equations
simultaneously and contain a new equation that may have new results.
