A generalized flag manifold is a homogeneous space of the form $G/K$, where
$K$ is the centralizer of a torus in a compact connected semisimple Lie group
$G$. We classify all flag manifolds with four isotropy summands and we study
their geometry. We present new $G$-invariant Einstein metrics by solving
explicity the Einstein equation. We also examine the isometric problem for
these Einstein metrics.
