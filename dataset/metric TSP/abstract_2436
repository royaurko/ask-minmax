We develop subrepresentation inequalities for infinitely degenerate metrics,
and obtain corresponding Poincare and Sobolev inequalities. We then derive
conditions on the degenerate metric under which weak solutions to associated
infinitely degenerate equations with rough coefficients are locally bounded or
even continuous. As an application we obtain W-hypoellipticity of certain
infinitely degenerate quasilinear equations with smooth coefficients having
mild nonlinearities and degeneracies.
