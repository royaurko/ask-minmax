Let $g$ be a Riemannian metric for $\mathbf{R}^d$ ($d\geq 3$) which differs
from the Euclidean metric only in a smooth and strictly convex bounded domain
$M$. The lens rigidity problem is concerned with recovering the metric $g$
inside $M$ from the corresponding scattering relation on the boundary $\partial
M$. In this paper, the stability of the lens rigidity problem is investigated
for metrics which are a priori close to a given non-trapping metric satisfying
"strong fold-regular" condition. A metric $g$ is called strong fold-regular if
for each point $x\in M$, there exists a set of geodesics passing through $x$
whose conormal bundle covers $T^*_{x}M$. Moreover, these geodesics contain
either no conjugate points or only fold conjugate points with a non-degeneracy
condition. Our main result gives the first stability result for the lens
rigidity problem in the case of anisotropic metrics. The approach is based on
the study of the linearized inverse problem of recovering a metric from its
induced geodesic flow, which is a weighted geodesic X-ray transform problem for
symmetric 2-tensor fields. A key ingredient is to show that the kernel of the
X-ray transform on symmetric solenoidal 2-tensor fields is of finite dimension.
It remains open whether the kernel space is trivial or not.
