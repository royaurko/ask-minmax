In this paper, we generalize a recent work of Liu et al. from the open unit
ball $\mathbb B^n$ to more general bounded strongly convex domains with $C^2$
boundary. It turns out that the main result in this paper is in some certain
sense just a part of results in a work of Bracci and Zaitsev. However, the
proofs are different: the arguments in this paper involve a simple growth
estimate for the Kobayashi metric near the boundary of convex domain $D\subset
\mathbb C^n$ and the well-known Graham's estimate on the boundary behavior of
the Kobayashi metric on strongly pseudoconvex domains, while Bracci and Zaitsev
use other arguments.
