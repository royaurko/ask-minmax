We consider a single Abelian Higgs vortex on a surface {\Sigma} whose
Gaussian curvature K is small relative to the size of the vortex, and analyse
vortex motion by using geodesics on the moduli space of static solutions. The
moduli space is {\Sigma} with a modified metric, and we propose that this
metric has a universal expansion, in terms of K and its derivatives, around the
initial metric on {\Sigma}. Using an integral expression for the K\"ahler
potential on the moduli space, we calculate the leading coefficients of this
expansion numerically, and find some evidence for their universality. The
expansion agrees to first order with the metric resulting from the Ricci flow
starting from the initial metric on {\Sigma}, but differs at higher order. We
compare the vortex motion with the motion of a point particle along geodesics
of {\Sigma}. Relative to a particle geodesic, the vortex experiences an
additional force, which to leading order is proportional to the gradient of K.
This force is analogous to the self-force on bodies of finite size that occurs
in gravitational motion.
