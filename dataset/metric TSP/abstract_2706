We prove that there exists a norm in the plane under which no n-point set
determines more than O(n log n log log n) unit distances. Actually, most norms
have this property, in the sense that their complement is a meager set in the
metric space of all norms (with the metric given by the Hausdorff distance of
the unit balls).
