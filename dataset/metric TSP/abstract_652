In this paper, we study strongly Gauduchon metrics on compact complex
manifolds. We study the cohomology cones SG in the de Rham cohomology groups
generated by all strongly Gauduchon metrics and its direct images under proper
modifications. We also study the moduli of strongly Gauduchon manifolds. We
prove an existence result of strongly Gauduchon metrics on compact complex
manifold which is fibred over a compact complex curve. In particular, if a
compact complex manifold X has a topologically essential fibration over a
compact complex curve, and if the generic fibres satisfy ddbar-lemma, then X
admits strongly Gauduchon metrics.
