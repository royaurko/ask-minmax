We clarify the relation among canonical, metric and Belinfante's
energy-momentum tensors for general tensor field theories. For any tensor field
T, we define a new tensor field $\til {\bm T}$, in terms of which the
Belinfante tensor is readily computed. We show that the latter is the one that
arises naturally from Noether Theorem for an arbitrary spacetime and it
coincides on-shell with the metric one.
