The main motivation of this paper arises from the study of
Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces, where the class of 1-rectifiable sets does not
contain smooth non-horizontal curves; therefore a new definition of rectifiable
sets including non-horizontal curves is needed. This is why we introduce in any
metric space a new class of curves, called continuously metric differentiable
of degree $k$, which are H\"older but not Lipschitz continuous when $k>1$.
Replacing Lipschitz curves by this kind of curves we define $({\cal
H}^k,1)$-rectifiable sets and show a density result generalizing the
corresponding one in Euclidean geometry. This theorem is a consequence of
computations of Hausdorff measures along curves, for which we give an integral
formula. In particular, we show that both spherical and usual Hausdorff
measures along curves coincide with a class of dimensioned lengths and are
related to an interpolation complexity, for which estimates have already been
obtained in Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces.
