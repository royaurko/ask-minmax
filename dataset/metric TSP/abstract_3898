The generalized Legendre transform method of Lindstrom and Rocek yields
hyperkaehler metrics from holomorphic functions. Its main ingredients are
sections of ${\cal O}(2j)$ bundles over the twistor space satisfying a reality
condition with respect to antipodal conjugation on the hyperkaehler sphere of
complex structures. Formally, the structure of the real ${\cal O}(2j)$ sections
is identical to that of quantum-mechanical wave functions describing the states
of a particle with spin $j$ in the spin coherent representation. We analyze
these sections and their SO(3) invariants and illustrate our findings with two
Swann bundle constructions.
