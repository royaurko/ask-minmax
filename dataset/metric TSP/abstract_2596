Some examples of three-dimensional metrics of constant curvature defined by
solutions of nonlinear integrable differential equations and their
generalizations are constructed. The properties of Riemann extensions of the
metrics of constant curvature are studied. The connection with the theory of
normal Riemann spaces are discussed.
