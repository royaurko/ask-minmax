A particular Finsler-metric proposed in [1,2] and describing a geometry with
a preferred null direction is characterized here as belonging to a subclass
contained in a larger class of Finsler-metrics with one or more preferred
directions (null, space- or timelike). The metrics are classified according to
their group of isometries. These turn out to be isomorphic to subgroups of the
Poincar\'e (Lorentz-) group complemented by the generator of a dilatation. The
arising Finsler geometries may be used for the construction of relativistic
theories testing the isotropy of space. It is shown that the Finsler space with
the only preferred null direction is the anisotropic space closest to isotropic
Minkowski-space of the full class discussed.
