Rainich-type conditions giving a spacetime "geometrization" of matter fields
in general relativity are reviewed and extended. Three types of matter are
considered: perfect fluids, scalar fields, and electromagnetic fields.
Necessary and sufficient conditions on a spacetime metric for it to be part of
a perfect fluid solution of the Einstein equations are given. Formulas for
constructing the fluid from the metric are obtained. All fluid results hold for
any spacetime dimension. Geometric conditions on a metric which are necessary
and sufficient for it to define a solution of the Einstein-scalar field
equations and formulas for constructing the scalar field from the metric are
unified and extended to arbitrary dimensions, to include a cosmological
constant, and to include any self-interaction potential. Necessary and
sufficient conditions on a four-dimensional spacetime metric for it to be an
electrovacuum and formulas for constructing the electromagnetic field from the
metric are generalized to include a cosmological constant. Both null and
non-null electromagnetic fields are treated. A number of examples and
applications of these results are presented.
