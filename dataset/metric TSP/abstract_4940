New features of the generalized symmetries of generic two-dimensional dilaton
models of gravity are presented and invariant gravity-matter couplings are
introduced. We show that there is a continuum set of Noether symmetries, which
contains half a de Witt algebra. Two of these symmetries are area-preserving
transformations. We show that gravity-matter couplings which are invariant
under area preserving transformations only contribute to the dynamics of the
dilaton-gravity sector with a reshaping of the dilaton potential. The
interaction with matter by means of invariant metrics is also considered. We
show in a constructive way that there are metrics which are invariant under two
of the symmetries. The most general metrics and minimal couplings that fulfil
this condition are found.
