In this paper we show that the tangent cone of a conflict set in $R^n$ is a
linear affine cone over a conflict set of smaller dimension and has dimension
$n-1$. Moreover we give an example where the conflict sets is not normally
embedded and not locally bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the corresponding tangent
cone.
