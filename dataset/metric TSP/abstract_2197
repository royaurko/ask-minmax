We show that the collective properties of self-propelled particles aligning
with their "topological" (Voronoi) neighbors are qualitatively different from
those of usual models where metric interaction ranges are used. This relevance
of metric-free interactions, shown in a minimal setting, indicate that
realistic models for the cohesive motion of cells, bird flocks, and fish
schools may have to incorporate them, as suggested by recent observations.
