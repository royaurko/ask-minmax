Static cylindrical shells made of various types of matter are studied as
sources of the vacuum Levi-Civita metrics. Their internal physical properties
are related to the two essential parameters of the metrics outside. The total
mass per unit length of the cylinders is always less than 1/4. The results are
illustrated by a number of figures.
