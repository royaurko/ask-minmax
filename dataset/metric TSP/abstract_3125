We present the evolution of the full set of Einstein equations during
preheating after inflation. We study a generic supersymmetric model of hybrid
inflation, integrating fields and metric fluctuations in a 3-dimensional
lattice. We take initial conditions consistent with Eintein's constraint
equations. The induced preheating of the metric fluctuations is not large
enough to backreact onto the fields, but preheating of the scalar modes does
affect the evolution of vector and tensor modes. In particular, they do enhance
the induced stochastic background of gravitational waves during preheating,
giving an energy density in general an order of magnitude larger than that
obtained by evolving the tensors fluctuations in an homogeneous background
metric. This enhancement can improve the expectations for detection by planned
gravitational waves observatories.
