Given a simply connected compact generalized flag manifold M together with
its invariant K\"ahler Einstein metric g, we investigate the functional given
by the first eigenvalue of the Hodge Laplacian on smooth functions restricted
to the space of invariant K\"ahler metrics. We give sufficient and necessary
conditions so that the metric g is a critical point for this functional.
Moreover we prove that when M is a full flag manifold, the metric g is critical
if and only if M= SU(3)/T^2 and in this case g is a maximum.
