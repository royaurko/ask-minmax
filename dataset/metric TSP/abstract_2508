We study spectral asymptotics for the Laplace operator on differential forms
on a Riemannian foliated manifold equipped with a bundle-like metric in the
case when the metric is blown up in directions normal to the leaves of the
foliation. The asymptotical formula for the eigenvalue distribution function is
obtained. The relationships with the spectral theory of leafwise Laplacian and
with the noncommutative spectral geometry of foliations are discussed.
