We study the Assouad dimension and the Nagata dimension of metric spaces. As
a general result, we prove that the Nagata dimension of a metric space is
always bounded from above by the Assouad dimension. Most of the paper is
devoted to the study of when these metric dimensions of a metric space are
locally given by the dimensions of its metric tangents. Having uniformly close
tangents is not sufficient. What is needed in addition is either that the
tangents have dimension with uniform constants independent from the point and
the tangent, or that the tangents are unique. We will apply our results to
equiregular subRiemannian manifolds and show that locally their Nagata
dimension equals the topological dimension.
