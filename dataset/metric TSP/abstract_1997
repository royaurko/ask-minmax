In this paper we prove that the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics for a toroidal
canonical degeneration family of K\"{a}hler manifolds with ample canonical
bundles Gromov-Hausdorff converge to the complete K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric on
the smooth part of the central fiber when the base locus of the degeneration
family is empty. We also prove the incompleteness of the Weil-Peterson metric
in this case.
