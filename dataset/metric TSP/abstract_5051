We consider branes as "points" in an infinite dimensional brane space ${\cal
M}$ with a prescribed metric. Branes move along the geodesics of ${\cal M}$.
For a particular choice of metric the equations of motion are equivalent to the
well known equations of the Dirac-Nambu-Goto branes (including strings). Such
theory describes "free fall" in ${\cal M}$-space. In the next step the metric
of ${\cal M}$-space is given the dynamical role and a corresponding kinetic
term is added to the action. So we obtain a background independent brane
theory: a space in which branes live is ${\cal M}$-space and it is not given in
advance, but comes out as a solution to the equations of motion. The embedding
space ("target space") is not separately postulated. It is identified with the
brane configuration.
