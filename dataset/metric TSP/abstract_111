We consider a certain metric on the space of all convex compacta in $\R^{n}$,
introduced by A. Pli\'s. The set of strictly convex compacta is a complete
metric subspace of the metric space of convex compacta with respect to this
metric. We present some applications of this metric to the problems of
set-valued analysis, in particular we estimate the distance between two compact
sets with respect to this metric and to the Hausdorff metric.
