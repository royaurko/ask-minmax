A given Hamiltonian matrix H with real spectrum is assumed tridiagonal and
non-Hermitian. Its possible Hermitizations via an amended, ad hoc inner-product
metric are studied. Under certain reasonable assumptions, all of these metrics
are shown obtainable as recurrent solutions of the hidden Hermiticity
constraint called Dieudonne equation. In this framework even the two-parametric
Jacobi-polynomial real- and asymmetric-matrix N-site lattice Hamiltonian is
found tractable non-numerically at all N.
