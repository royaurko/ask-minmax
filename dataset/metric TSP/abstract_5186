A particular exact solution of Einstein's Hermitian theory of relativity is
examined, after recalling that there is merit in adding phenomenological
sources to the theory, and in choosing the metric like it was done long ago by
Kursunoglu and Hely. It is shown by intrinsic arguments, relying on the
properties of the chosen metric manifold, that the solution describes in
Einstein's theory the field of n thin parallel wires at rest, run by steady
electric currents, and predicts their equilibrium positions through the
injunction that the metric must display cylindrical symmetry in the
infinitesimal neighbourhood of each wire. In the weak field limit the
equilibrium positions coincide with the ones prescribed by Maxwell's
electrodynamics.
