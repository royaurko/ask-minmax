This paper is devoted to the study of isometrically homogeneous spaces from
the view point of metric geometry. Mainly we focus on those spaces that are
homeomorphic to lines. One can reduce the study to those distances on $\R$ that
are translation invariant. We study possible values of various metric
dimensions of such spaces. One of the main results is the equivalence of two
properties: the first one is linear connectedness and the second one is
1-dimensionality, with respect to Nagata dimension. Several concrete
pathological examples are provided.
