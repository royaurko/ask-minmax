In this letter, we present a new metric for characterizing the geometric
conditions encountered in cellular positioning based on the angular spread of
the base stations (BSs). The metric is shown to be correlated with the
geometric dilution of precision (GDOP), yet has the benefit of being
characterizable in terms of the network parameters for BS layouts modeled
according to a Poisson point process. As an additional benefit, the metric is
shown to immediately yield a device's probability of being inside or outside
the convex hull of the BSs, which localization researchers will
widely-recognize as being a strong indicator of localization performance.
