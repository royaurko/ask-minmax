We construct a compact K\"ahler manifold of nonnegative quadratic bisectional
curvature, which does not admit any K\"ahler metric of nonnegative orthogonal
bisectional curvature. The manifold is a 7-dimensional K\"ahler C-space with
second Betti number equal to 1, and its canonical metric is a K\"ahler-Einstein
metric of positive scalar curvature
