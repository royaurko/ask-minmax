We calculate a wall crossing formula for 4-dimensional Poincare-Einstein
metrics, through a wall made of orbifold Poincare-Einstein metrics with A1
singularities. This is based on a formalism which enables to deal with higher
order terms of the Einstein equation in this setting. Some other consequences
are deduced.
