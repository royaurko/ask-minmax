We present a class of models in which the primordial metric fluctuations do
not necessarily obey Gaussian statistics. These models are realizations of
mechanisms in which non-Gaussianity is first generated by a light scalar field
and then transferred into curvature fluctuations during or at the end of
inflation. For this class of models we present generic results for the
probability distribution functions of the metric perturbation at the end of
inflation. It is stressed that finite volume effects can induce non trivial
effects that we sketch.
