We study continuous groups of generalized Kerr-Schild transformations and the
vector fields that generate them in any n-dimensional manifold with a
Lorentzian metric. We prove that all these vector fields can be intrinsically
characterized and that they constitute a Lie algebra if the null deformation
direction is fixed. The properties of these Lie algebras are briefly analyzed
and we show that they are generically finite-dimensional but that they may have
infinite dimension in some relevant situations. The most general vector fields
of the above type are explicitly constructed for the following cases: any
two-dimensional metric, the general spherically symmetric metric and
deformation direction, and the flat metric with parallel or cylindrical
deformation directions.
