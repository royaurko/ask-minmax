We show that Petrov type I vacuum solutions admitting a Killing vector whose
Papapetrou field is aligned with a principal bivector of the Weyl tensor are
the Kasner and Taub metrics, their counterpart with timelike orbits and their
associated windmill-like solutions, as well as the Petrov homogeneous vacuum
solution. We recover all these metrics by using an integration method based on
an invariant classification which allows us to characterize every solution. In
this way we obtain an intrinsic and explicit algorithm to identify them.
