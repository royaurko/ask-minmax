A regular (i.e., singularity-free) cycling cosmological model is advanced. In
the model, there are only two constants: the gravitational constant (or the
Planck time) and the cosmic period. The radius of the universe is a simple
periodic function of cosmic time. The regularity of the construction is
achieved via the condition that the measure associated with metric be the Haar
measure on the 3-space. The possibility of the construction is due to dark
matter---as long as it is treated not as a particle matter, but as a
compensational tensor field. The metrodynamical equation, i.e., an equation for
metric, is derived and expressions for the pressure, energy and momentum
compensons are obtained.
