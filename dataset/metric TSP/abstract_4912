The extension of the so-called "empty" (with gravity and antigravity that
compensate each other in full or do not exist at all) universe and cosmological
redshift in it are considered in this paper. Its flat space-time can be
submitted not only as manifold with Friedman-Robertson-Walker metrics (FRW) of
the general theory of relativity (GR) but also as space-time with usual
Minkowski metrics (M-metrics) of the special theory of relativity (SR); the
transfer of metrics can be done by suitable transformation of reference frame.
Both below-mentioned statements are equally fair for such the universe. First:
the distant galaxies can have superluminity recession velocities in FRW-space
of GR; we have no right to use here the formula of relativistic Doppler effect.
Secondly: the SR theory is fair in the M-space and, accordingly, recession
velocities of the same galaxies here can aspire to the speed of light only.
  In this article it is shown that, despite opposite pictures in FRW-and M-
spaces, in the careful account of all details both approaches yield results
agreed among them. Thus, actually there are no contradictions between the
interpretations of cosmological redshift, based on SR and GR.
