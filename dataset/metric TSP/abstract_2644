A four-dimensional static black hole solution of Einstein equation
conformally coupled to a massive and self interacting scalar field is obtained.
A nontrivial scalar solution proposes a weak scalar hair. A dressed black hole
shows a trace of scalar charge in the metric signalling the presence of scalar
hair. A number of metrics with regular horizons and temperatures are also
proposed.
