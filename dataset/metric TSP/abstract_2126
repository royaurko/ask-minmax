This paper studies a discrepancy-sensitive approach to dynamic fractional
cascading. We provide an efficient data structure for dominated maxima
searching in a dynamic set of points in the plane, which in turn leads to an
efficient dynamic data structure that can answer queries for nearest neighbors
using any Minkowski metric. We provide an efficient data structure for
