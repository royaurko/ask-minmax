The Kaluza and Klein versions of Kaluza-Klein theory are reviewed and
compared. The differences in the field equations of the two theories are
related to the transformation properties of the metrics employed. Based on this
comparison a modified version of the Kaluza theory is proposed, in which the
different sectors of the metric which describe gravitation, electromagnetism
and the scalar field are considered to be partially separate entities, with
distinct coordinate transformation properties. In addition, the cylinder
condition is relaxed, so that it only affects the 4-D sector of the metric.
This results in a theory in which the gravitational and electromagnetic fields
are restricted to a four-dimensional brane, and the scalar field is restricted
to the 5-D bulk.
