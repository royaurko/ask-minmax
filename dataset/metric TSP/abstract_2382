A tiling of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is repulsive if no $r$-patch can repeat
arbitrarily close to itself, relative to $r$. This is a characteristic property
of aperiodic order, for a non repulsive tiling has arbitrarily large local
periodic patterns.
  We consider an aperiodic, repetitive tiling $T$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$, with
finite local complexity. From a spectral triple built on the discrete hull
$\Xi$ of $T$, and its Connes distance, we derive two metrics $d_{sup}$ and
$d_{inf}$ on $\Xi$. We show that $T$ is repulsive if and only if $d_{sup}$ and
$d_{inf}$ are Lipschitz equivalent. This generalises previous works for
subshifts by J. Kellendonk, D. Lenz, and the contributor.
