We consider the Complex Stone-Weierstrass Property (CSWP), which is the
complex version of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem. If X is a compact subspace of
a product of three linearly ordered spaces, then X has the CSWP if and only if
X has no subspace homeomorphic to the Cantor set. In addition, every finite
power of the double arrow space has the CSWP. These results are proved using
some results about those compact Hausdorff spaces which have scattered-to-one
maps onto compact metric spaces.
