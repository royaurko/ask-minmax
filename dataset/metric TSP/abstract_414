A uniform strategy to derive metric tensors in two spatial dimension for
interpolation errors and their gradients in $L^p$ norm is presented. It
generates anisotropic adaptive meshes as quasi-uniform ones in corresponding
metric space, with the metric tensor being computed based on a posteriori error
estimates in different norms. Numerical results show that the corresponding
convergence rates are always optimal.
