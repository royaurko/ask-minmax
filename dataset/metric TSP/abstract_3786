This paper aims to classify the holonomy of the conformal Tractor connection,
and relate these holonomies to the geometry of the underlying manifold. The
conformally Einstein case is dealt with through the construction of metric
cones, whose Riemmanian holonomy is the same as the Tractor holonomy of the
underlying manifold. Direct calculations in the Ricci-flat case and an
important decomposition theorem complete the classification for definitive
signature.
