We show that the set of max-plus measures representing a given max-plus
harmonic vector has a least element. This may be viewed as an analogue of the
uniqueness of the integral representation of harmonic functions in Potential
Theory. As an application, we show how the distance-like functions of a metric
space can be expressed in terms of the Busemann points of the metric boundary.
