Let (X,d) be a metric space of p-negative type. Recently I. Doust and A.
Weston introduced a quantification of the p-negative type property, the so
called gap {\Gamma} of X. This talk introduces some formulas for the gap
{\Gamma} of a finite metric space of strict p-negative type and applies them to
evaluate {\Gamma} for some concrete finite metric spaces.
