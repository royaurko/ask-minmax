Bing and Moise proved, independently, that any Peano continuum admits a
length metric d. We treat non-degenerate Peano continua with a length metric as
evolution systems instead of stationary objects. For any compact length space
(X, d) we consider a semiflow in the hyperspace $2^X$ of all non-empty closed
sets in X. This semiflow starts with a canonical copy of the Peano continuum
(X,d) at t = 0 and, at some time, collapses everything into a point. We study
some properties of this semiflow for several classes of spaces, manifolds,
graphs and finite polyhedra among them.
