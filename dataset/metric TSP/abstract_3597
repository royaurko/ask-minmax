We consider gravitational self interaction in the lowest approximation and
assume that graviton interacts with gravitational energy-momentum tensor in the
same way as it interacts with particles. We show that, using gravitational
vertex with a preferred gravitational energy-momentum tensor, it is possible to
obtain a metric necessary for explaining perihelion precession. The preferred
gravitational energy-momentum tensor gives positive gravitational energy
density of Newtonian center. We show also that, employing "improvement"
technique, any gravitational energy-momentum tensor can be made suitable for
using in gravitational wave equation for obtaining metric which explains
perihelion precession. Yet the "improvement" leads to negative gravitational
energy density of the Newtonian center.
