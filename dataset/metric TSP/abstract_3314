For a cardinal $\kappa > \omega$ a metric space $X$ is called to be
$\kappa$-superuniversal whenever for every metric space $Y$ with $|Y| < \kappa$
every partial isometry from a subset of $Y$ into $X$ can be extended over the
whole space $Y$. Examples of such spaces were given by Hechler [1] and
Kat\v{e}tov [2]. In particular, Kat\v{e}tov showed that if $\omega < \kappa =
\kappa^{< \kappa}$, then there exists a $\kappa$-superuniversal $K$ which is
moreover $\kappa$-homogeneous, i.e. every isometry of a subspace $Y\subseteq K$
with $|Y|<\kappa$ can be extended to an isometry of the whole $K$. In
connection of this W. Kubi\'s suggested that there should also exist a
$\kappa$-superuniversal space that is not $\kappa$-homogeneous. In this paper
there is shown that for every cardinal $\kappa$ there exists a
$\kappa$-superuniversal space which is rigid, i.e. has exactly one isometry,
namely the identity. The construction involves an amalgamation-like property of
a family of metric spaces.
