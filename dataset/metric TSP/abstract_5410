Google Scholar Metrics (GSM), which was recently launched in April 2012,
features new bibliometric systems for gauging scientific journals by counting
the number of citations obtained in Google Scholar. This way, it opens new
possibilities for measuring journal impacts in the field of Humanities. The
present article intends to evaluate the scope of this tool through analysing
GSM searches, from the 5th through 6th of December 2012, of History journals
published in Spain. In sum, 69 journals were identified, accounting for only
24% of the History journals published in Spain. The ranges of H index values
for this field are so small that the ranking can no longer be said to show a
discriminating potential. In the light of this, we would like to propose a
change in the way Google Scholar Metrics is designed so that it could also
accommodate production and citation patterns in the particular field of
History, and, in a broader scope, in the area of Humanities as well.
