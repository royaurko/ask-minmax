Spacetimes have conventionally been described by a global Lorentzian metric
on a differentiable four-manifold. Herein we explore the possibility of
spacetimes defined by a connection, which is locally but not globally
Levi-Civita. The general method of obtaining such connections is presented for
the non-degenerate case followed by an example that modifies the
Robertson-Walker spacetimes for flat spacelike hypersurfaces.
