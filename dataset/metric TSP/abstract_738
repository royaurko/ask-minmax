We construct new stationary Ricci-flat metrics of cohomogeneity 2 in five
dimensions, which generalise the Myers-Perry rotating black hole metrics by
adding a further non-trivial parameter. We obtain them via a construction that
is analogous to the construction by Plebanski and Demianski in four dimensions
of the most general type D metrics. Limiting cases of the new metrics contain
not only the general Myers-Perry black hole with independent angular momenta,
but also the single rotation black ring of Emparan and Reall. In another limit,
we obtain new static metrics that describe black holes whose horizons are
distorted lens spaces L(n;m)= S^3/\Gamma(n;m), where m\ge n+2\ge 3. They are
asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime factored by \Gamma(m;n). In the general
stationary case, by contrast, the new metrics describe spacetimes with an
horizon and with a periodicity condition on the time coordinate; these examples
can be thought of as five-dimensional analogues of the four-dimensional
Taub-NUT metrics.
