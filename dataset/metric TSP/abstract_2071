We show that the spheres in Hilbert geometry have the same volume growth
entropy as those in the Lobachevsky space. We give the asymptotic estimates for
the ratio of the volume of metric ball to the area of the metric sphere in
Hilbert geometry. Derived estimates agree with the well-known fact in the
Lobachevsky space
