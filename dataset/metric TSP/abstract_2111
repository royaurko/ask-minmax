By using the equivalence between metric and Palatini f(R) (or "modified")
gravities with omega=0, -3/2 Brans-Dicke theories, it is shown that the
Ehlers-Geren-Sachs theorem of general relativity is extended to modified
gravity. In the case of metric f(R) gravity previously studied, this agrees
with previous literature.
