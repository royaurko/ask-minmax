We study the space of L^2 harmonic forms on complete manifolds with metrics
of fibred boundary or fibred cusp type. These metrics generalize the geometric
structures at infinity of several different well-known classes of metrics,
including asymptotically locally Euclidean manifolds, the (known types of)
gravitational instantons, and also Poincar\'e metrics on Q-rank 1 ends of
locally symmetric spaces and on the complements of smooth divisors in K\"ahler
manifolds. The answer in all cases is given in terms of intersection cohomology
of a stratified compactification of the manifold. The L^2 signature formula
implied by our result is closely related to the one proved by Dai [dai] and
more generally by Vaillant [Va], and identifies Dai's tau invariant directly in
terms of intersection cohomology of differing perversities. This work is also
closely related to a recent paper of Carron [Car] and the forthcoming paper of
Cheeger and Dai [CD]. We apply our results to a number of examples,
gravitational instantons among them, arising in predictions about L^2 harmonic
forms in duality theories in string theory.
