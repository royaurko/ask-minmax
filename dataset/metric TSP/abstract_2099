We consider a finite action for a higher dimensional Taub-NUT/Bolt-(A)dS
space via the so-called counter term subtraction method. In the limit of high
temperature, we show that the Cardy-Verlinde formula holds for the
Taub-Bolt-AdS metric and for the specific dimensional Taub-NUT-(A)dS metric,
except for the Taub-Bolt-dS metric.
