Certain semi-Riemannian metrics may be decomposed into a Riemannian part and
an isochronal part. We use this idea and an idea of Kasner to construct a
manifold in 6+1 Minkowski space with a well known metric. The full embedding we
display is isochronal which simplifies visualizing the properties of the
manifold.
