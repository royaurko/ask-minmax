Any germ of a complex analytic space is equipped with two natural metrics:
the {\it outer metric} induced by the hermitian metric of the ambient space and
the {\it inner metric}, which is the associated riemannian metric on the germ.
These two metrics are in general nonequivalent up to bilipschitz homeomorphism.
We show that minimal surface singularities are Lipschitz normally embedded,
i.e., their outer and inner metrics are bilipschitz equivalent, and that they
are the only rational surface singularities with this property. The proof is
based on a preliminary result which gives a general characterization of
Lipschitz normally embedded normal surface singularities.
