We introduce a notion of connecting points in a metric measure space by
Alberti representations and show that it is equivalent to the space satisfying
the differentiability theory of Cheeger for Lipschitz maps into Banach spaces
with the Radon-Nikodym property. We then prove that this is also equivalent to
satisfying an asymptotic non-homogeneous Poincar\'e inequality. Finally we show
that this non-homogeneous Poincar\'e inequality is improved to a non-asymptotic
version under taking Gromov-Hausdorff tangents and use this improved form to
derive quasiconvexity of the tangents.
