Agile software development methodologies focus on software projects which are
behind schedule or highly likely to have a problematic development phase. In
the last decade, Agile methods have transformed from cult techniques to
mainstream methodologies. Scrum, an Agile software development method, has been
widely adopted due to its adaptive nature.
  This paper presents a metric that measures the quality of the testing process
in a Scrum process. As product quality and process quality correlate, improved
test quality can ensure high quality products. Also, gaining experience from
eight years of successful Scrum implementation at SoftwarePeople, we describe
the Scrum process emphasizing the testing process. We propose a metric Product
Backlog Rating (PBR) to assess the testing process in Scrum. PBR considers the
complexity of the features to be developed in an iteration of Scrum, assesses
test ratings and offers a numerical score of the testing process. This metric
is able to provide a comprehensive overview of the testing process over the
development cycle of a product.
  We present a case study which shows how the metric is used at SoftwarePeople.
The case study explains some features that have been developed in a Sprint in
terms of feature complexity and potential test assessment difficulties and
shows how PBR is calculated during the Sprint. We propose a test process
assessment metric that provides insights into the Scrum testing process.
However, the metric needs further evaluation considering associated resources
(e.g., quality assurance engineers, the length of the Scrum cycle).
