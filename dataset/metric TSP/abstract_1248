We classify the effective and transitive actions of a Lie group G on an
n-dimensional non-degenerate hyperboloid (also called real pseudo-hyperbolic
space), under the assumption that G is a closed, connected Lie subgroup of an
indefinite special orthogonal group. Under the same assumption on G, we also
obtain that any G-homogeneous Einstein pseudo-Riemannian metric on a real,
complex or quaternionic pseudo-hyperbolic space, or on a para-complex or
para-quaternionic projective space is homothetic to either the canonical metric
or the Einstein metric of the canonical variation of a Hopf pseudo-Riemannian
submersion.
