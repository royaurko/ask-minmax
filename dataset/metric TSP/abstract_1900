Above Planck energies, the spacetime might become non--Riemannian, as it is
known fron string theory and inflation. Then geometries arise in which
nonmetricity and torsion appear as field strengths, side by side with
curvature. By gauging the affine group, a metric affine gauge theory emerges as
dynamical framework. Here, by using the harmonic map ansatz, a new class of
multipole like solutions in the metric affine gravity theory (MAG) is obtained.
