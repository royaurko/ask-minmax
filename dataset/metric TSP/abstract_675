In this paper, we describe the extraction of source code metrics from the
Jazz repository and the application of data mining techniques to identify the
most useful of those metrics for predicting the success or failure of an
attempt to construct a working instance of the software product. We present
results from a systematic study using the J48 classification method. The
results indicate that only a relatively small number of the available software
metrics that we considered have any significance for predicting the outcome of
a build. These significant metrics are discussed and implication of the results
discussed, particularly the relative difficulty of being able to predict failed
build attempts.
