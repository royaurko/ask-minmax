We show that, for the space of Borel probability measures on a Borel subset
of a Polish metric space, the extreme points of the Prokhorov,
Monge-Wasserstein and Kantorovich metric balls about a measure whose support
has at most $n$ points, consist of measures whose supports have at most $n+2$
points. Moreover, we use the Strassen and Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality
theorems to develop efficiently computable supersets of the extreme points.
