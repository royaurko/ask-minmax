In the present paper, the $(HM',S,T)$-Cartan connections on pseudo-Finsler
manifolds, introduced by A. Bejancu and H.R. Farran, are obtained by the
natural almost complex structure arising from the nonlinear connection $HM'$.
We prove that the natural almost complex linear connection associated to a
$(HM',S,T)$-Cartan connection is a metric linear connection with respect to the
Sasaki metric $G$. Finally we give some conditions for $(M', J, G)$ to be a
K\"ahler manifold.
