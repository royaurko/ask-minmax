In this paper, we state and prove a generalization of \'Ciri\'c fixed point
theorems in metric space by using a new generalized quasi-contractive map.
These theorems extend other well known fundamental metrical fixed point
theorems in the literature. Moreover, a multi-valued version for generalized
quasi-contraction is also established.
