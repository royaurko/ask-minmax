Existing mathematical results are applied to the problem of classifying
closed $p$-forms which are locally constructed from Lorentzian metrics on an
$n$-dimensional orientable manifold $M$ ($0<p<n$). We show that the only
closed, non-exact forms are generated by representatives of cohomology classes
of $M$ and $(n-1)$-forms representing $n$-dimensional (with $n$ even)
generalizations of the conservation of ``kink number'', which was exhibited by
Finkelstein and Misner for $n=4$. The cohomology class that defines the kink
number depends only on the diffeomorphism equivalence class of the metric, but
a result of Gilkey implies that there is no representative of this cohomology
class which is built from the metric, curvature and covariant derivatives of
curvature to any finite order.
