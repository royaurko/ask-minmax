We give a presentation theorem for continuous first-order logic and Metric
Abstract Elementary classes in terms of $L_{\omega_1, \omega}$ and Abstract
Elementary Classes, respectively. This presentation is accomplished by
analyzing dense subsets that are closed under functions. We extend this
correspondence to types and saturation.
