The Kerr-Newman metric describes a very special rotating, charged mass and is
the most general of the asymptotically flat stationary 'black hole' solutions
to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of general relativity. We review the
derivation of this metric from the Reissner-Nordstrom solution by means of a
complex transformation algorithm and provide a brief overview of its basic
geometric properties. We also include some discussion of interpretive issues,
related metrics, and higher-dimensional analogues.
