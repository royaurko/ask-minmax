We study the set of volumes of constant scalar curvature one metrics on an
atoroidal three-manifold.The infinum of this set is believed to be attained at
a hyperbolic metric. We prove that the supremum of this set is always
infinity. The technique is: minimal surfaces, Thurston norm in homology and new
conformal invariants.
