Using the Sasakian join construction with homology 3-spheres, we give a
countably infinite number of examples of Sasakian manifolds with perfect
fundamental group in all odd dimensions greater than 1. These have extremal
Sasaki metrics with constant scalar curvature. Moreover, we present further
examples of both Sasaki-Einstein and Sasaki-$\eta$-Einstein metrics.
