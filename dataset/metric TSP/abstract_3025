In this paper we study geometries on the manifold of curves.
  We define a manifold $M$ where objects $c\in M$ are curves, which we
parameterize as $c:S^1\to \real^n$ ($n\ge 2$, $S^1$ is the circle). Given a
curve $c$, we define the tangent space $T_cM$ of $M$ at $c$ including in it all
deformations $h:S^1\to\real^n$ of $c$.
  We discuss Riemannian and Finsler metrics $F(c,h)$ on this manifold $M$, and
in particular the case of the geometric $H^0$ metric $F(c,h)=\int |h|^2ds$ of
normal deformations $h$ of $c$; we study the existence of minimal geodesics of
$H^0$ under constraints; we moreover propose a conformal version of the $H^0$
metric.
