Let $G$ be a semidirect product of a simply connected nilpotent Lie group and
$\R$. For a left invariant control system on $G$ with a convex cone as a
control domain, it is proved that the attainable sets coincides with a
"halfspace" if the degree of contact of the with some special subspaces is
sufficiently high.
