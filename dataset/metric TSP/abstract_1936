The intimate link between complex geometry and the problem of the pre-metric
formulation of electromagnetism is explored. In particular, the relationship
between 3+1 decompositions of R4 and the decompositions of the vector space of
bivectors over R4 into real and imaginary subspaces relative to a choice of
complex structure is emphasized. The role of the various scalar products on the
space of bivectors that are defined in terms of a volume element on R4 and a
complex structure on the space of bivectors that makes it C-linear isomorphic
to C3 is discussed in the context of formulation of a theory of
electromagnetism in which the Lorentzian metric on spacetime follows as a
consequence of the existence of electromagnetic waves, not a prior assumption.
