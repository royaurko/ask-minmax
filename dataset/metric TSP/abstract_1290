Of concern is the study of fractional order Sobolev--type metrics on the
group of $H^{\infty}$-diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and on its Sobolev
completions $\mathcal{D}^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. It is shown that the
$H^{s}$-Sobolev metric induces a strong and smooth Riemannian metric on the
Banach manifolds $\mathcal{D}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ for $s >1 + \frac{d}{2}$. As
a consequence a global well-posedness result of the corresponding geodesic
equations, both on the Banach manifold $\mathcal{D}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ and on
the smooth regular Fr\'echet-Lie group of all $H^{\infty}$-diffeomorphisms is
obtained. In addition a local existence result for the geodesic equation for
metrics of order $\frac{1}{2} \leq s < 1 + d/2$ is derived.
