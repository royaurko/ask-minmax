We construct geodesics in the Wasserstein space of probability measure along
which all the measures have an upper bound on their density that is determined
by the densities of the endpoints of the geodesic. Using these geodesics we
show that a local Poincar\'e inequality and the measure contraction property
follow from the Ricci curvature bounds defined by Sturm. We also show for a
large class of convex functionals that a local Poincar\'e inequality is implied
by the weak displacement convexity of the functional.
