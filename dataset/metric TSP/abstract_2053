We show that the probabilistic distribution over the space in the spectator
world, can be associated via noncommutative geometry (with some modifications)
to a metric in which the particle lives. According to this geometrical view,
the metric in the particle world is ``contracted'' or ``stretched'' in an
inverse proportion to the probability distribution.
