The metric space-time is revised as a priori existing. It is substituted by
the world continuum endowed only with the affine connection. The metric,
accompanied by the tensor Goldstone boson, is to emerge during the spontaneous
breaking of the global affine symmetry. Implications for gravity and the
Universe are indicated.
