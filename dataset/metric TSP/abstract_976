We transpose the theory of rank metric and Gabidulin codes to the case of
fields of characteristic zero. The Frobenius automorphism is then replaced by
any element of the Galois group. We derive some conditions on the automorphism
to be able to easily transpose the results obtained by Gabidulin as well and a
classical polynomial-time decoding algorithm. We also provide various
definitions for the rank-metric.
