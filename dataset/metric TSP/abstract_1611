Recently there has been developed a reformulation of General Relativity -
referred to as {\it the null surface version of GR} - where instead of the
metric field as the basic variable of the theory, families of three-surfaces in
a four-manifold become basic. From these surfaces themselves, a conformal
metric, conformal to an Einstein metric, can be constructed. A choice of
conformal factor turns them into Einstein metrics. The surfaces are then
automatically characteristic surfaces of this metric. In the present paper we
explore the linearization of this {\it null surface theory} and compare it with
the standard linear GR. This allows a better understanding of many of the
subtle mathematical issues and sheds light on some of the obscure points of the
null surface theory. It furthermore permits a very simple solution generating
scheme for the linear theory and the beginning of a perturbation scheme for the
full theory.
