The objective of this work is to present the effects of a nonminimally
coupled model of gravity on a Solar System short range regime. For this reason,
this study is only valid when the cosmological contribution is considered
irrelevant. The action functional of the model involves two functions $f^1(R)$
and $f^2(R)$ of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$, where the last one multiplies
the matter Lagrangian.
  Using a Taylor expansion around $R=0$ for both functions $f^1(R)$ and
$f^2(R)$, it was found that the metric around a spherical object is a
perturbation of the weak-field Schwarzschild metric. The $tt$ component of the
metric, a Newtonian plus a Yukawa perturbation term, is constrained using the
available observational results.
  First it is shown that this effect is null when the characteristic mass
scales of each function $f^1(R)$ and $f^2(R)$ are identical. Besides, the
conclusion is that the nonminimal coupling only affects the Yukawa contribution
strength and not its range and that the Starobinsky model for inflation is not
experimentally constrained. Moreover, the geodetic precession effect, obtained
also from the radial perturbation of the metric, reveals to be of no relevance
for the constraints.
