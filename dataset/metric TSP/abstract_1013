We prove metric differentiation for differentiability spaces in the sense of
Cheeger. As corollaries we give a new proof that the minimal generalized upper
gradient coincides with the pointwise Lipschitz constant for Lipschitz
functions on PI spaces, a proof that the Lip-lip constant of any Lip-lip space
in the sense of Keith is equal to $1$, and new nonembeddability results.
