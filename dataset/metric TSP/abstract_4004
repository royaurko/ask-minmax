We calculate the leading weak-coupling instanton contribution to the
moduli-space metric of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group
SU(2) compactified on R^3 x S^1. The results are in precise agreement with the
semiclassical expansion of the exact metric recently conjectured by Gaiotto,
Moore and Neitzke based on considerations related to wall-crossing in the
corresponding four-dimensional theory.
