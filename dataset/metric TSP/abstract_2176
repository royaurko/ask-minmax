The three-dimensional Heisenberg group $H_3$ has three left-invariant Lorentz
metrics $g_1$, $g_2$ and $g_3$. They are not isometric each other. In this
paper, we characterize the left-invariant Lorentzian metric $g_1$ as a Lorentz
Ricci soliton. This Ricci soliton $g_1$ is a shrinking non-gradient Ricci
soliton. Likewise we prove that the isometry group of flat Euclid plane E(2)
and the isometry group of flat Lorentz plane E(1,1) have Lorentz Ricci
solitons.
