We obtain an infinite number of soliton solutions to the the five-dimensional
stationary Einstein equation with axial symmetry by using the inverse
scattering method. We start with the five-dimensional Minkowski space as a seed
metric to obtain these solutions. The solutions are characterized by two
soliton numbers and a constant appearing in the normalization factor related to
a coordinate condition. We show that the (2,0)-soliton solution is identical to
the Myers-Perry solution with one angular momentum by imposing a condition
between parameters. We also show that the (2,2)-soliton solution is different
from the black ring solution discovered by Emparan and Reall, although one
component of the metric of two metrics can be identical.
