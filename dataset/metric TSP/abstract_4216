In this survey article we review several results on the curvature of
semi-Riemannian metrics which are motivated by the positive mass theorem. The
main themes are estimates of the Riemann tensor of an asymptotically flat
manifold and the construction of Lorentzian metrics which satisfy the dominant
energy condition.
