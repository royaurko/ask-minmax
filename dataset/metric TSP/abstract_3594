We show that for general relativity in odd spacetime dimensions greater than
4, all components of the unphysical Weyl tensor for arbitrary smooth, compact
spatial support perturbations of Minkowski spacetime fail to be smooth at null
infinity at leading nonvanishing order. This implies that for nearly flat
radiating spacetimes, the non-smoothness of the unphysical metric at null
infinity manifests itself at the same order as it describes deviations from
flatness of the physical metric. Therefore, in odd spacetime dimensions, it
does not appear that conformal null infinity can be in any way useful for
describing radiation.
