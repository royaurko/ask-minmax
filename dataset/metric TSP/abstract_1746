Let L be a line bundle over a compact complex manifold X (possibly
non-Kahler) and denote by h_{L} and h_{X} fixed Hermitian metrics on L and TX,
respectively. We generalize the asymptotics for the induced Quillen metric on
the determinant line associated to a higher tensor power of L to the non-Kahler
setting. In the case when L is ample we also obtain the leading asymptotics for
the Ray-Singer analytic torsion of a (possbly non-positively curved) metric on
L, without assuming h_{X} is K\"ahler. The key point of the proofs is to relate
the asymptotics of the torsions above to "tunneling", i.e. to the distribution
of the exponentially small eigenvalues of the corresponding Dolbeault-Kodaira
Laplacians. The proof thus avoids the use of the exact (i.e. non-asymptotic)
deep results of Bismut-Gillet-Soul\'e for the Quillen metric, which are only
known to hold under the assumption that h_{X} be Kahler. Accordingly the proofs
are comparatively simple also in the Kahler case. A brief comparison with the
tunneling effect for Witten Laplacians and large deviation principles for
fermions is also made.
