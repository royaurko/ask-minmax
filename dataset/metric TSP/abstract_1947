In a very well-known paper, Virbhadra's research group proved that the
Weinberg, Papapetrou, Landau and Lifshitz, and Einstein energy-momentum
complexes ``coincide'' for all metrics of Kerr-Schild class. A few years later,
Virbhadra clarified that this ``coincidence'' in fact holds for metrics more
general than the Kerr-Schild class. In the present paper, this study is
extended for the Bergmann-Thomson complex and it is proved that this complex
also ``coincides'' with those complexes for a more general than the Kerr-Schild
class metric.
