In this paper we prove that the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics for a
degeneration family of K\"{a}hler manifolds with ample canonical bundles
Gromov-Hausdorff converge to the complete K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric on the
smooth part of the central fiber when the central fiber has only normal
crossing singularities inside smooth total space. We also prove the
incompleteness of the Weil-Peterson metric in this case.
