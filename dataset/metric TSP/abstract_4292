We show the equivalence of several characterizations of relative
hyperbolicity for metric spaces, and obtain extra information about geodesics
in a relatively hyperbolic space.
  We apply this to characterize hyperbolically embedded subgroups in terms of
nice actions on (relatively) hyperbolic spaces. We also study the divergence of
(properly) relatively hyperbolic groups, in particular showing that it is at
least exponential.
  Our main tool is the generalization of a result proved by Bowditch for
hyperbolic spaces: if a family of paths in a space satisfies a list of
properties specific to geodesics in a relatively hyperbolic space then the
space is relatively hyperbolic and the paths are close to geodesics.
