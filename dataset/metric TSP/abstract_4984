The natural extension of Schwarzschild metric to the case of nonzero
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ known as the Kottler metric is considered and
it is discussed under what circumstances the given metric could describe the
Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a medium with nonzero energy density.
Under the latter situation such an object might carry topologically
inequivalent configurations of various fields. The given possibility is
analysed for complex scalar field and it is shown that the mentioned
configurations might be tied with natural presence of Dirac monopoles on black
hole under consideration. In turn, this could markedly modify the Hawking
radiation process.
