We extend the classical Feferman-Vaught theorem to the logic for metric
structures. This implies that the reduced powers of elementarily equivalent
structures are elementarily equivalent, and therefore they are isomorphic under
the Continuum Hypothesis. We also prove the existence of two separable
C*-algebras of the form $\bigoplus_i M_{k(i)}(\mathbb{C})$ such that the
assertion that their coronas are isomorphic is independent from ZFC, which
gives the first example of genuinely non-commutative coronas of separable
C*-algebras with this property.
