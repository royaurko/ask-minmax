We explicitly parameterise the framed moduli space of circle-invariant
1-instantons on the 4-sphere, and compute its $L^2$ metric. With our definition
of framing, this moduli space is four dimensional and its metric is $SO(3)
\times U(1)$ symmetric. We study the behaviour of generic geodesics and show
that the metric is geodesically incomplete. Circle-invariant instantons on the
4-sphere can also be viewed as hyperbolic monopoles, and we interpret our
results from this viewpoint. We relate our results to work by Habermann on
unframed instantons on the 4-sphere and, in the limit where the radius of the
4-sphere tends to infinity, to results on instantons on Euclidean 4-space.
