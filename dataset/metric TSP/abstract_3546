The physical meaning of the Levi-Civita spacetime for some "critical" values
of the parameter sigma, is discussed in the light of gedanken experiments
performed with gyroscopes circumventing the axis of symmetry. The fact that
sigma=1/2 corresponds to flat space described from the point of view of an
accelerated frame of reference, led us to incorporate the C metric into
discussion. The interpretation of phi as an angle variable for any value of
sigma, appears to be at the origen of difficulties.
