We consider smoothings of a complex surface with singularities of class T and
no nontrivial holomorphic vector field. Under an hypothesis of non degeneracy
of the smoothing at each singular point, we prove that if the singular surface
admits an extremal metric, then the smoothings also admit extremal metrics in
nearby K\"ahler classes.
  In addition, we construct small Lagrangian stationary spheres which represent
Lagrangian vanishing cycles for surfaces close to the singular one.
