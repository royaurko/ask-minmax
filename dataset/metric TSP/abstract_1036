The metrics of gravitational shock waves for a Schwarzschild black hole in
ordinary coordinates and for a Kerr black hole in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
are derived. The Kerr metric is discussed for two cases: the case of a Kerr
black hole moving parallel to the rotational axis, and moving perpendicular to
the rotational axis. Then, two properties from the derived metrics are
investigated: the shift of a null coordinate and the refraction angle crossing
the gravitational shock wave. Astrophysical applications for these metrics are
discussed in short.
