The Hessian of either the entropy or the energy function can be regarded as a
metric on a Gibbs surface. For two parameter families of asymptotically flat
black holes in arbitrary dimension one or the other of these metrics are flat,
and the state space is a flat wedge. The mathematical reason for this is traced
back to the scale invariance of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. The picture of
state space that we obtain makes some properties such as the occurence of
divergent specific heats transparent.
