The coupling of the Higgs field through the Ricci tensor, put forward by
Balakrishna and Wali, is derived using a conformal rescaling of the metric.
Earlier results on "Bogomolny-type" equations in curved space, by Comtet, and
others, are recovered. The procedure can be generalized to any static
background metric.
