The unique spherically symmetric metric which has vanishing weyl tensor, is
asymptotically desitter, and can model constant galactic rotation curves is
presented. Two types of field equations are shown to have this metric as an
exact solution. The first is palatini varied scalar-tensor theory. The second
is the low energy limit of string theory modified by inclusion of a contrived
potential.
