Spacetimes which are conformally related to reducible 1+3 spacetimes are
considered. We classify these spacetimes according to the conformal algebra of
the underlying reducible spacetime, giving in each case canonical expressions
for the metric and conformal Killing vectors, and provide physically meaningful
examples.
