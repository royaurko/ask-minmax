We prove that the Hodge metric completion of the Teichm\"uller space of
polarized and marked Calabi-Yau manifolds is a complex affine manifold. We also
show that the extended period map from the completion space is injective into
the period domain, and that the completion space is a domain of holomorphy and
admits a complete K\"ahler-Einstein metric.
