This note will present a new proof of the fact that every uniformly bounded
group of invertible elements in a finite von Neumann algebra is similar to a
unitary group. The proof involves metric geometric arguments in the
non-positively curved space of positive invertible operators of the algebra; in
1974 Vasilescu and Zsido proved this result using the Ryll-Nardzewsky fixed
point theorem.
