Page's Einstein metric on CP_2 # (-CP_2) is conformally related to an
extremal Kaehler metric. Here we construct a family of conformally K\"ahler
solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations that deforms the Page metric, while
sweeping out the entire Kaehler cone of CP_2 # (-CP_2).The same method also
yields analogous solutions on every Hirzebruch surface. This allows us to
display infinitely many geometrically distinct families of solutions of the
Einstein-Maxwell equations on the smooth 4-manifolds S^2 x S^2 and CP_2 #
(-CP_2).
