We study a quasisymmetric version of the classical Koebe uniformization
theorem in the context of Ahlfors regular metric surfaces. In particular, we
prove that an Ahlfors 2-regular metric surface X homeomorphic to a finitely
connected domain in the standard 2-sphere is quasisymmetrically equivalent to a
circle domain if and only if X is linearly locally connected and its completion
is compact. We also give a counterexample in the countably connected case.
