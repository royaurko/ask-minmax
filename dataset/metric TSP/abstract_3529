A global solution of the Einstein equations is given, consisting of a perfect
fluid interior and a vacuum exterior. The rigidly rotating and incompressible
perfect fluid is matched along the hypersurface of vanishing pressure with the
stationary part of the Taub-NUT metric. The fluid core generates a
negative-mass NUT space-time. The matching procedure leaves one parameter in
the global solution.
