We study the problem of non-explosion of diffusion processes on a manifold
with time-dependent Riemannian metric. In particular we obtain that Brownian
motion cannot explode in finite time if the metric evolves under backwards
Ricci flow. Our result makes it possible to remove the assumption of
non-explosion in the pathwise contraction result established by Arnaudon,
Coulibaly and Thalmaier (arXiv:0904.2762, to appear in Sem. Prob.).
  As an important tool which is of independent interest we derive an Ito
formula for the distance from a fixed reference point, generalising a result of
Kendall (Ann. Prob. 15 (1987), 1491--1500).
