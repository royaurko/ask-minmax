We study the behaviour of families of Ricci-flat Kahler metrics on a
projective Calabi-Yau manifold when the Kahler classes degenerate to the
boundary of the ample cone. We prove that if the limit class is big and nef the
Ricci-flat metrics converge smoothly on compact sets outside a subvariety to a
limit incomplete Ricci-flat metric. The limit can also be understood from
algebraic geometry.
