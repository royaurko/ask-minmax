In this paper we find the first and second order perturbations of the induced
metric and the extrinsic curvature of a non-degenerate hypersurface $\Sigma$ in
a spacetime $(M,g)$, when the metric $g$ is perturbed arbitrarily to second
order and the hypersurface itself is allowed to change perturbatively (i.e. to
move within spacetime) also to second order. The results are fully general and
hold in arbitrary dimensions and signature. An application of these results for
the perturbed matching theory between spacetimes is presented.
