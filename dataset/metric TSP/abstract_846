Hasegawa and Petz introduced the notion of dual statistically monotone
metrics. They also gave a characterisation theorem showing that
Wigner-Yanase-Dyson metrics are the only members of the dual family. In this
paper we show that the characterisation theorem holds true under more general
hypotheses.
