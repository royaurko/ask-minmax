Let $(X,d)$ be a complete, pathwise connected metric measure space with
locally Ahlfors $Q$-regular measure $\mu$, where $Q>1$. Suppose that
$(X,d,\mu)$ supports a (local) $(1,2)$-Poincar\'e inequality and a suitable
curvature lower bound. For the Poisson equation $\Delta u=f$ on $(X,d,\mu)$,
Moser-Trudinger and Sobolev inequalities are established for the gradient of
$u$. The local H\"older continuity with optimal exponent of solutions is
obtained.
