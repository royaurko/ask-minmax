Spherically symmetric static solutions of the Einstein equations with a
positive cosmological constant for the energy-momentum tensor of a barotropic
perfect fluid are governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff-de Sitter
equation. Existence and regularity at the vacuum boundary of the solutions with
finite radii are investigated. The interior metric of the solution is connected
with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric on the vacuum region.
