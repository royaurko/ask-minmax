The metric around a wiggly cosmic string is calculated in the linear
approximation of Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation. The equations of motion for
relativistic and non-relativistic particles in this metric are obtained.
 Light propagation is also studied and it is shown that photon trajectories can
be bounded.
