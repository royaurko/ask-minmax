The principle part of Einstein equations in the harmonic gauge consists of a
constrained system of 10 curved space wave equations for the components of the
space-time metric. A well-posed initial boundary value problem based upon a new
formulation of constraint-preserving boundary conditions of the Sommerfeld type
has recently been established for such systems. In this paper these boundary
conditions are recast in a geometric form. This serves as a first step toward
their application to other metric formulations of Einstein's equations.
