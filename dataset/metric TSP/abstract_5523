A theorem by Mumford implies that every automorphic line bundle on a pure
open Shimura variety, equipped with an invariant smooth metric, can be uniquely
extended as a line bundle on a toroidal compactification of the variety, in
such a way that the metric acquires only logarithmic singularities. This result
is the key of being able to compute arithmetic intersection numbers from these
line bundles. Hence it is natural to ask whether Mumford's result remains valid
for line bundles on mixed Shimura varieties.
  In this paper we examine the simplest case, namely the sheaf of Jacobi forms
on the universal elliptic curve. We show that Mumford's result cannot be
extended directly to this case and that a new interesting kind of singularities
appears.
  By using the theory of b-divisors, we show that an analogue of Mumford's
extension theorem can be obtained. We also show that this extension is
meaningful because it satisfies Chern-Weil theory and a Hilbert-Samuel type of
formula.
