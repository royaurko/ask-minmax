Let $p$ be a real number greater than one and let $X$ be a locally compact,
noncompact metric measure space that satisfies certain conditions. The
$p$-Royden and $p$-harmonic boundaries of $X$ are constructed by using the
$p$-Royden algebra of functions on $X$ and a Dirichlet type problem is solved
for the $p$-Royden boundary. We also characterize the metric measure spaces
whose $p$-harmonic boundary is empty.
