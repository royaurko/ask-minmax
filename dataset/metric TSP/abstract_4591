A simple metric can be used to determine whether a planet or exoplanet can
clear its orbital zone during a characteristic time scale, such as the lifetime
of the host star on the main sequence. This criterion requires only estimates
of star mass, planet mass, and orbital period, making it possible to
immediately classify 99% of all known exoplanets. All 8 planets and all
classifiable exoplanets satisfy the criterion. This metric may be useful in
generalizing and simplifying the definition of a planet.
