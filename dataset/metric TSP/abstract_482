The equivalence of a conformal metric on 4-dimensional space-time and a local
field of 3-dimensional subspaces of the space of 2-forms over space-time is
discussed and the basic notion of transection is introduced. Corresponding
relation is spread to the metric case in terms of notion of normalized ordered
oriented transection field. As a result, one obtains a possibility to handle
the metric geometry without any references to the metric tensor itself on a
distinct base which nevertheless contains all the information on metricity.
Moreover, the notion of space-time curvature is provided with its natural
counterpart in the transection `language' in a form of curvature endomorphism
as well. To globalize the local constructions introduced, a certain fiber
bundle is defined whose sections are equivalent to normalized ordered oriented
transection fields and locally to the metric tensor on space-time. The
criterion distinguishing the Lorentz geometry is discussed. The resulting
alternative method of the description of space-time metricity, dealing with
exterior forms foliation alone, seems to be of a power compatible with one of
the standard concept based on the metric tensor.
