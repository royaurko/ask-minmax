The metrization of the space of neural responses is an ongoing research
program seeking to find natural ways to describe, in geometrical terms, the
sets of possible activities in the brain. One component of this program are the
{\em spike metrics}, notions of distance between two spike trains recorded from
a neuron. Alignment spike metrics work by identifying "equivalent" spikes in
one train and the other. We present an alignment spike metric having
$\mathcal{L}_p$ underlying geometrical structure; the $\mathcal{L}_2$ version
is Euclidean and is suitable for further embedding in Euclidean spaces by
Multidimensional Scaling methods or related procedures. We show how to
implement a fast algorithm for the computation of this metric based on
bipartite graph matching theory.
