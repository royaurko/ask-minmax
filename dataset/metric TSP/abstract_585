By Gromov's compactness theorem for metric spaces, every uniformly compact
sequence of metric spaces admits an isometric embedding into a common compact
metric space in which a subsequence converges with respect to the Hausdorff
distance. Working in the class or oriented $k$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds
(with boundary) and, more generally, integral currents in metric spaces in the
sense of Ambrosio-Kirchheim and replacing the Hausdorff distance with the
filling volume or flat distance, we prove an analogous compactness theorem in
which we replace uniform compactness of the sequence with uniform bounds on
volume and diameter.
