We show existence of unique smooth solutions to the Monge-Ampere equation for
(n-1)-plurisubharmonic functions on Hermitian manifolds, generalizing previous
work of the contributors. As a consequence we obtain Calabi-Yau theorems for
Gauduchon and strongly Gauduchon metrics on a class of non-Kahler manifolds:
those satisfying the Jost-Yau condition known as Astheno-Kahler.
  Gauduchon conjectured in 1984 that a Calabi-Yau theorem for Gauduchon metrics
holds on all compact complex manifolds. We discuss another Monge-Ampere
equation, recently introduced by Popovici, and show that the full Gauduchon
conjecture can be reduced to a second order estimate of Hou-Ma-Wu type.
