We give a characterization of conformal classes realizing a compact
manifold's Yamabe invariant. This characterization is the analogue of an
observation of Nadirashvili for metrics realizing the maximal first eigenvalue,
and of Fraser and Schoen for metrics realizing the maximal first Steklov
eigenvalue.
