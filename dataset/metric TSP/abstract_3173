Higher derivative scalar field theories have received considerable attention
for the potentially explanations of the initial state of the universe or the
current cosmic acceleration which they might offer. They have also attracted
many interests in the phenomenological studies of infrared modifications of
gravity. These theories are mostly studied by the metric variational approach
in which only the metric is the fundamental field to account for the
gravitation. In this paper we study the higher derivative scalar fields with
the metric-affine formalism where the connections are treated arbitrarily at
the beginning. Because the higher derivative scalar fields couple to the
connections directly in a covariant theory these two formalisms will lead to
different results. These differences are suppressed by the powers of the Planck
mass and are usually expected to have small effects. But in some cases they may
cause non-negligible deviations. We show by a higher derivative dark energy
model that the two formalisms lead to significantly different pictures of the
future universe.
