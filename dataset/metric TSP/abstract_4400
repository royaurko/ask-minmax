Voting power determines the "power" of individuals who cast votes; their
power is based on their ability to influence the winning-ness of a coalition.
Usually each individual acts alone, casting either all or none of their votes
and is equally likely to do either. This paper extends this standard "random
voting" model to allow probabilistic voting, partial voting, and correlated
team voting. We extend the standard Banzhaf metric to account for these cases;
our generalization reduces to the standard metric under "random voting", This
new paradigm allows us to answer questions such as "In the 2013 US Senate, how
much more unified would the Republicans have to be in order to have the same
power as the Democrats in attaining cloture?"
