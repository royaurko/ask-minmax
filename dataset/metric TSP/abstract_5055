We study the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations in a 6-dimensional space-time. We
make a self-consistent static, spherically symmetric ansatz for the gauge
fields and the metric. The metric of the manifold associated with the two extra
dimensions contains off-diagonal terms. The classical equations are solved
numerically and several branches of solutions are constructed. We also present
an effective 4-dimensional action from which the equations can equally well be
derived. This action is a standard Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory extended by
three scalar fields. Two of the scalar fields are interpreted as dilatons,
while the one associated with the off-diagonal term of the metric induces very
specific interactions.
