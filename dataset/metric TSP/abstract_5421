In the practice of information extraction, the input data are usually
arranged into pattern matrices, and analyzed by the methods of linear algebra
and statistics, such as principal component analysis. In some applications, the
tacit assumptions of these methods lead to wrong results. The usual reason is
that the matrix composition of linear algebra presents information as flowing
in waves, whereas it sometimes flows in particles, which seek the shortest
paths. This wave-particle duality in computation and information processing has
been originally observed by Abramsky. In this paper we pursue a particle view
of information, formalized in *distance spaces*, which generalize metric
spaces, but are slightly less general than Lawvere's *generalized metric
spaces*. In this framework, the task of extracting the 'principal components'
from a given matrix of data boils down to a bicompletio}, in the sense of
enriched category theory. We describe the bicompletion construction for
distance matrices. The practical goal that motivates this research is to
develop a method to estimate the hardness of attack constructions in security.
