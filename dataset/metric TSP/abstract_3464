We develop a general perturbative analysis on vacuum spacetimes which can be
constructed by generating manifolds of revolution around a curve, and apply it
to the Schwarzschild metric. The following different perturbations are carried
out separately: 1) Non-rotating 2-spheres are added along a plane curve
slightly deviated from the "Schwarzschild line"; 2) General non-rotating
topological 2-spheres are added along the "Schwarzschild line" 3) Slow-rotating
2-spheres are added along the "Schwarzschild line". For (1), we obtain the
first order vacuum solution and show that no higher order solution exists. This
linearised vacuum solution turns out however to be just a gauge transformation
of the Schwarzschild metric. For (2), we solve the general linearised vacuum
equations under several special cases. In particular, there exist linearised
vacuum solutions with signature-changing metrics (though these do not
correspond to adding topological 2-spheres). For (3), we find that the first
order vacuum solution is equivalent to the slowly rotating Kerr metric. This is
hence a much simpler and geometrically insightful derivation as compared to the
gravitomagnetic one, where this rotating-shells construction is a direct
manifestation of the frame-dragging phenomenon. We also show that the full Kerr
however, cannot be obtained via adding rotating ellipsoids.
