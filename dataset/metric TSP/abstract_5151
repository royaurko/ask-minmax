We demonstrate a systematic implementation of coupling between a scalar field
and the geometry of the space (curve, surface, etc.) which carries the field.
This naturally gives rise to a feedback mechanism between the field and the
geometry. We develop a systematic model for the feedback in a general form,
inspired by a specific implementation in the context of molecular dynamics (the
so-called Rahman-Parrinello molecular dynamics, or RP-MD). We use a generalized
Lagrangian that allows for the coupling of the space's metric tensor (the first
fundamental form) to the scalar field, and add terms motivated by RP-MD. We
present two implementations of the scheme: one in which the metric is only
time-dependent [which gives rise to ordinary differential equation (ODE) for
its temporal evolution], and one with spatio-temporal dependence [wherein the
metric's evolution is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE)].
Numerical results are reported for the (1+1)-dimensional model with a
nonlinearity of the sine-Gordon type.
