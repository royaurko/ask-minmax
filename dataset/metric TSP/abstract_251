In a recent paper Donaldson explains how to use an older construction of
Joyce to obtain four dimensional local models for scalar-flat Kahler metrics
with a 2-torus symmetry. Using this idea, he recovers and generalizes the
Taub-NUT metric by including it in a new family of complete scalar-flat toric
Kahler metrics. In this paper we generalize Donaldson's method and construct
complete scalar-flat toric Kahler metrics on any symplectic toric 4-manifold
with "strictly unbounded" moment polygon. These include the asymptotic locally
Euclidean scalar-flat Kahler metrics previously constructed by Calderbank and
Singer, as well as new examples of complete scalar-flat toric Kahler metrics
which are asymptotic to Donaldson's generalized Taub-NUT metrics. Our
construction is in symplectic action-angle coordinates and determines all these
metrics via their symplectic potentials. When the first Chern class is zero we
obtain a new description of known Ricci-flat Kahler metrics.
