The quasi-isotropic expansion for a simple two-fluid cosmological model,
including radiation and stringy gas is constructed. The first non-trivial order
expressions for the metric coefficients, energy densities and velocities are
explicitly written down. Their small and large time asymptotics are studied. It
is found that the large time asymptotic for the anisotropic component of the
metric coefficients grows faster than that of the isotropic
(trace-proportional) component.
