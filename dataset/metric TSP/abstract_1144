We prove that every Riemannian metric on the 2-disc such that all its
geodesics are minimal, is a minimal filling of its boundary (within the class
of fillings homeomorphic to the disc). This improves an earlier result of the
contributor by removing the assumption that the boundary is convex. More generally,
we prove this result for Finsler metrics with area defined as the
two-dimensional Holmes-Thompson volume. This implies a generalization of Pu's
isosystolic inequality to Finsler metrics, both for Holmes-Thompson and
Busemann definitions of Finsler area.
