The discovery of scale acceleration evidenced from supernovae luminosities
and spatial flatness of feature evolution in the cosmic microwave background
presents a challenge to the understanding of the evolution of cosmological
vacuum energy. Although some scenarios prefer a fixed cosmological constant
with dynamics governed in a Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry, an early
inflationary epoch remains a popular model for cosmology. It is therefore
advantageous to develop a metric framework that allows a transition from an
early inflationary period to a late stage dominated by dark energy. Such a
metric is here developed, and some properties of this metric are explored.
