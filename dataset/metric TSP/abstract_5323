In this article, we review briefly recent progress made in realizing
local(ized around a mobile space-time filling D3-brane in) D3/D7 mu-Split
Supersymmetry in (the large volume limit of Type IIB) String Theory
(compactified on Swiss-Cheese Calabi-Yau orientifolds) as well as obtaining a
125 GeV (light) Higgs in the same set up. We also discuss obtaining the
geometric Kaehler potential (and hence the Ricci-Flat metric) for the
Swiss-Cheese Calabi-Yau in the large volume limit using the Donaldson's
algorithm and intuition from GLSM-based calculations - we present new results
for Swiss-Cheese Calabi-Yau (used in the set up) metrics at points finitely
away from the "big" divisor.
