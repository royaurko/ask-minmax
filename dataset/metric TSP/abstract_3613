This paper has been addressed to a very old but burning problem of energy in
General Relativity. We evaluate energy and momentum densities for the static
and axisymmetric solutions. This specializes to two metrics, i.e., Erez-Rosen
and the gamma metrics, belonging to the Weyl class. We apply four well-known
prescriptions of Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Papaterou and M$\ddot{o}$ller to
compute energy-momentum density components. We obtain that these prescriptions
do not provide similar energy density, however momentum becomes constant in
each case. The results can be matched under particular boundary conditions.
