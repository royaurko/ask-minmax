We have investigated the vacuum maximally symmetric solutions of recently
proposed density-metric unimodular gravity theory,the results are widely
different from inflationary senario.The exponential dependence on time in
deSitter space is substiuted by a power law. Open space-times with non-zero
cosmological constant are excluded in this theory
