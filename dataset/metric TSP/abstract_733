The hyperbolic metric for the punctured unit disc in the Euclidean plane is
singular at the origin. A renormalization of the metric at the origin is
provided by the Euclidean metric. For Riemann surfaces there is a unique germ
for the isometry class of a complete hyperbolic metric at a cusp. The
renormalization for the punctured unit disc provides a renormalization for a
hyperbolic metric at a cusp. For a holomorphic family of punctured Riemann
surfaces the family of (co)tangent spaces along a puncture defines a
tautological holomorphic line bundle over the base of the family. The Hermitian
connection and Chern form for the renormalized metric are determined.
Connections to the work of M. Mirzakhani, L. Takhtajan and P. Zograf, and
intersection numbers for the moduli space of punctured Riemann surfaces studied
by E. Witten are presented.
