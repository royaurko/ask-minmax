While POMDPs provide a general platform for non-deterministic conditional
planning under a variety of quality metrics they have limited scalability. On
the other hand, non-deterministic conditional planners scale very well, but
many lack the ability to optimize plan quality metrics. We present a novel
generalization of planning graph based heuristics that helps conditional
planners both scale and generate high quality plans when using actions with
nonuniform costs. We make empirical comparisons with two state of the art
planners to show the benefit of our techniques.
