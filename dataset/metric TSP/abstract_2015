The structure of a Frobenius manifold encodes the geometry associated with a
flat pencil of metrics. However, as shown in the contributors' earlier work, much of
the structure comes from the compatibility properties of the pencil rather than
from the flatness of the pencil itself. In this paper conformally flat pencils
of metrics are studied and examples, based on a modification of the Saito
construction, are studied.
