We provide a new and elementary proof for the structure of geodesics in the
Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$. The proof is based on an adaptation of
Hurwitz's proof of the isoperimetric inequality in $\mathbb{R}^2$ using Fourier
series. We also prove that the Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric is real analytic
away from the center of the group.
