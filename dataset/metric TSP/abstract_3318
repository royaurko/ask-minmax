We consider a complex scalar field in background metrics that exhibit
frame-dragging, in particular the BTZ metric in 2+1 dimensional spacetime, and
the Kerr metric in 3+1 dimensional spacetime. In the equation of motion for the
scalar field, which is a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, we identify and
isolate the terms arising from frame-dragging that correspond to the Coriolis
force and the centrifugal force, which produce local rotation in the field. The
field physically describes a superfluid, which can rotate only through the
creation of quantized vortices. We demonstrate such vortex creation through
numerical simulation of a simplified metric that exhibits frame-dragging.
