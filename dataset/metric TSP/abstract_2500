Three numerical coverage metrics for the symbolic simulation of dense-time
systems and their estimation methods are presented. Special techniques to
derive numerical estimations of dense-time state-spaces have also been
developed. Properties of the metrics are also discussed with respect to four
criteria. Implementation and experiments are then reported.
