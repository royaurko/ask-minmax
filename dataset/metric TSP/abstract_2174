This paper is concerned with the existence of constant scalar curvature
Kaehler metrics on blow ups at finitely many points of compact manifolds which
already carry constant scalar curvature Kaehler metrics. We also consider the
desingularization of isolated quotient singularities of compact orbifolds which
already carry constant scalar curvature Kaehler metrics.
