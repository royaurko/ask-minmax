We perform a detailed numerical investigation of the approximate moduli space
metric proposed by Diakonov and Petrov [arXiv:0704.3181] for a confining model
of dyons. Our findings strongly indicate that only for a small number of dyons
at sufficiently low density this metric is positive definite - and, therefore,
a valid moduli space metric - throughout a considerable part of configuration
space. This poses strong limitations on results obtained by an unrestricted
integration over collective coordinates in this model. It also indicates that
strong correlations between collective coordinates will be essential for the
physical content of a dyon model, which could be exhibited by a suitable
simulation algorithm.
