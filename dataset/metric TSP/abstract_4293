Gradient Ricci almost solitons were introduced by Pigola, Rigoli, Rimoldi and
Setti. They are defined as solitons except that the metric coefficient is
required to be a smooth function rather than a constant. It is shown that any
almost soliton is conformal to another almost soliton having a soliton function
which is minus the original one. Uniqueness, and the case where both the source
and target are solitons, are studied. Completeness of the target metric is also
examined in the case where the source is K\"ahler and admits a special
K\"ahler-Ricci potential in the sense given by Derdzinski and Maschler.
