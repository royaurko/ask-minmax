We prove that there is a residual subset of the Gromov-Hausdorff space (i.e.
the space of all compact metric spaces up to isometry endowed with the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance) whose points enjoy several unexpected properties. In
particular, they have zero lower box dimension and infinite upper box
dimension.
