We obtain the energy and momentum of the Bianchi type VI_h universes using
different prescriptions for the energy-momentum complexes in the framework of
general relativity. The energy and momentum of the Bianchi VI_h universe are
found to be zero for the parameter h = -1 of the metric. The vanishing of these
results support the conjecture of Tryon that Universe must have a zero net
value for all conserved quantities.This also supports the work of Nathan Rosen
with the Robertson-Walker metric. Moreover, it raises an interesting question:
"Why h=-1 case is so special?"
