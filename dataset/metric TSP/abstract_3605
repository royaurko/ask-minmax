Recently the structure of the Letelier-Gal'tsov spacetime has become a matter
of some controversy. I show that the metric proposed in \cite{letgal} is
defined only on a dense subset of the whole manifold. In the case when it can
be defined on the remainder by continuity, the resulting spacetime corresponds
to a system of parallel cosmic strings at rest w.r.t. each other.
