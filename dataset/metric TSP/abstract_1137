We study an inverse problem for a non-compact Riemannian manifold whose ends
have the following properties : On each end, the Riemannian metric is assumed
to be a short-range perturbation of the metric of the form $(dy)^2 + h(x,dx)$,
$h(x,dx)$ being the metric of some compact manifold of codimension 1. Moreover
one end is exactly cylindrical, i.e. the metric is equal to $(dy)^2 + h(x,dx)$.
Given two such manifolds having the same scattering matrix on that exactly
cylindrical end for all energy, we show that these two manifolds are isometric.
