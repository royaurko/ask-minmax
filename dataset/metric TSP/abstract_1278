We examine phase transition of the Husimi-Temperley model in terms of
information geometry. For this purpose, we introduce the Fisher metric defined
by the density matrix of the model. We find that the metric becomes hyperbolic
at the critical point with respect to the energy scale. Then, the metric is
invariant under the scale transformation. We also find that the equation of
states is naturally derived from a necessary condition for the entropy operator
that is a building block of the metric. Based on these findings, we conclude
that the geometric quantities clearly detect the phase transition of the model.
