We show that the path of any accelerated body in an arbitrary space-time
geometry $g_{\mu\nu}$ can be described as geodesics in a dragged metric
$\hat{q}_{\mu\nu}$ that depends only on the background metric and on the motion
of the body. Such procedure allows the interpretation of all kind of
non-gravitational forces as modifications of the metric of space-time. This
method of effective elimination of the forces by a change of the metric of the
substratum can be understood as a generalization of the d'Alembert principle
applied to all relativistic processes.
