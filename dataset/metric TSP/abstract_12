It is known that the extension complexity of the TSP polytope for the
complete graph $K_n$ is exponential in $n$ even if the subtour inequalities are
excluded. In this article we study the polytopes formed by removing other
subsets $H$ of facet-defining inequalities of the TSP polytope. In particular,
we consider the case when $H$ is either the set of 2-matching inequalities or
the set of simple comb inequalities. These inequalities are routinely used in
cutting plane algorithms for the TSP. We show that the extension complexity
remains exponential even if we exclude these inequalities. In addition we show
that the extension complexity of the polytope formed by all comb inequalities
is exponential. For our proofs, we introduce a subclass of comb inequalities,
called $(h,t)$-uniform comb inequalities, which may be of independent interest
in the study of the TSP.
