The problem of classification of cubic homogeneous Finslerian 3D metrics with
respect to their isometries is considered. It is shown, that there are 6
different general affine types of such metrics. Algebras of isometries are
presented in apparent kind together with their affine-invariant properties.
Interrelation between symmetries and projective classifyings is discussed.
