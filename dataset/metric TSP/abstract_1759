We consider invariant Riemannian metrics on compact homogeneous spaces $G/H$
where an intermediate subgroup $K$ between $G$ and $H$ exists. In this case,
the homogeneous space $G/H$ is the total space of a Riemannian submersion. The
metrics constructed by shrinking the fibers in this way can be interpreted as
metrics obtained from a Cheeger deformation and are thus well known to be
nonnegatively curved. On the other hand, if the fibers are homothetically
enlarged, it depends on the triple of groups $(H,K,G)$ whether nonnegative
curvature is maintained for small deformations.
  Building on the work of L. Schwachh\"ofer and K. Tapp \cite{ST}, we examine
all $G$-invariant fibration metrics on $G/H$ for $G$ a compact simple Lie group
of dimension up to 15. An analysis of the low dimensional examples provides
insight into the algebraic criteria that yield continuous families of
nonnegative sectional curvature.
