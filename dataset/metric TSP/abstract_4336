We show that in any infinitesimally Hilbertian $CD^*(K,N)$-space at almost
every point there exists a Euclidean weak tangent, i.e. there exists a sequence
of dilations of the space that converges to a Euclidean space in the pointed
measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology. The proof follows by considering iterated
tangents and the splitting theorem for infinitesimally Hilbertian
$CD^*(0,N)$-spaces.
