The Urysohn space is a complete separable metric space, universal among
separable metric spaces for extending finite partial isometries into it. We
present an alternative construction of the Urysohn space which enables us to
show that extending isometries can be done in a canonical and continuous way,
and allows us to equip the Urysohn space with algebraic structure. This is
achieved in a constructive setting without assuming any choice principles.
