An electric monopole solution to the equations of Maxwell and Einstein's
general relativity is displayed. It differs from the usual one in that all
components of the metric vanish at large spatial distances from the charge
rather than approaching the Minkowski metric. This enables us to find an
approximate solution to that for many charges.
