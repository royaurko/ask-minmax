It is shown that the existence of an $\omega$-compatible Einstein metric on a
compact symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ imposes certain restrictions on the
symplectic Chern numbers. Examples of symplectic manifolds which do not satisfy
these restrictions are given. The results offer partial support to a conjecture
of Goldberg.
