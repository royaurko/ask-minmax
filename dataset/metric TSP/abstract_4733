Let ${\mathcal X}$ be a doubling metric measure space. If ${\mathcal X}$ has
the $\delta$-annular decay property for some $\delta\in (0,\,1]$, the contributors
then establish the boundedness of the Lusin-area function, which is defined via
kernels modeled on the semigroup generated by the Schr\"odinger operator, from
localized spaces ${\rm BMO}_\rho({\mathcal X})$ to ${\rm BLO}_\rho({\mathcal
X})$ without invoking any regularity of considered kernels. The same is true
for the $g^\ast_\labda$ function and unlike the Lusin-area function, in this
case, ${\mathcal X}$ is not necessary to have the $\delta$-annular decay
property. Moreover, for any metric space, the contributors introduce the weak
geodesic property and the monotone geodesic property, which are proved to be
respectively equivalent to the chain ball property of Buckley. Recall that
Buckley proved that any length space has the chain ball property and, for any
metric space equipped with a doubling measure, the chain ball property implies
the $\delta$-annular decay property for some $\delta\in (0,1]$. Moreover, using
some results on pointwise multipliers of ${\rm bmo}({\mathbb R})$, the contributors
construct a counterexample to show that there exists a nonnegative function
which is in ${\rm bmo}({\mathbb R})$, but not in ${\rm blo}({\mathbb R})$; this
further indicates that the above boundedness of the Lusin-area and
$g^\ast_\lambda$ functions even in ${\mathbb R}^d$ with the Lebesgue measure or
the Heisenberg group also improves the existing results.
