The mobility of a Kaehler metric is the dimension of the space of metrics
with which it is c-projectively equivalent. The mobility is at least two if and
only if the Kaehler metric admits a nontrivial hamiltonian 2-form. After
summarizing this relationship, we present necessary conditions for a Kaehler
metric to have mobility at least three: its curvature must have nontrivial
nullity at every point. Using the local classification of Kaehler metrics with
hamiltonian 2-forms, we describe explicitly the Kaehler metrics with mobility
at least three and hence show that the nullity condition on the curvature is
also sufficient, up to some degenerate exceptions. In an Appendix, we explain
how the classification may be related, generically, to the holonomy of a
complex cone metric.
