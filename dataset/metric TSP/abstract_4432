A geodesic bicombing on a metric space selects for every pair of points a
geodesic connecting them. We prove existence and uniqueness results for
geodesic bicombings satisfying different convexity conditions. In combination
with recent work by the second contributor on injective hulls, this shows that every
word hyperbolic group acts geometrically on a proper, finite dimensional space
X with a unique (hence equivariant) convex geodesic bicombing of the strongest
type. Furthermore, the Gromov boundary of X is a Z-set in the closure of X, and
the latter is a metrizable absolute retract, in analogy with the Bestvina--Mess
theorem on the Rips complex.
