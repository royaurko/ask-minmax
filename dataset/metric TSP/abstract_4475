We consider three-dimensional reshaping of a thin nematoelastic film upon
nematic-isotropic transition in the field of a charge one topological defect,
leading to either cone or anticone (d-cone) shells. The analysis is based on
the relation between the shell metric and the tensor order parameter under the
assumption of no elastic deformation and volume change. The shape of the shell
can be modified by doping, creating cones with curved generatrices. Anticones
necessarily have an even number of radial creases. The curvature singularity at
the apex is resolved due to decay of the nematic order parameter at the defect
core.
