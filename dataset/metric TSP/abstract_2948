We consider a scalar field with a Gauss-Bonnet-type coupling to the curvature
in a curved space-time. For such a quadratic coupling to the curvature, the
metric energy-momentum tensor does not contain derivatives of the metric of
orders greater than two. We obtain the metric energy-momentum tensor and find
the geometric structure of the first three counterterms to the vacuum averages
of the energy-momentum tensor for an arbitrary background metric of an
N-dimensional space-time. In a homogeneous isotropic space, we obtain the first
three counterterms of the n-wave procedure, which allow calculating the
renormalized values of the vacuum averages of the energy-momentum tensors in
the dimensions N=4,5. Using dimensional regularization, we establish that the
geometric structures of the counterterms in the $n$-wave procedure coincide
with those in the effective action method.
