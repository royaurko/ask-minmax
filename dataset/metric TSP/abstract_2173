Brownian motions on a metric graph are defined. Their generators are
characterized as Laplace operators subject to Wentzell boundary at every
vertex. Conversely, given a set of Wentzell boundary conditions at the vertices
of a metric graph, a Brownian motion is constructed pathwise on this graph so
that its generator satisfies the given boundary conditions.
