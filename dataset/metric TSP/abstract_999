We investigate properties of the Hodge metric of a mixed period domain. In
particular, we calculate its curvature and the curvature of the Hodge bundles.
We also consider when the pull back metric via a period map is K\"ahler.
Several applications in cases of geometric interest are given, such as for
normal functions and biextension bundles.
