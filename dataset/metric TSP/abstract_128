Metric currents are, in a certain sense, a metric analogous of flat currents,
therefore are related to the geometry of the space and of their support. In
this short note, we try to give some evidence for the previous statement, by
showing that the homology which can be defined by means of metric normal
currents coincides, on nice enough metric spaces, with the usual singular
homology.
