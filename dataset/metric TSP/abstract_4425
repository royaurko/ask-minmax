The hyperK\"ahler-quaternionic K\"ahler correspondence constructs
quaternionic K\"ahler metrics from hyperK\"ahler metrics with a rotating circle
symmetry. We discuss how this may be interpreted as a combination of the twist
construction with the concept of elementary deformation, surveying results of
our forthcoming paper. We outline how this leads to a uniqueness statement for
the above correspondence and indicate how basic examples of c-map constructions
may be realised in this context.
