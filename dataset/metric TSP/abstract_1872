We obtain higher dimensional analogues of the results of Mantoulidis and
Schoen. More precisely, we show that (i) any metric $g$ on the $3$-sphere $S^3$
with positive Ricci curvature can be realized as the induced metric on the
outermost apparent horizon of a $4$-dimensional asymptotically flat manifold
with nonnegative scalar curvature, whose ADM mass can be arranged to be
arbitrarily close to the optimal value; (ii) any metric $g$ on the $n$-sphere
$S^n$, with $n \geq 3$, with positive scalar curvature, such that $(S^n, g)$
isometrically embeds into $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ as a star-shaped hypersurface, can
be realized as the induced metric on the outermost apparent horizon of an
$(n+1)$-dimensional asymptotically flat manifold with nonnegative scalar
curvature, whose ADM mass can be made to be arbitrarily close to the optimal
value.
