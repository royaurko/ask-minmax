Vulnerability discovery and exploits detection are two wide areas of study in
software engineering. This preliminary work tries to combine existing methods
with machine learning techniques to define a metric classification of
vulnerable computer programs. First a feature set has been defined and later
two models have been tested against real world vulnerabilities. A relation
between the classifier choice and the features has also been outlined.
