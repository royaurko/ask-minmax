In a conformal class of metrics with positive Yamabe invariant, we derive a
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of metrics with positive Q
curvature. The condition is conformally invariant. We also prove some
inequalities between the Green's functions of the conformal Laplacian operator
and the Paneitz operator.
