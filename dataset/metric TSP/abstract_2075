This is the first in a series of papers in which we develop a twistor-based
method of constructing hyperkaehler metrics from holomorphic functions and
elliptic curves. As an application, we revisit the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold and
derive in an explicit holomorphic coordinate basis closed-form formulas for,
among other things, the metric, the holomorphic symplectic form and all three
Kaehler potentials.
