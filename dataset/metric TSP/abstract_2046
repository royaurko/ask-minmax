We study a class of non-smooth asymptotically flat manifolds on which metrics
fails to be $C^1$ across a hypersurface $\Sigma$. We first give an
approximation scheme to mollify the metric, then we prove that the Positive
Mass Theorem still holds on these manifolds if a geometric boundary condition
is satisfied by metrics separated by $\Sigma$.
