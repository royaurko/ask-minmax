We investigate U(1)-equivariant deformations of C. LeBrun's self-dual metric
with torus action. We explicitly determine all U(1)-subgroups of the torus for
which one can obtain U(1)-equivariant deformation that do not preserve
semi-free U(1)-action. This gives many new self-dual metrics with U(1)-action
which are not conformally isometric to LeBrun metric. We also count the
dimension of the moduli space of self-dual metrics with U(1)-action obtained in
this way.
