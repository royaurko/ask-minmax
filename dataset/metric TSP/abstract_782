The $\Gamma$-limit for a sequence of length functionals associated with a one
parameter family of Riemannian manifolds is computed analytically. The
Riemannian manifold is of `two-phase' type, that is, the metric coefficient
takes values in $\{1,\beta\}$, with $\beta$ sufficiently large. The metric
coefficient takes the value $\beta$ on squares, the size of which are
controlled by a single parameter. We find a family of examples of limiting
Finsler metrics that are piecewise affine with infinitely many lines of
discontinuity. Such an example provides insight into how the limit metric
behaves under variations of the underlying microscopic Riemannian geometry,
with implications for attempts to compute such metrics numerically.
