In the previous paper [MR2430243] we computed some geometric quantities such
as curvature and flag curvature for a general left invariant Finsler metric on
a two-step nilpotent group. In the present paper we give a more complete
description of the Chern--Rund connection defined by a left invariant Randers
metric on the 3 dimensional Heisenberg group.
