Contraction analysis is a stability theory for nonlinear systems where
stability is defined incrementally between two arbitrary trajectories. It
provides an alternative framework in which to study uncertain interconnections
or systems with external inputs, where it offers several significant advantages
when compared with traditional Lyapunov analysis. Contraction-based methods are
particularly useful for analyzing systems with uncertain parameters and for
proving synchronization properties of nonlinear oscillators. Existence of a
contraction metric for a given system is a necessary and sufficient condition
for global exponential convergence of system trajectories. For systems with
polynomial or rational dynamics, the search for contraction metrics can be made
fully algorithmic through the use of convex optimization and sum of squares
(SOS) programming. The search process is made computationally tractable by
relaxing matrix definiteness constraints, whose feasibility indicate existence
of a contraction metric, into SOS constraints on polynomial matrices. We
illustrate the results through examples from the literature, emphasizing the
advantages and contrasting the differences between the contraction approach and
traditional Lyapunov techniques.
