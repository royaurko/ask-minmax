We present a systematic and consistent construction of geometrothermodynamics
by using Riemannian contact geometry for the phase manifold and harmonic maps
for the equilibrium manifold. We present several metrics for the phase manifold
that are invariant with respect to Legendre transformations and induce
thermodynamic metrics on the equilibrium manifold. We review all the known
examples in which the curvature of the thermodynamic metrics can be used as a
measure of the thermodynamic interaction.
