The paper presents a new cross-ratio of hypercomplex numbers based on
projective geometry. We discuss the essential properties of the projective
cross-ratio, notably its invariance under Mobius transformations. Applications
to the geometry of conic sections and Mobius-invariant metrics on the upper
half-plane are also given.
