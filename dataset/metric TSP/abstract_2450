Let $\text{Bl}_{\mathbb{P}^1} \mathbb{P}^n$ be a K\"ahler manifold obtained
by blowing up a complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ along a line
$\mathbb{P}^1$. We prove that $\text{Bl}_{\mathbb{P}^1} \mathbb{P}^n$ does not
admit constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics in any rational K\"ahler
class, but admits extremal metrics, with an explicit formula in action-angle
coordinates, in K\"ahler classes that are close to the pullback of the
Fubini--Study class.
