We study the geometry of the canonical connection on a quasi-Kaehler manifold
with Norden metric. We consider the cases when the canonical connection has
Kaehler curvature tensor and parallel torsion, and derive conditions for an
isotropic-Kaehler manifold. We give the relation between the canonical
connection, the B-connection, and the connection with totally skew-symmetric
torsion on quasi-Kaehler manifolds with Norden metric.
