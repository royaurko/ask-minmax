We undertake to show how the relativistic Finslerian Metric Function (FMF)
should arise under uni-directional violation of spatial isotropy, keeping the
condition that the indicatrix (mass-shell) is a space of constant negative
curvature. By evaluating respective Finslerian tetrads, and treating them
consistently as the bases of inertial reference frame (RF), the generalized
Finslerian kinematic transformations follow in a convenient explicit form. The
concomitant Finslerian relativistic relations generalize their Lorentzian
prototypes through the presence of one characteristic parameter g, so that the
constraints on the parameter may be found in future high-precision
post-Lorentzian experiments. As the associated Finslerian Hamiltonian function
is also obtainable in a clear explicit form, convenient prospects for the
Finslerian extension of particle dynamics are also opened. Additionally, the
Finslerian extension of the general-relativistic Schwarzschild metric can
unambiguously be proposed.
