In this paper, we study the range of (absolute value) cosine transforms for
which we give a proof for an extended surjectivity theorem by making
applications of the Fredholm's theorem in integral equations, and show a
Hermitian characterization theorem for complex Minkowski metrics on
\mathbb{C}^n. Moreover, we parametrize the Grassmannian in an elementary linear
algebra approach, and give a characterization on the image of the (absolute
value) cosine transform on the space of distributions on the Grassmannian
Gr_{2}(\mathbb{C}^{2}), by computing the coefficients in the Legendre series
expansion of distributions.
