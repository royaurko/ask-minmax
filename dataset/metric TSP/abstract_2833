We construct normal forms for Lorentzian metrics on Engel distributions under
the assumption that abnormal curves are timelike future directed Hamiltonian
geodesics. Then we indicate some cases in which the abnormal timelike future
directed curve initiating at the origin is geometrically optimal. We also give
certain estimates for reachable sets from a point.
