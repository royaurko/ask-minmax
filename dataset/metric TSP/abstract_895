Let $G$ be a connnected, unipotent, perfect group scheme over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0. V. Drinfeld has defined a
certain metric group associated to biextensions of $G \times G$ by the discrete
group $Q_p/Z_p$. We prove a certain conjecture of Drinfeld regarding the class
of this metric group in the Witt group.
