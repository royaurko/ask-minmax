Conformal fluctuations of the metric tensor at the Planck scale are
considered. They give rise to a lower bound of the proper length. This leads to
finite expressions for quantities related to propagators without the need of
renormalization or regularization. Quantities like the current quark mass or
the effective strong coupling constant have to be reinterpreted.
