Researchers have developed ways to generalize the mean and variance to
situations in which a data metric is available. We apply the tools developed in
Pennec (2006) to categorical data, and show the generality of this approach by
considering two quite different applications. First, spelling variability in
Middle English is quantified. Second, variability of a finite group (in the
sense of group theory) is defined and applied to an example.
