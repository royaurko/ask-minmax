In this paper we show that it is possible to derive the Kerr solution in an
alternative, intuitive way, based on physical reasoning and starting from an
orthogonal metric ansatz having manifest ellipsoidal space-time symmetry
(ellipsoidal symmetry). This is possible because both flat metric in oblate
spheroidal (ellipsoidal) coordinates and Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist
coordinates can be rewritten in such a form that the difference between the two
is only in the time-time and radial-radial metric tensor components, just as is
the case with Schwarzschild metric and flat metric in spherical coordinates.
