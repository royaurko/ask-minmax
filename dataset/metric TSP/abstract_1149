A contact pair on a manifold always admits an associated metric for which the
two characteristic contact foliations are orthogonal. We show that all these
metrics have the same volume element. We also prove that the leaves of the
characteristic foliations are minimal with respect to these metrics. We give an
example where these leaves are not totally geodesic submanifolds.
