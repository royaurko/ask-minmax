A new approximate metric representing the spacetime of a rotating deformed
body is obtained by perturbing the Kerr metric to include the mass-quadrupole
and quadrupole-quadrupole orders. It has a simple form, because is Kerr-like.
Its post-linear form coincides with post-linear quadrupole-quadrupole metrics
already found. Moreover, it can be transformed to an improved Hartle-Thorne
metric, this guarantees its validity to be useful in studing compact object,
like neutron stars, and that it is possible to find an inner solution.
