The method of simple straightforward calculation of the curvature tensor of
the Finsleroid--regular space is indicated. The Schwarzschild metric which
underlines the gravitational field produced by static spherical-symmetric body
is shown to be uniquely extended to the Finslerian domain upon a consistent
treatment of the pseudo-Finsleroid axis vector field $b_i$ to be the field of
the time variable.
  Keywords: Finsler metrics, gravitational equations, curvature tensors.
