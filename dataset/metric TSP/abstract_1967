Two and three loop alpha' corrections are calculated for Kasner and
Schwarzschild metrics, and their T-duals, in the bosonic string theory. These
metrics are used to obtain the two and three loop alpha' corrections to
T-duality. It is noted in particular that the inclusion of alpha' corrections
and the requirement of consistency with the alpha'-corrected T-duality for the
Kasner and Schwarzschild metrics enables one to fix uniquely the covariant form
of the T-duality rules at three loops. As a generalization of the T-dual of the
Schwarzschild geometry a class of massless geometries is presented.
