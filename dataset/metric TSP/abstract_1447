We introduce an universum of the Polish (=complete separable metric) space -
the convex cone of distance matrices and study its geometry. It happened that
the generic Polish spaces in this sense of this universum is so called Urysohn
spaces defined by P.S.Urysohn in 20-th, and generic metric triple (= metric
space with probability borel measure) is also Urysohn space with
non-degenerated measure. We prove that the complete invariant of the metric
space with measure up to measure preserving isometries is so called matrix
distribution - invarinat and ergodic measure with respect to infinite symmetric
group which is concentrated on the cone of distance matrices. This defined an
important new class of random matrices and family of random metrics on the
naturals.
