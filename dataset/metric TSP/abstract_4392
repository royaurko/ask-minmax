It is known that there are 34 classes of isomorphic connected simply
connected six-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups. Of these, only 26 classes
suppose left-invariant symplectic structures \cite{Goze-Khakim-Med}. In
\cite{CFU2} it is shown that 14 classes of symplectic six-dimensional nilpotent
Lie groups suppose compatible complex structures and, therefore, define
pseudo-K\"{a}hler metrics. In this paper we show that on the remaining 12
classes of six-dimensional nilpotent symplectic Lie groups there are
left-invariant almost pseudo-K\"{a}hler metrics, and we study their geometrical
properties.
