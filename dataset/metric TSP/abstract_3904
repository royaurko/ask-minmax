Is is known that the loop space associated to a Riemannian manifold admits a
quasi-symplectic structure. This article shows that this structure is not
likely to recover the underlying Riemannian metric by proving a result that is
a strong indication of the "almost" independence of the quasi-symplectic
structure with respect to the metric. Finally conditions to have contact
structures on these spaces are studied.
