A pseudo-Hermitian coupled-channel square-well model is proposed, solved and
discussed. The domain of parameters is determined where all the bound-state
energies (twice degenerate with respect to the second observable which we call
"spin") remain real. The standard probabilistic interpretation of the wave
functions is achieved by the transition from the original elementary
non-physical indefinite pseudo-metric $\theta$ to another, more involved but
correct positive-definite physical metric $\Theta$. In our model the latter
step remains comparatively easily feasible. Another fortunate circumstance
emerges during the perturbative construction of the metric $\Theta$ and, hence,
of the correct scalar product and of the physical norm. One finds that at the
higher energy levels the influence of all the non-Hermiticities of our model
becomes very strongly and progressively suppressed.
