We call a metric $m$-quasi-Einstein if $Ric_X^m$, which replaces a gradient
of a smooth function $f$ by a vector field $X$ in $m$-Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor,
is a constant multiple of the metric tensor. It is a generalization of Einstein
metrics which contains Ricci solitons. In this paper, we focus on
left-invariant metrics on simple Lie groups. First, we prove that $X$ is a
left-invariant Killing vector field if the metric on a compact simple Lie group
is $m$-quasi-Einstein. Then we show that every compact simple Lie group admits
non-trivial $m$-quasi-Einstein metrics except $SU(3)$, $E_8$ and $G_2$, and
most of them admit infinitely many metrics. Naturally, the study on
$m$-quasi-Einstein metrics can be extended to pseudo-Riemannian case. And we
prove that every compact simple Lie group admits non-trivial $m$-quasi-Einstein
Lorentzian metrics and most of them admit infinitely many metrics. Finally, we
prove that some non-compact simple Lie groups admit infinitely many non-trivial
$m$-quasi-Einstein Lorentzian metrics.
