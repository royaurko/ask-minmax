We generalize the construction of Arzhantseva, Guentner and Spakula of a box
space of the free group which admits a coarse embedding into Hilbert space. We
show that for a finitely generated free group, the box space corresponding to
the derived $m$-series (for any integer $m\geq 2$) coarsely embeds into Hilbert
space. This gives new examples of metric spaces with bounded geometry which
coarsely embed into Hilbert space but do not have Yu's property A.
