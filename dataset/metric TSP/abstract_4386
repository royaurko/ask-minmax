We show that any infinite order element $g$ of a virtually cyclic
hyperbolically embedded subgroup of a group $G$ is Morse, that is to say any
quasi-geodesic connecting points in the cyclic group $C$ generated by $g$ stays
close to $C$. This answers a question of Dahmani-Guirardel-Osin. What is more,
we show that hyperbolically embedded subgroups are quasi-convex.
  Finally, we give a definition of what it means for a collection of subspaces
of a metric space to be hyperbolically embedded and we show that axes of
pseudo-Anosovs are hyperbolically embedded in Teichm\"uller space endowed with
the Weil-Petersson metric.
