We investigate a collection of orthonormal functions that encodes information
about the continued fraction expansion of real numbers. When suitably ordered
these functions form a complete system of martingale differences and are a
special case of a class of martingale differences considered by R. F. Gundy. By
applying known results for martingales we obtain corresponding metric theorems
for the continued fraction expansion of almost all real numbers.
