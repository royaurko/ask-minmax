We present details of the harmonic space construction of a quaternionic
extension of the four-dimensional Taub-NUT metric. As the main merit of the
harmonic space approach, the metric is obtained in an explicit form following a
generic set of rules. It exhibits $SU(2)\times U(1)$ isometry group and depends
on two parameters, Taub-NUT `mass' and the cosmological constant. We consider
several limiting cases of interest which correspond to special choices of the
involved parameters.
