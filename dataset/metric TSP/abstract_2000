For every hyperbolic group and more general hyperbolic graphs, we construct
an equivariant ideal bicombing: this is a homological analogue of the geodesic
flow on negatively curved manifolds. We then construct a cohomological
invariant which implies that several Measure Equivalence and Orbit Equivalence
rigidity results established by Monod-Shalom hold for all non-elementary
hyperbolic groups and their non-elementary subgroups. We also derive
superrigidity results for actions of general irreducible lattices on a large
class of hyperbolic metric spaces.
