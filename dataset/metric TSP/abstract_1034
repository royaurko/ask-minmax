Competitive on-line prediction (also known as universal prediction of
individual sequences) is a strand of learning theory avoiding making any
stochastic assumptions about the way the observations are generated. The
predictor's goal is to compete with a benchmark class of prediction rules,
which is often a proper Banach function space. Metric entropy provides a
unifying framework for competitive on-line prediction: the numerous known upper
bounds on the metric entropy of various compact sets in function spaces readily
imply bounds on the performance of on-line prediction strategies. This paper
discusses strengths and limitations of the direct approach to competitive
on-line prediction via metric entropy, including comparisons to other
approaches.
