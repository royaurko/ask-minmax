We consider the moduli space of the extremal K\"ahler metrics on compact
manifolds. We show that under the conditions of two-sided total volume bounds,
$L^{n\over2}$-norm bounds on $\Riem$, and Sobolev constant bounds, this Moduli
space can be compactified by including (reduced) orbifolds with finitely many
singularities. Most of our results go through for certain other classes of
critical Riemannian metrics.
