We show how the $A_\infty$ class of weights can be considered as a metric
space. As far as we know this is the first time that a metric d is considered
on this set. We use this metric to generalize the results obtained in [9].
Namely, we show that for any Calderon- Zygmund operator T and an $A_p$, 1 < p <
1, weight $w_0$, the operator norm of T in $L^{p}(w)$ converge to the operator
norm of T in L^{p}(w_{0})$ as d(w;w_0) goes to 0. We also find the rate of this
convergence and prove that is sharp.
