We present the complete solution of the first order metric and density
perturbation equations in a spatially flat (K=0), Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) universe filled with pressureless ideal fluid, in the presence of
cosmological constant. We use covariant linear perturbation formalism and the
comoving gauge condition to obtain the field and conservation equations. The
solution contains all modes of the perturbations, i.e. scalar, vector and
tensor modes, and we show that our results are in agreement with the Sachs &
Wolfe metric perturbation formalism.
