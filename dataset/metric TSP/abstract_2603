We study the Calabi functional on a ruled surface over a genus two curve. For
polarisations which do not admit an extremal metric we describe the behaviour
of a minimising sequence splitting the manifold into pieces. We also show that
the Calabi flow starting from a metric with suitable symmetry gives such a
minimising sequence.
