The Hilbert manifold $\Sigma$ consisting of positive invertible (unitized)
Hilbert-Schmidt operators has a rich structure and geometry. The geometry of
unitary orbits $\Omega\subset \Sigma$ is studied from the topological and
metric viewpoints: we seek for conditions that ensure the existence of a smooth
local structure for the set $\Omega$, and we study the convexity of this set
for the geodesic structures that arise when we give $\Sigma$ two Riemannian
metrics.
