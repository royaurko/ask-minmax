We present a randomized approximation algorithm for computing traveling
salesperson tours in undirected regular graphs. Given an $n$-vertex,
$k$-regular graph, the algorithm computes a tour of length at most
$\left(1+\frac{7}{\ln k-O(1)}\right)n$, with high probability, in $O(nk \log
k)$ time. This improves upon a recent result by Vishnoi (\cite{Vishnoi12}, FOCS
2012) for the same problem, in terms of both approximation factor, and running
time. The key ingredient of our algorithm is a technique that uses
edge-coloring algorithms to sample a cycle cover with $O(n/\log k)$ cycles with
high probability, in near linear time.
  Additionally, we also give a deterministic
$\frac{3}{2}+O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\right)$ factor approximation algorithm
running in time $O(nk)$.
