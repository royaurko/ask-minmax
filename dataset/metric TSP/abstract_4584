This paper is devoted to investigate gravitational collapse of dust in metric
$f(R)$ gravity. We take FRW metric for the interior region while the
Schwarzchild spacetime is considered for the exterior region of a star. The
junction conditions have been derived to match interior and exterior
spacetimes. The assumption of constant scalar curvature is used to find a
solution of field equations. Gravitational mass is found by using the junction
conditions. It is concluded that the constant curvature term $f(R_0)$ plays the
role of the cosmological constant involved in the field equations of general
relativity.
