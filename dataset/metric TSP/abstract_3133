We identify the complex plane C with the open unit disc D={z:|z|<1} by the
homeomorphism z --> z/(1+|z|). This leads to a compactification $\bar{C}$ of C,
homeomorphic to the closed unit disc. The Euclidean metric on the closed unit
disc induces a metric d on $\bar{C}$. We identify all uniform limits of
polynomials on $\bar{D}$ with respect to the metric d. The class of the above
limits is an extension of the disc algebra and it is denoted by $\bar{A}(D)$.
We study properties of the elements of $\bar{A}(D)$ and topological properties
of the class $\bar{A}(D)$ endowed with its natural topology. The class
$\bar{A}(D)$ is different and, from the geometric point of view, richer than
the class $\tilde{A}(D)$ introduced in Nestoridis (2010), Arxiv:1009.5364, on
the basis of the chordal metric.
