We develop a new approach to formulate and prove the weak uncertainty
inequality which was recently introduced by Okoudjou and Strichartz. We assume
either an appropriate measure growth condition with respect to the effective
resistance metric, or, in the absence of such a metric, we assume the
  Poincare inequality and reverse volume doubling property. We also consider
the weak uncertainty inequality in the context of Nash-type inequalities. Our
results can be applied to a wide variety of metric measure spaces, including
graphs, fractals and manifolds.
