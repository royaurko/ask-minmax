Optimal transport enables one to construct a metric on the set of
(sufficiently small at infinity) probability measures on any (not too wild)
metric space X, called its Wasserstein space W(X). In this paper we investigate
the geometry of W(X) when X is a Hadamard space, by which we mean that $X$ has
globally non-positive sectional curvature and is locally compact. Although it
is known that -except in the case of the line- W(X) is not non-positively
curved, our results show that W(X) have large-scale properties reminiscent of
that of X. In particular we define a geodesic boundary for W(X) that enables us
to prove a non-embeddablity result: if X has the visibility property, then the
Euclidean plane does not admit any isometric embedding in W(X).
