I discuss relativistic extensions of MOND in which the metric couples
normally to matter. I argue that MOND might be a residual effect from the
vacuum polarization of infrared gravitons produced during primordial inflation.
If so, MOND corrections to the gravitational field equations would be nonlocal.
Nonocality also results when one constructs metric field equations which
reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation, along with sufficient weak lensing. I give
the full field equations for the simplest class of models, and I specialize
these equations to the geometries relevant for cosmology. I conclude by
sketching the direction of future studies.
