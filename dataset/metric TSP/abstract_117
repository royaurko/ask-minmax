We investigate the relationship between the metric boundary and the Gromov
boundary of a hyperbolic metric space. We show that the Gromov boundary is a
quotient topological space of the metric boundary, and that therefore a
word-hyperbolic group has an amenable action on the metric boundary of its
Cayley graph. This result has significance for the study of Lip-norms on group
C*-algebras.
