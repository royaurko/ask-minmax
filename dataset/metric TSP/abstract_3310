Measurement is an important criterion to improve the performance of a
product. This paper presents a comparative study involving measurements between
two frameworks MARF and GIPSY. Initially it establishes a thorough
understanding of these frameworks and their applications. MARF comprises of a
number of algorithms for voice and speech processing etc. GIPSY on the contrary
provides a multi lingual platform for developing compiler components. These
frameworks are meant to provide an open source environment for the programmers
or users and implement them in applications. Several metrics are used for
object-oriented design quality assessment. We use these metrics to evaluate the
code quality of both MARF and GIPSY. We describe how tools can be used to
analyze these metric values and categorize the quality of the code as excellent
or worse. Based on these values we interpret the results in terms of quality
attributes achieved. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of metric values is
made in this regard to elaborate the impact of design parameters on the quality
of the code.
