Given a closed subset $\La$ of the open unit ball $B_1\subset \real^n$, $n
\geq 3$, we will consider a complete Riemannian metric $g$ on $\bar{B_1}
\setminus \La$ of constant scalar curvature equal to $n(n-1)$ and conformally
related to the Euclidean metric. In this paper we prove that every closed
Euclidean ball $\bar{B} \subset B_1\setminus \La$ is convex with respect to the
metric $g$, assuming the mean curvature of the boundary $\partial B_1$ is
nonnegative with respect to the inward normal.
