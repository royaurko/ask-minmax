We propose a variable metric forward-backward splitting algorithm and prove
its convergence in real Hilbert spaces. We then use this framework to derive
primal-dual splitting algorithms for solving various classes of monotone
inclusions in duality. Some of these algorithms are new even when specialized
to the fixed metric case. Various applications are discussed.
