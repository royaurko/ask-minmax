This paper studies functions of bounded mean oscillation (BMO) on metric
spaces equipped with a doubling measure. The main result gives
characterizations for mappings that preserve BMO. This extends the
corresponding Euclidean results by Gotoh to metric measure spaces. The argument
is based on a generalizations Uchiyama's construction of certain extremal
BMO-functions and John-Nirenberg's lemma.
