We quantify the extent to which a supercritical Sobolev mapping can increase
the dimension of subsets of its domain, in the setting of metric measure spaces
supporting a Poincar\'e inequality. For foliations of a metric space X defined
by a David--Semmes regular mapping we quantitatively estimate, in terms of
Hausdorff dimension, the size of the set of leaves of the foliation that are
mapped onto sets of higher dimension. We discuss key examples of such
foliations, including foliations of the Heisenberg group by left and right
cosets of horizontal subgroups. Examples are given demonstrating the extent to
which our results are sharp. In fact, we show that the set of mappings that
distort the dimensions of sets by the maximum possible amount is a prevalent
subset of the relevant function space; the latter result is new even in
Euclidean space.
