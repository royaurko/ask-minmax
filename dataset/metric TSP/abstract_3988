Torsion and curvature could play a fundamental role in explaining
cosmological dynamics. f(R)-gravity with torsion is an approach aimed to
encompass in a comprehensive scheme all the Dark Side of the Universe (Dark
Energy and Dark Matter). We discuss the field equations in empty space and in
presence of perfect fluid matter taking into account the analogy with the
metric-affine formalism. The result is that the extra curvature and torsion
degrees of freedom can be dealt under the standard of an effective scalar field
of fully geometric origin. The initial value problem for such theories is also
discussed.
