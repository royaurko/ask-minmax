We define metric bundles/metric graph bundles which provide a purely
topological/coarse-geometric generalization of the notion of trees of metric
spaces a la Bestvina-Feighn in the special case that the inclusions of the edge
spaces into the vertex spaces are uniform coarsely surjective quasi-isometries.
We prove the existence of quasi-isometric sections in this generality. Then we
prove a combination theorem for metric (graph) bundles (including exact
sequences of groups) that establishes sufficient conditions, particularly
flaring, under which the metric bundles are hyperbolic. We use this to give
examples of surface bundles over hyperbolic disks, whose universal cover is
Gromov-hyperbolic. We also show that in typical situations, flaring is also a
necessary condition.
