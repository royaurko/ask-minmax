We build a simple cosmological model by means of a parabolic
Lema\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric up to a redshift $z\simeq 0.4$, an
hyperbolic Friedmann metric for $z\sim 0.4$ up to the scale where dimming
galaxies are observed ($z\sim 1.4$) and a bulk spatially flat metric up to the
last scattering surface. Following Wiltshire, by taking into account the
different rate of clocks for an observer at the centre of a parabolic LTB
spacetime with respect to a one in the hyperbolic Friedmann metric, an
"apparent" negative deceleration parameter is perceived by the observer at the
centre of LTB, provided that all the regularity conditions are imposed and the
past null sections of the LTB and the hyperbolic Friedmann metrics are
identified. As a result, a first order Hubble law emerges at low redshifts. A
parameter $K$ arises driving the deceleration parameter perceived by the
central LTB observer. Finally, we obtain that a negative value for the
deceleration parameter is compatible with the observed energy-density at our
present epoch.
