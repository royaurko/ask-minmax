\"{O}zavsar and Cevikel(Fixed point of multiplicative contraction mappings on
multiplicative metric space.arXiv:1205.5131v1 [math.GN] 23 may 2012)initiated
the concept of the multiplicative metric space in such a way that the usual
triangular inequality is replaced by "multiplicative triangle inequality
$d(x,y)\leq d(x,z).d(z,y)$ for all $x,y,z\in X$". In this manuscript, we
discussed some unique fixed point theorems in the context of multiplicative
metric spaces. The established results carry some well known results from the
literature to multiplicative metric space. We note that some fixed point
theorems can be deduced in multiplicative metric space by using the established
results. Appropriate examples are also given.
