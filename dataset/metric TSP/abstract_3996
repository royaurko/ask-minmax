The direct measurement of quality is difficult because there is no way we can
measure quality factors. For measuring these factors, we have to express them
in terms of metrics or models. Researchers have developed quality models that
attempt to measure quality in terms of attributes, characteristics and metrics.
In this work we have proposed the methodology of controlled experimentation
coupled with power of Logical Scoring of Preferences to evaluate global quality
of four object-oriented designs.
