When autonomous agents are executing in the real world, the state of the
world as well as the objectives of the agent may change from the agent's
original model. In such cases, the agent's planning process must modify the
plan under execution to make it amenable to the new conditions, and to resume
execution. This brings up the replanning problem, and the various techniques
that have been proposed to solve it. In all, three main techniques -- based on
three different metrics -- have been proposed in prior automated planning work.
An open question is whether these metrics are interchangeable; answering this
requires a normalized comparison of the various replanning quality metrics. In
this paper, we show that it is possible to support such a comparison by
compiling all the respective techniques into a single substrate. Using this
novel compilation, we demonstrate that these different metrics are not
interchangeable, and that they are not good surrogates for each other. Thus we
focus attention on the incompatibility of the various replanning flavors with
each other, founded in the differences between the metrics that they
respectively seek to optimize.
