On a smoothly stratified space, we identify intersection cohomology of any
given perversity with an associated weighted $L^2$ cohomology for iterated
fibred cusp metrics on the smooth stratum. In particular given a Witt space, we
identify the $L^2$ cohomology of iterated fibred cusp metrics with the middle
perversity intersection cohomology of the corresponding stratified space.
