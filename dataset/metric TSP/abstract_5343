An emergent gravity metric incorporating $k-$essence scalar fields $\phi$
having a Born-Infeld type lagrangian is mapped into a metric whose structure is
similar to that of a blackhole of large mass $M$ that has swallowed a global
monopole. However, here the field is not that of a monopole but rather that of
a $k-$essence scalar field. If $\phi_{emergent}$ be solutions of the emergent
gravity equations of motion under cosmological boundary conditions at $\infty$,
then for $r\rightarrow\infty$ the rescaled field $\frac
{\phi_{emergent}}{2GM-1}$ has exact correspondence with $\phi$ with
$\phi(r,t)=\phi_{1}(r)+\phi_{2}(t)$. The Hawking temperature of this metric is
$T_{\mathrm emergent}= \frac{\hbar c^{3}}{8\pi GM k_{\mathrm B}}(1-K)^{2}\equiv
\frac{\hbar}{8\pi GM k_{\mathrm B}}(1-K)^{2}$, taking the speed of light $c=1$.
Here $K=\dot\phi_{2}^{2}$ is the kinetic energy of the $k-$essence field $\phi$
and $K$ is always less than unity, $k_{\mathrm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.
This is phenomenologically interesting in the context of Belgiorno {\it et
al's} gravitational analogue experiment.
