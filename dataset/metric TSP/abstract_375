We investigate a certain class of solvable metric Lie algebras. For this
purpose a theory of twofold extensions associated to an orthogonal
representation of an abelian Lie algebra is developed. Among other things, we
obtain a classification scheme for indecomposable metric Lie algebras with
maximal isotropic centre and the classification of metric Lie algebras of index
2.
