There is a well known construction of weakly continuous valuations on convex
compact polytopes in R^n. In this paper we investigate when a special case of
this construction gives a valuation which extends by continuity in the
Hausdorff metric to all convex compact subsets of R^n. It is shown that there
is a necessary condition on the initial data for such an extension. In the case
of R^3 more explicit results are obtained.
