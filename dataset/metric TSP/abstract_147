Software complexity metrics is essential for minimizing the cost of software
maintenance. Package level and System level complexity cannot be measured
without class level complexity. This research addresses the class complexity
metrics. This paper studies the existing class complexity metrics and proposes
a new class complexity metric CCC (Complete class complexity metric). The CCC
metric is then analytically evaluated by Weyuker's property.
