Dirac equation is written in a non-Riemannian spacetime with torsion and
non-metricity by lifting the connection from the tangent bundle to the spinor
bundle over spacetime. Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the Dirac equation in
a Schwarzschild background spacetime is considered and it is shown that both
the torsion and non-metricity couples to the momentum and spin of a massive,
spinning particle. However, the effects are small to be observationally
significant.
