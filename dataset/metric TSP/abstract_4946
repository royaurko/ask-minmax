It is shown that in the extreme limit with a zero surface gravity but nonzero
local temperature the limiting metric of a generic static black hole is
determined by a metric induced on a horizon and one function of two
coordinates, stress-energy tensor of a source picking up its values from a
horizon. The limiting procedure is extended to rotating black holes. If the
extreme limit is due to merging a black hole horizon and cosmological one both
horizons are always in thermal equilibrium in this limit. This is proved for a
generic case of static or axially-symmetrical rotating spacetimes.
