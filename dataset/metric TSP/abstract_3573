I study fresh inflation from a five-dimensional vacuum state, where the fifth
dimension is constant. In this framework, the universe can be seen as inflating
in a four-dimensional FRW metric embedding in a five-dimensional metric.
Finally, the experimental data $n_s=1$ are consistent with $(p+\rho_t)/\rho_t
\simeq1/3$ in the fresh inflationary scenario.
