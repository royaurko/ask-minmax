We construct new maximally symmetric solutions for the metric. We then show
that for a string moving in a background consisting of maximally symmetric
gravity, dilaton field and second rank antisymmetric tensor field, the O(d)
$\otimes$ O(d) transformation on the vacuum solutions, in general, gives
inequivalent solutions that are not maximally symmetric.
