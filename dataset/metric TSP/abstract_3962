The Regge-Wheeler equation describes axial perturbations of Schwarzschild
metric in linear approximation. Teukolsky Master Equation describes
perturbations of Kerr metric in the same approximation. We present here unified
description of all classes of exact solutions to these equations in terms of
the confluent Heun's functions. Special attention is paid to the polynomial
solutions, which yield novel applications of Teukolsky Master Equation for
description of relativistic jets and astrophysical explosions.
