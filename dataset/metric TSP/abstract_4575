In sub-Riemannian geometry the coefficients of the Jacobi equation define
curvature-like invariants. We show that these coefficients can be interpreted
as the curvature of a canonical Ehresmann connection associated to the metric,
first introduced in [Zelenko-Li]. We show why this connection is naturally
nonlinear, and we discuss some of its properties.
