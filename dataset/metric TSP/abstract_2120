The main purpose of the paper is to find some expansion properties of locally
finite metric spaces which do not embed coarsely into a Hilbert space. The
obtained result is used to show that infinite locally finite graphs excluding a
minor embed coarsely into a Hilbert space. In an appendix a direct proof of the
latter result is given.
