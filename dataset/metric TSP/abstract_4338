We study isometric embeddings of non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric
describing a charged black hole. We obtain three new embeddings in the flat
ambient space with minimal possible dimension. These embeddings are global,
i.e. corresponding surfaces are smooth at all values of radius, including
horizons. Each of the given embeddings covers one instance of the regions
outside the horizon, one instance between the horizons and one instance inside
the internal horizon. The lines of time for these embeddings turn out to be
more complicated than circles or hyperbolas.
