We prove spectral localization for infinite metric graphs with a self-adjoint
Laplace operator and a random potential. To do so we adapt the multiscale
analysis (MSA) from the R^d-case to metric graphs. In the MSA a covering of the
graph is needed which is obtained from a uniform polynomial growth of the
graph. The geometric restrictions of the graph include a uniform bound on the
edge lengths. As boundary conditions we allow all local settings which give a
lower bounded self-adjoint operator with an associated quadratic form.
  The result is spectral localization (i.e. pure point spectrum) with
polynomially decaying eigenfunctions in a small interval at the ground state
energy.
