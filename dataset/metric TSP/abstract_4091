In previous work, a class of noninvertible topological dynamical systems $f:
X \to X$ was introduced and studied; we called these {\em topologically coarse
expanding conformal} systems. To such a system is naturally associated a
preferred quasisymmetry (indeed, snowflake) class of metrics in which arbitrary
iterates distort roundness and ratios of diameters by controlled amounts; we
called this {\em metrically coarse expanding conformal}. In this note we extend
the class of examples to several more familiar settings, give applications of
our general methods, and discuss implications for the computation of conformal
dimension.
