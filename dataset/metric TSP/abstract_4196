We consider spaces for which there is a notion of harmonicity for complex
valued functions defined on them. For instance, this is the case of Riemannian
manifolds on one hand, and (metric) graphs on the other hand. We observe that
it is then possible to define an "amazing" notion of holomorphic functions on
them, and show how rigid it is in some cases.
