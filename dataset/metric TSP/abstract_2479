The goal of this paper is to introduce and study analogues of the Euclidean
Funk and Hilbert metrics on open convex subsets $\Omega$ of hyperbolic or
spherical spaces. At least at a formal level, there are striking similarities
among the three cases: Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic. We start by
defining non-Euclidean analogues of the Euclidean Funk weak metric and we give
three distinct representations of it in each of the non-Euclidean cases, which
parallel the known situation for the Euclidean case. As a consequence, all of
these metrics are shown to be Finslerian, and the associated norms of the
Finsler metrics are described. The theory is developed by using a set of
classical trigonometric identities on the sphere $S^n$ and the hyperbolic space
$\mathbb{H}^n$ and the definition of a cross ratio on the non-Euclidean spaces
of constant curvature. This in turn leads to the concept of projectivity
invariance in these spaces. We then study the geodesics of the Funk and Hilbert
metrics. In the case of Euclidean (respectively spherical, hyperbolic)
geometry, the Euclidean (respectively spherical, hyperbolic) geodesics are Funk
and Hilbert geodesics. Natural projection maps that exist between the spaces
$\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathbb{H}^n$ and the upper hemisphere demonstrate that the
theories of Hilbert geometry of convex sets in the three spaces of constant
curvature are all equivalent. The same cannot be said about the Funk
geometries.
