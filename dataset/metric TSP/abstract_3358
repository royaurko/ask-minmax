In General Relativity the metric can be recovered from the structure of the
lightcones and a measure giving the volume element. Since the causal structure
seems to be simpler than the Lorentzian manifold structure, this suggests that
it is more fundamental. But there are cases when seemingly healthy causal
structure and measure determine a singular metric. Here it is shown that this
is not a bug, but a feature, because big-bang and black hole singularities are
instances of this situation. But while the metric is special at singularities,
being singular, the causal structure and the measure are not special in an
explicit way at singularities. Therefore, considering the causal structure more
fundamental than the metric provides a more natural framework to deal with
spacetime singularities.
