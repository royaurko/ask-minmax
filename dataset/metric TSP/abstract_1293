We correct a partial mistake for a metric presented in the article "Lattice
constellation and codes from quadratic number fields" [IEEE Trans. Inform.
Theory, vol. 47, No. 4, May. 2001]. We show that the metric defined in the
article is not true, therefore, this brings about to destroy the encoding and
decoding procedures. Also, we define a proper metric for some codes defined in
the article and show that there exist some $1-$error correcting perfect codes
with respect to this new metric.
