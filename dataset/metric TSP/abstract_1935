We describe conditions assuring that the Kerr--Schild type solutions of
Einstein equations with pure radiation fields are asymptotically flat at future
null infinity. Such metrics cannot describe ``true'' gravitational radiation
from bounded sources--it is shown that the Bondi news function vanishes
identically. We obtain formulae for the total energy and angular momentum at
scri+. As an example we consider non-stationary generalization of the Kerr
metric given by Vaidya and Patel. Angular momentum and total energy are
expressed in closed form as functions of retarded time.
