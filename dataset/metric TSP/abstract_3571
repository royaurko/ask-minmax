A simple group theoretic derivation is given of the family of space-time
metrics with isometry group SO(2,1) X SO(2) X R first described by Godel, of
which the Godel stationary cosmological solution is the member with a
perfect-fluid stress-energy tensor. Other members of the family are shown to be
interpretable as cosmological solutions with a electrically charged perfect
fluid and a magnetic field.
