We relate Ambrosio-Kirchheim metric currents to Alberti representations and
Weaver derivations. In particular, given a metric current $T$, we show that if
the module $\mathscr{X}(\|T\|)$ of Weaver derivations is finitely generated,
then $T$ can be represented in terms of derivations; this extends previous
results of Williams. Applications of this theory include an approximation of
$1$-dimensional metric currents in terms of normal currents and the
construction of Alberti representations in the directions of vector fields.
