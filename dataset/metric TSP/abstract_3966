In this paper, we show that the \alpha_{m,2}-invariant of a smooth cubic
surface with Eckardt points is strictly bigger than 2/3. This can be used to
simplify Tian's original proof of the existence of Kaehler-Einstein metrics on
such manifolds. We also sketch the computations on cubic surfaces with one
ordinary double points, and outline the analytic difficulties to prove the
existence of orbifold Kaehler-Einstein metrics.
