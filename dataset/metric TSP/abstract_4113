We show that the blow-up of a generalized Kahler 4-manifold in a
nondegenerate complex point admits a generalized Kahler metric. As with the
blow-up of complex surfaces, this metric may be chosen to coincide with the
original outside a tubular neighbourhood of the exceptional divisor. To
accomplish this, we develop a blow-up operation for bi-Hermitian manifolds.
