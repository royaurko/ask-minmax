We discuss the problem of $R$-separability (separability of variables with a
factor $R$) in the stationary Schr\"odinger equation on $n$-dimensional Riemann
space. We follow the approach of Gaston Darboux who was the first to give the
first general treatment of $R$-separability in PDE (Laplace equation on
${\mathbb E}^3$). According to Darboux $R$-separability amounts to two
conditions: metric is isothermic (all its parametric surfaces are isothermic in
the sense of both classical differential geometry and modern theory of
solitons) and moreover when an isothermic metric is given their Lam\'e
coefficients satisfy a single constraint which is either functional (when $R$
is harmonic) or differential (in the opposite case). These two conditions are
generalized to $n$-dimensional case. In particular we define $n$-dimensional
isothermic metrics and distinguish an important subclass of isothermic metrics
which we call binary metrics. The approach is illustrated by two standard
examples and two less standard examples. In all cases the approach offers
alternative and much simplified proofs or derivations. We formulate a
systematic procedure to isolate $R$-separable metrics. This procedure is
implemented in the case of 3-dimensional Laplace equation. Finally we discuss
the class of Dupin-cyclidic metrics which are non-regularly $R$-separable in
the Laplace equation on ${\mathbb E}^3$.
