Task-based, rather than vehicle-based, control architectures have been shown
to provide superior performance in certain human supervisory control missions.
These results motivate the need for the development of robust, reliable
usability metrics to aid in creating interfaces for use in this domain. To this
end, we conduct a pilot usability study of a particular task-based supervisory
control interface called the Research Environment for Supervisory Control of
Heterogenous Unmanned Vehicles (RESCHU). In particular, we explore the use of
eye-tracking metrics as an objective means of evaluating the RESCHU interface
and providing guidance in improving usability. Our main goals for this study
are to 1) better understand how eye-tracking can augment standard usability
metrics, 2) formulate initial models of operator behavior, and 3) identify
interesting areas of future research.
