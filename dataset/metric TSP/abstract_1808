Using the thermodynamics formalism, we introduce a notion of intersection for
projective Anosov representations, show analyticity results for the
intersection and the entropy, and rigidity results for the intersection. We use
the renormalized intersection to produce a $Out(\Gamma)$-invariant Riemannian
metric on the smooth points of the deformation space of irreducible, projective
Anosov representations of a word hyperbolic group $\Gamma$ into $SL(m,R)$ whose
Zariski closure contains a generic element. In particular, we produce mapping
class group invariant Riemannian metrics on Hitchin components which restrict
to the Weil--Petersson metric on the Fuchsian loci. Moreover, we produce
$Out(\Gamma)$-invariant metrics on deformation spaces of convex cocompact
representations into $PSL(2,C)$ and show that the Hausdorff dimension of the
limit set varies analytically over analytic families of convex cocompact
representations into any rank 1 semi-simple Lie group.
