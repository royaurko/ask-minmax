The presence of Killing-Yano tensors implies the existence of non-generic
supercharges in spinning point particle theories on curved backgrounds. Dual
metrics are defined through their associated non-degenerate Killing tensors of
valence two. Siklos spacetimes, which are the only non-trivial Einstein spaces
conformal to non-flat pp-waves are investigated in regards to the existence of
their corresponding Killing and Killing-Yano tensors. It is found that under
some restrictions, pp-wave metrics and Siklos spacetimes admit dual metrics and
non-generic supercharges. Possible significance of those dual spacetimes are
discussed.
