A set $W\subseteq V(G)$ is called a resolving set, if for each two distinct
vertices $u,v\in V(G)$ there exists $w\in W$ such that $d(u,w)\neq d(v,w)$,
where $d(x,y)$ is the distance between the vertices $x$ and $y$. A resolving
set for $G$ with minimum cardinality is called a metric basis.
  A graph with a unique metric basis is called a uniquely dimensional graph.
  In this paper, we study some properties of uniquely dimensional graphs.
