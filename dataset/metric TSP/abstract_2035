We prove a classification theorem for conformal maps with respect to the
control distance generated by a system of diagonal vector fields.
  It turns out that all such maps can be obtained as compositions of suitable
dilations, inversions and isometries. We also classify all umbilical surfaces
of the underlying metric.
