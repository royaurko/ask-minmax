We consider in this work the space of probability measures P(X) on a Hilbert
space X endowed with the 2-Wasserstein metric. Given a family of probability
measures in P(X), we propose an algorithm to compute curves that summarize
efficiently that family in the 2-Wasserstein metric sense. To do so, we adapt
the intuitive approach laid out by standard principal component analysis to the
2-Wasserstein metric, by using the Riemannian structure and associated concepts
(Fr\'echet mean, geodesics, tangent vectors) that this metric defines on P(X).
The curves we consider are generalized geodesics, which can be parameterized by
two velocity fields defined on the support of the Wasserstein mean of the
family of measures, each pointing towards an ending point of the generalized
geodesic. We propose several approximations to optimize efficiently such
velocity fields. Experiment re- sults show the ability of the computed
principal components to capture axes of variability on histograms and
probability measures data.
