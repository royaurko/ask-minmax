We study algebraic and geometric properties of metric spaces endowed with
dilatation structures, which are emergent during the passage through smaller
and smaller scales. In the limit we obtain a generalization of metric affine
geometry, endowed with a noncommutative vector addition operation and with a
modified version of ratio of three collinear points. This is the geometry of
normed affine group spaces, a category which contains the ones of homogeneous
groups, Carnot groups or contractible groups. In this category group operations
are not fundamental, but derived objects, and the generalization of affine
geometry is not based on incidence relations.
