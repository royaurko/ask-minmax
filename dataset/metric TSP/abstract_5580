In this paper, we calculate the effective gravitational mass of
Ay\'{o}n-Beato and Garc\'{\i}a regular (non-singular) static spherically
symmetric asymptotically Minkowskian metric that is a solution to Einstein's
equations coupled with a nonlinear electromagnetic field. The effective
gravitational mass is negative, zero, or positive that depends on the ratio of
magnitude of electric charge to the ADM mass and the ratio of the radial
distance to the ADM mass. As expected, at large value of radial distance, our
result gives effective gravitational mass of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric.
