A group presentation is said to have rational growth if the generating series
associated to its growth function represents a rational function. A
long-standing open question asks whether the Heisenberg group has rational
growth for all finite generating sets, and we settle this question
affirmatively. We also establish almost-convexity for all finite generating
sets. Previously, both of these properties were known to hold for hyperbolic
groups and virtually abelian groups, and there were no further examples in
either case. Our main method is a close description of the relationship between
word metrics and associated Carnot-Caratheodory Finsler metrics on the ambient
Lie group. We provide (non-regular) languages in any word metric that suffice
to represent all group elements.
