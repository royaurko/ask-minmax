Recently we have presented a new formulation of the theory of gravity based
on an implementation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle distinct from
General Relativity. The kinetic part of the theory - that describes how matter
is affected by the modified geometry due to the gravitational field - is the
same as in General Relativity. However, we do not consider the metric as an
independent field. Instead, it is an effective one, constructed in terms of two
fundamental spinor fields $\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ and thus the metric does not
have a dynamics of its own, but inherits its evolution through its relation
with the fundamental spinors. In the first paper it was shown that the metric
that describes the gravitational field generated by a compact static and
spherically symmetric configuration is very similar to the Schwarzschild
metric. In the present paper we describe the cosmological framework in the
realm of the Spinor Theory of Gravity.
