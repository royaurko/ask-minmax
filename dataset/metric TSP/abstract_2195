We define a generalization of the fixed point set, called the bounded fixed
set, for a group acting by isometries on a metric space. An analogue of the P.
A. Smith theorem is proved for metric spaces of finite asymptotic dimension,
which relates the coarse homology of the bounded fixed set to the coarse
homology of the total space.
