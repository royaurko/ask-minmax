We consider discrete metric spaces and we look for non-constant contractions.
We introduce the notion of contractive map and we characterize the spaces with
non-constant contractive maps. We provide some examples to discussion the
possible relations between contractions, contractive maps and constant
functions. Finally we apply the main result to the subgraphs of a non-oriented,
connected graph.
