An $(\alpha,\beta)$-metric is defined by a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and
$1$-form $\beta$. In this paper, we characterize conformal vector fields of
$(\alpha,\beta)$-spaces by some PDEs. Further, we determine the local solutions
of conformal vector fields of $(\alpha,\beta)$-spaces in dimension $n\ge 3$
under certain curvature conditions. In addition, we use certain conformal
vector field to give a new proof to a known result on the local and global
classifications for Randers metrics which are locally projectively flat and of
isotropic S-curvature.
