One proves that any everywhere defined constructive mapping from a complete
metric space into a complete metric space which preserves the property of
precompacity of subsets is locally uniformly continuous. This fact can be
viewed as interpretation of L. E. J. Brower's fan theorem in terms of A. A.
Markov's constructive analysis.
