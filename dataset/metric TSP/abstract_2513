This paper is an account (without proofs) of the results of our work "Metric
and Generalized Projection Operators in Banach Spaces: Properties and
Applications", funct-an/9311001. The Section 9 establishing a connection
between variational inequalities and Wienner-Hopf equations in Banach spaces by
means of metric and generalized projection operators, is added.
