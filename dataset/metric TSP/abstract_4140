This article is devoted to the study of classical and new results concerning
equidistant sets, both from the topological and metric point of view. We start
with a review of the most interesting known facts about these sets in the
euclidean space and then we prove that equidistant sets vary continuously with
their focal sets. In the second part we propose a viewpoint in which
equidistant sets can be thought of as natural generalization for conics. Along
these lines, we show that many geometric features of classical conics can be
retrieved in more general equidistant sets. In the Appendix we prove a
shadowing property of equidistant sets and provide sharp estimates. This result
should be of interest for computer simulations.
