We construct the non-BPS black brane representation from the Kerr metric
using the U-duality and symmetries in string or M-theory. We give the general
rule to get the brane configuration and we apply it especially for Kerr metric.
We find the three charged solution in M-theory and after the compactification
it becomes rotating black string solution in five dimension. We also find the
four charged solution containing the pp-wave in M-theory, and we can find
charged dilaton rotating black hole solution in four dimension after the torus
compactification. This solution has the other representation in string theory,
which is easy to apply the AdS/CFT correspondence.
