We discuss five simple functions on finite multisets of metric spaces. The
first four are all metrics iff the underlying space is bounded and are complete
metrics iff it is also complete. Two of them, and the fifth function, all
generalise the usual Hausdorff metric on subsets. Some possible applications
are also considered.
