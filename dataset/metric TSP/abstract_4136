Let X be a K\"ahler manifold and D be a R-divisor with simple normal crossing
support and coefficients between 1/2 and 1. Assuming that K_X+D is ample, we
prove the existence and uniqueness of a negatively curved Kahler-Einstein
metric on X\D having mixed Poincar\'e and cone singularities according to the
coefficients of D. As an application we prove a vanishing theorem for certain
holomorphic tensor fields attached to the pair (X,D).
