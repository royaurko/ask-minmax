Scholarly and social impacts of scientific publications could be measured by
various metrics. In this study, the relationship between various metrics of
63,805 PLOS research articles are studied. Generally, article views correlate

detailed and comprehensive article metrics. Although the low correlation

studies, more than ever, we find that social attention is highly correlated
with article view, especially the browser html view. Social attention is the
important source that bringing network traffic to browser html view and may
lead to citation subsequently. High altmetric score has the potential role in
promoting the long-term academic impact of articles, when a conceptual model is
proposed to interpret the conversion from social attention to article view, and
to citation finally.
