The requirement that a (non-Einstein) K\"ahler metric in any given complex
dimension $m>2$ be almost-everywhere conformally Einstein turns out to be much
more restrictive, even locally, than in the case of complex surfaces. The local
biholomorphic-isometry types of such metrics depend, for each $m>2$, on three
real parameters along with an arbitrary K\"ahler-Einstein metric $h$ in complex
dimension $m-1$. We provide an explicit description of all these local-isometry
types, for any given $h$. That result is derived from a more general local
classification theorem for metrics admitting functions we call {\it special
K\"ahler-Ricci potentials}.
