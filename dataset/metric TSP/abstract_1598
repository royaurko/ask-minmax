Let $r>0$ be a real number and $g(r)$ the Riemannian metric of $S^m(1)\times
S^k(r)$, the direct product of two round spheres of dimensions $m\ge 1$ and
$k\ge 1$ so that $n:=m+k\ge 3$. The number of solutions to the corresponding
Yamabe equation \begin{align*} -4\tfrac{n-1}{n-2}\Delta_{g(r)}
u+R_{g(r)}u=R_{g(r)}u^{\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \qquad (u>0) \end{align*} on $S^m\times
S^k$ diverges to infinity as $r\to\infty$ unless $m=1$. The same is true as
$r\to 0$ unless $k=1$. On the other hand, if $\frac{k-1}{m}\le r^2 \le
\frac{k}{m-1}$, there is no nonconstant solution depending only on one of the
$S^m$- and $S^k$-variables. These are consequences of the previous results due
to O. Kobayashi (1985, 1987), Schoen (1989), Petean (2010), and
Bidaut-Veron--Veron (1991).
  In this paper, we construct Riemannian metrics of constant scalar curvature
on twisted $S^k$-bundles and draw a similar picture. Let $E\to X$ be a real
vector bundle of rank $k$ with inner product ($k\ge 2$, $\dim X\ge 1$). Adding
the point at infinity to each fiber of $E$, we obtain the $S^k$-bundle $ M\to
X$ with structure group $\mathrm{O}(k)$. Out of a metric connection $\nabla$ on
$E$ and a Riemannian metric $\check{g}$ of constant scalar curvature on $X$
such that the corresponding (induced) Sasaki metric on the unit sphere bundle
of $E$ has constant scalar curvature, we construct a one-parameter family of
constant scalar curvature metrics on $M$ by solving a free-boundary problem of
ODE. This construction generalizes that of Otoba (2014). When $(X,
\check{g})=S^m(1)$, we estimate the number of solutions for the corresponding
Yamabe equation as in the product case.
