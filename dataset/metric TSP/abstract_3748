A formula for the Riemannian metric tensor of differentiable manifolds of
linear dynamical systems of same McMillan degree is presented in terms of their
transfer function matrices. The necessary calculations for its application to
ARMA and state space overlapping parametrizations are drafted. The importance
of this approach for systems identification and multiple time series analysis
and forecasting is explained.
