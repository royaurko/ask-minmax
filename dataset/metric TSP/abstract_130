Spherically symmetric metrics form a rich and important class of metrics.
Many well-known Finsler metrics of constant flag curvature can be locally
expressed as a spherically symmetric metric on R^n. In this paper, we study
spherically symmetric metrics with constant Ricci curvature and constant flag
curvature.
