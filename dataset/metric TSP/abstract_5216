The purpose of this note is to characterize the asymptotic dimension
$asdim(X)$ of metric spaces $X$ in terms similar to Property A of Yu:
  If $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $n\ge 0$, then the following conditions are
equivalent: [a.] $asdim(X,d)\leq n$, [b.] For each $R,\epsilon > 0$ there is $S
> 0$ and finite non-empty subsets $A_x\subset B(x,S)\times N$, $x\in X$, such
that $\frac{| A_x\Delta A_y|}{| A_x\cap A_y|} < \epsilon$ if $d(x,y) < R$ and
the projection of $A_x$ onto $X$ contains at most $n+1$ elements for all $x\in
X$, [c.] For each $R > 0$ there is $S > 0$ and finite non-empty subsets
$A_x\subset B(x,S)\times N$, $x\in X$, such that $\frac{| A_x\Delta A_y|}{|
A_x\cap A_y|} < \frac{1}{n+1}$ if $d(x,y) < R$ and the projection of $A_x$ onto
$X$ contains at most $n+1$ elements for all $x\in X$.
