Consider the massless Dirac operator on a 3-torus equipped with Euclidean
metric and standard spin structure. It is known that the eigenvalues can be
calculated explicitly: the spectrum is symmetric about zero and zero itself is
a double eigenvalue. The aim of the paper is to develop a perturbation theory
for the eigenvalue with smallest modulus with respect to perturbations of the
metric. Here the application of perturbation techniques is hindered by the fact
that eigenvalues of the massless Dirac operator have even multiplicity, which
is a consequence of this operator commuting with the antilinear operator of
charge conjugation (a peculiar feature of dimension 3). We derive an asymptotic
formula for the eigenvalue with smallest modulus for arbitrary perturbations of
the metric and present two particular families of Riemannian metrics for which
the eigenvalue with smallest modulus can be evaluated explicitly. We also
establish a relation between our asymptotic formula and the eta invariant.
