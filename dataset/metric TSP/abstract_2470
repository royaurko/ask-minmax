We discuss the causal diagrams of static and spherically symmetric bigravity
vacuum solutions, with interacting metrics $f$ and $g$. Such solutions can be
classified into type I (or "non-diagonal") and type II (or "diagonal"). The
general solution of type I is known, and leads to metrics $f$ and $g$ in the
Schwarzschild-(Anti)de Sitter family. The two metrics are not always
diagonalizable in the same coordinate system, and the light-cone structure of
both metrics can be quite different. In spite of this, we find that causality
is preserved, in the sense that closed time-like curves cannot be pieced
together from geodesics of both metrics. We propose maximal extensions of Type
I bigravity solutions, where geodesics of both metrics do not stop unless a
curvature singularity is encountered. Such maximal extensions can contain
several copies (or even an infinite number of them) of the maximally extended
"individual" geometries associated to $f$ and $g$ separately. Generically, we
find that the maximal extensions of bigravity solutions are not globally
hyperbolic, even in cases when the individual geometries are. The general
solution of type II has not been given in closed form. We discuss a subclass
where $g$ is an arbitrary solution of Einstein's equations with a cosmological
constant, and we find that in this case the only solutions are such that
$f\propto g$ (with trivial causal structure).
