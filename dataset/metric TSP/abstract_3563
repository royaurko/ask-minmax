Self-similar spacetimes are of importance to cosmology and to gravitational
collapse problems. We show that self-similarity or the existence of a
homothetic Killing vector field for spherically symmetric spacetimes implies
the separability of the spacetime metric in terms of the co-moving coordinates
and that the metric is, uniquely, the one recently reported in [cqg1]. The
spacetime, in general, has non-vanishing energy-flux and shear. The spacetime
admits matter with any equation of state.
