In 1999, M. Gromov introduced the box distance function $\sikaku$ on the
space of all mm-spaces. In this paper, by using the method of T. H. Colding
(cf. \cite[Lemma 5.10]{Colding}), we estimate
$\sikaku(\mathbb{S}^n,\mathbb{S}^m)$ and $\sikaku (\mathbb{C}P^n,
  \mathbb{C}P^m)$, where $\mathbb{S}^n$ is the $n$-dimensional unit sphere in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is the $n$-dimensional complex
projective space equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. In paticular, we give
the complete answer to an Exercise of Gromov's Green book (cf. \cite[Section
$3{1/2}.18$]{gromov}). We also estimate $\sikaku \big(SO(n), SO(m)\big)$ from
below, where SO(n) is the special orthogonal group.
