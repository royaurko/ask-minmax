A long standing conjecture says that the integrality ratio of the subtour LP
for metric TSP is $4/3$. A well known family of graphic TSP instances achieves
this lower bound asymptotically. For Euclidean TSP the best known lower bound
on the integrality ratio was $8/7$. We improve this value by presenting a
family of Euclidean TSP instances for which the integrality ratio of the
subtour LP converges to 4/3.
