If a macromolecule is described by curvilinear coordinates or rigid
constraints are imposed, the equilibrium probability density that must be
sampled in Monte Carlo simulations includes the determinants of different
mass-metric tensors. In this work, we explicitly write the determinant of the
mass-metric tensor G and of the reduced mass-metric tensor g, for any molecule,
general internal coordinates and arbitrary constraints, as a product of two
functions; one depending only on the external coordinates that describe the
overall translation and rotation of the system, and the other only on the
internal coordinates. This work extends previous results in the literature,
proving with full generality that one may integrate out the external
coordinates and perform Monte Carlo simulations in the internal conformational
space of macromolecules. In addition, we give a general mathematical argument
showing that the factorization is a consequence of the symmetries of the metric
tensors involved. Finally, the determinant of the mass-metric tensor G is
computed explicitly in a set of curvilinear coordinates specially well-suited
for general branched molecules.
