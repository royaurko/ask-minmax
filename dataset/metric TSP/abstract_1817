Hybrid metric-Palatini gravity is a recent and novel approach to modified
theories of gravity, which consists of adding to the metric Einstein-Hilbert
Lagrangian an f(R) term constructed a la Palatini. It was shown that the theory
passes local tests even if the scalar field is very light, and thus implies the
existence of a long-range scalar field, which is able to modify the dynamics in
galactic and cosmological scales, but leaves the Solar System unaffected. In
this work, motivated by the possibility that the Universe may have started out
in an asymptotically Einstein static state in the inflationary universe
context, we analyse the stability of the Einstein static Universe by
considering linear homogeneous perturbations in the respective dynamically
equivalent scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity.
Considering linear homogeneous perturbations, the stability regions of the
Einstein static universe are parametrized by the first and second derivatives
of the scalar potential, and it is explicitly shown that a large class of
stable solutions exists in the respective parameter space, in the context of
hybrid metric-Palatini gravity.
