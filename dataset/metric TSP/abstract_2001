In the space $\mathbb U^4$ of cubic forms of surfaces, regarded as a
$G$-space and endowed with a natural invariant metric, the ratio of the volumes
of those representing umbilic points with negative to those with positive
indexes is evaluated in terms of the asymmetry of the metric, defined here. A
connection of this ratio with that reported by Berry and Hannay (1977) in the
domain of Statistical Physics, is discussed.
