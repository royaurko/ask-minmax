It is shown that for arbitrary connection in the vector bundle compatible
with some Hermitian metric, the corresponding Fedosov trace functional commutes
with involution generated by this metric. This result is then used to prove
that certain noncommutative gravity actions are real in all powers of
deformation parameter.
