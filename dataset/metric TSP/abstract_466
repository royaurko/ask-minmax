A complete classification of exact solutions of ghost-free, massive bigravity
is derived which enables the dynamical decoupling of the background, and the
foreground metrics. The general decoupling solution space of the two metrics is
constructed. Within this branch of the solution space the foreground metric
theory becomes general relativity (GR) with an additional effective
cosmological constant, and the background metric dynamics is governed by plain
GR.
