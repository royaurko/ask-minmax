We use the notion of topological data analysis to compare metrics on data
sets. We provide two different motivating examples for this. The first of these
is a point cloud data set that has $\mathbb{R}^2$ as its ambient space, and is
therefore very visual. the second deals with a very abstract space which arises
through the study of non-transitive dice.
