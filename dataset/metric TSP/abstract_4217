We solve the Einstein vacuum-equations for the case of static and
axisymmetric solutions in a system of coordinates different from the Weyl
standard one. We prove that there exists a class of solutions with the
appropriate asymptotical behaviour which can be written in a simple compact
form, in terms of a function that must satisfies certain Cauchy-Newman problem.
The relation between the choice of coordinates and the form of the metric
functions that describe the solution is given by providing that analytic
function which characterizes the metric as well as the gauge.
