f(R) gravity theories in the Palatini formalism has been recently used as an
alternative way to explain the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with no
need of invoking either dark energy or extra spatial dimension. However, its
applications have shown that some subtleties of these theories need a more
profound examination. Here we are interested in the conformal aspects of the
Palatini approach in extended theories of gravity. As is well known,
extremization of the gravitational action a la Palatini, naturally "selects" a
new metric h related to the metric g of the subjacent manifold by a conformal
transformation. The related conformal function is given by the derivative of
f(R). In this work we examine the conformal symmetries of the flat (k=0) FLRW
spacetime and find that its Conformal Killing Vectors are directly linked to
the new metric h and also that each vector yields a different conformal
function.
