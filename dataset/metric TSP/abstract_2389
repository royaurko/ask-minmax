In this manuscript a conformally invariant theory of gravitation in the
context of metric measure space is proposed. Metric measure space provides a
natural framework in which both coordinate and conformal transformations are
allowed and may be considered as an alternative for Riemannian space, on which
general relativity is based. Within this new framework, a generalization of the
Einstein equation is obtained. The invariance of the geometrical part of the
action under the diffeomorphism leads to the second contracted Bianchi
identity. It is shown that this identity is completely similar to that of the
integrable Weyl geometry.
