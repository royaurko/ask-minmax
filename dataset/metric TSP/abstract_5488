We shall give dynamics to our spacetime manifold by first identifying the
local affine symmetry as the characterizing symmetry for our geometry a'la
Felix Klein, this symmetry is imposed on us by the Law of Inertia and the Law
of Causality. We then prescribe 16 gauge vector bosons to this symmetry a'la
Yang and Mills. The locally affine symmetric Yang-Mills Lagrangian in the
presence of a background world metric, and the corresponding equations of
motion, are respectively constructed and derived. Spontaneous breaking of the
local affine symmetry to the local Lorentz symmetry is achieved by classical
solutions to the equations of motion. In these classical solutions, the 16
gauge vector bosons are shown to select the Schwarzschild metric as one among
the admissible background world metrics. Classical gravity is thus be expressed
by a spontaneously broken Erlangen program. We shall also show that this
Yang-Mills gauge theory of gravity can give an explanation of the form of the
galactic rotation curves, of the amount of intergalactic gravitational lensing,
and of the accelerating expansion of the Universe.
