An AF C*-algebra has a natural filtration as an increasing sequence of finite
dimensional C*-algebras. We show that it is possible to construct a Dirac
operator which relates to this filtration in a natural way and which will
induce a metric for the weak*-topology on the state space of the algebra. In
the particular case of a UHF C*-algebra, the construction can be made in a way,
which relates directly to the dimensions of the increasing sequence of
subalgebras.The algebra of continuous functions on the Cantor set is an
approximately finite dimensional C*-algebra and our investigations show, when
applied to this algebra, that the proposed Dirac operators have good classical
interpretations and lead to an, apparently, new way of constructing a
representative for a Cantor set of any given Hausdorff dimension. At the end of
the paper we study the finite dimensional full matrix algebras over the complex
numbers, and show that the operation of transposition on matrices yields a
spectral triple which has the property that it's metric on the state space is
exactly the norm distance.This result is then generalized to arbitrary unital
C*-algebras.
