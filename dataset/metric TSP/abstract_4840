The quotient of the conformal group of Euclidean 4-space by its Weyl subgroup
results in a geometry possessing many of the properties of relativistic phase
space, including both a natural symplectic form and non-degenerate Killing
metric. We show that the general solution posesses orthogonal Lagrangian
submanifolds, with the induced metric and the spin connection on the
submanifolds necessarily Lorentzian, despite the Euclidean starting pont. By
examining the structure equations of the biconformal space in an orthonormal
frame adapted to its phase space properties, we also find that two new tensor
fields exist in this geometry, not present in Riemannian geometry. The first is
a combination of the Weyl vector with the scale factor on the metric, and
determines the timelike directions on the submanifolds. The second comes from
the components of the spin connection, symmetric with respect to the new
metric. Though this field comes from the spin connection it transforms
homogeneously. Finally, we show that in the absence of conformal curvature or
sources, the configuration space has geometric terms equivalent to a perfect
fluid and a cosmological constant.
