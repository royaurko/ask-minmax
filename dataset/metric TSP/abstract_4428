This article deals with the space of probability measures (with finite second
order moments) over a CAT(0) space. The Wasserstein metric turns this space of
measures into a geodesic space called Wasserstein space. We are interested in
the geometric properties of this space. In this paper, we study its isometry
group. The main result is that the isometry group of the Wasserstein space of a
CAT(0) space X coincides with that of X when X is negatively curved. This
result is known to be false when X is the Euclidean space.
