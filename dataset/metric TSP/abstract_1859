We study the existence of tangent lines, i.e. subsets of the tangent space
isometric to the real line, in tangent spaces of metric spaces. We first
revisit the almost everywhere metric differentiability of Lipschitz continuous
curves. We then show that any blow-up done at a point of metric
differentiability and of density one for the domain of the curve gives a
tangent line.
  Metric differentiability enjoys a Borel measurability property and this will
permit us to use it in the framework of Lipschitz differentiability spaces. We
show that any tangent space of a Lipschitz differentiability space contains at
least $n$ distinct tangent lines, obtained as the blow-up of $n$ Lipschitz
curves, where $n$ is the dimension of the local measurable chart. Under
additional assumptions on the space, such as curvature lower bounds, these $n$
distinct tangent lines span an $n$-dimensional part of the tangent space.
