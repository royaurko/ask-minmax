We study the eigenvalues of the angular equation arising after the separation
of the Dirac equation in the extreme Kerr metric. To this purpose a
self-adjoint holomorphic operator family associated to this eigenvalue problem
is considered. We show that the eigenvalues satisfy a first order nonlinear
differential equation with respect to the black hole mass and we solve it.
Finally, we prove that there exist no bound states for the Dirac equation in
the aforementioned metric.
