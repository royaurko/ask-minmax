An explicit 3-dimensional Riemannian metric is constructed which can be
interpreted as the (conformal) sum of two Kerr black holes with aligned angular
momentum. When the separation distance between them is large we prove that this
metric has positive Ricci scalar and hence positive Yamabe invariant. This
metric can be used to construct axially symmetric initial data for two Kerr
black holes with large angular momentum.
