We give an exact solution of the quadratic gravity in D dimensions. The
solution is a plane fronted wave metric with a cosmological constant. This
metric solves not only the full quadratic gravity field equations but also the
linearized ones which include the linearized equations of the recently found
critical gravity. A subset of the solutions change the asymptotic structure of
the anti-de Sitter space due to their logarithmic behavior.
