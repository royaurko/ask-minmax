We present new non-Ricci-flat Kahler metrics with U(N) and O(N) isometries as
target manifolds of superconformally invariant sigma models with an anomalous
dimension. They are so-called Ricci solitons, special solutions to a Ricci-flow
equation. These metrics explicitly contain the anomalous dimension and reduce
to Ricci-flat Kahler metrics on the canonical line bundles over certain coset
spaces in the limit of vanishing anomalous dimension.
