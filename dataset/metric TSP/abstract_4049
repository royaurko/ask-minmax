Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. This paper is
concerned with the set of scalar-flat metrics which are in the conformal class
of g and have the boundary as a constant mean curvature hypersurface. We prove
that this set is compact for dimensions greater than or equal to 7 under the
generic condition that the trace-free 2nd fundamental form of the boundary is
nonzero everywhere.
