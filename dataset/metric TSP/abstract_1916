We study a time-dependent 5D metric which contains a static 4D sub-metric
whose 3D part is spherically symmetric. An expansion in the metric coefficient
allow us to obtain close-to Schwarzschild approximation to a class of
spherically-symmetric solutions. Using Campbell's embedding theorem and the
induced-matter formalism we obtain two 4D solutions. One describes a source
with the stiff equation of state believed to be applicable to dense
astrophysical objects, and the other describes a spherical source with a radial
heat flow.
