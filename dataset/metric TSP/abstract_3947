We investigate the geometry of a normal bundle equipped with a
$(p,q)$-metric, i.e., Riemannian metric of Cheeger-Gromoll type, to the
submanifold of a Riemannian manifold. We derive all natural object as the
Levi-Civita connection, curvature tensor, sectional and scalar curvature. We
prove that under some natural conditions the sectional curvature of this bundle
may be bounded from below by given arbitrary large positive constant. Next we
investigate $(p,q)$-metrics from the complex geometry point of view. We show
when the normal bundle can by equipped with a structure of almost Hermitian,
almost K\"ahlerian, conformally almost K\"ahlerian or K\"ahlerian manifold.
