We have studied the S=1/2 quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet TiOCl using
single crystal x-ray diffraction and inelastic x-ray scattering techniques. The
Ti ions form staggered spin chains which dimerize below Tc1 = 66 K and have an
incommensurate lattice distortion between Tc1 and Tc2 = 92 K. Based on our
measurements of the intensities, wave vectors, and harmonics of the
incommensurate superlattice peaks, we construct a model for the incommensurate
modulation. The results are in good agreement with a soliton lattice model,
though some quantitative discrepancies exist near Tc2. The behavior of the
phonons has been studied using inelastic x-ray scattering with ~2 meV energy
resolution. For the first time, a zone boundary phonon which softens at the
spin-Peierls temperature Tsp has been observed. Our results show reasonably
good quantitative agreement with the Cross-Fisher theory for the phonon
dynamics at wave vectors near the zone boundary and temperatures near Tsp.
However, not all aspects of the data can be described, such as the strong
overdamping of the soft mode above Tsp. Overall, our results show that TiOCl is
a good realization of a spin-Peierls system, where the phonon softening allows
us to identify the transition temperature as Tsp=Tc2=92 K
