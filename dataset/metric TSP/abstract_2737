Let $A\subseteq\mathbb C$ be a starlike set with a center $a$. We prove that
every tangent space to $A$ at the point $a$ is isometric to the smallest closed
cone, with the vertex $a$, which includes $A$. A partial converse to this
result is obtained. The tangent space to convex sets is also discussed.
