The Newman-Janis algorithm is supplemented with a null rotation and applied
to the tensors of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime to generate the metric,
Maxwell, Ricci and Weyl tensors for the Kerr-Newman spacetime. This procedure
also provides a mechanism whereby the Carter Killing tensor arises from the
geodesic angular momentum tensor of the underlying Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric.
The conformal Killing tensor in the Kerr-Newman spacetime is generated in a
similar fashion. The extended algorithm is also applied to the Killing vectors
of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime with interesting consequences. The
Schwarzschild to Kerr transformation is a special case.
