We study harmonic almost contact structures in the context of contact metric
manifolds, and an analysis is carried out when such a manifold fibres over an
almost Hermitian manifold, as exemplified by the Boothby-Wang fibration. Two
types of almost contact metric warped products are also studied, relating their
harmonicity to that of the almost Hermitian structure on the base or fibre.
