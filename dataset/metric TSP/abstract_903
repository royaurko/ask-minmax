We prove that every strong A-infinity weight is a Muckenhoupt weight in
Ahlfors-regular metric measure spaces that support a Poincare inequality. We
also explore the relations between various definitions for A-infinity weights
in this setting, since some of these characterizations are needed in the proof
of the main result.
