We present the results of XMM-Newton survey of the northern part of the disk
of M31. The results of a spectral and timing analysis of the thirty seven
brightest sources are presented. Combining the results of X-ray analysis with
available data at other wavelengths, we were able to classify ~50%, or 19 out
of 37 sources. Two sources in our sample were previously unknown: the hard
X-ray source XMMU J004415.8+413057 and a transient supersoft source
XMMUJ004414.1+412206. We report the discovery of possible X-ray pulsations from
the source XMMUJ004415.8+413057 with a period of 197 s. The spectral and timing
properties of XMMU J004415.8+413057 make it first accreting X-ray pulsar
candidate detected in M31. We report on the first unambiguous detection of the
soft unresolved X-ray emission from the disk of M31. The unresolved emission
follows the pattern of the spiral arms and can be traced up to distance of ~0.5
deg (~7 kpc at 760 kpc) from the center of the galaxy. The spectrum of the
unresolved emission shows dominant soft thermal component which can be fitted
with a ~0.3 keV optically thin thermal plasma emission models. We suggest that
significant part of this diffuse soft X-ray component may represent hot diffuse
gas in the spiral arms of M31 and emission from normal stars in the disk of
M31.
