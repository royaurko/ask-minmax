We study the regularity properties for solutions of a class of Schr\"odinger
equations $(\Delta + V) u = 0$ on a stratified space $M$ endowed with an
iterated edge metric. The focus is on obtaining optimal H\"older regularity of
these solutions assuming fairly minimal conditions on the underlying metric and
potential.
