Among all conformal classes of Riemannian metrics on ${\Bbb CP}_2$, that of
the Fubini-Study metric is shown to have the largest Yamabe constant. The
proof, which involves perturbations of the Seiberg-Witten equations, also
yields new results on the total scalar curvature of almost-K\"ahler
4-manifolds.
