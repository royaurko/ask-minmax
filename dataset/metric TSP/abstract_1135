Two metrics $g $ and $\bar g$ are geodesically equivalent, if they share the
same (unparameterized) geodesics. We introduce two constructions that allow one
to reduce many natural problems related to geodesically equivalent metrics,
such as the classification of local normal forms and the Lie problem (the
description of projective vector fields), to the case when the (1,1)-tensor
$G^i_j:= g^{ik} \bar g_{kj}$ has one real eigenvalue, or two complex conjugate
eigenvalues, and give first applications. As a part of the proof of the main
result, we generalize Topalov-Sinjukov (hierarchy) Theorem for
pseudo-Riemannian metrics
