We study heat semigroups generated by self-adjoint Laplace operators on
metric graphs characterized by the property that the local scattering matrices
associated with each vertex of the graph are independent from the spectral
parameter. For such operators we prove a representation for the heat kernel as
a sum over all walks with given initial and terminal edges. Using this
representation a trace formula for heat semigroups is proven. Applications of
the trace formula to inverse spectral and scattering problems are also
discussed.
