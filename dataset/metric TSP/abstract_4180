In this paper, we define a new metric family based on two concepts: The
definition of the stopping criterion and the notion of satisfaction, where the
former depends on the willingness and expectation of a user exploring search
results. Both concepts have been discussed so far in the IR literature, but we
argue in this paper that defining a proper single valued metric depends on
merging them into a single conceptual framework.
