A coordinate system that blockwise-simplifies the Kerr-Newman black hole's
thermodynamical state space Ruppeiner metric geometry is constructed, with
discussion of the limiting cases corresponding to simpler black holes. It is
deduced that one of the three conformal Killing vectors of the
Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr cases (whose thermodynamical state space metrics
are 2 by 2 and conformally flat) survives generalization to the Kerr-Newman
case's 3 by 3 thermodynamical state space metric.
