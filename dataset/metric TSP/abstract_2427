We give a survey of our recent work describing a method which combines the
Sasaki join construction with the admissible K\"ahler construction of to obtain
new extremal and new constant scalar curvature Sasaki metrics, including
Sasaki-Einstein metrics. The constant scalar curvature Sasaki metrics also
provide explicit solutions to the CR Yamabe problem. In this regard we give
examples of the lack of uniqueness when the Yamabe invariant is positive.
