A classical foundation for an idea of reality condition in the context of
spin foams (Barrett-Crane models) is developed. I extract classical real
general relativity (all signatures) from complex general relativity by imposing
the area metric reality constraint; the area metric is real iff a
non-degenerate metric is real or imaginary. First I review the Plebanski theory
of complex general relativity starting from a complex vectorial action. Then I
modify the theory by adding a Lagrange multiplier to impose the area metric
reality condition and derive classical real general relativity. I investigate
two types of action: Complex and Real. All the non-trivial solutions of the
field equations of the theory with the complex action correspond to real
general relativity. Half the non-trivial solutions of the field equations of
the theory with the real action correspond to real general relativity.
Discretization of the area metric reality constraint in the context of
Barrett-Crane theory is discussed. In the context of Barrett-Crane theory the
area metric reality condition is equivalent to the condition that the scalar
products of the bivectors associated to the triangles of a four simplex be
real. The Plebanski formalism for the degenerate case and Palatini formalism
are also briefly discussed by including the area metric reality condition.
