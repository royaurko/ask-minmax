In this paper we show that there exists a new symmetry in the relativistic
wave equation for a scalar field in arbitrary dimensions. This symmetry is
related to redefinitions of the metric tensor which implement a map between
non-equivalent manifolds. It is possible to interpret these transformations as
a generalization of the conformal transformations. In addition, one can show
that this set of manifolds together with the transformation connecting its
metrics forms a group. As long as the scalar field dynamics is invariant under
these transformations, there immediately appears an ambiguity concerning the
definition of the underlying background geometry.
