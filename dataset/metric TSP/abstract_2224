We find coordinates, the metric tensor, the inverse metric tensor and the
Laplace-Beltrami operator for the orbit space of Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory
on a finite, rectangular lattice. This is done using a complete axial gauge
fixing. The Gribov problem can be completely solved, with no remaining gauge
ambiguities.
