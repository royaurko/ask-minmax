Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian spin manifold. The constant term in the
expansion of the Green function for the Dirac operator at a fixed point $p\in
M$ is called the mass endomorphism in $p$ associated to the metric $g$ due to
an analogy to the mass in the Yamabe problem. We show that the mass
endomorphism of a generic metric on a three-dimensional spin manifold is
nonzero. This implies a strict inequality which can be used to avoid
bubbling-off phenomena in conformal spin geometry.
