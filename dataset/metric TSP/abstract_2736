In this manuscript, it is shown that the Pioneer anomaly is the local
evidence for an expanding universe. In other words, its value is a direct
measure of the Hubble constant while its sign shows the expanding behavior of
the dynamics of the universe. This analysis is obtained by studying the radial
geodesic deviation of the light rays in the perturbed
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric in the Newtonian gauge.
