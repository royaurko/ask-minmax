We extend a recent result of Burns, Guillemin and Uribe on the asymptotics of
the spectral measure for the reduction metric on a toric variety to any toric
metric on a toric variety. We show how this extended result together with the
Tian-Yau-Zelditch asymptotic expansion can be used to deduce Abreu's formula
for the scalar curvature of a toric metric on a toric variety in terms of
polytope data.
