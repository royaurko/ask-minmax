We comment on the structure of intersecting black p-brane solutions in string
theory explaining how known solutions can be obtained from Schwarzschild
solution simply by sequences of boosts and dualities. This implies, in
particular, that dimensional reduction in all internal world-volume directions
including time leads to a metric (related by analytic continuation to a
cosmological metric) which does not depend on p-brane charges, i.e. is the same
as the metric following by reduction from a higher-dimensional `neutral'
Schwarzschild black hole.
