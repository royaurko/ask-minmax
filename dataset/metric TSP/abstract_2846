We construct a hermitian metric on the classifying spaces of graded-polarized
mixed Hodge structures and prove analogs of the strong distance estimate
between an admissible period map and the approximating nilpotent orbit. We also
consider the asymptotic behavior of the biextension metric, the norm estimates
and the asymptotics of the reduced limit Hodge filtration.
