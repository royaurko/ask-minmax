Let $\Psi_1,\Psi_2,...$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random Lipschitz functions on
a complete separable metric space with unbounded metric $d$ and forward
iterations $X_n$. Suppose that $X_n$ has a stationary distribution. We study
the stationary tail behavior of the functional $D_n=d(x_0,X_n)$, $x_0$ an
arbitrary reference point, by providing bounds for these random variables in
terms of simple contractive iterated function systems on the nonnegative
halfline. Our results provide bounds for the lower and upper tail index of
$D_n$ and will be illustrated by a number of popular examples including the
AR(1) model with ARCH errors and random logistic transforms.
