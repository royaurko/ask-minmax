We discuss a certain Riemannian metric, related to the toric Kahler-Einstein
equation, that is associated in a linearly-invariant manner with a given
log-concave measure in R^n. We use this metric in order to bound the second
derivatives of the solution to the toric Kahler-Einstein equation, and in order
to obtain spectral-gap estimates similar to those of Payne and Weinberger.
