In this paper, we introduce the first Aeppli-Chern class for complex
manifolds and show that the $(1,1)$- component of the curvature $2$-form of the
Levi-Civita connection on the anti-canonical line bundle represents this class.
We also derive curvature relations on Hermitian manifolds and the background
Riemannian manifolds. Moreover, we study non-K\"ahler Calabi-Yau manifolds by
using the first Aeppli-Chern class and the Levi-Civita Ricci-flat metrics. In
particular, we construct explicit Levi-Civita Ricci-flat metrics on Hopf
manifolds $S^{2n-1}\times S^1$. We also construct a smooth family of Gauduchon
metrics on a compact Hermitian manifolds such that the metrics are in the same
first Aeppli-Chern class, and their first Chern-Ricci curvatures are the same
and nonnegative, but their Riemannian scalar curvatures are constant and vary
smoothly between negative infinity and a positive number. In particular, we
show that Hermitian manifolds with nonnegative first Chern class can admit
Hermitian metrics with strictly negative Riemannian scalar curvatures.
