In this paper, we discuss the decomposition of a Lie group with a left
invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric and the uniqueness. In fact, it is a
decomposition of a Lie group into totally geodesic sub-manifolds which is
different from the De Rham decomposition on a Lie group. As an application, we
give a decomposition of a Lie group with a left invariant pseudo-Riemannian
Einstein metric, and prove that the decomposition is unique up to the order of
the parts in the decomposition.
