We obtain the energy and momentum densities of a general static axially
symmetric vacuum space-time described by the Weyl metric, using Landau-Lifshitz
and Bergmann-Thomson energy-momentum complexes. These two definitions of the
energy-momentum complex do not provide the same energy density for the
space-time under consideration, while give the same momentum density. We show
that, in the case of Curzon metric which is a particular case of the Weyl
metric, these two definitions give the same energy only when $R \to \infty$.
Furthermore, we compare these results with those obtained using Einstein,
Papapetrou and M{\o}ller energy momentum complexes.
