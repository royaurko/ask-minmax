We consider the metric exterior to a charged dilaton black hole in a de
Sitter universe. We study the motion of a test particle in this metric.
Conserved quantities are identified and the Hamilton-Jacobi method is employed
for the solutions of the equations of motion. At large distances from the black
hole the Hubble expansion of the universe modifies the effective potential such
that bound orbits could exist up to an upper limit of the angular momentum per
mass for the orbiting test particle. We then study the phenomenon of strong
field gravitational lensing by these black holes by extending the standard
formalism of strong lensing to the non-asymptotically flat dilaton-de Sitter
metric. Expressions for the various lensing quantities are obtained in terms of
the metric coefficients.
