In this article we define and study a notion of asymptotic rank for metric
spaces and show in our main theorem that for a large class of spaces, the
asymptotic rank is characterized by the growth of the higher filling functions.
For a proper, cocompact, simply-connected geodesic metric space of
non-curvature in the sense of Alexandrov the asymptotic rank equals its
Euclidean rank.
