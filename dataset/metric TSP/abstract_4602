The scattering operators associated to an ACHE metric of Bergman type on a
strictly pseudovonvex domain are a one-parameter family of CR-conformally
invariant pseudodifferntial operators of Heisenberg class with respect to the
induced CR structure on the boundary. In this paper, we mainly show that if the
boundary Webster scalar curvature is positive, then for $\gamma\in(0,1)$ the
renormalised scattering operator $P_{2\gamma}$ has positive spectrum and
satisfies the maximum principal; moreover, the fractional curvature
$Q_{2\gamma}$ is also positive. This is parallel to the result of
Guillarmou-Qing \cite{GQ} for the real case. We also give two energy extension
formulae for $P_{2\gamma}$, which are parallel to the energy extension given by
Chang-Case \cite{CC} for the real case.
