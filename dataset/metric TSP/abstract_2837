We review some classical differentiation theorems for measures, showing how
they can be turned into an integral representation of a Borel measure with
respect to a fixed Carath\'eodory measure. We focus our attention on the case
this measure is the spherical Hausdorff measure, giving a metric measure area
formula. Our point consists in using certain covering derivatives as
"generalized densities". Some consequences for the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg
group are also pointed out.
