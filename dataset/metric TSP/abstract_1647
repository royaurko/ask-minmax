In contrast to the usual Lipschitz seminorms associated to ordinary metrics
on compact spaces, we show by examples that Lipschitz seminorms on possibly
non-commutative compact spaces are usually not determined by the restriction of
the metric they define on the state space, to the extreme points of the state
space. We characterize the Lipschitz norms which are determined by their metric
on the whole state space as being those which are lower semicontinuous. We show
that their domain of Lipschitz elements can be enlarged so as to form a dual
Banach space, which generalizes the situation for ordinary Lipschitz seminorms.
We give a characterization of the metrics on state spaces which come from
Lipschitz seminorms. The natural (broader) setting for these results is
provided by the ``function spaces'' of Kadison. A variety of methods for
constructing Lipschitz seminorms is indicated.
