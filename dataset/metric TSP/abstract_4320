Let $\mathcal{H}_{n,k}(\Sigma)$ be the space of degree $n\geq 1$ holomorphic
maps from a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma $ to $\mathbb{C}P^k$. In the case
$\Sigma=S^2$ and $n=1$, the $L^2$ metric on $\mathcal{H}_{1,k}(S^2)$ was
computed exactly by Speight. In this paper, the Ricci curvature tensor and the
scalar curvature on $\mathcal{H}_{1,k}(S^2)$ are determined explicitly for
$k\geq 2$. An exact direct computation of the Einstein-Hilbert action with
respect to the $L^2$ metric on $\mathcal{H}_{1,k}(S^2)$ is made and shown to
coincide with a formula conjectured by Baptista.
