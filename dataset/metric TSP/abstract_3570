Barber's second self creation theory with bulk viscous fluid source for an
LRS Bianchi type-I metric is considered by using deceleration parameter to be
constant where the metric potentials are taken as function of $x$ and $t$. The
coefficient of bulk viscosity is assumed to be a power function of the mass
density. Some physical and geometrical features of the models are discussed
