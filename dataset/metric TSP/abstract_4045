Let $S$ be a Riemann surface of analytic finite type or the unit disk in the
complex plane. Let $[\mu]$ denote the Teichm\"uller equivalence classes of
Beltrami differentials $\mu $. We apply the Fundamental Inequalities to obtain
a binary infinitesimal form of Teichm\"uller metric. Using this form, we define
"\emph{angle}" between two geodesics originating from a point and conjecture
that the sum of the angles of a triangle in $T(S)$ should be less than $\pi$ if
$S$ is of analytic finite type. As a consequence, the well-known necessary
condition for two geodesics coinciding is derived immediately.
