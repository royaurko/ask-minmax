Noting that the complete lift of a Rimannian metric defined on a
differentiable manifold is not 0-homogeneous on the fibers of the tangent
bundle . In this paper we introduce a new lift which is 0-homogeneous. It
determines on slit tangent bundle a pseudo-Riemannian metric, which depends
only on the metric . We study some of the geometrical properties of this
pseudo-Riemannian space and define the natural almost complex structure and
natural almost product structure which preserve the property of homogeneity and
find some new results.
