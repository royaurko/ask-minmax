We produce new non-K\"ahler complete steady gradient Ricci solitons whose
asymptotics combine those of the Bryant solitons and the Hamilton cigar. We
also obtain a family of complete Ricci-flat metrics with asymptotically locally
conical asymptotics. Finally, we obtain numerical evidence for complete steady
soliton structures on the vector bundles whose distance sphere bundles are
respectively the twistor and ${\rm Sp}(1)$ bundles over quaternionic projective
space.
