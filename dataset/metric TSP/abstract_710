It is well-known that the class of piecewise smooth curves together with a
smooth Riemannian metric induces a metric space structure on a manifold.
However, little is known about the minimal regularity needed to analyze curves
and particularly to study length-minimizing curves where neither classical
techniques such as a differentiable exponential map etc. are available nor
(generalized) curvature bounds are imposed. In this paper we advance
low-regularity Riemannian geometry by investigating general length structures
on manifolds that are equipped with Riemannian metrics of low regularity. We
generalize the length structure by proving that the class of absolutely
continuous curves induces the standard metric space structure. The main result
states that the arc-length of absolutely continuous curves is the same as the
length induced by the metric. For the proof we use techniques from the analysis
of metric spaces and employ specific smooth approximations of continuous
Riemannian metrics. We thus show that when dealing with lengths of curves, the
metric approach for low-regularity Riemannnian manifolds is still compatible
with standard definitions and can successfully fill in for lack of
differentiability.
