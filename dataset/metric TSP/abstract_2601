We consider the stable dependence of solutions to wave equations on metrics
in C^{1,1} class. The main result states that solutions depend uniformly
continuously on the metric, when the Cauchy data is given in a range of Sobolev
spaces. The proof is constructive and uses the wave packet approach to
hyperbolic equations.
