We elaborate upon a bijection discovered by Cools, Draisma, Payne, and Robeva
between the set of rectangular standard Young tableaux and the set of
equivalence classes of chip configurations on certain metric graphs under the
relation of linear equivalence. We present an explicit formula for computing
the $v_0$-reduced divisors (representatives of the equivalence classes)
associated to given tableaux, and use this formula to prove (i) evacuation of
tableaux corresponds (under the bijection) to reflecting the metric graph, and
(ii) conjugation of the tableaux corresponds to taking the Riemann-Roch dual of
the divisor.
