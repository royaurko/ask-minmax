Let $\Gamma$ denote a lattice in $SU(1,p)$, with $p$ greater than 1. We show
that there exists no Zariski dense maximal representation with target $SU(m,n)$
if $n>m>1$. The proof is geometric and is based on the study of the rigidity
properties of the geometry whose points are isotropic $m$-subspaces of a
complex vector space $V$ endowed with a Hermitian metric $h$ of signature
$(m,n)$ and whose lines correspond to the $2m$ dimensional subspaces of $V$ on
which the restriction of $h$ has signature $(m,m)$.
