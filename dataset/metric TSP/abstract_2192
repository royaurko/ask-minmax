In this paper we study ``Bergman-type'' singular integral operators on
Ahlfors regular metric spaces. The main result of the paper demonstrates that
if a singular integral operator on a Ahlfors regular metric space satisfies an
additional estimate, then knowing the ``T(1)'' conditions for the operator
imply that the operator is bounded on $L^2$. The method of proof of the main
result is an extension and another application of the work originated by
Nazarov, Treil and the first contributor on non-homogeneous harmonic analysis.
