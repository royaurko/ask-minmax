We present a survey of the known cosmological and black hole solutions in
ghost-free bigravity and massive gravity theories. These can be divided into
three classes. First, there are solutions with proportional metrics, which are
the same as in General Relativity with a cosmological term, which can be
positive, negative or zero. Secondly, for spherically symmetric systems, there
are solutions with non-bidiagonal metrics. The g-metric fulfills Einstein
equations with a positive cosmological term and a matter source, while the
f-metric is anti-de Sitter. The third class contains solutions with bidiagonal
metrics, and these can be quite complex. The time-dependent solutions describe
homogeneous (isotropic or anisotropic) cosmologies which show a late-time
self-acceleration or other types of behavior. The static solutions describe
black holes with a massive graviton hair, and also globally regular lumps of
energy. None of these are asymptotically flat. Including a matter source gives
rise to asymptotically flat solutions which exhibit the Vainshtein mechanism of
recovery of General Relativity in a finite region.
