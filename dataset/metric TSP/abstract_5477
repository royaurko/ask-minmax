We define and study a metric independence notion in a homogeneous metric
abstract elementary class with perturbations that is $d^p$-superstable
(superstable wrt. the perturbation topology), weakly simple and has complete
type spaces. We introduce a way to measure the dependence of a tuple $a$ from a
set $B$ over another set $A$. We prove basic properties of the notion, e.g.
that $a$ is independent of $B$ over $A$ (in the usual sense of homogeneous
model theory) iff the measure of dependence is $<\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon
>0$. As an application, we show that weak simplicity implies (a very strong
form of) simplicity and study the question when the dependence inside a set of
all realisations of some type can be seen to arise from a pregeometry in cases
when the type is not regular. In the end of the paper, we demonstrate our
notions and results in an example class built from the $p$-adic integers.
