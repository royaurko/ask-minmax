We obtain explicit and simple conditions which in many cases allow one
decide, whether or not a Denjoy domain endowed with the Poincare or
quasihyperbolic metric is Gromov hyperbolic. The criteria are based on the
Euclidean size of the complement. As a corollary, the main theorem allows to
deduce the non-hyperbolicity of any periodic Denjoy domain.
