In the neighborhood of a regular point, generalized Kahler geometry admits a
description in terms of a single real function, the generalized Kahler
potential. We study the local conditions for a generalized Kahler manifold to
be a generalized Calabi-Yau manifold and we derive a non-linear PDE that the
generalized Kahler potential has to satisfy for this to be true. This
non-linear PDE can be understood as a generalization of the complex
Monge-Ampere equation and its solutions give supergravity solutions with
metric, dilaton and H-field.
