We review our recent work on applying the Google PageRank algorithm to find
scientific "gems" among all Physical Review publications, and its extension to
CiteRank, to find currently popular research directions. These metrics provide
a meaningful extension to traditionally-used importance measures, such as the
number of citations and journal impact factor. We also point out some pitfalls
of over-relying on quantitative metrics to evaluate scientific quality.
