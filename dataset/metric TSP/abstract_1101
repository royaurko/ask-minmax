Recall that the usual Einstein metrics are those for which the first Ricci
contraction of the covariant Riemann curvature tensor is proportional to the
metric. Assuming the same type of restrictions but instead on the different
contractions of Thorpe tensors, one gets several natural generalizations of
Einstein's condition. In this paper, we study some properties of these classes
of metrics.
