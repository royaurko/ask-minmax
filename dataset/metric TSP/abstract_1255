We present ALH hyperkahler metrics induced from well-separated SU(2) monopole
walls which are equivalent to monopoles on T^2 x R. The metrics are explicitly
obtained due to Manton's observation by using explicit monopole solutions.
These are doubly-periodic and have the modular invariance with respect to the
complex structure of the complex torus T^2. We also derive metrics from
monopole walls with Dirac-type singularities.
