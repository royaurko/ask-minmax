The coordinate conditions for three exact solutions for the metric components
of a coordinate system with constant acceleration or of a static plane
symmetric gravitational field are presented. First, the coordinate condition
that the acceleration of light is constant is applied to the field equations to
derive the metric of a coordinate system of constant acceleration. Second, the
coordinate conditions required to produce the metrics of Rindler and Lass are
applied to the field equations to calculate the components of these two metrics
and the coordinate velocities and coordinate accelerations for light of these
two metrics are compared to the coordinate system of constant acceleration.
