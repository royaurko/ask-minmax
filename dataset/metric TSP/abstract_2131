We show that only two types of effective metrics are possible in certain
nonlinear electromagnetic theories. This is achieved by using the dependence of
the effective metric on the energy-momentum tensor of the background along with
the Segr\`e classification of the latter. Each of these forms is completely
determined by single scalar function, which characterizes the light cone of the
nonlinear theory. We compare this light cone with that of Minkowski in two
examples.
