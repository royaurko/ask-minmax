Let $G$ be a connected graph and $W=\{ w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_k \} \subseteq
V(G)$ be an ordered set. For every vertex $v$, the metric representation of $v$
with respect to $W$ is an ordered $k$-vector defined as $r(v|W):=(d(v,w_1),
d(v,w_2), \ldots, d(v,w_k))$, where $d(x,y)$ is the distance between the
vertices $x$ and $y$. The set $W$ is called a resolving set for $G$ if distinct
vertices of $G$ have distinct representations with respect to $W$. The minimum
cardinality of a resolving set for $G$ is its metric dimension and is denoted
by $dim(G)$. In this paper, we study the metric dimension of tensor product of
cliques and prove some bounds. Then we determine the metric dimension of tensor
product of two cliques.
