Let $G$ be a simple compact connected Lie group. We study homogeneous
Einstein metrics for a class of compact homogeneous spaces, namely generalized
flag manifolds $G/H$ with second Betti number $b_{2}(G/H)=1$. There are 8
infinite families $G/H$ corresponding to a classical simple Lie group $G$ and
25 exceptional flag manifolds, which all have some common geometric features;
for example they admit a unique invariant complex structure which gives rise to
unique invariant K\"ahler--Einstein metric. The most typical examples are the
compact isotropy irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces for which the Killing
form is the unique homogeneous Einstein metric (which is K\"ahler). For
non-isotropy irreducible spaces the classification of homogeneous Einstein
metrics has been completed for 24 of the 26 cases. In this paper we construct
the Einstein equation for the two unexamined cases, namely the flag manifolds
$\E_8/\U(1)\times \SU(4)\times \SU(5)$ and $\E_8/\U(1)\times \SU(2)\times
\SU(3)\times \SU(5)$. In order to determine explicitly the Ricci tensors of an
$\E_8$-invariant metric we use a method based on the Riemannian submersions.
For both spaces we classify all homogeneous Einstein metrics and thus we
conclude that any flag manifold $G/H$ with $b_{2}(M)=1$ admits a finite number
of non-isometric non-K\"ahler invariant Einstein metrics. The precise number of
these metrics is given in Table 1.
