In this work we study in detail new kinds of motions of the metric tensor.
The work is divided into two main parts. In the first part we study the general
existence of Kerr-Schild motions --a recently introduced metric motion. We show
that generically, Kerr-Schild motions give rise to finite dimensional Lie
algebras and are isometrizable, i.e., they are in a one-to-one correspondence
with a subset of isometries of a (usually different) spacetime. This is similar
to conformal motions. There are however some exceptions that yield infinite
dimensional algebras in any dimension of the manifold. We also show that
Kerr-Schild motions may be interpreted as some kind of metric symmetries in the
sense of having associated some geometrical invariants. In the second part, we
suggest a scheme able to cope with other new candidates of metric motions from
a geometrical viewpoint. We solve a set of new candidates which may be
interpreted as the seeds of further developments and relate them with known
methods of finding new solutions to Einstein's field equations. The results are
similar to those of Kerr-Schild motions, yet a richer algebraical structure
appears. In conclusion, even though several points still remain open, the
wealth of results shows that the proposed concept of generalized metric motions
is meaningful and likely to have a spin-off in gravitational physics.We end by
listing and analyzing some of those open points.
