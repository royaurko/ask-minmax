We use the Bradlow parameter expansion to construct the metric tensor in the
space of solutions of the Bogomolny equations for the Abelian Higgs model on a
two-dimensional torus. Using this metric we study the dynamics and scattering
of vortices on the torus within the geodesic approximation. For small torus
volumes the metric is determined in terms of a small number of parameters. For
large volumes the results provide a very precise approximation to the metric
and dynamics on the plane.
