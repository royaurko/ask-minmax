The fundamental role played by black holes in our study of microquasars,
gamma ray bursts, and the outflows from active galactic nuclei requires an
appreciation for, and at times some in-depth analysis of, curved spacetime. We
highlight misconceptions surrounding the notion of coordinate transformation in
general relativity as applied to metrics for rotating black holes that are
beginning to increasingly appear in the literature. We emphasize that there is
no coordinate transformation that can turn the metric of a rotating spacetime
into that for a Schwarzschild spacetime, or more generally, that no coordinate
transformation exists that can diagonalize the metric for a rotating spacetime.
We caution against the notion of "local" coordinate transformation, which is
often incorrectly associated with a global analysis of the spacetime.
