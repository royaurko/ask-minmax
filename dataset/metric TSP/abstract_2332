We consider the wave equation for a stationary Lorentzian metric in the case
of two space dimensions. Assuming that the metric has a singularity of the
appropriate form, surrounded by an ergosphere which is a smooth Jordan curve,
we prove the existence of a black hole. It is shown that the boundary of the
black hole (the event horizon) is not in general a smooth curve. We demonstrate
this in a physical model for acoustic black holes, where the event horizon may
have corners.
