Otsuki tori form a countable family of immersed minimal two-dimensional tori
in the unitary three-dimensional sphere. According to El Soufi-Ilias theorem,
the metrics on the Otsuki tori are extremal for some unknown eigenvalues of the
Laplace-Beltrami operator. Despite the fact that the Otsuki tori are defined in
quite an implicit way, we find explicitly the numbers of the corresponding
extremal eigenvalues. In particular we provide an extremal metric for the third
eigenvalue of the torus.
