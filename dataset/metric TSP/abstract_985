In this paper we prove existence of complete minimal surfaces in some metric
semidirect products. These surfaces are similar to the doubly and singly
periodic Scherk minimal surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$. In particular, we obtain
these surfaces in the Heisenberg space with its canonical metric, and in Sol3
with a one-parameter family of non-isometric metrics.
