In this paper we study a solution of heterotic string theory corresponding to
a rotating Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime. It has an exact CFT description as a
heterotic coset model, and a Lagrangian formulation as a gauged WZNW model. It
is a generalisation of a recently discussed stringy Taub-NUT solution, and is
interesting as another laboratory for studying the fate of closed timelike
curves and cosmological singularities in string theory. We extend the
computation of the exact metric and dilaton to this rotating case, and then
discuss some properties of the metric, with particular emphasis on the
curvature singularities.
