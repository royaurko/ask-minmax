According to the socalled "quasi-metric" framework developed elsewhere, the
cosmic expansion applies directly to gravitationally bound systems. This
prediction has a number of observable consequences, none of which are in
conflict with observation. In this paper we compare test particle motion in the
nonstatic gravitational field outside a spherically symmetric source (as
predicted by a quasi-metric theory of gravity) to test particle motion in the
Schwarzschild geometry. It is found that if one incorrectly uses the
Schwarzschild geometry (to the relevant accuracy) to represent the nonstatic
quasi-metric model, the largest errors result from the mismodelling of null
paths. One consequence of this is that using electromagnetic signals to track
the motion of a non-relativistic particle results in the illusion that the
particle is influenced by an anomalous force of size cH (where H is the Hubble
parameter) directed towards the observer. This result naturally explains the
apparently anomalous force acting on the Pioneer 10/11, Galileo and Ulysses
spacecraft as inferred from radiometric data.
