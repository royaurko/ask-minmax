We present an example of a zero-dimensional compact metric space $X$ and its
closed subspace $A$ such that there is no continuous linear extension operator
for the Lipschitz pseudometrics on $A$ to the Lipschitz pseudometrics on $X$.
The construction is based on results of A. Brudnyi and Yu. Brudnyi concerning
linear extension operators for Lipschitz functions.
