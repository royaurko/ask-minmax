We define a criterion for a homogeneous, complete metric structure $X$ that
implies that the automorphism group $\mbox{Aut}(X)$ satisfies all the main
consequences of the existence of ample generics: it has the small index
property, the automatic continuity property, and uncountable cofinality for
non-open subgroups. Then we verify it for the Urysohn space $\mbox{U}$, the
Lebesgue probability measure algebra $\mbox{MALG}$, and the Hilbert space
$\ell_2$, thus proving that $\mbox{Iso}(\mbox{U})$, $\mbox{Aut}(\mbox{MALG})$,
$U(\ell_2)$, and $O(\ell_2)$ share these properties. We also formulate a
condition for $X$ which implies that every homomorphism of $\mbox{Aut}(X)$ into
a separable group $K$ with a left-invariant, complete metric, is trivial, and
we verify it for $\mbox{U}$, and $\ell_2$.
