In the present work some examples of toric hyperkahler metrics in eight
dimensions are constructed. First it is described how the Calderbank-Pedersen
metrics arise as a consequence of the Joyce description of selfdual structures
in four dimensions, the Jones-Tod correspondence and a result due to Tod and
Przanowski. It is also shown that any quaternionic Kahler metric with $T^2$
isometry is locally isometric to a Calderbank-Pedersen one. The Swann
construction of hyperkahler metrics in eight dimensions is applied to them to
find hyperkahler examples with $U(1)\times U(1)$ isometry. The connection with
the Pedersen-Poon toric hyperkahler metrics is explained and it is shown that
there is a class of solutions of the generalized monopole equation in
$\mathbb{R}^2 \otimes Im\mathbb{H}$ related to eigenfunctions of certain linear
equation. This hyperkahler examples are lifted to solutions of the D=11
supergravity and type IIA and IIB backgrounds are found by use of dualities. As
before, all the description is achieved in terms of a single eigenfunction F.
Some explicit F are found, together with the Toda structure corresponding to
the trajectories of the Killing vectors of the Calderbank-Pedersen bases.
