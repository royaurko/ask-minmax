I derive the stochastic equation for the perturbations of the metric for a
gauge - invariant energy - momemtum - tensor (EMT) in stochastic inflation. A
quantization for the field that describes the gauge - invariant perturbations
for the metric is developed. In a power - law expansion for the universe the
amplitude for these perturbations on a background metric could be very
important in the infrared sector.
