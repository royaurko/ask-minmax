Recently three proofs of the $A_2$-conjecture were obtained. All of them are
"glued" to euclidian space and a special choice of one random dyadic lattice.
We build a random "dyadic" lattice in any doubling metric space which have
properties that are enough to prove the $A_2$-conjecture in these spaces.
