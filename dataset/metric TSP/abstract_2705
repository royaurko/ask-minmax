In this paper, we define a natural metric on Aut(X*) and prove that the
closure of the adding machine group, a subgroup of the automorphism group, is
both isometric and isomorphic to the group of p-adic integers. So, we show that
the group of p-adic integers can be isometrically embedded into the metric
space Aut(X*).
