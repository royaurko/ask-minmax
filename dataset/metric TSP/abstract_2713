In this paper, first we have established two sets of sufficient conditions
for a TS-IF contractive mapping to have unique fixed point in a intuitionistic
fuzzy metric space. Then we have defined \,$(\,\epsilon \,,\, \lambda\,)$\,
IF-uniformly locally contractive mapping and \,$\eta\,-$\,chainable space,
where it has been proved that the \,$(\,\epsilon \,,\, \lambda\,)$\,
IF-uniformly locally contractive mapping possesses a fixed point
