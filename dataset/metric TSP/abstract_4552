We prove that there is a hyperbolic transcendental entire map that generates
a class of potentials which is different from the ones studied by Mayer and
Urba\'nski (2010). Moreover, a metric on a non-compact subset of the full shift
with a countable alphabet is given, which is not necessarily compatible with
the natural shift metric. This subset encodes the dynamics of a subset of the
Julia set of hyperbolic transcendental maps, which is non-compact and
non-Markov, so we study the existence of a conformal and an invariant
probability measure of the shift on this subset and a class of weakly H\"older
continuous potentials.
