Let $(M, \partial M)$ be a compact 3-manifold with boundary which admits a
complete, convex co-compact hyperbolic metric. For each hyperbolic metric $g$
on $M$ such that $\dr M$ is smooth and strictly convex, the induced metric on
$\dr M$ has curvature $K>-1$, and each such metric on $\dr M$ is obtained for a
unique choice of $g$. A dual statement is that, for each $g$ as above, the
third fundamental form of $\dr M$ has curvature $K<1$, and its closed geodesics
which are contractible in $M$ have length $L>2\pi$. Conversely, any such metric
on $\dr M$ is obtained for a unique choice of $g$.
  We are interested here in the similar situation where $\partial M$ is not
smooth, but rather looks locally like an ideal polyhedron in $H^3$. We can give
a fairly complete answer to the question on the third fundamental form -- which
in this case concerns the dihedral angles -- and some partial results about the
induced metric.
  This has some by-products, like an affine piecewise flat structure on the
Teichmueller space of a surface with some marked points, or an extension of the
Koebe circle packing theorem to many 3-manifolds with boundary.
