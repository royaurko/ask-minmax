We show that, under mild conditions, the space of numerical Bridgeland
stability conditions Stab(T) on a triangulated category T is complete. In
particular the metric on a full component of Stab(T) for which the central
charges factor through a finite rank quotient of the Grothendieck group K(T) is
complete. As an example, we compute the metric on the space of numerical
stability conditions on a smooth complex projective curve of genus greater than
one, and show that in this case the quotient Stab(T)/C by the natural action of
the complex numbers is isometric to the upper half plane equipped with half the
hyperbolic metric.
  We also make two observations about the way in which the heart changes as we
move through the space of stability conditions. Firstly, hearts of stability
conditions in the same component of the space of stability conditions are
related by finite sequences of tilts. Secondly, if each of a convergent
sequence of stability conditions has the same heart then the heart of the
limiting stability condition is obtained from this by a right tilt.
