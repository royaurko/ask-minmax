Diamond gave compact criteria in fuzzy numbers space endowed with $L_p$
metric and compact criteria in the space of fuzzy star-shaped numbers with
respect to the origin endowed with $L_p$ metric. However, these compact
criteria are wrong. Wu and Zhao proposed right characterizations in these two
spaces. Based on this result, Zhao and Wu further gave compact criteria in the
space of fuzzy star-shaped numbers with $L_p$ metric. This paper has three
aims. Since all the above mentioned fuzzy sets spaces are special cases of the
general fuzzy star-shaped numbers space with $L_p$ metric, the first aim is to
give a characterization of compact sets in general fuzzy star-shaped numbers
space with $L_p$ metric. Compare the existing compactness characterizations of
fuzzy sets space endowed with $L_p$ metric with Arzel\`{a}--Ascoli theorem, it
finds that the latter gives the compact criteria by characterizing the totally
bounded sets while the former does not seem to characterize the totally bounded
sets. Since, in metric space, totally boundedness is a key feature of
compactness, the second aim of our paper is to present characterizations of
totally bounded sets in all the above mentioned fuzzy sets spaces equipped with
$L_p$-metric. As Diamond pointed out, all the above mentioned fuzzy sets spaces
with $L_p$-metric are not complete, the third aim of this paper is to construct
the completions of these spaces, and give characterizations of totally bounded
sets and compact sets in the corresponding completions.
