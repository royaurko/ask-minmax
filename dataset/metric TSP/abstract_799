We study the scalar curvature of K\"ahler metrics that have cone
singularities along a divisor, with a particular focus on two classes of such
metrics that enjoy some nice properties: momentum-constructed conically
singular metrics and the metrics of the form $\omega + \lambda \sqrt{-1}
\partial \bar{\partial} |s|^{2 \beta}_h$. Our main result is that, on the
projective completion $\mathbb{P} (\mathcal{F} \oplus \mathbb{C})$ of a
pluricanonical line bundle $\mathcal{F}$ over a product of K\"ahler--Einstein
Fano manifolds with the second Betti number 1, momentum-constructed constant
scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics with cone singularities along the
$\infty$-section exist if and only if the log Futaki invariant vanishes on the
fibrewise $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, giving a supporting evidence to the log
version of the Donaldson--Tian--Yau conjecture for general polarisations. We
also show that, for these classes of conically singular metrics, the scalar
curvature can be defined on the whole manifold as a current, so that we can
compute the log Futaki invariant with respect to them. Finally, we prove some
partial invariance results for them.
