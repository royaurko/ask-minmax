In data analysis, there is a strong demand for graph metrics that differ from
the classical shortest path and resistance distances. Recently, several new
classes of graph metrics have been proposed. This paper presents some of them
featuring the cutpoint additive distances. These include the path distances,
the reliability distance, the walk distances, and the logarithmic forest
distances among others. We discuss a number of connections between these and
other distances.
