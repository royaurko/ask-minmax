We obtain the integral formulae for computing the tetrads and metric
components in Riemann normal coordinates and Fermi coordinate system of an
observer in arbitrary motion. Our approach admits essential enlarging the range
of validity of these coordinates. The results obtained are applied to the
geodesic deviation in the field of a weak plane gravitational wave and the
computation of plane-wave metric in Fermi normal coordinates.
