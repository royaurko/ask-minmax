In this paper, we consider the transceiver and relay design for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular two-way relay channel (cTWRC),
where a multi-antenna base station (BS) exchanges information with multiple
multi-antenna mobile stations via a multi-antenna relay station (RS). We
propose a novel two-way relaying scheme to approach the sum capacity of the
MIMO cTWRC.
