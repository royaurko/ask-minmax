The field equations of the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation are
presented in different representations, related to each other by conformal
transformations of the metric. One of the representations resembles the
Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory, and is the starting point for the generation of
exact electrostatic and magnetostatic exterior solutions. The corresponding
solutions for each specific theory can be obtained by transforming back to the
original canonical representation, and the conversions are given for the
theories of Jordan-Brans-Dicke, Barker, Schwinger, and conformally invariant
coupling. The electrostatic solutions represent the exterior metrics and fields
of configurations where the gravitational and electric equipotential surfaces
have the same symmetry. A particular family of electrostatic solutions is
developed, which includes as special case the spherically symmetric solutions
of the scalar-tensor theories. As expected, they reduce to the well-known
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric when the scalar field is set equal to a constant.
The analysis of the Jordan-Brans-Dicke metric yields an upper bound for the
mass-radius ratio of static stars, for a class of interior structures.
