We give a simple argument to show that no purely metric-based, relativistic
formulation of Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) whose energy
functional is stable (in the sense of being quadratic in perturbations) can be
consistent with the observed amount of gravitational lensing from galaxies. An
important part of the argument is the fact that reproducing the MOND force law
requires any completely stable, metric-based theory of gravity to become
conformally invariant in the weak field limit. We discuss the prospects for a
formulation with a very weak instability.
