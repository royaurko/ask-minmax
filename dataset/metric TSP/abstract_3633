I demonstrate that instability in a system of homogeneous scalar fields leads
to the growth of super-Hubble metric perturbations. This generalizes the result
that parametric resonance can lead to the growth of cosmological perturbations.
Since dynamical chaos is common in multi-field quartically coupled systems, I
argue that the evolution of the fields after inflation must be examined to
determine whether the amplitude of cosmological metric perturbations is
underestimated in the standard inflationary calculations. I illustrate this
effect with a simple hybrid inflation model.
