It is proven that the Wahlquist perfect fluid space-time cannot be smoothly
joined to an exterior asymptotically flat vacuum region. The proof uses a power
series expansion in the angular velocity, to a precision of the second order.
In this approximation, the Wahlquist metric is a special case of the rotating
Whittaker space-time. The exterior vacuum domain is treated in a like manner.
We compute the conditions of matching at the possible boundary surface in both
the interior and the vacuum domain. The conditions for matching the induced
metrics and the extrinsic curvatures are mutually contradictory.
