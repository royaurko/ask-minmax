In this paper, we shall give some affirmative answer to an extremal Kaehler
version of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson Conjecture. For a polarized algebraic
manifold $(X,L)$, we choose a maximal algebraic torus $T$ in the group of
holomorphic automorphisms of $X$. Then the polarization class $c_1(L)$ will be
shown to admit an extremal Kaehler metric if $(X,L)$ is strongly K-stable
relative to $T$.
