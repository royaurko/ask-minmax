The purpose of this paper is to discuss the notion of the quasihyperbolic
volume and to find growth estimates for the quasihyperbolic volume of balls in
a domain $G \subset {\mathbb R}^{n},$ in terms of the radius. It turns out that
in the case of domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries, the rate of growth
depends not merely on the radius but also on the metric structure of the
boundary.
