Off-diagonal upper bounds are established away from the diagonal for the
Bergman kernels associated to high powers of holomorphic line bundles over
compact complex manifolds, asymptotically as the power tends to infinity. The
line bundle is assumed to be equipped with a Hermitian metric with positive
curvature form, which is infinitely differentiable but not necessarily real
analytic. The bounds obtained are the best possible for this class of metrics.
