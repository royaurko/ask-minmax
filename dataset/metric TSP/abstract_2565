We study a novel class of nonsingular time-symmetric cosmological bounces. In
this class of four dimensional models the bounce is induced by a perfect fluid
with a negative energy density. Metric perturbations are solved in an analytic
way all through the bounce. The conditions for generating a scale invariant
spectrum of tensor and scalar metric perturbations are discussed.
