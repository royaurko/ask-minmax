We show that under certain mild conditions, a metric simplicial complex which
satisfies the Ptolemy inequality is a CAT(0) space. Ptolemy's inequality is
closely related to inversions of metric spaces. For a large class of metric
simplicial complexes, we characterize those which are isometric to Euclidean
space in terms of metric inversions.
