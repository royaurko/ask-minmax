Inspired by the recent work of Physicists Hertog-Horowitz-Maeda, we prove two
stability results for compact Riemannian manifolds with nonzero parallel
spinors. Our first result says that Ricci flat metrics which also admits
nonzero parallel spinors are stable (in the direction of changes in conformal
structures) as the critical points of the total scalar curvature functional. In
fact, we show that the Lichnerowicz Laplacian, which governs the second
variation, is the square of a twisted Dirac operator. Our second result, which
is a local version of the first one, shows that any metrics of positive scalar
curvature cannot lie too close to a metric with nonzero parallel spinor. We
also prove a rigidity result for special holonomy metrics. In the case of
$SU(m)$ holonomy, the rigidity result implies that scalar flat deformations of
Calabi-Yau metric must be Calabi-Yau. Finally we explore the connection with
positive mass theorem, which presents another approach to proving these
stability and rigidity results.
