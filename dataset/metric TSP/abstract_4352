We study the existence of invariant metrics with holonomy $G_{2(2)}^* \subset
SO(4,3)$ on compact nilmanifolds, i.e. on compact quotients of nilpotent Lie
groups by discrete subgroups. We prove that, up to isomorphism, there exists
only one indecomposable nilpotent Lie algebra admitting a torsion-free
$G_{2(2)}^*$-structure such that the center is definite with respect to the
induced inner product. In particular, we show that the associated compact
nilmanifold admits a 3-parameter family of invariant metrics with full holonomy
$G_{2(2)}^*$.
