We consider a region $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with boundary $\partial M$ and a
metric $g$ on $M$ conformal to the Euclidean metric. We analyze the inverse
problem, originally formulated by Dix, of reconstructing $g$ from boundary
measurements associated with the single scattering of seismic waves in this
region. In our formulation the measurements determine the shape operator of
wavefronts outside of $M$ originating at diffraction points within $M$. We
develop an explicit reconstruction procedure which consists of two steps. In
the first step we reconstruct the directional curvatures and the metric in what
are essentially Riemmanian normal coordinates; in the second step we develop a
conversion to Cartesian coordinates. We admit the presence of conjugate points.
In dimension $n \geq 3$ both steps involve the solution of a system of ordinary
differential equations. In dimension $n=2$ the same is true for the first step,
but the second step requires the solution of a Cauchy problem for an elliptic
operator which is unstable in general. The first step of the procedure applies
for general metrics.
