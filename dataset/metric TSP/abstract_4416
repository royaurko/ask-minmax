We prove that all collapsible d-complexes linearly embed in R^{2d}; this is
optimal.
  As a consequence, we obtain a Tverberg-type theorem for metric spaces with
curvature bounded above: Given (r-1)(2d+1) + 1 points in a non-positively
curved d-complex, we can partition them into r subsets whose convex hulls
intersect.
  Moreover, all CAT(0) 2-complexes PL-embed in R^4, and all complexes with
discrete Morse vector (1,1,1) embed into R^4 linearly.
