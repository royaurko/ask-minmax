The Einstein-Proca equations, describing a spin-1 massive vector field in
general relativity, are studied in the static, spherically-symmetric case. The
Proca field equation is a highly nonlinear wave equation, but can be solved to
good accuracy in perturbation theory, which should be very accurate for a wide
range of mass scales. The resulting first order metric reduces to the
Reissner-Nordstrom solution in the limit as the range parameter $\mu$ goes to
zero. The additional terms in the $g_{00}$ metric are positive, as in
Reissner-Nordstrom, in agreement with previous numerical solutions, and hence
involve naked singularities.
