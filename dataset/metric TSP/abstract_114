We consider invariant Einstein metrics on the Stiefel manifold $V_q\bb{R} ^n$
of all orthonormal $q$-frames in $\bb{R}^n$. This manifold is diffeomorphic to
the homogeneous space $\SO(n)/\SO(n-q)$ and its isotropy representation
contains equivalent summands. %This causes difficulty in the description of all
$\SO(n)$-invariant metrics.
  We prove, by assuming additional symmetries, that $V_4\bb{R}^n$ $(n\ge 6)$
admits at least four $\SO(n)$-invariant Einstein metrics, two of which are
Jensen's metrics and the other two are new metrics. Moreover, we prove that
$V_5\bb{R}^7$ admits at least six invariant Einstein metrics, two of which are
Jensen's metrics and the other four are new metrics.
