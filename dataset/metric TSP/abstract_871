The aim of this paper is to derive explicit formulae for the Riemannian Bures
metric on the manifold of (finite dimensional) nondegenerate density matrices.
The computation of the Bures metric using the presented equations does not
require any diagonalization procedure and uses matrix products, determinants
and traces, only.
