We demonstrate here that the metric of a planar black hole in asymptotic
Anti-de Sitter space can, on a slice of dimension 3+1, be reproduced as a
relativistic acoustic metric. This completes an earlier calculation in which
the non-relativistic limit was used, and also serves to obtain a concrete form
of the Lagrangian.
