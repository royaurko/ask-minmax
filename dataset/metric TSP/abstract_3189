This paper contains locally rotationally symmetric kinematic self-similar
perfect fluid and dust solutions. We consider three families of metrics which
admit kinematic self-similar vectors of the first, second, zeroth and infinite
kinds, not only for the tilted fluid case but also for the parallel and
orthogonal cases. It is found that the orthogonal case gives contradiction both
in perfect fluid and dust cases for all the three metrics while the tilted case
reduces to the parallel case in both perfect fluid and dust cases for the
second metric. The remaining cases give self-similar solutions of different
kinds. We obtain a total of seventeen independent solutions out of which two
are vacuum. The third metric yields contradiction in all the cases.
