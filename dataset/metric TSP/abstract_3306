Finding measures for research impact, be it for individuals, institutions,
instruments or projects, has gained a lot of popularity. More papers than ever
are being written on new impact measures, and problems with existing measures
are being pointed out on a regular basis. Funding agencies require impact
statistics in their reports, job candidates incorporate them in their resumes,
and publication metrics have even been used in at least one recent court case.
To support this need for research impact indicators, the SAO/NASA Astrophysics
Data System (ADS) has developed a service which provides a broad overview of
various impact measures. In this presentation we discuss how the ADS can be
used to quench the thirst for impact measures. We will also discuss a couple of
the lesser known indicators in the metrics overview and the main issues to be
aware of when compiling publication-based metrics in the ADS, namely contributor
name ambiguity and citation incompleteness.
