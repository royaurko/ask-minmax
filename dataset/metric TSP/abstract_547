We describe a family of locally conformal Kaehler metrics on class 1 Hopf
surfaces H containing some recent metrics constructed by P. Gauduchon and L.
ornea. We study some canonical foliations associated to these metrics, in
particular a 2-dimensional foliation E that is shown to be independent of the
metric. We elementary prove that E has compact leaves if and only if H is
elliptic. In this case the leaves of E give explicitly the elliptic fibration
of H, and the natural orbifold structure on the leaf space is illustrated.
