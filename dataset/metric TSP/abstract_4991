Diffeomorphism covariant theories with dynamical background metric, like
gravity coupled to matter fields in the way expressed by Einstein-Hilbert's
action or relativistic strings described by Polyakov's action, have `on-shell'
vanishing energy-momentum tensor $t_{\mu\nu}$ because $t_{\mu\nu}$ is,
essentially, the Eulerian derivative associated with the dynamical background
metric and thus $t_{\mu\nu}$ vanishes `on-shell.' Therefore, the equations of
motion for the dynamical background metric play a double role: as equations of
motion themselves and as a reflection of the fact that $t_{\mu\nu}=0$.
Alternatively, the vanishing property of $t_{\mu\nu}$ can be seen as a
reflection of the so-called `problem of time' present in diffeomorphism
covariant theories in the sense that $t_{\mu\nu}$ are written as linear
combinations of first class constraints only.
