We construct unbounded positive $C^2$-solutions of the equation $\Delta u + K
u^{(n + 2)/(n - 2)} = 0$ in ${\R}^n$ (equipped with Euclidean metric $g_o$)
such that $K$ is bounded between two positive numbers in ${\R}^n$, the
conformal metric $g = u^{4/(n - 2)} g_o$ is complete, and the volume growth of
$g$ can be arbitrarily fast or reasonably slow according to the constructions.
By imposing natural conditions on $u$, we obtain growth estimate on the
$L^{2n/(n - 2)}$-norm of the solution and show that it has slow decay.
