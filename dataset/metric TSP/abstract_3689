We present a linearized treatment of the Karch-Randall braneworld where an
AdS_4 or dS_4 brane is embedded in AdS_5. We examine the quasi-zero graviton
mode in detail and reproduce the graviton mass by elementary means for the
AdS_5 case. We also determine the axially symmetric, static excitations of the
vacuum and demonstrate that they reproduce the 4D AdS_4 and dS_4 Schwarzschild
metrics on the brane.
