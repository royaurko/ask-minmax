In this paper we continue our study about the existence of Kaehler metrics of
constant scalar curvature (Kcsc) on blow ups at points of compact manifolds
with Kcsc metrics started in math.DG/0411522. In this second part we deal with
the case of base manifolds with holomorphic vector fields and we give
sufficient conditions for the position of points to be blown up to preserve the
Kcsc property. These results are obtained by a gluing procedure. We give
explicit examples of our construction, in particular getting optimal results in
the cases of P^n and P^n x M, where M is a Kcsc compact manifold with discrete
automorphism group.
