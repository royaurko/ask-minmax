The conformal invariance of the Hawking temperature, conjectured for the
asymptotically flat and stationary black holes by Jacobson and Kang, is
semiclassically evaluated for a simple particular case of symmetrical
spherically and non asymptotically flat black hole. By using the Bogoliubov
coefficients, the metric euclideanization, the reflection coefficient and the
gravitational anomaly, as methods of calculating the Hawking temperature, we
find that it is invariant under a specific conformal transformation of the
metric. We discuss briefly the results for each method.
