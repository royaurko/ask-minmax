Collapsibility is a classical notion introduced by Whitehead as part of his
simple homotopy theory. We provide several results relating it to metric
geometry and convexity.
  (1) Every complex that is CAT(0) with a metric for which all vertex stars are
convex is collapsible.
  (2) Any linear subdivision of any polytope is simplicially collapsible after
one barycentric subdivision. This solves up to one derived subdivision a
classical question by Lickorish.
  (3) Any linear subdivision of any star-shaped polyhedron in R^s is
simplicially collapsible after d-2 barycentric subdivisions at most. This
presents progress on an old question by Goodrick.
  We furthermore provide the following applications:
  (1) Any simplicial complex admits a CAT(0) metric if and only if it admits
collapsible triangulations.
  (2) All contractible manifolds (except for some 4-dimensional ones) admit
collapsible CAT(0) triangulations. This provides a polyhedral version of a
classical result of Ancel and Guilbault.
  (3) There are exponentially many geometric triangulations of S^d. This
interpolates between the known result that boundaries of simplicial
(d+1)-polytopes are exponentially many, and the conjecture that d-spheres are
more than exponentially many.
  (4) In terms of the number of facets, there are only exponentially many
geometric triangulations of space forms with bounded geometry. This establishes
a discrete version of Cheeger's finiteness theorem.
