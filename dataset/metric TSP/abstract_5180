In this paper we study the invariant Carnot-Caratheodory metrics on
$SU(2)\simeq S^3$, $SO(3)$ and $SL(2)$ induced by their Cartan decomposition
and by the Killing form. Beside computing explicitly geodesics and conjugate
loci, we compute the cut loci (globally) and we give the expression of the
Carnot-Caratheodory distance as the inverse of an elementary function. We then
prove that the metric given on $SU(2)$ projects on the so called lens spaces
$L(p,q)$. Also for lens spaces, we compute the cut loci (globally).
  For $SU(2)$ the cut locus is a maximal circle without one point. In all other
cases the cut locus is a stratified set. To our knowledge, this is the first
explicit computation of the whole cut locus in sub-Riemannian geometry, except
for the trivial case of the Heisenberg group.
