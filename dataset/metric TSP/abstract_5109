We show that the set $\s(R)$ of shift-isomorphism classes of semidualizing
complexes over a local ring $R$ admits a nontrivial metric. We investigate the
interplay between the metric and several algebraic operations. Motivated by the
dagger duality isometry, we prove the following: If $K,L$ are homologically
bounded below and degreewise finite $R$-complexes such that $K\lotimes_R
K\lotimes_R L$ is semidualizing, then $K$ is shift-isomorphic to $R$. In
investigating the existence of nontrivial open balls in $\s(R)$, we prove that
$\s(R)$ contains elements that are not comparable in the reflexivity ordering
if and only if it contains at least three distinct elements.
