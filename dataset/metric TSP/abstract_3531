According to Birkhoff's theorem the only spherically symmetric solution of
the vacuum Einstein field equations is the Schwarzschild solution. Inspite of
imposing asymptotically flatness and staticness as initial conditions we obtain
that these equations have general solutions with the Schwarzschild metric as
merely a special and simplest form of them. It is possible to have perfect and
smooth metrics with the same Newtonian and post-Newtonian limits of
Schwarzschild by a convenient and correct selection.
