We prove that two homogeneous ultra-metric spaces $X,Y$ are coarsely
equivalent if and only if $\mathrm{Ent}^\sharp(X)=\mathrm{Ent}^\sharp(Y)$ where
$\mathrm{Ent}^\sharp(X)$ is the so-called sharp entropy of $X$. This
classification implies that each homogeneous proper ultra-metric space is
coarsely equivalent to the anti-Cantor set $2^{<\omega}$. For the proof of
these results we develop a technique of towers which can have an independent
interest.
