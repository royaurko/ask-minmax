We show asymptotic completeness for a class of superradiant Klein-Gordon
equations. Our results are applied to the Klein-Gordon equation on the De
Sitter Kerr metric with small angular momentum of the black hole. For this
equation we obtain asymptotic completeness for fixed angular momentum of the
field.
