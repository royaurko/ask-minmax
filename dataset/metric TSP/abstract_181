In this paper the notion of the intrinsic geometry of an almost contact
metric manifold is introduced. Description of some classes of spaces with
almost contact metric structures in terms of the intrinsic geometry is given. A
new type of almost contact metric spaces, more precisely, Hermitian almost
contact metric spaces, is introduced.
