Moore characterized the amenability of automorphism groups of countable
ultrahomogeneous structures by a Ramsey-type property. We extend this result to
automorphism groups of metric Fra\"iss\'e structures, which encompass all
Polish groups. As an application, we prove that amenability is a G_delta
condition.
