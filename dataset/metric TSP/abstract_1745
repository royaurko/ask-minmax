Let X be a quasiprojective manifold given by the complement of a divisor
$\bD$ with normal crossings in a smooth projective manifold $\bX$. Using a
natural compactification of $X$ by a manifold with corners $\tX$, we describe
the full asymptotic behavior at infinity of certain complete Kahler metrics of
finite volume on X. When these metrics evolve according to the Ricci flow, we
prove that such asymptotic behaviors persist at later time by showing the
associated potential function is smooth up to the boundary on the
compactification $\tX$. However, when the divisor $\bD$ is smooth with
$K_{\bX}+[\bD]>0$ and the Ricci flow converges to a Kahler-Einstein metric, we
show that this Kahler-Einstein metric has a rather different asymptotic
behavior at infinity, since its associated potential function is
polyhomogeneous with in general some logarithmic terms occurring in its
expansion at the boundary.
