For a complete Riemannian metric, a pointwise conformal transformation may
lead to a complete or incomplete transformed Riemannian metric, depending on
the behavior of the conformal factor. We establish conditions on the growth of
the conformal factor towards the infinity of the Riemannian metric, such that
the conformally transformed Riemannian metric remains complete.
