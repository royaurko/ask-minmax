Given a closed hyperbolic surface $S$, let $\cQF$ denote the space of
quasifuchsian hyperbolic metrics on $S\times\R$ and $\cGH_{-1}$ the space of
maximal globally hyperbolic anti-de Sitter metrics on $S\times\R$. We describe
natural maps between (parts of) $\cQF$ and $\cGH_{-1}$, called "Wick
rotations", defined in terms of special surfaces (e.g. minimal/maximal
surfaces, CMC surfaces, pleated surfaces) and prove that these maps are at
least $C^1$ smooth and symplectic with respect to the canonical symplectic
structures on both $\cQF$ and $\cGH_{-1}$. Similar results involving the spaces
of globally hyperbolic de Sitter and Minkowski metrics are also described.
  These 3-dimensional results are shown to be equivalent to purely
2-dimensional ones. Namely, consider the double harmonic map
$\cH:T^*\cT\to\cTT$, sending a conformal structure $c$ and a holomorphic
quadratic differential $q$ on $S$ to the pair of hyperbolic metrics $(m_L,m_R)$
such that the harmonic maps isotopic to the identity from $(S,c)$ to $(S,m_L)$
and to $(S,m_R)$ have, respectively, Hopf differentials equal to $i q$ and $-i
q$, and the double earthquake map $\cE:\cT\times\cML\to\cTT$, sending a
hyperbolic metric $m$ and a measured lamination $l$ on $S$ to the pair
$(E_L(m,l), E_R(m,l))$, where $E_L$ and $E_R$ denote the left and right
earthquakes. We describe how such 2-dimensional double maps are related to
3-dimensional Wick rotations and prove that they are also $C^1$ smooth and
symplectic.
