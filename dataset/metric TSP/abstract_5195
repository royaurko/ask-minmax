We establish a dimension formula for the harmonic measure of a finitely
supported and symmetric random walk on a hyperbolic group. We also characterize
random walks for which this dimension is maximal. Our approach is based on the
Green metric, a metric which provides a geometric point of view on random walks
and, in particular, which allows us to interpret harmonic measures as \qc
measures on the boundary of the group.
