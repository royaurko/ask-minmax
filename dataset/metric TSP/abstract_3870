Let Y be an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR) for the class of metric
spaces and let X be a Hausdorff space. Let map(X,Y) denote the space of
continuous maps from X to Y with the compact open topology. It is shown that if
X is a CW complex then map(X,Y) is an ANR for the class of metric spaces if and
only if map(X,Y) is metrizable and has the homotopy type of a CW complex. The
same holds also when X is a compactly generated hemicompact space
(metrizability assumption is void in this case).
