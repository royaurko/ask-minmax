The ramification of a polyhedral space is defined as the metric completion of
the universal cover of its regular locus.
  We consider mainly polyhedral spaces of two origins: quotients of Euclidean
space by a discrete group of isometries and polyhedral metrics on the complex
projective plane with singularities at a collection of complex lines.
  In the former case we conjecture that quotient spaces always have a CAT[0]
ramification and prove this in several cases. In the latter case we prove that
the ramification is CAT[0] if the metric is non-negatively curved. We deduce
that complex line arrangements in the complex projective plane studied by
Hirzebruch have aspherical complement.
