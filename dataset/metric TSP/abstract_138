Complete constant positive scalar curvature metrics on S^n - {p_1, ..., p_k}
admit a definite asymptotic structure; i.e. the metric is asymptotic to a
specific S^{n-1}-invariant metric near the puncture points. This allows one to
glue together two such metrics near their puncture points, provided the
asymptotic structures match, and create a metric whose scalar curvature is very
close to constant. In this paper we perturb this new metric to obtain a metric
of constant scalar curvature.
