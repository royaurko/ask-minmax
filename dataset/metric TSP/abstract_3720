In this paper we investigate the geometry of Calibrated submanifolds and
study relations between their moduli-space and geometry of the ambient
manifold. In particular for a Calabi-Yau manifold we define Special Lagrangian
submanifolds for any Kahler metric on it. We show that for a choice of Kahler
metric the Borcea-Voisin threefold has a fibration structure with generic fiber
being a Special Lagrangian torus. Moreover we construct a mirror to this
fibration. Also for any closed G_2 form on a 7-manifold we study coassociative
submanifolds and we show that one example of a G_2 manifold constructed by
Joyce in [10] is a fibration with generic fiber being a coassociative 4-torus.
Similarly we construct a mirror to this fibration.
