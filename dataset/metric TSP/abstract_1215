We prove the global existence of the small solutions to the Cauchy problem
for quasilinear wave equations satisfying the null condition on $(R^3, g)$,
where the metric $g$ is a small perturbation of the flat metric and approaches
the Euclidean metric like $(1+|x|)^{-a}$ with $a>1$. Global and almost global
existence for systems without the null condition are also discussed for certain
small time-dependent perturbations of the flat metric in the appendix.
