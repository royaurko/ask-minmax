The paper studied the scalar and gauge fields on the background metric of
Kasner in the multidimensional spacetime. Influence of metric effects leads to
renormalization of main parameters of the fields in the Lagrangian, and new
mass and charge terms are introduced to corresponding observed in reality
values. Effective masses and charge of the fields depend upon the additional
terms with cosmological constant. Was calculated the expressions for the
effective mass and charge of the fields in anisotropic spacetime.
