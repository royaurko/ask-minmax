We show that a non-expansive action of a topological semigroup S on a metric
space X is linearizable iff its orbits are bounded. The crucial point here is
to prove that X can be extended by adding a fixed point of S, thus allowing
application of a semigroup version of the Arens-Eells linearization, iff the
orbits of S in X are bounded.
