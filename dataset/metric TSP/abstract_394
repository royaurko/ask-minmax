Let (X,d) be a metric space and m\in X. Suppose that \phi:X\times
X\to\mathbold{R} is a nonnegative symmetric function. We define a metric
d^{\phi,m} on X which is equivalent to d. If d^{\phi,m} is totally bounded, its
completion is a compactification of (X,d). As examples, we construct two
compactifications of (\mathhbold{R}^s,d_E), where d_E is the Euclidean metric
and s\geq 2.
