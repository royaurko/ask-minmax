In this paper we give general criteria on tightness and weak convergence of
discrete Markov chains to symmetric jump processes on metric measure spaces
under mild conditions. As an application, we investigate discrete approximation
for a large class of symmetric jump processes. We also discuss some application
of our results to the scaling limit of random walk in random conductance.
