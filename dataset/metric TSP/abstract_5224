The gravitational Higgs mechanism proposed by 't Hooft in arXiv:0708.3184
involves the spacetime metric g_{mu nu} as well as the induced metric
\bar{g}_{mu nu} proportional to \eta_{a b} \partial_{mu} \phi^a \partial_{nu}
\phi^b where \phi^{a} (a=0,...,3), as we call it, break all four
diffeomorphisms spontaneously via the vacuum expectation values < \phi^a >
proportional to x^a. In this framework, we construct and analyze the most
general action density in terms of various invariants involving the curvature
tensors, connexion coefficients, and the contractions and the determinants of
the two metric fields. We show that this action admits a consistent expansion
about the flat background such that the resulting Lagrangian possesses several
novel features not found in the linearized Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with
Fierz-Pauli mass term (LELHL-FP): (i) its kinetic part generalizes that of
LELHL-FP by weighing the corresponding structures with certain coefficients
generated by invariants, (ii) the entire Lagrangian is ghost-- and
tachyon--free for mass terms not necessarily in the Fierz-Pauli form, and,
(iii) a consistent mass term is generated with no apparent need to higher
derivative couplings.
