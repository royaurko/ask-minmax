Let $d$ be a metric on $R^n$ and let $C^{m,(d)}(R^n)$ be the space of
$C^m$-function on $R^n$ whose partial derivatives of order $m$ belong to the
space $Lip(R^n;d)$. We show that the homogeneous Sobolev space
$L^{m+1}_p(R^n),p>n,$ can be represented as a union of $C^{m,(d)}(R^n)$-spaces
where $d$ belongs to a family of metrics on $R^n$ with certain "nice"
properties. This enables us in several important cases to give intrinsic
characterizations of the restrictions of Sobolev spaces to arbitrary closed
subsets of $R^n$. In particular, we generalize the classical Whitney extension
theorem for the space $C^m(R^n)$ to the case of the Sobolev space $L^m_p(R^n)$
whenever $m\ge 1$ and $p>n$.
