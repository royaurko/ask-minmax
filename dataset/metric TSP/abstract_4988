The notion of null (isotropic) vector field is considered in spaces with
affine connections and metrics as models of space or space-time. On its basis
the propagation of signals in space-time is considered. The Doppler effect is
generalized for these types of spaces. The notions of standard (longitudinal)
Doppler effect and transversal Doppler effect are introduced. On their grounds,
the Hubble effect and the aberration effect appear as Doppler effects with
explicit forms of the centrifugal (centripetal) and Coriolis velocity vector
fields in spaces with affine connections and metrics. The upper limit of the
value of the general observed shift parameter z, generated by both the effects,
based on the Doppler effects, is found to be z = 1.41. Doppler's effects,
Hubble's effect, and aberration's effect could be used in mechanics of
continuous media and in other classical field theories in the same way as the
standard Doppler effect is used in classical and relativistic mechanics. PACS
