We show that the cone of weighted n-point quasi-metrics WQMet_n, the cone of
weighted quasi-hypermetrics WHyp_n and the cone of oriented cuts OCut_n are
projec- tions along an extreme ray of the metric cone Metn+1, of the
hypermetric cone Hypn+1 and of the cut cone Cut_{n+1}, respectively. This
projection is such that if one knows all faces of an original cone then one
knows all faces of the projected cone.
