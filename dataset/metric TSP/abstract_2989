We discuss the possible set of operators from various boundary conformal
field theories to build meaningful correlators that lead via a Loewner type
procedure to generalisations of SLE($\kappa,\rho$). We also highlight the
necessity of moduli for a consistent kinematic description of these more
general stochastic processes. As an illustration we give a geometric derivation
of $\text{SLE}(\kappa,\rho)$ in terms of conformally invariant random growing
compact subsets of polygons. The parameters $\rho_j$ are related to the
exterior angles of the polygons. We also show that $\text{SLE}(\kappa,\rho)$
can be generated by a Brownian motion in a gravitational background, where the
metric and the Brownian motion are coupled. The metric is obtained as the
pull-back of the Euclidean metric of a fluctuating polygon.
