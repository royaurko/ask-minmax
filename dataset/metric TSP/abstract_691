Two pseudo-Riemannian metrics are called projectively equivalent if their
unparametrized geodesics coincide. The degree of mobility of a metric is the
dimension of the space of metrics that are projectively equivalent to it. We
give a complete list of possible values for the degree of mobility of
Riemannian and Lorentzian Einstein metrics on simply connected manifolds, and
describe all possible dimensions of the space of essential projective vector
fields.
