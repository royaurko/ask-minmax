We consider the generation of the scalar mode of the metric perturbations
during preheating stage in a two field model with the potential $V(\phi, \chi)=
{m^{2}\phi^{2}\over 2}+{g^{2}\phi^{2}\chi^{2}\over 2}$. We discuss two possible
sources of such perturbations: a) due to the coupling between the perturbation
of the matter field $\delta \chi$ and the background part of the matter field
$\chi_{0}(t)$, b) due to non-linear fluctuations in a condensate of
``particles'' of the field $\chi$. Both types of the metric perturbations are
assumed to be small, and estimated using the linear theory of the metric
perturbations. We estimate analytically the upper limit of the amplitude of the
metric perturbations for all scales in the limit of so-called broad resonance,
and show that the large scale metric perturbations are very small, and taking
them into account does not influence the standard picture of the production of
the metric perturbations in inflationary scenario.
