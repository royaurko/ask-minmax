In paper [3] on the classification of second-order PDEs with four independent
variables that possess partner symmetries, asymmetric heavenly equation appears
as one of canonical equations admitting partner symmetries. It was shown that
all these canonical equations, together with general heavenly equation of
Dubrov and Ferapontov [4], provide potentials for anti-self-dual Ricci-flat
vacuum metrics [1,2,5], the asymmetric heavenly equation presenting the only
exception so far. Our aim here is to show that the latter equation also governs
anti-self-dual vacuum heavenly metric. We present the corresponding basis of
null vector fields, null tetrad of coframe 1-forms and a general form of the
metric. We obtain a multi-parameter polynomial solution of our equation which
yields a family of metrics with the above properties. Riemann curvature 2-forms
are also explicitly presented for the cubic solution to modified heavenly
equation [4], which is a particular case of the asymmetric heavenly equation.
