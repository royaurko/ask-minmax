Let $\Gamma$ be a Gromov hyperbolic group, endowed with an arbitrary
left-invariant hyperbolic metric, quasi-isometric to a word metric. The action
of $\Gamma$ on its boundary $\partial\Gamma$ endowed with the
Patterson-Sullivan measure $\mu$, after an appropriate normalization, gives
rise to a unitary representation of $\Gamma$ on $L^2(\partial\Gamma,\mu)$. We
show that these representations are irreducible and weakly contained in the
regular representation, and give criteria for their unitary equivalence in
terms of the metrics on $\Gamma$.
