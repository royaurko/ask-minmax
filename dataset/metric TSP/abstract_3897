This article contains a detailed study, in the toric case, of the test
configuration geodesic rays defined by Phong-Sturm. We show that the `Bergman
approximations' of Phong-Sturm converge in C^1 to the geodesic ray and that the
geodesic ray itself is C^{1,1} and no better. The \kahler metrics associated to
the geodesic ray of potentials are discontinuous across certain hypersurfaces
and are degenerate on certain open sets. A novelty in the analysis is the
connection between Bergman metrics, Bergman kernels and the theory of large
deviations.
