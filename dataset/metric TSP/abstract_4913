We apply the principle of energy conservation to the motion of the test
particle in gravitational field by requiring that its energy, gained by
gravitation, has to be balanced by decrease of its rest mass. Due to the change
of mass in gravitational field Newton's force law between gravitating bodies is
modified, too. With this modified force law we build up the the classical field
theory of gravitation in which all relevant field quantities are in the
definition domain $r\in [0,\infty)$ finite and positive. We show that under
such circumstances, the energy release at any gravitational collapse is finite.
On the other side, the energy conservation leads to an equation which relates
the mass change of the test particle due to gravitation and the metric of the
corresponding gravitational field. The mass change in Newton's gravitational
field lead to a remarkable simple metric which shifts, in contrast to the
Schwarzschild metric, the horizon of events to the gravity center of the
gravitational collapse.
