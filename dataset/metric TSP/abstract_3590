We discuss a semiclassical treatment to inflationary models from Kaluza-Klein
theory without the cylinder condition. We conclude that the evolution of the
early universe could be described by a geodesic trayectory of a cosmological 5D
metric here proposed, so that the effective 4D FRW background metric should be
a hypersurface on a constant fifth dimension.
