Attribute weighting and differential weighting, two major mechanisms for
computing context-dependent similarity or dissimilarity measures are studied
and compared. A dissimilarity measure based on subset size in the context is
proposed and its metrization and application are given. It is also shown that
while all attribute weighting dissimilarity measures are metrics differential
weighting dissimilarity measures are usually non-metric.
