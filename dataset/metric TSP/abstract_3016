This paper studies a general notion of flatness in the enriched context:
P-flatness where the parameter P stands for a class of presheaves. One obtains
a completion of a category A by considering the category Flat_P(A) of P-flat
presheaves over A. This completion is related to the free cocompletion of A
under a class of colimits defined by Kelly. For a category A, for P = P0 the
class of all presheaves, Flat_P0(A) is the Cauchy-completion of A. Two classes
P1 and P2 of general interest for general metric spaces are considered. The P1-
and P2-flatness are investigated and the associated completions are
characterized for general metric spaces (enrichemnts over R+) and preorders
(enrichments over Bool). We get this way two non-symmetric completions for
metric spaces and retrieve the ideal completion for preorders.
