This paper discusses the various models related to cloud computing. Knowing
the metrics related to infrastructure is very critical to enhance the
performance of cloud services. Various metrics related to clouds such as
pageview response time, admission control and enforcing elasticity to cloud
infrastructure are very crucial in analyzing the characteristics of the cloud
to enhance the cloud performance.
