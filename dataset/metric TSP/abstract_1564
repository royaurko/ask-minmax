In this paper we describe an approach to complex Finsler metrics suitable
to deal with global questions, and stressing the similarities between
hermitian and complex Finsler metrics. Let $F$ be a smooth complex Finsler
metric on a complex manifold $M$, and assume that the indicatrices of $F$ are
strongly pseudoconvex -- we shall say that $F$ itself is strongly pseudoconvex.
  The vertical bundle $\cal V$ is the kernel of the differential of the
canonical projection of the holomorphic tangent bundle of $M$. Using $F$, it
is possible to endow $\cal V$ with a hermitian metric; let $D$ be the Chern
connection associated to this metric. It turns out that there is a canonical
way to build starting from $D$ a horizontal bundle $\cal H$, as well as a
bundle isomorphism $\Theta\colon{\cal V}\to\cal H$. Using $\Theta$ we may
transfer both the metric and the connection on $\cal H$; furthermore, there is
a canonical isometric embedding $\chi$ of the holomorphic tangent bundle of
$M$ into $\cal H$.
  Our idea is that the Finsler geometry of $M$ can be studied applying standard
hermitian techniques to $\cal H$ using $\chi$ to transfer back and forth
problems and solutions. To support this claim, in this paper we discuss
Bianchi identities, K\"ahler conditions, the first and second variation
formulas, geodesics and holomorphic curvature. Furthermore, we provide a sound
geometric interpretation to our previous work on the existence of complex
geodesic curves. Finally, we prove that in complex K\"ahler Finsler
manifolds with constant nonpositive holomorphic curvature (and satisfying
an additional symmetry property on the curvature) the complex geodesic
curves define a nice fibration of the manifold, completely analogous to the
one described by Lempert in strongly convex domains.
