We use maximal periodic flats to show that on a finite volume irreducible
locally symmetric manifold of dimension $\geq 3$, no metric $g$ has more
symmetry than the locally symmetric metric. We also show that if $g$ is a
finite volume metric that is not locally symmetric, then its lift to the
universal cover has discrete isometry group.
