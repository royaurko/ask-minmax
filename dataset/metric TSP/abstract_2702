We derive a transformation of the noncommutative geometry inspired
Schwarzschild solution into new coordinates such that the apparent unphysical
singularities of the metric are removed. Moreover, we give the maximal
singularity-free atlas for the manifold with the metric under consideration.
This atlas reveals many new features e.g. it turns out to describe an infinite
lattice of asymptotically flat universes connected by black hole tunnels.
