It is shown that the Hilbert geometry $(D,h_D)$ associated to a bounded
convex domain $D\subset \mathbb{E}^n$ is isometric to a normed vector space
$(V,||\cdot ||)$ if and only if $D$ is an open $n$-simplex. One further result
on the asymptotic geometry of Hilbert's metric is obtained with corollaries for
the behavior of geodesics. Finally we prove that every geodesic ray in a
Hilbert geometry converges to a point of the boundary.
