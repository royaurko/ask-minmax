We introduce a new quasi-isometry invariant of metric spaces called the
hyperbolic dimension, hypdim, which is a version of the Gromov's asymptotic
dimension, asdim. The hyperbolic dimension is at most the asymptotic dimension,
however, unlike the asymptotic dimension, the hyperbolic dimension of any
Euclidean space R^n is zero (while asdim R^n=n.) This invariant possesses usual
properties of dimension like monotonicity and product theorems. Our main result
says that the hyperbolic dimension of any Gromov hyperbolic space X (with mild
restrictions) is at least the topological dimension of the boundary at infinity
plus 1. As an application we obtain that there is no quasi-isometric embedding
of the real hyperbolic space H^n into the (n-1)-fold metric product of metric
trees stabilized by any Euclidean factor.
