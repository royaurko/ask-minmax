In this paper we study multi-gravity (multi-metric and multi-vielbein)
theories in the presence of cycles of interactions (cycles in the so-called
`theory graph'). It has been conjectured that in multi-metric theories such
cycles lead to the introduction of a ghost-like instability, which, however, is
absent in the multi-vielbein version of such theories. In this paper we answer
this question in the affirmative by explicitly demonstrating the presence of
the ghost in such multi-metric theories in the form of dangerous higher
derivative terms in the decoupling limit Lagrangian; we also explain why these
terms are absent in the vielbein version of these theories. Finally we discuss
the ramifications of our result on the dimensional deconstruction paradigm,
which would seek an equivalence between such theories and a truncated
Kaluza-Klein theory, and find that the impediment to taking the continuum limit
due to a low strong-coupling scale is exacerbated by the presence of the ghost,
when these theories are constructed using metrics.
