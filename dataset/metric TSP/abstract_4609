We construct metric spaces that do not have property A yet are coarsely
embeddable into a Hilbert space. Our examples are so called warped cones, which
were introduced by J. Roe to serve as examples of spaces non-embeddable into a
Hilbert space and with or without property A. The construction provides the
first examples of warped cones combining coarse embeddability and lack of
property A.
  Along the way, it is proven that property A of the warped cone over a
profinite completion is equivalent to amenability of the group. We also
construct warped cones over manifolds with isometrically embedded expanders.
  In the appendix we solve a problem of Nowak regarding his examples of spaces
with similar properties.
