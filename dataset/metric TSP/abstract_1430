We study issues pertaining to the Ricci-flatness of metrics on orbifolds
resolved by D-branes. We find a K\"ahler metric on the three-dimensional
orbifold $\C^3/\Z_3$, resolved by D-branes, following an approach due to
Guillemin. This metric is not Ricci-flat for any finite value of the blow-up
parameter. Conditions for the envisaged Ricci-flat metric for finite values of
the blow-up parameter are formulated in terms of a correction to the K\"ahler
potential. This leads to an explicit construction of a Ricci-flat K\"ahler
metric on the resolved orbifold. The correction can be interpreted as a part of
the superspace-interaction in the corresponding gauged linear sigma-model.
