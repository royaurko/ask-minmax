In his 1910 "Five Variables" paper, Cartan solved the equivalence problem for
the geometry of $(2, 3, 5)$-distributions, which have since arisen in numerous
contexts, and in doing so demonstrated an intimate link between this geometry
and the exceptional simple Lie groups of type $\mathrm{G}_2$. He also claimed
to produce a local classification of all such (complex) distributions whose
infinitesimal symmetry algebra have dimension at least six and which satisfy a
natural uniformity condition, but in 2013 Doubrov and Govorov showed that this
classification misses a single structure ${\bf D}^{\natural}$. We show that,
remarkably, one can find a closed (and unlike some previous examples,
nonpolynomial) form for the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric of the conformal
class induced by (a real form of) ${\bf D}^{\natural}$, and show that its
holonomy is the uncommonly evidenced exceptional group $\mathrm{G}_2^*$. This
example expands the small class of known explicit ambient metrics, for which we
also provide a short directory. We also present some straightforward but novel
observations about ambient metrics of left-invariant conformal structures.
