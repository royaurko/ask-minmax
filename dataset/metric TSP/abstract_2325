We verify the three-dimensional Glassey conjecture for exterior domain (M,
g), where the metric g is asymptotically Euclidean, provided that certain local
energy assumption is satisfied. The radial Glassey conjecture exterior to a
ball is also verified for dimension three or higher. The local energy
assumption is satisfied for many important cases, including exterior domain
with nontrapping obstacles and flat metric, exterior domain with star-shaped
obstacles and small asymptotically Euclidean metric, as well as the nontrapping
asymptotically Euclidean manifolds (R^n, g).
