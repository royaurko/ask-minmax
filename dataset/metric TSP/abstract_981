Here we consider a metric-affine theory of gravity in which the gravitational
Lagrangian is the scalar curvature. The matter action is allowed to depend also
on the torsion and the nonmetricity, which are considered as the field
variables together with the metric. We find the field equations of the theory
and show that they reduce to Einstein equations in vacuum
