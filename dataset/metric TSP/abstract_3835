We explicit Ozawa kernels for classical group theoretical constructions, for
discrete metric spaces of finite asymptotic dimension, of large enough Hilbert
space compression, and for suitable actions of countable groups on metric
spaces. We also obtain an alternative proof of stability results concerning
Yu's property A.
