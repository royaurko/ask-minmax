We show that if $M = X \times Y$ is the product of two complex manifolds (of
positive dimensions), then $M$ does not admit any complete K\"ahler metric with
bisectional curvature bounded between two negative constants. More generally, a
locally-trivial holomorphic fibre-bundle does not admit such a metric.
