We prove $L^q$ bounds on the restriction of spectral clusters to submanifolds
in Riemannian manifolds equipped with metrics of $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity for
$0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$. Our results allow for Lipschitz regularity when $\alpha
=0$, meaning they give estimates on manifolds with boundary. When $0< \alpha
\leq 1$, the scalar second fundamental form for a codimension 1 submanifold can
be defined, and we show improved estimates when this form is negative definite.
This extends results of Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov and Hu to manifolds with low
regularity metrics.
