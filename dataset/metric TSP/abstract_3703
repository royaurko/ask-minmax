The Newton-Hooke algebras in d dimensions are constructed as contractions of
dS(AdS) algebras. Non-relativistic brane actions are WZ terms of these
Newton-Hooke algebras. The NH algebras appear also as subalgebras of
multi-temporal relativistic conformal algebras, SO(d+1, p+2). We construct
generalizations of pp-wave metrics from these algebras.
