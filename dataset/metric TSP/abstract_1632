Within the 4-dimensional conformal algebra, the presence of two translation
operators implies the existence of 3 distinct metrics of definite Weyl weight
constructible from the translational gauge fields. If we demand that each of
these metrics give rise to a gauge theory of gravity, we are led to extend the
symmetry so that each of these three metrics has a corresponding translation
operator. Assigning a vierbein to each of these three translations, a different
spacetime metric arises for every choice of inner product of the vierbeins. The
covering group of the compact part of the minimal transitive group classifying
these inner products is $SU(4)$. An additional $SU(2)$ symmetry classifies the
antisymmetric parts of the vierbein product. If the metric is chosen as the
gauge field of the translations in the standard way, the SU(4) part of this
symmetry is broken to the semidirect product of $SU(3)$ with $U(1)$.
