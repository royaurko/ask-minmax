There has been some recent controversy regarding the Ruppeiner metrics that
are induced by Reissner-Nordstrom (and Reissner-Nordstrom-like) black holes.
Most infamously, why does this family of metrics turn out to be flat, how is
this outcome to be physically understood, and can/should the formalism be
suitably modified to induce curvature? In the current paper, we provide a novel
interpretation of this debate. For the sake of maximal analytic clarity and
tractability, some supporting calculations are carried out for the relatively
simple model of a rotating BTZ black hole.
