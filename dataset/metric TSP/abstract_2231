This article presents a proof of Pogorelov's result that there exists a
$C^{2,1}$ metric with no local $C^2$ realization in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It also
construct in a very elementary way a $C^{1,1}$ realization of this metric.
Pogorelov's result is somewhat controversial among the community of researchers
that study isometric immersions. This in part owes to the lack of details in
Pogorelov's original paper. The chief aim of the paper is therefore to provide
the missing details. The construction is the same as Pogorelov's, although the
verification differs in some important respects.
