We exhibit Osserman metrics with non-nilpotent Jacobi operators and with
non-trivial Jordan normal form in neutral signature (n,n) for any n which is at
least 3. These examples admit a natural almost para-Hermitian structure and are
semi para-complex Osserman with non-trivial Jordan normal form as well; they
neither satisfy the third Gray identity nor are they integrable.
