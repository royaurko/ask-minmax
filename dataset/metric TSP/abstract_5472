The aim of this report is to present a ranking of Communication journals
covered in Google Scholar Metrics for the period 2008-2012. It corresponds to
the H Index update made last year for the period 2007-2011 (Delgado
L\'opez-C\'ozar and Repiso 2013). Google Scholar Metrics doesnt currently allow
to group and sort all journals belonging to a scientific discipline. In the
case of Communication, in the ten listings displayed by GSM we can only locate
46 journals. Therefore, in an attempt to overcome this limitation, we have used
the diversity of search procedures allowed by GSM to identify the greatest
number of scientific journals of Communication with H Index calculated by this
bibliometric tool. The result is a ranking of 354 communication journals sorted
by the same H Index, and mean as discriminating value. Journals are also
grouped by quartiles.
