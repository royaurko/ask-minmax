Presence of higher derivative terms in the Horava model of gravity can
generate an instability in the Minkowski ground state. This in turn leads to a
space dependent vacuum metric with a length scale determined by the higher
derivative coupling coefficient. The translation invariance is spontaneously
broken in the process. The phenomenon is interpreted as a form of Landau
liquid-solid phase translation. The (metric) condensate acts as a source that
modifies the Newtonian potential below the length scale but keeps it unchanged
for sufficiently large distance.
