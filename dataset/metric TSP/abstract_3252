We study locally conformal calibrated $G_2$-structures whose underlying
Riemannian metric is Einstein, showing that in the compact case the scalar
curvature cannot be positive. As a consequence, a compact homogeneous
$7$-manifold cannot admit an invariant Einstein locally conformal calibrated
$G_2$-structure unless the underlying metric is flat. In contrast to the
compact case, we provide a non-compact example of homogeneous manifold endowed
with a locally conformal calibrated $G_2$-structure whose associated Riemannian
metric is Einstein and non Ricci-flat. The homogeneous Einstein metric is a
rank-one extension of a Ricci soliton on the $3$-dimensional complex Heisenberg
group endowed with a left-invariant coupled ${\rm SU}(3)$-structure $(\omega,
\Psi)$, i.e., such that $d \omega = c {\rm Re}(\Psi)$, with $c \in \mathbb{R} -
\{ 0 \}$. Nilpotent Lie algebras admitting a coupled ${\rm SU}(3)$-structure
are also classified.
