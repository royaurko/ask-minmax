Given a compact metric space $X$, the collection of Borel probability
measures on $X$ can be made into a complete metric space via the Kantorovich
metric. We generalize this well known result to projection valued measures. In
particular, given a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, consider the collection of
projection valued measures from $X$ into the projections on $\mathcal{H}$. We
show that this collection can be made into complete metric space via a
generalized Kantorovich metric. As an application, we use the Contraction
Mapping Theorem on this complete metric space of projection valued measures to
provide an alternative method for proving a fixed point result due to P.
Jorgensen. This fixed point, which is a projection valued measure, arises from
an iterated function system on $X$, and is related to Cuntz algebras. We also
show that the space of positive operator valued measures from $X$ into the
positive operators on $\mathcal{H}$ can be made into a complete metric space,
via the same generalized Kantorovich metric.
