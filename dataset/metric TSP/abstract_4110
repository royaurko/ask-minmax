The Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole
metrics appear as exact solutions in the recently formulated massive gravity of
de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT), where the mass term sets the curvature
scale. They occur within a two-parameter family of dGRT mass terms. They show
no trace of a cloud of scalar graviton modes, and in the limit of vanishing
graviton mass they go smoothly to the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om
metrics.
