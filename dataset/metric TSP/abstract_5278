This article is a summary of some of the contributor's work on Sasaki-Einstein
geometry. A rather general conjecture in string theory known as the AdS/CFT
correspondence relates Sasaki-Einstein geometry, in low dimensions, to
superconformal field theory; properties of the latter are therefore reflected
in the former, and vice versa. Despite this physical motivation, many recent
results are of independent geometrical interest, and are described here in
purely mathematical terms: explicit constructions of infinite families of both
quasi-regular and irregular Sasaki-Einstein metrics; toric Sasakian geometry;
an extremal problem that determines the Reeb vector field for, and hence also
the volume of, a Sasaki-Einstein manifold; and finally, obstructions to the
existence of Sasaki-Einstein metrics. Some of these results also provide new
insights into Kahler geometry, and in particular new obstructions to the
existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano orbifolds.
