The analog of the Schwarzschild metric is explored in the context of
Non-Singular Gravity. Analytic results are developed describing redshifts,
curvatures and topological features of the spacetime. All curvatures and
redshifts are finite so there are no Black Holes, no singularities and no
Hawking radiation.
