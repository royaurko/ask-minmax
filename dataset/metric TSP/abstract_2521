We present calculations of gyroscope precession in spacetimes described by
Levi-Civita and Lewis metrics, under different circumstances. By doing so we
are able to establish a link between the parameters of the metrics and
observable quantities, providing thereby a physical interpretation for those
parameters, without specifying the source of the field.
