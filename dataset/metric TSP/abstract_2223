We prove an Hopf-Lax-Oleinik formula for the solutions of some Hamilton-
Jacobi equations on a general metric space. As a first consequence, we show in
full gener- ality that the log-Sobolev inequality is equivalent to an
hypercontractivity property of the Hamilton-Jacobi semi-group. As a second
consequence, we prove that Talagrand's transport- entropy inequalities in
metric space are characterized in terms of log-Sobolev inequalities restricted
to the class of c-convex functions.
