Over a compact oriented manifold, the space of Riemannian metrics and
normalised positive volume forms admits a natural pseudo-Riemannian metric $G$,
which is useful for the study of Perelman's $\mathcal{W}$ functional. We show
that if the initial speed of a $G$-geodesic is $G$-orthogonal to the tangent
space to the orbit of the initial point, under the action of the diffeomorphism
group, then this property is preserved along all points of the $G$-geodesic. We
show also that this property implies preservation of the Chern-Ricci form along
such $G$-geodesics, under the extra assumption of complex aniti-invariant
initial metric variation. This result is useful for a slice type theorem needed
for the proof of the dynamical stability of the Soliton-K\"ahler-Ricci flow.
