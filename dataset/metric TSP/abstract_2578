We prove minimal entropy rigidity for complete, finite volume manifolds
locally isometric to a product of rank one symmetric spaces of dimension at
least 3: the locally symmetric metric uniquely minimizes (normalized) entropy
among all Riemannian metrics. The corresponding theorem is true for maps into
these spaces as well.
