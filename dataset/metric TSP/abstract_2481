We construct Dirac operators and spectral triples for certain, not
necessarily self-similar, fractal sets built on curves. Connes' distance
formula of noncommutative geometry provides a natural metric on the fractal. To
motivate the construction, we address Kigami's measurable Riemannian geometry,
which is a metric realization of the Sierpinski gasket as a self-affine space
with continuously differentiable geodesics. As a fractal analog of Connes'
theorem for a compact Riemmanian manifold, it is proved that the natural metric
coincides with Kigami's geodesic metric. This present work extends to the
harmonic gasket and other fractals built on curves a significant part of the
earlier results of E. Christensen, C. Ivan, and the first contributor obtained, in
particular, for the Euclidean Sierpinski gasket. (As is now well known, the
harmonic gasket, unlike the Euclidean gasket, is ideally suited to analysis on
fractals. It can be viewed as the Euclidean gasket in harmonic coordinates.)
Our current, broader framework allows for a variety of potential applications
to geometric analysis on fractal manifolds.
