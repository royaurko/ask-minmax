Property A introduced by Guoliang Yu is an amenability-type property for
metric spaces. In this article, we study property A for uniformly locally
finite coarse spaces. Main examples of coarse spaces are a metric space, a set
equipped with a discrete group action, and a sequence of finitely generated
groups. The purpose of this article is to give complete proofs to related basic
facts.
