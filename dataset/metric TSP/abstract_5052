In this paper we construct Einstein spaces with negative Ricci curvature in
various dimensions. These spaces -- which can be thought of as generalised AdS
spacetimes -- can be classified in terms of the geometry of the horospheres in
Poincare-like coordinates, and can be both homogeneous and static. By using
simple building blocks, which in general are homogeneous Einstein
solvmanifolds, we give a general algorithm for constructing Einstein metrics
where the horospheres are any product of generalised Heisenberg geometries,
nilgeometries, solvegeometries, or Ricci-flat manifolds. Furthermore, we show
that all of these spaces can give rise to black holes with the horizon geometry
corresponding to the geometry of the horospheres, by explicitly deriving their
metrics.
