The paper introduces the approach to construction of the Lagrangian of the
field (fields). This approach is based solely on the metric function of the
Finsler space: the Lagrangian is constructed as the unit divided by the volume
swept by the unit vector running through all the points of the indicatrix in
the tangent space under the assumption of the tangent space being Euclidean.
For the space, which is conformally connected to the Minkowski space, under the
assumption of the exponential time dependence and spherically symmetrical
coordinates dependence the cosmological equation is written, which yields
Hubble law for distances from the origin which are much less than the size of
the universe. The cosmological equation is written for the field describing the
universe with the geometry conformally connected to the geometry of polynumbers
H(4) with the Berwald-Moore metrics.
