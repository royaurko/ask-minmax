A Clifford-Wolf translation of a connected Finsler space is an isometry which
moves each point the sam distance. A Finsler space $(M, F)$ is called
Clifford-Wolf homogeneous if for any two point $x_1, x_2\in M$ there is a
Clifford-Wolf translation $\rho$ such that $\rho(x_1)=x_2$. In this paper, we
study Clifford-Wolf translations of left invariant Randers metrics on compact
Lie groups. The mian result is that a left invariant Randers metric on a
connected compact simple Lie group is Clifford-Wolf homogeneous if and only if
the indicatrix of the metric is a round sphere with respect to a bi-invariant
Riemannian metric. This presents a large number of examples of non-reversible
Finsler metrics which are Clifford-Wolf homogeneous.
