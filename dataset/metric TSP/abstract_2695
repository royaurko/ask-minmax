We prove that the maximal nilpotent subalgebra of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra has
an (essentially unique) Euclidean metric with respect to which the Laplace
operator in the chain complex is scalar on each component of a given degree.
Moreover, both the Lie algebra structure and the metric are uniquely determined
by this property.
