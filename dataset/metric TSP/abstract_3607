We show that the Einstein-aether theory of Jacobson and Mattingly (J&M) can
be understood in the framework of the metric-affine (gauge theory of) gravity
(MAG). We achieve this by relating the aether vector field of J&M to certain
post-Riemannian nonmetricity pieces contained in an independent linear
connection of spacetime. Then, for the aether, a corresponding geometrical
curvature-square Lagrangian with a massive piece can be formulated
straightforwardly. We find an exact spherically symmetric solution of our
model.
