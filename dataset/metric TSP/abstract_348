The need for appropriate ways to measure the distance or similarity between
data is ubiquitous in machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining,
but handcrafting such good metrics for specific problems is generally
difficult. This has led to the emergence of metric learning, which aims at
automatically learning a metric from data and has attracted a lot of interest
in machine learning and related fields for the past ten years. This survey
paper proposes a systematic review of the metric learning literature,
highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. We pay particular attention to
Mahalanobis distance metric learning, a well-studied and successful framework,
but additionally present a wide range of methods that have recently emerged as
powerful alternatives, including nonlinear metric learning, similarity learning
and local metric learning. Recent trends and extensions, such as
semi-supervised metric learning, metric learning for histogram data and the
derivation of generalization guarantees, are also covered. Finally, this survey
addresses metric learning for structured data, in particular edit distance
learning, and attempts to give an overview of the remaining challenges in
metric learning for the years to come.
