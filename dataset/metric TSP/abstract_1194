In this short note, five-dimensional brane world models with dS_{4} metric on
the branes are discussed. The explicit coordinate transformations, which show
the equivalence between the bulk metric of these brane world models and the
metric induced on an appropriate submanifolds in the flat six-dimensional
pseudo-Euclidean space-time, are presented. The cases of the zero and non-zero
cosmological constant in the bulk are discussed in detail.
