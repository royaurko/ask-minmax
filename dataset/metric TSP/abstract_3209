General scaling arguments, and the behavior of the thermal entropy density,
are shown to lead to an infrared metric holographically representing a
compressible state with hidden Fermi surfaces. This metric is characterized by
a general dynamic critical exponent, z, and a specific hyperscaling violation
exponent, \theta. The same metric exhibits a logarithmic violation of the area
law of entanglement entropy, as shown recently by Ogawa et al.
(arXiv:1111.1023). We study the dependence of the entanglement entropy on the
shape of the entangling region(s), on the total charge density, on temperature,
and on the presence of additional visible Fermi surfaces of gauge-neutral
fermions; for the latter computations, we realize the needed metric in an
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. All our results support the proposal that the
holographic theory describes a metallic state with hidden Fermi surfaces of
fermions carrying gauge charges of deconfined gauge fields.
