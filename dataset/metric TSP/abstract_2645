The framework of universal geometry allows us to consider metrical properties
of affine views of elliptic curves, even over finite fields. We show how the
Neuberg cubic of triangle geometry extends to the finite field situation and
provides interesting potential invariants for elliptic curves, focussing on an
explicit example over $\mathbb{F}_{23}$. We also prove that tangent conics for
a Weierstrass cubic are identical or disjoint.
