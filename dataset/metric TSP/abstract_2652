We analyze the resolvent and define the scattering matrix for asymptotically
hyperbolic manifolds with metrics which have a polyhomogeneous expansion near
the boundary, and also prove that there is always an essential singularity of
the resolvent in this setting. We use this analysis to prove an inverse result
for conformally compact odd dimensional Einstein manifolds.
