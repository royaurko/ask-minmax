This work consists in applying the analysis of integrable models to study the
problem of Hyper-Kahler metrics building. In this context, we use the harmonic
superspace language applied to D=2 N=4 SU(2) Liouville self interacting model
and derive an explicit central extended Hyper-Kahler metric as well as the
induced scalar potential.
