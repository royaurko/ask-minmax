We show that given two hyperbolic Dirichlet to Neumann maps associated to two
Riemannian metrics of a Riemannian manifold with boundary which coincide near
the boundary are close then the lens data of the two metrics is the same. As a
consequence, we prove uniqueness of recovery a conformal factor (sound speed)
locally under some conditions on the latter.
