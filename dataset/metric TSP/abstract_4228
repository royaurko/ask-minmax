The Baire metric induces an ultrametric on a dataset and is of linear
computational complexity, contrasted with the standard quadratic time
agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. We apply the Baire distance to
spectrometric and photometric redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
using, in this work, about half a million astronomical objects. We want to know
how well the (more cos\ tly to determine) spectrometric redshifts can predict
the (more easily obtained) photometric redshifts, i.e. we seek to regress the
spectrometric on the photometric redshifts, and we develop a clusterwise
nearest neighbor regression procedure for this.
