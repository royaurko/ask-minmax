A characterization of Blaschke addition as a map between origin-symmetric
convex bodies is established. This results from a new characterization of
Minkowski addition as a map between origin-symmetric zonoids, combined with the
use of L\'{e}vy-Prokhorov metrics. A full set of examples is provided that show
the results are in a sense the best possible.
