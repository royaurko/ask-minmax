We apply algebraic and vertex operator techniques to solve two dimensional
reduced vacuum Einstein's equations. This leads to explicit expressions for the
coefficients of metrics solutions of the vacuum equations as ratios of
determinants. No quadratures are left. These formulas rely on the
identification of dual pairs of vertex operators corresponding to dual metrics
related by the Kramer-Neugebauer symmetry.
