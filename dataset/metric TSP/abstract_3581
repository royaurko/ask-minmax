We show that the coupling of a Dirac spinor field with the gravitational
field in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity is consistent. For
an arbitrary SO(3,1) connection there are two possibilities for the coupling of
the spinor field with the gravitational field. The problems of consistency
raised by Y. N. Obukhov and J. G. Pereira in the paper {\it Metric-affine
approach to teleparallel gravity} [gr-qc/0212080] take place only in the
framework of one particular coupling. By adopting an alternative coupling the
consistency problem disappears.
