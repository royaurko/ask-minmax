In this paper, we study a class of Finsler metrics which contains the class
of P-reducible metrics. Finsler metrics in this class are called generalized
P-reducible metrics. We consider generalized P-reducible metrics with scalar
flag curvature and find a condition under which these metrics reduce to
C-reducible metrics. This generalize Matsumotos theorem, which describes the
equivalency of C-reducibility and P-reducibility on Finsler manifolds with
scalar curvature. Then we show that generalized P-reducible metrics with
vanishing stretch curvature are C-reducible.
