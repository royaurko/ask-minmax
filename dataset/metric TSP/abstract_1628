The study of post-Einsteinian metric extensions of general relativity (GR),
which preserve the metric interpretation of gravity while considering metrics
which may differ from that predicted by GR, is pushed one step further. We give
a complete description of radar ranging and Doppler tracking in terms of the
time delay affecting an electromagnetic signal travelling between the Earth and
a remote probe. Results of previous publications concerning the Pioneer anomaly
are corrected and an annually modulated anomaly is predicted besides the
secular anomaly. Their correlation is shown to play an important role when
extracting reliable information from Pioneer observations. The formalism
developed here provides a basis for a quantitative analysis of the Pioneer
data, in order to assess whether extended metric theories can be the
appropriate description of gravity in the solar system.
