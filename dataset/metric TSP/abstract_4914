A light scalar field, minimally or not-minimally coupled to the metric field,
is a well-defined candidate for the dark energy, overcoming the coincidence
problem intrinsic to the cosmological constant and avoiding the difficulties of
parameterizations. We present a general description of the weak gravitational
lensing valid for every metric theory of gravity, including vector and tensor
perturbations for a non-flat spatial metric. Based on this description, we
investigate two minimally-coupled scalar field quintessence models using
VIRMOS-Descart and CFHTLS cosmic shear data, and forecast the constraints for
the proposed space-borne wide-field imager DUNE.
