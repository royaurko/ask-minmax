For a certain example of a "doubly special relativity theory" the modified
space-time Lorentz transformations are obtained from momentum space
transformations by using canonical methods. In the sequel an energy-momentum
dependent space-time metric is constructed, which is essentially invariant
under the modified Lorentz transformations. By associating such a metric to
every Planck cell in space and the energy-momentum contained in it, a solution
of the problem of macroscopic bodies in doubly special relativity is suggested.
