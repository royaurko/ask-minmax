We show that if the Kobayashi--Royden metric of a complex manifold is
continuous and positive at a given point and any non-zero tangent vector, then
the "derivatives" of the higher order Lempert functions exist and equal the
respective Kobayashi metrics at the point. It is a generalization of a result
by M. Kobayashi for taut manifolds.
