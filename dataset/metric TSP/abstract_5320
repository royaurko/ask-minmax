We study Hodge bundles on Siegel varieties and their various extensions to
smooth toroidal compactifications. Precisely, we construct a canonical Hodge
bundle on an arbitrary Siegel variety so that the holomorphic tangent bundle
can be embedded into the Hodge bundle, and we observe that the Bergman metric
on the Siegel variety is compatible with the induced Hodge metric. Therefore we
obtain the asymptotic estimate of the Bergman metric explicitly. Depending on
these properties and the uniformitarian of K\"ahler-Einstein manifold, we study
extensions of the tangent bundle over any smooth toroidal compactification. We
also apply this result, together with Siegel cusp modular forms, to study
general type for Siegel varieties.
