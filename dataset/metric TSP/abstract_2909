We examine the Type 1a supernova data in order to determine if it shows any
signal of large scale anisotropy. The anisotropy is modelled by an extended
G\"{o}del metric, which incorporates expansion along with rotation. The model
is smoothly connected to the usual FRW type, while expressing anisotropic
metric effects depending on certain parameters. We find no significant signal
of anisotropy in the data. We obtain bounds on an anisotropic redshift versus
magnitude relationship, and accompanying parameters of the G\"{o}del-Obukhov
metric.
