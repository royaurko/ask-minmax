In this paper, we introduce and investigate a general transformation or
change of Finsler metrics, which is referred to as a generalized
$\beta$-conformal change: $$L(x,y) \longrightarrow\overline{L}(x,y) =
f(e^{\sigma(x)}L(x,y),\beta(x,y)).$$ This transformation combines both
$\beta$-change and conformal change in a general setting. The change, under
this transformation, of the fundamental Finsler connections, together with
their associated geometric objects, are obtained. Some invariants and various
special Finsler spaces are investigated under this change. The most important
changes of Finsler metrics existing in the literature are deduced from the
generalized $\beta$-conformal change as special cases.
