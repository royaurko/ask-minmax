We study a class of simply connected manifolds in all odd dimensions greater
than 3 that exhibit an infinite number of toric contact structures of Reeb type
that are inequivalent as contact structures. We compute the cohomology ring of
our manifolds by using the join construction for Sasaki manifolds and show that
all such contact structures admit a ray of compatible Sasaki metrics of
constant scalar curvature (CSC). Furthermore, infinitely many such structures
admit at least 3 rays of constant scalar curvature Sasaki metrics.
