We consider a two-stage procedure (TSP) for estimating an inverse regression
function at a given point, where isotonic regression is used at stage one to
obtain an initial estimate and a local linear approximation in the vicinity of
this estimate is used at stage two. We establish that the convergence rate of
the second-stage estimate can attain the parametric $n^{1/2}$ rate.
Furthermore, a bootstrapped variant of TSP (BTSP) is introduced and its
consistency properties studied. This variant manages to overcome the slow speed
of the convergence in distribution and the estimation of the derivative of the
regression function at the unknown target quantity. Finally, the finite sample
performance of BTSP is studied through simulations and the method is
illustrated on a data set.
