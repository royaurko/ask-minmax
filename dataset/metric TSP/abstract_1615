This is a survey of a new type of relativistic space-time framework; the
"quasi-metric" framework. See the abstract of gr-qc/0111110 to get some idea of
its geometrical basis. A theory of gravity consistent with the quasi-metric
framework is presented. It is not yet clear whether or not this theory is
viable, but in its non-metric sector it makes successful predictions from first
principles where metric theories fail.
