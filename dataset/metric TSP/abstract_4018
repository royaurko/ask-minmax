The modified theories of gravity, especially the f(R) gravity, have attracted
much attention in the last decade. In this context, we study the exact vacuum
solutions of Bianchi type I, III and Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes in the metric
version of f(R) gravity. The field equations are solved by taking expansion
scalar theta proportional to shear scalar sigma which gives A=B^n, where A and
B are the metric coefficients. The physical behavior of the solutions has been
discussed using some physical quantities. Also, the function of the Ricci
scalar is evaluated in each case.
