Scientometrics is the study of the quantitative aspects of the process of
science as a communication system. It is centrally, but not only, concerned
with the analysis of citations in the academic literature. In recent years it
has come to play a major role in the measurement and evaluation of research
performance. In this review we consider: the historical development of
scientometrics, sources of citation data, citation metrics and the "laws" of
scientometrics, normalisation, journal impact factors and other journal
metrics, visualising and mapping science, evaluation and policy, and future
developments.
