We discuss several features of the propagation of perturbations in nonlinear
scalar field theories using the effective metric. It is shown that the
effective metric can be classified according to whether the gradient of the
scalar field is timelike, null, or spacelike, and this classification is
illustrated with two examples. We shall also show that different signatures for
the effective metric are allowed.
