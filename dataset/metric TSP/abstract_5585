Let $\Omega$ be a bounded closed set in $R^d$ with non-empty interior, and
let ${\cal C}_r(\Omega)$ be the class of convex functions on $\Omega$ with
$L^r$-norm bounded by $1$. We obtain sharp estimates of the $\epsilon$-entropy
of ${\cal C}_r(\Omega)$ under $L^p(\Omega)$ metrics, $1\le p<r\le \infty$. In
particular, the results imply that the universal lower bound $\epsilon^{-d/2}$
is attained by all $d$-polytopes. While a general convex body can be
approximated by inscribed polytopes, the entropy rate does not carry over to
the limiting body. For example, if $\Omega$ is the closed unit ball in $R^d$,
then the metric entropy of ${\cal C}_\infty(\Omega)$ under the $L^p(\Omega)$
metrics has order $\epsilon^{-(d-1)p/2}$ for $p>\frac{d}{d-1}$. Our results
have applications to questions concerning rates of convergence of nonparametric
estimators of high-dimensional shape-constrained functions.
