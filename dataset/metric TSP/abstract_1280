People demand for software quality is growing increasingly, thus different
scales for the software are growing fast to handle the quality of software. The
software complexity metric is one of the measurements that use some of the
internal attributes or characteristics of software to know how they effect on
the software quality. In this paper, we cover some of more efficient software
complexity metrics such as Cyclomatic complexity, line of code and Hallstead
complexity metric. This paper presents their impacts on the software quality.
It also discusses and analyzes the correlation between them. It finally reveals
their relation with the number of errors using a real dataset as a case study.
