We study locally conformally Berwald metrics on closed manifolds which are
not globally conformally Berwald. We prove that the characterization of such
metrics is equivalent to characterizing incomplete, simply-connected,
Riemannian manifolds with reducible holonomy group whose quotient by a group of
homotheties is closed. We further prove a de Rham type splitting theorem which
states that if such a manifold is analytic, it is isometric to the Riemannian
product of a Euclidean space and an incomplete manifold.
