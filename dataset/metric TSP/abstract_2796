We present some results concerning currents of integration on
finite-dimensional analytic spaces in Hilbert spaces, using the setting of
metric currents. In particular, we obtain the characterization of such currents
as positive closed $(k,k)-$rectifiable currents and solve the boundary problem
for holomorphic chains.
