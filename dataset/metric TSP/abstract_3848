Although the likelihood function is normalizeable with respect to the data
there is no guarantee that the same holds with respect to the model parameters.
This may lead to singularities in the expectation value integral of these
parameters, especially if the prior information is not sufficient to take care
of finite integral values. However, the problem may be solved by obeying the
correct Riemannian metric imposed by the likelihood. This will be demonstrated
for the example of the electron temperature evaluation in hydrogen plasmas.
