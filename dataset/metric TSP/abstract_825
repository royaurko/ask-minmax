This brief paper investigates the consequences for the metric tensor of
space-time when the Weyl tensor (in its conformally invariant form) and the
energy-momentum tensor is specified. It is shown that, unless rather special
conditions hold, the metric is uniquely determined up to a constant conformal
factor.
