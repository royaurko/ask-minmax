Royden proved that any isometry of Teichmuller space in the Teichmuller
metric must be an element of the extended mapping class group M(S). He also
proved that the Teichmuller metric is not symmetric at any point. In this paper
we give extensions of Royden's theorems from the Teichmuller metric to an
arbitrary complete, finite covolume, M(S)-invariant Finsler (e.g. Riemannian)
metric on Teichmuller space. In particular this gives a new mechanism behind
Royden's original theorem.
