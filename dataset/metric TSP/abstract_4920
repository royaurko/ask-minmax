Very little attention has been paid to the comparison of efficiency between
high accuracy statistical parsers. This paper proposes one machine-independent
metric that is general enough to allow comparisons across very different
parsing architectures. This metric, which we call ``events considered'',
measures the number of ``events'', however they are defined for a particular
parser, for which a probability must be calculated, in order to find the parse.
It is applicable to single-pass or multi-stage parsers. We discuss the
advantages of the metric, and demonstrate its usefulness by using it to compare
two parsers which differ in several fundamental ways.
