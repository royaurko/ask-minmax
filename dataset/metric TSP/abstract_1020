Inspired by the question of whether one can create a visually informative map
in which distances reflect travel-times rather than physical proximity, we
examine whether it is possible to construct a meaningful travel time function
between points in a region. We argue that such a function should constitute a
mathematical metric, and we offer a reasonable candidate using a max-min
approach.
