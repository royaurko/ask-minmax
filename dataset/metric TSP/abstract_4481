In this paper we calculate the strong field limit deflection angle for a
light ray passing near a scalar charged spherically symmetric object described
by a metric which comes from the low-energy limit of heterotic string theory.
Then, we compare the expansion parameters of our results with those obtained in
the Einstein's canonical frame, obtained by a conformal transformation, and we
show that, at least at first order, the results do not agree.
