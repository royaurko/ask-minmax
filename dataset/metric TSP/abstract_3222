We study a Vicsek-style model of self-propelled particles where ferromagnetic
and nematic alignment compete in both the usual "metric" version and in the
"metric-free" case where a particle interacts with its Voronoi neighbors. We
show that the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium XY model is similar to
that of its equilibrium counterpart: the properties of the fully-nematic model,
studied before in [F. Ginelli, F. Peruani, M. Baer, and H. Chat\'e, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 104, 184502 (2010)], are thus robust to the introduction of a modest bias
of interactions towards ferromagnetic alignment. The direct transitions between
polar and nematic ordered phases are shown to be discontinuous in the metric
case, and continuous, belonging to the Ising universality class, in the
metric-free version.
