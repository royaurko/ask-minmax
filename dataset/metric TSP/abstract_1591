We study metrics on shape space of immersions that have a particularly simple
horizontal bundle. More specifically, we consider reparametrization invariant
Sobolev metrics $G$ on the space $\operatorname{Imm}(M,N)$ of immersions of a
compact manifold $M$ in a Riemannian manifold $(N,\overline{g})$. The tangent
space $T_f\operatorname{Imm}(M,N)$ at each immersion $f$ has two natural
splittings: one into components that are tangential/normal to the surface $f$
(with respect to $\overline{g}$) and another one into vertical/horizontal
components (with respect to the projection onto the shape space
$B_i(M,N)=\operatorname{Imm}(M,N)/\operatorname{Diff}(M)$ of unparametrized
immersions and with respect to the metric $G$). The first splitting can be
easily calculated numerically, while the second splitting is important because
it mirrors the geometry of shape space and geodesics thereon. Motivated by
facilitating the numerical calculation of geodesics on shape space, we
characterize all metrics $G$ such that the two splittings coincide. In the
special case of planar curves, we show that the regularity of curves in the
metric completion can be controlled by choosing a strong enough metric within
this class. We demonstrate in several examples that our approach allows us to
efficiently calculate numerical solutions of the boundary value problem for
geodesics on shape space.
