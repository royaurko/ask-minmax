Motivated by a classical comparison result of J. C. F. Sturm we introduce a
curvature-dimension condition CD(k,N) for general metric measure spaces and
variable lower curvature bound k. In the case of non-zero constant lower
curvature our approach coincides with the celebrated condition that was
proposed by K.-T. Sturm. We prove several geometric properties as sharp
Bishop-Gromov volume growth comparison or a sharp generalized Bonnet-Myers
theorem (Schneider's Theorem). Additionally, our curvature-dimension condition
is stable with respect to measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, and it is
stable with respect to tensorization of finitely many metric measure spaces
provided a non-branching condition is assumed.
