We compute the metric on moduli space for the Dabholkar-Harvey string soliton
in $D=4$ to lowest nontrivial order in the string tension. The metric is found
to be flat, which implies trivial scattering of the solitons. This result is
consistent with an earlier test-string calculation of the leading order
dynamical force and a computation of the Veneziano amplitude for the scattering
of macroscopic strings.
