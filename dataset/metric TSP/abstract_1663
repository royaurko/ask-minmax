The Gauss-Bonnet curvature of order $2k$ is a generalization to higher
dimensions of the Gauss-Bonnet integrand in dimension $2k$, as the usual scalar
curvature generalizes the two dimensional Gauss-Bonnet integrand. In this
paper, we evaluate the first variation of the integrals of these curvatures
seen as functionals on the space of all Riemannian metrics on the manifold
under consideration. An important property of this derivative is that it
depends only on the curvature tensor and not on its covariant derivatives. We
show that the critical points of this functional once restricted to metrics
with unit volume are generalized Einstein metrics and once restricted to a
pointwise conformal class of metrics are metrics with constant Gauss-Bonnet
curvature.
