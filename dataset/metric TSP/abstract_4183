We classify the triples $H \subset K \subset G$ of nested compact Lie groups
which satisfy the "positive triple" condition that was shown by the second
contributor to ensure that $G/H$ admits a metric with quasi-positive curvature. A
few new examples of spaces that admit quasi-positively curved metrics emerge
from this classification; namely, a $\CP^2$-bundle over $S^6$, a $B^7$-bundle
over $\HP^2$, a $\CP^{2n-1}$-bundle over $\HP^{n}$ for each $n\geq 2$, and a
family of finite quotients of $T^1S^6$.
