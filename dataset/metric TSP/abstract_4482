As a generalization of slant submanifolds and semi-slant submanifolds, we
introduce the notions of pointwise slant submanifolds and pointwise semi-slant
sunmanifolds of an almost contact metric manifold. We obtain a characterization
at each notion, investigate the topological properties of pointwise slant
submanifolds, and give some examples of them. We also consider some
distributions on cosymplectic, Sasakian, Kenmotsu manifolds and deal with some
properties of warped product pointwise semi-slant submanifolds. Finally, we
give some inequalities for the squared norm of the second fundamental form in
terms of a warping function and a semi-slant function for warped product
submanifolds of cosymplectic, Sasakian, Kenmotsu manifolds.
