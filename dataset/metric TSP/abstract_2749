We study Kaehlerian manifolds with Norden metric $g$ and develop the theory
of their holomorphic hypersurfaces with constant totally real sectional
curvatures. We prove a classification theorem for the holomorphic hypersurfaces
of $(\mathbb{R}^{2n+2}, g, J)$ with constant totally real sectional curvatures.
