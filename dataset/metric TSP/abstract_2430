It is introduced a differentiable manifold with almost contact 3-structure
which consists of an almost contact metric structure and two almost contact
B-metric structures. The corresponding classifications are discussed. The
product of this manifold and a real line is an almost hypercomplex manifold
with Hermitian-Norden metrics. The vanishing of the Nijenhuis tensors and their
associated tensors is considered. It is proven that the introduced manifold of
cosymplectic type is flat. Some examples of the studied manifolds are given.
