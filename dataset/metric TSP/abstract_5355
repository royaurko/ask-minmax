We study property A for coarse (metric) spaces introduced by Guoliang Yu.
Property A is an amenability-type condition, which is less restrictive than
amenability for groups. Skandalis, Tu and Yu clarified a connection with
amenability in the theory of operator algebras. They proved that property A of
a coarse metric space X is equivalent to nuclearity of the uniform Roe algebra
C^*_u(X). We prove that local reflexivity of C^*_u(X) also characterizes
property A. For the proof of this theorem, the notion of a weighted weak
expander sequence is introduced. We prove that X does not have property A if
and only if it contains a weighted weak expander sequence.
