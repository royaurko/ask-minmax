We compare metrics obtained through analytic perturbation theory with their
numerical counterparts. The analytic solutions are computed with the CMMR
post-Minkowskian and slow rotation approximation due to Cabezas et al. (2007)
for an asymptotically flat stationary spacetime containing a rotating perfect
fluid compact source. The same spacetime is studied with the AKM numerical
multi-domain spectral code (Ansorg et al., 2002,2003). We then study their
differences inside the source, near the infinity and in the matching surface,
or equivalently, the global character of the analytic perturbation scheme.
