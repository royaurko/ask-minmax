In this short note we compare the weighted Laplacians on real and complex
(K\"ahler) metric measure spaces. In the compact case K\"ahler metric measure
spaces are considered on Fano manifolds for the study of K\"ahler-Einstein
metrics while real metric measure spaces are considered with Bakry-\'Emery
Ricci tensor. There are twisted Laplacians which are useful in both cases but
look alike each other. We see that if we consider noncompact complete manifolds
significant differences appear.
