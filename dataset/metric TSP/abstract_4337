A curved static de Sitter-like metric is analyzed. The source of curvature is
rooted from a constant stress tensor with positive energy density and negative
pressures. All the curvature invariants are constant everywhere and the
geometry is conformally flat. The horizon surface gravity equals the parameter
$\omega$ from the metric that is also interpreted as an angular velocity. The
Tolman-Komar gravitational energy is investigated. One finds that the horizon
entropy satisfies the relation $S = A_{H}/4$, as for the black hole horizon.
