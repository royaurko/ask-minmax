Using as an underlying manifold an alpha-Sasakian manifold we introduce
warped product Kaehler manifolds. We prove that if the underlying manifold is
an alpha-Sasakian space form, then the corresponding Kaehler manifold is of
quasi-constant holomorphic sectional curvatures with special distribution.
Conversely, we prove that any Kaehler manifold of quasi-constant holomorphic
sectional curvatures with special distribution locally has the structure of a
warped product Kaehler manifold whose base is an alpha-Sasakian space form.
Considering the scalar distribution generated by the scalar curvature of a
Kaehler manifold, we give a new approach to the local theory of Bochner-Kaehler
manifolds. We study the class of Bochner-Kaehler manifolds whose scalar
distribution is of special type. Taking into account that any manifold of this
class locally is a warped product Kaehler manifold, we describe all warped
product Bochner-Kaehler metrics. We find four families of complete metrics of
this type.
