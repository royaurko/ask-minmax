We prove an obstruction at the level of rational cohomology in small degrees
to the existence of positively curved metrics with large symmetry rank. The
symmetry rank bound is logarithmic in the dimension of the manifold. As an
application, we provide evidence for a generalized conjecture of Hopf that says
that no symmetric space of rank at least two admits a metric with positive
curvature.
