We regard a contact metric manifold whose Reeb vector field belongs to the
$(\kappa,\mu)$-nullity distribution as a bi-Legendrian manifold and we study
its canonical bi-Legendrian structure. Then we characterize contact metric
$(\kappa,\mu)$-spaces in terms of a canonical connection which can be naturally
defined on them.
