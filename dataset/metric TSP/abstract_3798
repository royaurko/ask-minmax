One of Demailly's characterizations of Seshadri constants on ample line
bundles works with Lelong numbers of certain positive singular hermitian
metrics. In this note sections of multiples of the line bundle are used to
produce such metrics and then to deduce another formula for Seshadri constants.
It is applied to compute Seshadri constants on blown up products of curves, to
disprove a conjectured characterization of maximal rationally connected
quotients and to introduce a new approach to Nagata's conjecture.
