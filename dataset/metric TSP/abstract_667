We introduce a new definition of nonpositive curvature in metric spaces and
study its relationship to the existing notions of nonpositive curvature in
comparison geometry. The main feature of our definition is that it applies to
all metric spaces and does not rely on geodesics. Moreover, a scaled and a
relaxed version of our definition are appropriate in discrete metric spaces,
and are believed to be of interest in geometric data analysis.
