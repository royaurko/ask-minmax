Stein's (1972) method is a very general tool for assessing the quality of
approximation of the distribution of a random element by another, often
simpler, distribution. In applications of Stein's method, one needs to
establish a Stein identity for the approximating distribution, solve the Stein
equation and estimate the behaviour of the solutions in terms of the metrics
under study. For some Stein equations, solutions with good properties are
known; for others, this is not the case. Barbour and Xia (1999) introduced a
perturbation method for Poisson approximation, in which Stein identities for a
large class of compound Poisson and translated Poisson distributions are viewed
as perturbations of a Poisson distribution. In this paper, it is shown that the
method can be extended to very general settings, including perturbations of
normal, Poisson, compound Poisson, binomial and Poisson process approximations
in terms of various metrics such as the Kolmogorov, Wasserstein and total
variation metrics. Examples are provided to illustrate how the general
perturbation method can be applied.
