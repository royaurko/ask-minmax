We prove that for every natural number k there are simply connected
topological four-manifolds which have at leat k distinct smooth structures
supporting Einstein metrics, and also have infinitely many distinct smooth
structures not supporting Einstein metrics. Moreover, all these smooth
structures become diffeomorphic after connected sum with only one copy of the
complex projective plane. We prove that manifolds with these properties cover a
large geographical area.
