In this study, we obtain new classes of linear codes over Hurwitz integers
equipped with a new metric. We refer to the metric as Hurwitz metric. The codes
with respect to Hurwitz metric use in coded modu- lation schemes based on
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-type constellations, for which neither
Hamming metric nor Lee metric. Also, we define decoding algorithms for these
codes when up to two coordinates of a transmitted code vector are effected by
error of arbitrary Hurwitz weight.
