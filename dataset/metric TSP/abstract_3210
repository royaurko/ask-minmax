We study here circular timelike geodesics in the Janis-Newman-Winicour and
Gamma metric spacetimes which contain a strong curvature naked singularity and
reduce to the Schwarzschild metric for a specific value of one of the
parameters. We show that for both the metrics the range of allowed parameters
can be divided into three regimes where structure of the circular geodesics is
qualitatively different. It follows that the properties of the accretion disks
around such naked singularities can be significantly different from those of
disks around black holes. This adds to previous studies showing that if naked
singularities exist in nature, their observational signature would be
significantly different from that of the black hole.
