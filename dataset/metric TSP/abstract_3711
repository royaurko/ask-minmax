The geometry of the $q$-deformed line is studied. A real differential
calculus is introduced and the associated algebra of forms represented on a
Hilbert space. It is found that there is a natural metric with an associated
linear connection which is of zero curvature. The metric, which is formally
defined in terms of differential forms, is in this simple case identifiable as
an observable.
