Starting from a 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie group N endowed with an invariant
SU(3) structure, we construct a homogeneous conformally parallel G_2-metric on
an associated solvmanifold. We classify all half-flat SU(3) structures that
endow the rank-one solvable extension of N with a conformally parallel G_2
structure. By suitably deforming the SU(3) structures obtained, we are able to
describe the corresponding non-homogeneous Ricci-flat metrics with holonomy
contained in G_2. In the process we also find a new metric with exceptional
holonomy.
