A procedure is described for matching a given stationary axisymmetric perfect
fluid solution to a not necessarily asymptotically flat vacuum exterior. Using
data on the zero pressure surface, the procedure yields the Ernst potential of
the matching vacuum metric on the symmetry axis. From this the full metric can
be constructed using a variety of well established procedures.
