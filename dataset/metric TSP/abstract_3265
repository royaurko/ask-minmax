We consider a contact manifold with a pseudo-Riemannian metric and define a
contact vector field intrinsically associated to this pair of structures. We
call this new differential invariant the contact Riemannian curl. On a
Riemannian manifold, Killing vector fields are those that annihilate the
metric; a Killing $1$-form is obtained from a Killing vector field by lowering
indices. We show that the contact Riemannian curl vanishes if the metric is of
constant curvature and the contact structure is defined by a Killing $1$-form.
We also show that the contact Riemannian curl has a strong similarity with the
Schwarzian derivative since it depends only on the projective equivalence class
of the metric. For the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a contact manifold, the
contact Riemannian curl is proportional to the subsymbol defined in
arXiv:1205.6562. We also show that the contact Riemannian curl vanishes on the
(co)tangent bundle over a Riemannian manifold. This implies that the
corresponding subsymbol of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is identically zero.
