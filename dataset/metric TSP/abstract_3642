We study the scattering of fermions in a ``global monopole'' background
metric. This is the four-dimensional analogue of the scattering on a cone in
three dimensions. The scattering amplitude is exactly obtained. We then study
massless fermion-dyon systems in such a background metric. The density of the
$S$-wave fermion condensate is found to be given by a constant times the flat
space value of Callan and Rubakov.
