On a Poisson manifold endowed with a Riemannian metric we will construct a
vector field that generalizes the double bracket vector field defined on
semi-simple Lie algebras. On a regular symplectic leaf we will construct a
generalization of the normal metric such that the above vector field restricted
to the symplectic leaf is a gradient vector field with respect to this metric.
