We determine the exact complexity of classifying compact metric spaces up to
homeomorphism. More precisely, the homeomorphism relation on compact metric
spaces is Borel bi-reducible with the complete orbit equivalence relation of
Polish group actions. Consequently, the same holds for the isomorphism relation
between separable commutative C*-algebras and the isometry relation between
C(K)-spaces.
