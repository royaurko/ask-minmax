Explicit solutions to the conifold equations with complex dimension $n=3,4$
in terms of {\it{complex coordinates (fields)}} are employed to construct the
Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metrics on these manifolds. The K\"{a}hler 2-forms are
found to be closed. The complex realization of these conifold metrics are used
in the construction of 2-dimensional non-linear sigma model with the conifolds
as target spaces. The action for the sigma model is shown to be bounded from
below. By a suitable choice of the 'integration constants', arising in the
solution of Ricci flatness requirement, the metric and the equations of motion
are found to be {\it{non-singular}}. As the target space is Ricci flat, the
perturbative 1-loop counter terms being absent, the model becomes topological.
The inherent U(1) fibre over the base of the conifolds is shown to correspond
to a gauge connection in the sigma model.
  The same procedure is employed to construct the metric for the resolved
conifold, in terms of complex coordinates and the action for a non-linear sigma
model with resolved conifold as target space, is found to have a minimum value,
which is topological. The metric is expressed in terms of the six real
coordinates and compared with earlier works. The harmonic function, which is
the warp factor in Type II-B string theory, is obtained and the ten-dimensional
warped metric has the $AdS_{5}\times X_{5}$ geometry.
