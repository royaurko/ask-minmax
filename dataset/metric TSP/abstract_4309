We show that the translation length of any parabolic isometry on a complete
semi-uniformly visible CAT(0) space is always zero. As a consequence, we will
classify the isometries on visible CAT(0) spaces in terms of translation
lengths. We will also show that the moduli space $\mathbb{M}(S_{g,n})$ of
surface $S_{g,n}$ of $g$ genus with $n$ punctures admits no complete visible
CAT(0) Riemannian metric if $3g+n\geq 5$, which answers the Brock-Farb-McMullen
question in the visible case.
