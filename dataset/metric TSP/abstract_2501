The general set of HCI and Educational principles are considered and a
classification system constructed. A frequency analysis of principles is used
to obtain the most significant set. Metrics are devised to provide objective
measures of these principles and a consistent testing regime devised. These
principles are used to analyse Blackboard and Moodle.
