We study the AdS/CFT relation between an infinite class of 5-d Ypq
Sasaki-Einstein metrics and the corresponding quiver theories. The long BPS
operators of the field theories are matched to massless geodesics in the
geometries, providing a test of AdS/CFT for these cases. Certain small
fluctuations (in the BMN sense) can also be successfully compared. We then go
further and find, using an appropriate limit, a reduced action, first order in
time derivatives, which describes strings with large R-charge. In the field
theory we consider holomorphic operators with large winding numbers around the
quiver and find, interestingly, that, after certain simplifying assumptions,
they can be described effectively as strings moving in a particular metric.
Although not equal, the metric is similar to the one in the bulk. We find it
encouraging that a string picture emerges directly from the field theory and
discuss possible ways to improve the agreement.
