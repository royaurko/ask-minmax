We attach the degenerate signature (n,0,1) to the projectivized dual
Grassmann algebra over R(n+1). We explore the use of the resulting Clifford
algebra as a model for euclidean geometry. We avoid problems with the
degenerate metric by constructing an algebra isomorphism between this Grassmann
algebra and its dual, that yields non-metric meet and join operators. We review
the Cayley-Klein construction of the projective (homogeneous) model for
euclidean geometry leading to the choice of the signature (n,0,1). We focus on
the cases of n=2 and n=3 in detail, enumerating the geometric products between
simple k- and m-vectors. We establish that versor (sandwich) operators provide
all euclidean isometries, both direct and indirect. We locate the spin group, a
double cover of the direct euclidean group, inside the even subalgebra of the
Clifford algebra, and provide a simple algorithm for calculating the logarithm
of such elements. We conclude with an elementary account of euclidean rigid
body motion within this framework.
