The concepts of Boolean metric space and convex combination are used to
characterize polynomial maps in a class of commutative Von Neumann regular
rings including Boolean rings and p-rings, that we have called CFG-rings. In
those rings, the study of the category of algebraic varieties (i.e. sets of
solutions to a finite number of polynomial equations with polynomial maps as
morphisms) is equivalent to the study of a class of Boolean metric spaces, that
we call here CFG-spaces.
