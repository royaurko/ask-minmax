We consider decay of the inflaton with a quartic potential coupled to other
fields, including gravity, but restricted to spherical symmetry. We describe
analytically an early, quasilinear regime, during which inflaton fluctuations
and the metric functions are driven by nonlinear effects of the decay products.
We present a detailed study of the leading nonlinear effects in this regime.
Results of the quasilinear approximation, in its domain of applicability, are
found to be consistent with those of fully nonlinear lattice studies. We
discuss how these results may be promoted to the full three dimensions.
