Contraction analysis uses differential dynamics and Riemannian metrics to
show that all solutions of a particular system converge exponentially. In this
paper we generalize this approach to problems in control design, giving
sufficient conditions for exponential stabilizability of all trajectories of a
nonlinear control system. The conditions can be expressed in terms of a dual
metric as (convex) pointwise linear matrix inequalities. We show that for
feedback linearizable systems the conditions are necessary as well as
sufficient. We also show how computation can be simplified through the use of a
virtual dynamical systems, and derive novel convex criteria for exponential
convergence to a flow-invariant nonlinear manifold. Straightforward extensions
allow approximate optimal and robust control, generalizing well-known LMI
conditions for linear systems. The proposed techniques are illustrated with a
variety of examples, including some utilizing sum-of-squares programming for
computation of the metric.
