We derive the expressions for canonical energy, momentum, and angular
momentum for multiple metric theories. We prove that although the metric fields
are generally interacting, the total energy is the sum of conserved energies
corresponding to each metric. A positive energy theorem is given as a result.
In addition, we present an Hamiltonian formalism for a subgroup of multi-metric
theories.
