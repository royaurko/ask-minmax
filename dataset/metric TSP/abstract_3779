Recently, Donaldson proved asymptotic stability for a polarized algebraic
manifold $M$ with polarization class admitting a K\"ahler metric of constant
scalar curvature, essentially when the linear algebraic part $H$ of $Aut^0(M)$
is semisimple. The purpose of this paper is to give a generalization of
Donaldson's result to the case where the polarization class admits an extremal
K\"ahler metric, even when $H$ is not semisimple.
