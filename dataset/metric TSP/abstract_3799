We present a construction of complete self-dual Einstein metrics of negative
scalar curvature on an uncountable family of manifolds of infinite topological
type, which are enumerated by continued fraction expansions of irrational
numbers. These manifolds may be regarded as limits of the resolutions of cyclic
quotient singularities (governed by continued fraction expansions of rational
numbers) on which we constructed complete self-dual Einstein metrics in
previous work.
