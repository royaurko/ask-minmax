We describe some remarkable properties of the so-called Information Metric on
instanton moduli space. This Metric is manifestly gauge and conformally
invariant and coincides with the Euclidean AdS_5 metric on the one-instanton
SU(2) moduli space for the standard metric on R^4. We propose that for an
arbitrary boundary metric the AdS/CFT bulk space-time is the instanton moduli
space equipped with the Information Metric.
  To test this proposal, we examine the variation of the instanton moduli and
the Information Metric for first-order perturbations of the boundary metric and
obtain three non-trivial and somewhat surprising results: (1) The perturbed
Information Metric is Einstein. (2) The perturbed instanton density is the
corresponding massless boundary-to-bulk scalar propagator. (3) The regularized
boundary-to-bulk geodesic distance is proportional to the logarithm of the
perturbed instanton density. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation implied by (3) equips
the moduli space with a rich geometrical structure which we explore.
  These results tentatively suggest a picture in which the one-instanton sector
of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory (rather than some large-N limit) is in some sense
holographically dual to bulk gravity.
