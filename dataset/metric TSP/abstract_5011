Utilizing the ADM equations, we derive a metric and reduced field equations
describing a general, spherically symmetric perfect fluid. The metric describes
both the interior perfect fluid region and exterior vacuum Schwarzschild
spacetime in a single coordinate patch. The exterior spacetime is in
generalized Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates which is an infinite class of
coordinate systems. In the static limit the system reduces to a
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation on the interior with the exterior in
Schwarzschild coordinates. We show the coordinate transformation for the
non-static cases to comoving coordinates, where the metric is seen to be a
direct generalization of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi spacetime to include
pressures.
