We note that the Bogomolny equation for abelian vortices is precisely the
condition for invariance of the Hermitian-Einstein equation under a degenerate
conformal transformation. This leads to a natural interpretation of vortices as
degenerate hermitian metrics that satisfy a certain curvature equation. Using
this viewpoint, we rephrase standard results about vortices and make new
observations. We note the existence of a conceptually simple, non-linear rule
for superposing vortex solutions, and we describe the natural behaviour of the
L^2-metric on the moduli space upon restriction to a class of submanifolds.
