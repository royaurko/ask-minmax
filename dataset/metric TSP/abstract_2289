Relativistic positioning systems provide tensors represented in
$\{\ell\ell\ell\ell\}$-frames ($\ell$ for light) dual to systems of emission
coordinates. We show that any Lorentzian metric field given in such a frame is
isometrically equivalent to a generic metric field defined by only four
positive functions depending on another specific system of emission
coordinates.
