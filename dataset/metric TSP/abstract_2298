Main characteristics of Google Scholar Metrics new version (july 2013) are
presented. We outline the novelties and the weaknesses detected after a first
analysis. As main conclusion, we remark the lack of new functionalities with
respect to last editions, as the only modification is the update of the
timeframe (2008-2012). Hence, problems pointed out in our last reviews still
remain active. Finally, it seems Google Scholar Metrics will be updated in a
yearly basis
