We review the basic arguments for the likelihood of non-Gaussian density
perturbations in inflation models with primordial black hole (PBH) production.
We discuss our derived distributions of field fluctuations and their
implications, specifically commenting on the fine-tuning problem. We also
discuss how the derived distributions may be affected when linked to metric
perturbations. While linking the metric perturbations to field fluctuations in
a nonlinear way may be important for determining exact probability
distributions, the correct mapping is not self-evident. The calculation of P.
Ivanov, which yields skew positive distribution, is based on an ansatz for the
behavior of the nonlinear metric perturbation. We note that the ``natural''
generalization of the gauge-invariant formalism favored by Bond and Salopek
yields an effective linear link between the distribution of field fluctuations
and metric perturbations during inflation.
