We investigate the Hawking radiation of black $p$-branes of superstring
theories using the method of anomaly cancelation, specially, we use the method
of [S. Iso, H. Umetsu and F. Wilczek, {\sl Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 96}, 151302
(2006); {\sl Phys. Rev. D} {\bf 74}, 044017 (2006)]. The metrics of black
$p$-branes are spherically symmetric, but not the Schwarzschild type. In order
to simplify the calculation, we first make a coordinate transformation to
transform the metric to the Schwarzschild type. Then we calculate its
energy-momentum flux from the method of anomaly cancelation of the above
mentioned references. The obtained energy-momentum flux is equal to a black
body radiation, the thermodynamic temperature of the radiation is equal to its
Hawking temperature. And we find that the results are not changed for the
original non-Schwarzschild type spherically symmetric metric.
