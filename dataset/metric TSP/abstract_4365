In this paper we study the behavior of jet quenching parameter in the
background metric with hyperscaling violation at finite temperature.The
background metric is covariant under a generalized Lifshitz scaling symmetry
with the dynamical exponent z and hyperscaling exponent $\theta$. We evaluate
the jet quenching parameter for certain range of these parameters consistent
with the Gubser bound conditions in terms of T, z and $\theta$. We compare our
results with those from conformal case and experimental data. Then we add a
constant electric field to this background and find its effect on the jet
quenching parameter.
