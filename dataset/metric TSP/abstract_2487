In this paper, we disprove a conjecture of Goemans and Linial; namely, that
every negative type metric embeds into $\ell_1$ with constant distortion. We
show that for an arbitrarily small constant $\delta> 0$, for all large enough
$n$, there is an $n$-point negative type metric which requires distortion at
least $(\log\log n)^{1/6-\delta}$ to embed into $\ell_1.$
  Surprisingly, our construction is inspired by the Unique Games Conjecture
(UGC) of Khot, establishing a previously unsuspected connection between
probabilistically checkable proof systems (PCPs) and the theory of metric
embeddings. We first prove that the UGC implies a super-constant hardness
result for the (non-uniform) Sparsest Cut problem. Though this hardness result
relies on the UGC, we demonstrate, nevertheless, that the corresponding PCP
reduction can be used to construct an "integrality gap instance" for Sparsest
Cut. Towards this, we first construct an integrality gap instance for a natural
SDP relaxation of Unique Games. Then we "simulate" the PCP reduction and
"translate" the integrality gap instance of Unique Games to an integrality gap
instance of Sparsest Cut. This enables us to prove a $(\log \log
n)^{1/6-\delta}$ integrality gap for Sparsest Cut, which is known to be
equivalent to the metric embedding lower bound.
