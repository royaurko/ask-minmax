We construct a catalog, of snowflake type metric circles, that describes all
metric quasicircles up to \bl\ equivalence. This is a metric space analog of a
result due to Rohde. Our construction also works for all bounded turning metric
circles; these need not be doubling. As a byproduct, we show that a metric
quasicircle with Assouad dimension strictly less than two is bi-Lipschitz
equivalent to a planar quasicircle.
