For a large class of metric space X including discrete groups we prove that
the asymptotic Assouad-Nagata dimension AN-asdim X of X coincides with the
covering dimension $\dim(\nu_L X)$ of the Higson corona of X with respect to
the sublinear coarse structure on X. Then we apply this fact to prove the
equality AN-asdim(X x R) = AN-asdim X + 1. We note that the similar equality
for Gromov's asymptotic dimension asdim generally fails to hold [Dr3].
  Additionally we construct an injective map from the asymptotic cone without
the basepoint to the sublinear Higson Corona.
