We discuss the role of additional local symmetries related to the
transformations of connection fields in the affine-metric theory of gravity.
The corresponding BRST transformations connected with all symmetries (general
coordinate, local Lorentz and extra) are constructed. It is shown, that extra
symmetries give the additional contribution to effective action which is
proportional to the corresponding Nielsen-Kallosh ghost one. Some arguments are
given, that there is no anomaly associated with extra local symmetries.
