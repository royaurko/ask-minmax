This paper is concerned with basic geometric properties of the phase space of
a classical general relativistic particle, regarded as the 1st jet space of
motions, i.e. as the 1st jet space of timelike 1--dimensional submanifolds of
spacetime.
  This setting allows us to skip constraints.
  Our main goal is to determine the geometric conditions by which the Lorentz
metric and a connection of the phase space yield contact and Jacobi structures.
  In particular, we specialise these conditions to the cases when the
connection of the phase space is generated by the metric and an additional
tensor.
  Indeed, the case generated by the metric and the electromagnetic field is
included, as well.
