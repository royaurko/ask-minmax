We study an analogue of the analytic torsion for elliptic complexes that are
graded by $\mathbb{Z}_2$, orignally constructed by Mathai and Wu. Motivated by
topological T-duality, Bouwknegt an Mathai study the complex of forms on an
odd-dimensional manifold equipped with with the twisted differential $d_H =
d+H$, where $H$ is a closed odd-dimensional form. We show that the Ray-Singer
metric on this twisted determinant is equal to the untwisted Ray-Singer metric
when the determinant lines are identified using a canonical isomorphism. We
also study another analytical invariant of the twisted differential, the
derived Euler characteristic $\chi'(d_H)$, as defined by Bismut and Zhang.
