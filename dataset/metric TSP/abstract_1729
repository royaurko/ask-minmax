We consider a four-dimensional simplicial complex and the minisuperspace
general relativity system described by the metric flat in the most part of the
interior of every 4-simplex with exception of a thin layer of thickness
$\propto \varepsilon$ along the every three-dimensional face where the metric
undergoes jump between the two 4-simplices sharing this face. At $\varepsilon
\to 0$ this jump would become discontinuity. Since, however, discontinuity of
the (induced on the face) metric is not allowed in general relativity, the
terms in the Einstein action tending to infinity at $\varepsilon \to 0$ arise.
In the path integral approach, these terms lead to the pre-exponent factor with
\dfuns requiring that the induced on the faces metric be continuous, i. e. the
4-simplices fit on their common faces. The other part of the path integral
measure corresponds to the action being the sum of independent terms over the
4-simplices. Therefore this part of the path integral measure is the product of
independent measures over the 4-simplices. The result obtained is in accordance
with our previous one obtained from the symmetry considerations.
