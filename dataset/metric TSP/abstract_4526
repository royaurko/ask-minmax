Our aim in this paper is to study local rigidity for metrics defined on a
compact manifold $M$ with boundary satisfying constant scalar curvature on $M$
and constant mean curvature on $\partial M$. We present some geometrical
hypotheses ensuring local rigidity for both, the general Riemannian and the
warped metric case. These conditions arise from the study of a spectral problem
which is not included within the classical problems (Neumann, Steklov,...) that
we call "mixed eigenvalue problem". Finally, we apply our previous results for
the spatial slice of the de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild spacetimes.
