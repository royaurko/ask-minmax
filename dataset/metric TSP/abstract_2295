We advocate and develop the use of the dreibein (and the metric) as
prepotential for Yang-Mills theory. The SO(3) Yang-Mills theory in three
Euclidean dimensions is rewritten as R^2 theory with, in addition, a local
action involving anticommuting tensor fields. Thus Yang-Mills theory is
expressed as a local theory of only gauge-invariant variables. The conformal
mode of the metric captures the multi-monopole configurations. It is proposed
that a theory of just one scalar field with quartic derivatives, obtained by
keeping only the conformal mode, may be a confining theory. Our approach
provides a complete ansatz for the vector potential covering the topological
aspects.
