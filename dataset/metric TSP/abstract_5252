In this paper we study warped product Einstein metrics over spaces with
constant scalar curvature. We call such a manifold rigid if the universal cover
of the base is Einstein or is isometric to a product of Einstein manifolds.
When the base is three dimensional and the dimension of the fiber is greater
than one we show that the space is always rigid. We also exhibit examples of
solvable four dimensional Lie groups that can be used as the base space of
non-rigid warped product Einstein metrics showing that the result is not true
in dimension greater than three. We also give some further natural curvature
conditions that characterize the rigid examples in higher dimensions.
