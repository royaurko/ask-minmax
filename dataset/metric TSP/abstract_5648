FRW cosmologies with conformally coupled scalar fields are investigated in a
geometrical way by the means of geodesics of the Jacobi metric. In this model
of dynamics, trajectories in the configuration space are represented by
geodesics. Because of the singular nature of the Jacobi metric on the boundary
set $\partial\mathcal{D}$ of the domain of admissible motion, the geodesics
change the cone sectors several times (or an infinite number of times) in the
neighborhood of the singular set $\partial\mathcal{D}$. We show that this
singular set contains interesting information about the dynamical complexity of
the model. Firstly, this set can be used as a Poincar{\'e} surface for
construction of Poincar{\'e} sections, and the trajectories then have the
recurrence property. We also investigate the distribution of the intersection
points. Secondly, the full classification of periodic orbits in the
configuration space is performed and existence of UPO is demonstrated. Our
general conclusion is that, although the presented model leads to several
complications, like divergence of curvature invariants as a measure of
sensitive dependence on initial conditions, some global results can be obtained
and some additional physical insight is gained from using the conformal Jacobi
metric. We also study the complex behavior of trajectories in terms of symbolic
dynamics.
