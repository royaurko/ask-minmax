This paper studies Hamilton-Jacobi equations of evolution type defined in a
general metric space. We give a notion of a solution through optimal principles
and establish a unique existence theorem of the solution for initial value
problems. We also note a relationship between the notion of a solution and
another notion based on characterization of the modulus of the gradient in the
sense of [13].
