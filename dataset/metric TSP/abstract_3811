In the first part of the paper we show how to relate several dimension
theories (asymptotic dimension with Higson property, asymptotic dimension of
Gromov, and capacity dimension of Buyalo \cite{Buyalo1}) to Nagata-Assouad
dimension. This is done by applying two functors on the Lipschitz category of
metric spaces: microscopic and macroscopic. In the second part we identify
(among spaces of finite Nagata-Assouad dimension) spaces of Nagata-Assouad
dimension at most $n$ as those for which the $n$-sphere $S^n$ is a Lipschitz
extensor. Large scale and small scale analogs of that result are given.
