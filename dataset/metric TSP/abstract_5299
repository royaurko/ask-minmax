In this paper, we investigate spherically symmetric perfect fluid
gravitational collapse in metric $f(R)$ gravity. We take non-static spherically
symmetric metric in the interior region and static spherically symmetric metric
in the exterior region of a star. The junction conditions between interior and
exterior spacetimes are derived. The field equations in f(R) theory are solved
using the assumption of constant Ricci scalar. Inserting their solution into
junction conditions, the gravitational mass is found. Further, the apparent
horizons and their time of formation is discussed. We conclude that the
constant scalar curvature term f(R_0) acts as a source of repulsive force and
thus slows down the collapse of matter. The comparison with the corresponding
results available in general relativity indicates that f(R_0) plays the role of
the cosmological constant.
