A concise form of the Kinnersley-Chitre five-parameter metric for a spinning
mass is obtained by exploiting a remarkable similarity between the metric's
factor structure and the analogous structure of the Tomimatsu-Sato solutions
with even distortion parameter delta. The corresponding general subfamily of
asymptotically flat spacetimes containing four arbitrary real parameters is
considered, and all configurations describing two extreme Kerr sources
separated by a strut are identified and briefly discussed.
