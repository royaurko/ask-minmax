Solutions to gravity with quadratic Lagrangians are found for the simple case
where the only nonconstant metric component is the lapse $N$ and the Riemann
tensor takes the form $R^{t}_{.itj}=-k_{i}k_{j}, i,j=1,2,3$; thus these
solutions depend on cross terms in the Riemann tensor and therefore complement
the linearized theory where it is the derivatives of the Riemann tensor that
matter. The relationship of this metric to the null gravitational radiation
metric of Peres is given. Gravitaional energy Poynting vectors are construcetd
for the solutions and one of these, based on the Lanczos tensor, supports the
indication in the linearized theory that nonnull gravitational radiation can
occur.
