In study of pseudo(quasi)-hermitian operators, the key role is played by the
positive-definite metric operator. It enables physical interpretation of the
considered systems. In the article, we study the pseudo-hermitian systems with
constant number of particles in equilibrium. We show that the explicit
knowledge of the metric operator is not essential for study of thermodynamic
properties of the system. We introduce a simple example where the physically
relevant quantities are derived without explicit calculation of either metric
operator or spectrum of the Hamiltonian.
