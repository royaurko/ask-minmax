The article is devoted to a proof of the optimal upper-bound for Morse Lemma,
its "anti"-version and their applications. Roughly speaking, Morse Lemma states
that in a hyperbolic metric space, a $\lambda$-quasi-geodesic $\gamma$ sits in
a $\lambda^2$-neighborhood of every geodesic $\sigma$ with same endpoints.
Anti-Morse Lemma states that $\sigma$ sits in a $\log\lambda$-neighborhood of
$\gamma$. Applications include the displacement of points under
quasi-isometries fixing the ideal boundary.
