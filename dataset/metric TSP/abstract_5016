Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals
(IMRIs)--binaries in which a stellar-mass object spirals into a massive black
hole or other massive, compact body--are important sources of gravitational
waves for LISA and LIGO, respectively. Thorne has speculated that the waves
from EMRIs and IMRIs encode, in principle, all the details of (i) the central
body's spacetime geometry (metric), (ii) the tidal coupling (energy and angular
momentum exchange) between the central body and orbiting object, and (iii) the
evolving orbital elements. Fintan Ryan has given a first partial proof that
this speculation is correct: Restricting himself to nearly circular, nearly
equatorial orbits and ignoring tidal coupling, Ryan proved that the central
body's metric is encoded in the waves. In this paper we generalize Ryan's
theorem. Retaining Ryan's restriction to nearly circular and nearly equatorial
orbits, and dropping the assumption of no tidal coupling, we prove that
Thorne's conjecture is nearly fully correct: the waves encode not only the
central body's metric but also the evolving orbital elements and (in a sense
slightly different from Thorne's conjecture) the evolving tidal coupling.
