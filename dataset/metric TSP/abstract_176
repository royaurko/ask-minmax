We will consider inclusion of metric balls defined by the quasihyperbolic,
the $j$-metric and the chordal metric. The quasihyperbolic metric and the
$j$-metric are considered in general subdomains of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and in some
particular domains like $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus {0}$ and the upper half-space.
