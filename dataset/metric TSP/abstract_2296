Let $(X,d,\mu)$ be a complete metric measure space, with $\mu$ a locally
doubling measure, that supports a local weak $L^2$-Poincar\'e inequality. By
assuming a heat semigroup type curvature condition, we prove that
Cheeger-harmonic functions are Lipschitz continuous on $(X,d,\mu)$. Gradient
estimates for Cheeger-harmonic functions and solutions to a class of non-linear
Poisson type equations are presented.
