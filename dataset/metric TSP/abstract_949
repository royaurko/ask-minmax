The aim of this paper is to introduce the sublinear Higson corona and show
that the sublinear Higson corona of Euclidean cone of P and X is decomposed
into the product of P and that of X. Here P is a compact metric space and X is
unbounded proper metric space. For example, the sublinear Higson corona of
n-dimensional Euclidean space is homeomorphic to the product of
(n-1)-dimensional sphere and that of natural numbers.
