On the basis of the Lie derivative method in a metric-affine space-time it is
shown that in the metric-affine gravitational theory the energy-momentum
conservation law and therefore the equations of the matter motion are the
consequence (as in the GR) of the gravitational field equations. The possi-
bility of the detection of the space-time non-metric properties is discussed.
