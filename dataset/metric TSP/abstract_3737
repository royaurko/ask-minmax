Let X be a Fano manifold. G.Tian proves that if X admits a Kaehler-Einstein
metric, then it satisfies two different stability conditions: one involving the
Futaki invariant of a special degeneration of X, the other
Hilbert-Mumford-stability of X w.r.t. a certain polarization. He conjectures
that each of these conditions is also sufficient for the existence of such a
metric. If this is true, then in particular the two stability conditions would
be equivalent. We show that for Fano hypersurfaces in projective space, where
due to the work of Lu and Yotov an explicit formula for the Futaki invariant is
known, these two conditions are indeed very closely related.
