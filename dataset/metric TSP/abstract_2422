Not only the Dirac operator, but also the spinor bundle of a
pseudo-Riemannian manifold depends on the underlying metric. This leads to
technical difficulties in the study of problems where many metrics are
involved, for instance in variational theory. We construct a natural finite
dimensional bundle, from which all the metric spinor bundles can be recovered
including their extra structure. In the Lorentzian case, we also give some
applications to Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory as a variational theory and show
how to coherently define a maximal Cauchy development for this theory.
