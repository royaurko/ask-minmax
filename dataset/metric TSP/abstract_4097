Exact solutions of the self-consistent relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
equations for an anisotropic magnetized plasma on the background of
Bondi-Pirani-Robinson's vacuum plane gravitational wave (PGW) metric with an
arbitrary polarization are obtained, which generalize the results obtained
earlier by one of the contributors for the transverse polarization of a
gravitational wave. Based on the reformulated energobalance equation it is
shown that in the linear approximation by gravitational wave amplitude only the
transverse polarization of PGW interacts with magnetized plasma.
