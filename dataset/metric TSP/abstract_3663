D-instantons are considered as a probe of coinciding $N$ D3-branes. They can
feel an external metric via the commutator terms in their effective action. We
show that when the D-instantons are separated from the D3-branes, the metric
which is probed at the one loop level, {\it exactly} coincides with that of the
BPS R-R 3-brane. Interesting connection of this result to the possible
explanation of the AdS/CFT correspondence within IKKT M-atrix theory is
discussed.
