Kolmogorov complexity has inspired several alignment-free distance measures,
based on the comparison of lengths of compressions, which have been applied
successfully in many areas. One of these measures, the so-called Universal
Similarity Metric (USM), has been used by Krasnogor and Pelta to compare simple
protein contact maps, showing that it yielded good clustering on four small
datasets. We report an extensive test of this metric using a much larger and
representative protein dataset: the domain dataset used by Sierk and Pearson to
evaluate seven protein structure comparison methods and two protein sequence
comparison methods. One result is that Krasnogor-Pelta method has less domain
discriminant power than any one of the methods considered by Sierk and Pearson
when using these simple contact maps. In another test, we found that the USM
based distance has low agreement with the CATH tree structure for the same
benchmark of Sierk and Pearson. In any case, its agreement is lower than the
one of a standard sequential alignment method, SSEARCH. Finally, we manually
found lots of small subsets of the database that are better clustered using
SSEARCH than USM, to confirm that Krasnogor-Pelta's conclusions were based on
datasets that were too small.
