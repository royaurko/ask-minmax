We find the exact order estimates of the approximations of the classes ${\cal
F}_{q,r}^{\psi}$ of functions of several variables by greedy approximants in
the integral metric. We also obtain the exact order estimates of the best
$n$-term orthogonal trigonometric approximations of the classes ${\cal
F}_{q,r}^{\psi}$ in the integral metric.
