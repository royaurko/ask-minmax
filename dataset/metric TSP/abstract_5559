Open source software projects evolve thanks to a group of volunteers that
help in their development. Thus, the success of these projects depends on their
ability to attract (and keep) developers. We believe the openness of a project,
i.e., how easy is for a new user to actively contribute to it, can help to make
a project more attractive. To explore the openness of a software project, we
propose three metrics focused on: (1) the distribution of the project
community, (2) the rate of acceptance of external contributions and (3) the
time it takes to become an official collaborator of the project. We have
adapted and applied these metrics to a subset of GitHub projects, thus giving
some practical findings on their openness.
