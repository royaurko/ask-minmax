A well-known class of questions asks the following: If $X$ and $Y$ are metric
measure spaces and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a Lipschitz mapping whose image has
positive measure, then must $f$ have large pieces on which it is bi-Lipschitz?
Building on methods of David (who is not the present contributor) and Semmes, we
answer this question in the affirmative for Lipschitz mappings between certain
types of Ahlfors $s$-regular, topological $d$-manifolds. In general, these
manifolds need not be bi-Lipschitz embeddable in any Euclidean space. To prove
the result, we use some facts on the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of manifolds
and a topological theorem of Bonk and Kleiner. This also yields a new proof of
the uniform rectifiability of some metric manifolds.
