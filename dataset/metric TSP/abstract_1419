Held has proposed an integration procedure within the GHP formalism built
around four real, functionally independent, zero-weighted scalars. He suggests
that such a procedure would be particularly simple for the `optimal situation',
when the formalism directly supplies the full quota of four scalars of this
type; a spacetime without any Killing vectors would be such a situation. Wils
has recently obtained a metric which he claims is the only conformally flat,
pure radiation metric which is not a plane wave; this metric has been shown by
Koutras to admit no Killing vectors, in general. Therefore, as a simple
illustration of the GHP integration procedure, we obtain systematically the
complete class of conformally flat, pure radiation metrics. Our result shows
that the conformally flat, pure radiation metrics, which are not plane waves,
are a larger class than Wils has obtained.
