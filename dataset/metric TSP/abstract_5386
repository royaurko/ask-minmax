In this paper, we introduce stable recursive subhomogeneous algebras
(SRSHAs), which is analogous to recursive subhomogeneous algebras (RSHAs)
introduced by N. C. Phillips in the studies of free minimal integer actions on
compact metric spaces. The difference between the stable version and the none
stable version is that the irreducible representations of SRSHAs are infinite
dimensional, but the irreducible representations of the RSHAs are finite
dimensional. While RSHAs play an important role in the study of free minimal
integer actions on compact metric spaces, SRSHAs play an analogous role in the
study of free minimal actions by the group of the real numbers on compact
metric spaces. In this paper, we show that simple inductive limits of SRSHAs
with no dimension growth in which the connecting maps are injective and
non-vanishing have topological stable rank one.
