It is well-known that the Kerr-metric (rotating black hole in four
dimensions) has Petrov type D. We prove a similar property in five dimensions.
The Myers-Perry metric (rotating black hole in five dimensions) with one
non-zero angular momentum has Petrov type \underline{22}. Conversely, we show
that the Myers-Perry solution is unique within a certain restricted class of
metrics of Petrov type \underline{22}.
