A new rotation version of the Curzon-Chazy metric is found. This new metric
was obtained by means of a perturbation method, in order to include slow
rotation. The solution is then proved to fulfill the Einstein field equations
using a REDUCE program. Furthermore, the applications of this new solution are
discussed.
