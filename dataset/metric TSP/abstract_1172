We introduce the notions of in-betweenness and monotonicity with respect to a
metric, for operator means. These notions can be seen as generalising their
natural counterpart for scalar means, and as a relaxation of the notion of
geodesity. We exhibit two classes of non-trivial means that are monotonic with
respect to the Euclidean metric. We also show that all Kubo-Ando means are
monotonic with respect to the trace metric, which is the natural metric for the
geometric mean.
