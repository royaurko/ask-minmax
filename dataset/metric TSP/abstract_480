Let $L$ be a big holomorphic line bundle on a complex projective manifold
$X.$ We show how to associate a convex function on the Okounkov body of $L$ to
any continuous metric $\psi$ on $L.$ We will call this the Chebyshev transform
of $\psi,$ denoted by $c[\psi].$ Our main theorem states that the difference of
metric volume of $L$ with respect to two metrics, a notion introduced by
Berman-Boucksom, is equal to the integral over the Okounkov body of the
difference of the Chebyshev transforms of the metrics. When the metrics have
positive curvature the metric volume coincides with the Monge-Amp\`ere energy,
which is a well-known functional in K\"ahler-Einstein geometry and Arakelov
geometry. We show that this can be seen as a generalization of classical
results on Chebyshev constants and the Legendre transform of invariant metrics
on toric manifolds. As an application we prove the differentiability of the
metric volume in the cone of big metrized $\mathbb{R}$-divisors. This
generalizes the result of Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson on the differentiability of
the ordinary volume of big $\mathbb{R}$-divisors and the result of
Berman-Boucksom on the differentiability of the metric volume when the
underlying line bundle is fixed.
