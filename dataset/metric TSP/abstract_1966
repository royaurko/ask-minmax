We show that for all very special quaternionic manifolds a different N=1
reduction exists, defining a Kaehler Geometry which is ``dual'' to the original
very special Kaehler geometry with metric G_{a\bar{b}}= - \partial_a \partial_b
\ln V (V={1/6}d_{abc}\lambda^a \lambda^b \lambda^c). The dual metric
g^{ab}=V^{-2} (G^{-1})^{ab} is Kaehler and it also defines a flat potential as
the original metric. Such geometries and some of their extensions find
applications in Type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau orientifolds.
