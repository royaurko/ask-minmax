Let X be a group with identity e, let A be an infinite set of generators for
X, and let (X,d_A) be the metric space with the word metric d_A induced by A.
If the diameter of the space is infinite, then for every positive integer h
there are infinitely many elements x in X with d_A(e,x)=h. It is proved that if
P is a nonempty finite set of prime numbers and A is the set of positive
integers whose prime factors all belong to P, then the diameter of the metric
space (\Z,d_A) is infinite. Let \lambda_A(h) denote the smallest positive
integer x with d_A(e,x)=h. It is an open problem to compute \lambda_A(h) and
estimate its growth rate.
