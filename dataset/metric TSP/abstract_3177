In this article we study Sobolev metrics of order one on diffeomorphism
groups on the real line. We prove that the space
$\operatorname{Diff}_{1}(\mathbb R)$ equipped with the homogenous Sobolev
metric of order one is a flat space in the sense of Riemannian geometry, as it
is isometric to an open subset of a mapping space equipped with the flat
$L^2$-metric. Here $\operatorname{Diff}_{1}(\mathbb R)$ denotes the extension
of the group of all either compactly supported, rapidly decreasing or
$H^\infty$-diffeomorphisms, that allows for a shift towards infinity. In
particular this result provides an analytic solution formula for the
corresponding geodesic equation, the non-periodic Hunter-Saxton equation. In
addition we show that one can obtain a similar result for the two-component
Hunter-Saxton equation and discuss the case of the non-homogenous Sobolev one
metric which is related to the Camassa-Holm equation.
