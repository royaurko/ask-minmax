For large software systems, refactoring activities can be a challenging task,
since for keeping component complexity under control the overall architecture
as well as many details of each component have to be considered. Product
metrics are therefore often used to quantify several parameters related to the
modularity of a software system. This paper devises an approach for
automatically suggesting refactoring opportunities on large software systems.
We show that by assessing metrics for all components, move methods refactoring
an be suggested in such a way to improve modularity of several components at
once, without hindering any other. However, computing metrics for large
software systems, comprising thousands of classes or more, can be a time
consuming task when performed on a single CPU. For this, we propose a solution
that computes metrics by resorting to GPU, hence greatly shortening computation
time. Thanks to our approach precise knowledge on several properties of the
system can be continuously gathered while the system evolves, hence assisting
developers to quickly assess several solutions for reducing modularity issues.
