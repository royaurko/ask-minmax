This letter presents a novel detection strategy for Spatially-Multiplexed
Generalized Spatial Modulation systems. It is a multi-stage detection that
produces a list of candidates of the transmitted signal vector, sorted
according to the proximity of the data vector to one of the possible vector
subspaces. The quality metric and list-length metric selects the best candidate
and manages the list length, respectively. Performance results show that it
significantly reduces the performance gap to the optimal maximum likelihood
detector, while maintaining significant computational cost reduction.
