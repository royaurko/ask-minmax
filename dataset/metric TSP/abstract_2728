It is shown that bootstrap approximations of an estimator which is based on a
continuous operator from the set of Borel probability measures defined on a
compact metric space into a complete separable metric space is stable in the
sense of qualitative robustness. Support vector machines based on shifted loss
functions are treated as special cases.
