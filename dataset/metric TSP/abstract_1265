In this article we study homogeneous warped product Einstein metrics and its
connections with homogeneous Ricci solitons. We show that homogeneous
$(\lambda,n+m)$-Einstein manifolds (which are the bases of homogeneous warped
product Einstein metrics) are one-dimensional extensions of algebraic solitons.
This answers a question from a paper of C. He, P. Petersen and W. Wylie, where
they prove the converse statement. Our proof is strongly based on their
results, but it also makes use of sharp tools from the theory of homogeneous
Ricci solitons. As an application, we obtain that any homogeneous warped
product Einstein metric with homogeneous base is diffeomorphic to a product of
homogeneous Einstein manifolds.
