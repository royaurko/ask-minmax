In this article, we consider the problem of estimating the heat kernel on
measure-metric spaces equipped with a resistance form. Such spaces admit a
corresponding resistance metric that reflects the conductivity properties of
the set. In this situation, it has been proved that when there is uniform
polynomial volume growth with respect to the resistance metric the behaviour of
the on-diagonal part of the heat kernel is completely determined by this rate
of volume growth. However, recent results have shown that for certain random
fractal sets, there are global and local (point-wise) fluctuations in the
volume as $r\rightarrow 0$ and so these uniform results do not apply. Motivated
by these examples, we present global and local on-diagonal heat kernel
estimates when the volume growth is not uniform, and demonstrate that when the
volume fluctuations are non-trivial, there will be nontrivial fluctuations of
the same order (up to exponents) in the short-time heat kernel asymptotics. We
also provide bounds for the off-diagonal part of the heat kernel. These results
apply to deterministic and random self-similar fractals, and metric space
dendrites (the topological analogues of graph trees).
