This paper is an attempt to give some general results on the tempered
fundamental group of a $p$-adic smooth algebraic varieties (which is a sort of
analog of the topologic fundamental group of complex algebraic varieties in the
p-adic world). The main result asserts that one can recover the metric
structure of the graph of the stable model of a Mumford curve from the tempered
fundamental group of this Mumford curve. We will also prove birational
invariance, invariance by algebraically closed extensions and a Kuenneth
formula for the tempered fundamental group. We will describe the tempered
fundamental group of an abelian variety and link the tempered fundamental group
of a curve to the tempered fundamental group of its Jacobian variety.
