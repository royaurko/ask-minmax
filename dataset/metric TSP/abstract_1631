We study numerically evolution of metric perturbations during reheating in a
model with two fields and a strong parametric resonance. Our calculation is
fully nonlinear and includes gravity but is restricted to spherical symmetry.
In this model, super-Hubble metric perturbations can grow during reheating only
due to effects nonlinear in fluctuations of the fields. We find that they
indeed grow and, soon after the growth begins, dominate variances of the metric
functions. Thus, the metric functions become smooth but varying significantly
over large scales. Their profiles at late times are interpreted as signalling a
gravitational instability and formation of a black hole.
