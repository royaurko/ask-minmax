Suppose that there exist two K\"ahler metrics $\omega$ and $\alpha$ such that
the metric contraction of $\alpha$ with respect to $\omega$ is constant, i.e.
$\Lambda_{\omega} \alpha = \text{const}$. We prove that for all large enough
$R>0$ there exists a twisted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric
$\omega'$ in the cohomology class $[ \omega ]$, satisfying $S(\omega' ) - R
\Lambda_{\omega' } \alpha = \text{const}$. We discuss its implication to
$K$-stability and the continuity method recently proposed by X.X. Chen.
