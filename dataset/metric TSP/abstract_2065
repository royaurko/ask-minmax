We consider discrete Schr"odinger operators on the line with potentials
generated by a minimal homeomorphism on a compact metric space and a continuous
sampling function. We introduce the concepts of topological and metric
repetition property. Assuming that the underlying dynamical system satisfies
one of these repetition properties, we show using Gordon's Lemma that for a
generic continuous sampling function, the associated Schr"odinger operators
have no eigenvalues in a topological or metric sense, respectively. We present
a number of applications, particularly to shifts and skew-shifts on the torus.
