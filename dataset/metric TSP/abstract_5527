Let (X,L) be a polarized compact manifold, i.e. L is an ample line bundle
over X and denote by H the infinite dimensional space of all positively curved
Hermitian metrics on L equipped with the Mabuchi metric. In this short note we
show, using Bedford-Taylor type envelope techniques developed in the contributors
previous work [ber2], that Chen's weak geodesic connecting any two elements in
H are C^{1,1}-smooth, i.e. the real Hessian is bounded, for any fixed time t,
thus improving the original bound on the Laplacins due to Chen. This also gives
a partial generalization of Blocki's refinement of Chen's regularity result.
More generally, a regularity result for complex Monge-Ampere equations over
X\timesD, for D a pseudconvex domain in \C^{n} is given.
