We show that, in the framework of Deformed Special Relativity (DSR), namely a
(four-dimensional) generalization of the (local) space-time struc- ture based
on an energy-dependent "deformation" of the usual Minkowski geometry, two kinds
of gauge symmetries arise, whose spaces either coin- cide with the deformed
Minkowski space or are just internal spaces to it. This is why we named them
"metric gauge theories". In the case of the internal gauge ?elds, they are a
consequence of the deformed Minkowski space (DMS) possessing the structure of a
generalized Lagrange space. Such a geometrical structure allows one to de?ne
curvature and torsion in the DMS.
