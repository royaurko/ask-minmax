In this paper, we give a Schr\"odinger-type uncertainty relation using the
Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information. In addition, we give Schr\"odinger-type
uncertainty relation by use of a two-parameter extended correlation measure.
Moreover, we give the further generalization for Schr\"odinger-type uncertainty
relation by metric adjusted correlation measure. These results generalize our
previous result in [Phys. Rev. A, Vol.82(2010), 034101].
