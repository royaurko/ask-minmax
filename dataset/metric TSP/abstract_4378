If a smooth compact 4-manifold M admits a Kaehler-Einstein metric g of
positive scalar curvature, Gursky showed that its conformal class [g] is an
absolute minimizer of the Weyl functional among all conformal classes with
positive Yamabe constant. Here we prove that, with the same hypotheses, [g]
also minimizes of the Weyl functional on a different open set of conformal
classes, most of which have negative Yamabe constant. An analogous minimization
result is then proved for Einstein metrics g which are Hermitian, but not
Kaehler.
