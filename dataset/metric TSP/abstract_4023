In the last few years, many different performance measures have been
introduced to overcome the weakness of the most natural metric, the Accuracy.
Among them, Matthews Correlation Coefficient has recently gained popularity
among researchers not only in machine learning but also in several application
fields such as bioinformatics. Nonetheless, further novel functions are being
proposed in literature. We show that Confusion Entropy, a recently introduced
classifier performance measure for multi-class problems, has a strong
(monotone) relation with the multi-class generalization of a classical metric,
the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Computational evidence in support of the
claim is provided, together with an outline of the theoretical explanation.
