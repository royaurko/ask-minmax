We use the square root of inverse metric described by $l=u^{\dag} \gamma^{a}
u \theta_{a}$ construct an $U(4)$ gauge invariant, locally Lorentz invariant
and generally covariant Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}=\nabla l$ which describe $U(4)$
non-abelian gauge theory in curved space-time and give the particles spectrum
of Standard Model of Particle Physics. We also construct a Lagrangian
$\mathcal{L}_{g}=\nabla^{2} l^{2}$ which might describe gravity.
