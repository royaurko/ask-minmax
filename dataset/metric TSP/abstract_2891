We present here a result of Monomialization of real analytic two-symmetric
tensor fields over regular real analytic surfaces. We apply it to the
(extension of the pull-back of the) inner metric of a resolved surface of a
real analytic surface singularity. Doing so we recover Hsiang & Pati property
at each point of the resolved surface.
