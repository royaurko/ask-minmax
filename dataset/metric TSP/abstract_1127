We analyze the Bures metric over the canonical thermal states for the Kitaev
honeycomb mode. In this way the effects of finite temperature on topological
phase transitions can be studied. Different regions in the parameter space of
the model can be clearly identified in terms of different temperature scaling
behavior of the Bures metric tensor. Furthermore, we show a simple relation
between the metric elements and the crossover temperature between the
quasi-critical and the quasi-classical regions. These results extend the ones
of [29,30] to finite temperatures.
