The Yamabe invariant Y(M) of a smooth compact manifold is roughly the
supremum of the scalar curvatures of unit-volume constant-scalar-curvature
Riemannian metrics g on M. (To be precise, one only considers those
constant-scalar-curvature metrics which are Yamabe minimizers, but this
technicality does not, e.g. affect the sign of the answer.) In this article, it
is shown that many 4-manifolds M with Y(M) < 0 have have finite covering spaces
\tilde{M} with Y(\tilde{M}) > 0.
