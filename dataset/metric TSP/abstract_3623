Recently, Brownstein and Moffat proposed a gravitational mechanism to explain
the Pioneer anomaly based on their scalar-tensor-vector (STVG) metric theory of
gravity. In this paper we show that their model, fitted to the presently
available data for the anomalous Pioneer 10/11 acceleration, is in contrast
with the latest determinations of the perihelion extra-rates of Jupiter, Saturn
and Uranus.
