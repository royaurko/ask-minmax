We present some results regarding metric perturbations in general relativity
and other metric theories of gravity. In particular, using the Newman Penrose
variables, we write down and discuss the equations which govern tensor field
perturbations of ranks $0, \pm 1$ and $\pm 2$ (scalar,vector,tensor bosonic
perturbations) over certain space-times that admit specific background metrics
expressible in isotropic coordinates. Armed with these equations, we are able
to develop the Hadamard series which can be associated with the fundamental
solution of the equations, wherein we introduce an inhomogeneous singularity at
the physical space-time point of the perturbing particle. The Hadamard series
is then used to generate closed form solutions by making choices for an
appropriate ansatz solution. In particular, we solve for the spin-weighted
electrostatic potential for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and for the fully
dynamical potential for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological solution.
