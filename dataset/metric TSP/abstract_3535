We present the generalized Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution of the field
equations of metric-affine gravity (MAG), endowed with electric and magnetic
charges, as well as with gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic charges and a
cosmological constant term. Moreover, the case $M=e_o$, i.e. mass equal to
electric charge and $\lambda=0$, corresponds to an electrically and
magnetically charged monopole. Also further multipole solutions are obtained.
The charge assignments of the solutions is discussed.
