This article presents a new and more elementary proof of the main
Seiberg-Witten-based obstruction to the existence of Einstein metrics on smooth
compact 4-manifolds. It also introduces a new smooth manifold invariant which
conveniently encapsulates those aspects of Seiberg-Witten theory most relevant
to the study of Riemannian variational problems on 4-manifolds.
