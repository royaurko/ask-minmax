Rectangular TVS-cone metric spaces are introduced and Kannan's fixed point
theorem is proved in these spaces. Two approaches are followed for the proof.
At first we prove the theorem by a direct method using the structure of the
space itself. Secondly, we use the nonlinear scalarization used recently by
Wei-Shih Du in [A note on cone metric fixed point theory and its equivalence,
{Nonlinear Analysis},72(5),2259-2261 (2010).] to prove the equivalence of the
Banach contraction principle in cone metric spaces and usual metric spaces. The
proof is done without any normality assumption on the cone of the locally
convex topological vector space, and hence generalizing several previously
obtained results.
