We study the metric entropy of the metric space $B_n$ of all n-dimensional
Banach spaces (the so-called Banach-Mazur compactum) equipped with the
Banach-Mazur (multiplicative) "distance" $d$. We are interested either in
estimates independent of the dimension or in asymptotic estimates when the
dimension tends to $\infty$. For instance, we prove that, if $N({B_n},d,
1+\varepsilon)$ is the smallest number of "balls" of "radius" $1+\varepsilon$
that cover $ B_n$, then for any $\varepsilon>0$ we have $$0<\liminf_{n\to
\infty}n^{-1} \log\log N(B_n,d,1+\varepsilon)\le \limsup_{n\to \infty}n^{-1}
\log\log N(B_n,d,1+\varepsilon)<\infty.$$ We also prove an analogous result for
the metric entropy of the set of n-dimensional operator spaces equipped with
the distance $d_N$ naturally associated to $N\times N$-matrices with operator
entries. In that case $N$ is arbitrary but our estimates are valid
independently of $N$. In the Banach space case (i.e.N=1) the above upper bound
is part of the folklore, and the lower bound is at least partially known (but
apparently has not appeared in print). While we follow the same approach in
both cases, the matricial case requires more delicate ingredients, namely
estimates (from our previous work) on certain $n$-tuples of $N\times N$ unitary
matrices known as "quantum expanders".
