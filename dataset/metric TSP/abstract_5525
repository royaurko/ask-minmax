In this paper, a complete analysis of symmetries and conservation laws for
the charged squashed Kaluza--Klein black hole spacetime in a Riemannian space
is discussed. First, a comprehensive group analysis of the underlying
space-time metric using Lie point symmetries are presented and then it the
$n$-dimensional optimal system of this space-time metric, for $n=1,\ldots,4$,
are computed. It is shown that there is not any $n$-dimensional optimal system
of Lie symmetry subalgebra associated to the system of geodesic for $n\geq5$.
Then the point symmetries of the one parameter Lie groups of transformations
that leave invariant the action integral corresponding to the Lagrangian that
means Noether symmetries are found and then the conservation laws associated to
the system of geodesic equations are calculated via Noether's theorem.
