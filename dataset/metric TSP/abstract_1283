We study paracontact metric $(\kappa,\mu)$-spaces with $\kappa=-1$,
equivalent to $h^2=0$ but not $h=0$. In particular, we will give an alternative
proof of Theorem 3.2 of [11] and present examples of paracontact metric
$(-1,2)$-spaces and $(-1,0)$-spaces of arbitrary dimension with tensor $h$ of
every possible constant rank. We will also show explicit examples of
paracontact metric $(-1, \mu)$-spaces with tensor $h$ of non-constant rank,
which were not known to exist until now.
