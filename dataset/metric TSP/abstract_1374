In continuation of [3] we discuss metrics of the form $$ G^P_f(h,k)=\int_M
\sum_{i=0}^p\Phi_i(\Vol(f)) \g((P_i)_fh,k) \vol(f^*\g) $$ on the space of
immersions $\Imm(M,N)$ and on shape space $B_i(M,N)=\Imm(M,N)/\on{Diff}(M)$.
Here $(N,\g)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold, $M$ is a compact manifold,
$f:M\to N$ is an immersion, $h$ and $k$ are tangent vectors to $f$ in the space
of immersions, $f^*\g$ is the induced Riemannian metric on $M$, $\vol(f^*\g)$
is the induced volume density on $M$, $\Vol(f)=\int_M\vol(f^*\g)$, $\Phi_i$ are
positive real-valued functions, and $(P_i)_f$ are operators like some power of
the Laplacian $\Delta^{f^*\g}$. We derive the geodesic equations for these
metrics and show that they are sometimes well-posed with the geodesic
exponential mapping a local diffeomorphism. The new aspect here are the weights
$\Ph_i(\Vol(f))$ which we use to construct scale invariant metrics and order 0
metrics with positive geodesic distance. We treat several concrete special
cases in detail.
