We show that degenerate complex Monge-Ampere equations in a big cohomology
class of a compact Kaehler manifold can be solved using a variational method
independent of Yau's theorem. Our formulation yields in particular a natural
pluricomplex analogue of the classical logarithmic energy of a measure. We also
investigate Kaehler-Einstein equations on Fano manifolds. Using continuous
geodesics in the closure of the space of Kaehler metrics and Berndtsson's
positivity of direct images we extend Ding-Tian's variational characterization
and Bando-Mabuchi's uniqueness result to singular Kaehler-Einstein metrics.
Finally using our variational characterization we prove the existence,
uniqueness and convergence of k-balanced metrics in the sense of Donaldson both
in the (anti)canonical case and with respect to a measure of finite
pluricomplex energy in our sense.
