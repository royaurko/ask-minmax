We study the asymptotic behaviour of families of gradient flows in a general
metric setting, when the metric-dissipation potentials degenerate in the limit
to a dissipation with linear growth. We present a general variational
definition of BV solutions to metric evolutions, showing the different
characterization of the solution in the absolutely continuous regime, on the
singular Cantor part, and along the jump transitions. By using tools of metric
analysis, BV functions and blow-up by time rescaling, we show that this
variational notion is stable with respect to a wide class of perturbations
involving energies, distances, and dissipation potentials. As a particular
application, we show that BV solutions to rate-independent problems arise
naturally as a limit of $p$-gradient flows, $p>1$, when the exponents $p$
converge to 1.
