We show that the G{\" o}del type Metrics in three dimensions with arbitrary
two dimensional background space satisfy the Einstein-perfect fluid field
equations. There exists only one first order partial differential equation
satisfied by the components of fluid's velocity vector field. We then show that
the same metrics solve the field equations of the topologically massive gravity
where the two dimensional background geometry is a space of constant negative
Gaussian curvature. We discuss the possibility that the G{\" o}del Type Metrics
to solve the Ricci and Cotton flow equations. When the vector field $u^{\mu}$
is a Killing vector field we finally show that the stationary G{\" o}del Type
Metrics solve the field equations of the most possible gravitational field
equations where the interaction lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the
electromagnetic field and the curvature tensors.
