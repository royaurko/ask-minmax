We call a metric quasi-Einstein if the $m$-Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor is a
constant multiple of the metric tensor. This is a generalization of Einstein
metrics, which contains gradient Ricci solitons and is also closely related to
the construction of the warped product Einstein metrics. We study properties of
quasi-Einstein metrics and prove several rigidity results. We also give a
splitting theorem for some K\"ahler quasi-Einstein metrics.
