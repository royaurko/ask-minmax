In the setting of a metric space equipped with a doubling measure and
supporting a Poincar\'e inequality, and based on results by Bj\"orn and
Shanmugalingam (2007), we show that functions of bounded variation can be
extended from any bounded uniform domain to the whole space. Closely related to
extensions is the concept of boundary traces, which have previously been
studied by Hakkarainen et al. (2014). On spaces that satisfy a suitable
locality condition for sets of finite perimeter, we establish some basic
results for the traces of functions of bounded variation. Our analysis of
traces also produces novel results on the behavior of functions of bounded
variation in their jump sets.
