Generalized Painleve-Gullstrand metrics are explicitly constructed for the
Kerr-Newman family of charged rotating black holes. These descriptions are free
of all coordinate singularities; moreover, unlike the Doran and other proposed
metrics, an extra tunable function is introduced to ensure all variables in the
metrics remain real for all values of the mass M, charge Q, angular momentum
aM, and cosmological constant \Lambda > - 3/(a^2). To describe fermions in
Kerr-Newman spacetimes, the stronger requirement of non-singular vierbein
one-forms at the horizon(s) is imposed and coordinate singularities are
eliminated by local Lorentz boosts. Other known vierbein fields of Kerr-Newman
black holes are analysed and discussed; and it is revealed that some of these
descriptions are actually not related by physical Lorentz transformations to
the original Kerr-Newman expression in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates - which is
the reason complex components appear (for certain ranges of the radial
coordinate) in these metrics. As an application of our constructions the
correct effective Hawking temperature for Kerr black holes is derived with the
method of Parikh and Wilczek.
