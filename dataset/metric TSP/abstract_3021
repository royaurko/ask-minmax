A systematic approach has been developed to encompass the Minkowski-type
extension of Euclidean geometry such that a one-vector anisotropy is permitted,
retaining simultaneously the concept of angle. For the respective geometry, the
Euclidean unit ball is to be replaced by the body which is convex and rotund
and is found on assuming that its surface (the indicatrix extending the unit
sphere) is a space of constant positive curvature. We have called the body the
Finsleroid in view of its intrinsic relationship with the metric function of
Finsler type.
 The main point of the present paper is the angle coming from geodesics through
the cosine theorem, the underlying idea being to derive the angular measure
from the solutions to the geodesic equation which prove to be obtainable in
simple explicit forms. The substantive items concern geodesics, angle, scalar
product, perpendicularity, and two-vector metric tensor. The
Finsleroid-space-associated one-vector Finslerian metric function admits in
quite a natural way an attractive two-vector extension.
