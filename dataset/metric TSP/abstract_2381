We prove Obata's rigidity theorem for metric measure spaces that satisfy a
Riemannian curvature-dimension condition. Additionally, we show that a lower
bound $K$ for the generalized Hessian of a sufficiently regular function $u$
holds if and only if $u$ is $K$-convex. A corollary is also a rigidity result
for higher order eigenvalues.
