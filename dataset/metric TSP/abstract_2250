Let D a divisor with simple normal crossings in a Kahler manifold X. The
purpose of this short note is to show that the existence of a Poincare type
metric with constant scalar curvature in on the complement of D implies for any
component of the divisor that the scalar curvature of Poincare type metric
outside of D is less than the mean scalar curvature attached to the component.
We also explain how those results were already conjectured by G. Szekelyhidi
when D is reduced to one component.
