The stress-energy tensor of a quantized scalar field is computed in the
reduced two-dimensional charged dilatonic black hole spacetime of Garfinkle,
Horowitz, and Strominger. In order for the stress-energy of quantized fields to
be regular on the event horizon in both the extreme string metric and the
conformally associated physical metric, it is necessary to assign a nonzero
temperature, T = (8 pi e^{phi_0} M)^{-1}, to the extreme string metric,
contrary to the expectation that this horizonless spacetime would have a
natural temperature of zero.
