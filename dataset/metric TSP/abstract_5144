A geometrization of the Yang-Mills field, by which an SU(2) gauge theory
becomes equivalent to a 3-space geometry - or optical system - is examined.
In a first step, ambient space remains Euclidean and current problems on flat
space can be looked at from a new point of view. The Wu-Yang ambiguity, for
example, appears related to the multiple possible torsions of distinct
metric-preserving connections. In a second step, also the ambient space
becomes curved. In general, the strictly Riemannian, metric sector plays the
role of an arbitrary host space, with the gauge field represented by a
contorsion. For some field configurations, however, it is possible to obtain a
purely metric representation. In those cases, if the space is symmetric
homogeneous the Christoffel connections are automatically solutions of the
Yang-Mills equations.
