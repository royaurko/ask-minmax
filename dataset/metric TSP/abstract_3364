In order to investigate to what extent the calculus of classical
(pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds can be extended to a noncommutative setting, we
introduce pseudo-Riemannian calculi of modules over noncommutative algebras. In
this framework, it is possible to prove an analogue of Levi-Civita's theorem,
stating that there exists at most one torsion-free and metric connection for a
given (metric) module, satisfying the requirements of a real metric calculus.
Furthermore, the corresponding curvature operator has the same symmetry
properties as the classical Riemannian curvature. As our main motivating
example, we consider a pseudo-Riemannian calculus over the noncommutative
3-sphere and explicitly determine the torsion-free and metric connection, as
well as the curvature operator together with its scalar curvature.
