The motion of a spinning test particle given by the Mathisson-Papapetrou
equations is studied on an exterior vacuum C metric background spacetime
describing the accelerated motion of a spherically symmetric gravitational
source. We consider circular orbits of the particle around the direction of
acceleration of the source. The symmetries of this configuration lead to the
reduction of the differential equations of motion to algebraic relations. The
spin supplementary conditions as well as the coupling between the spin of the
particle and the acceleration of the source are discussed.
