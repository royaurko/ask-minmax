The Eisenhart-Duval lift allows embedding non-relativistic theories into a
Lorentzian geometrical setting. In this paper we study the lift from the point
of view of the Dirac equation and its hidden symmetries. We show that
dimensional reduction of the Dirac equation for the Eisenhart-Duval metric in
general gives rise to the non-relativistic Levy-Leblond equation in lower
dimension. We study in detail in which specific cases the lower dimensional
limit is given by the Dirac equation, with scalar and vector flux, and the
relation between lift, reduction and the hidden symmetries of the Dirac
equation. While there is a precise correspondence in the case of the lower
dimensional massive Dirac equation with no flux, we find that for generic
fluxes it is not possible to lift or reduce all solutions and hidden
symmetries. As a by-product of this analysis we construct new Lorentzian
metrics with special tensors by lifting Killing-Yano and Closed Conformal
Killing-Yano tensors and describe the general Conformal Killing-Yano tensor of
the Eisenhart-Duval lift metrics in terms of lower dimensional forms. Lastly,
we show how dimensionally reducing the higher dimensional operators of the
massless Dirac equation that are associated to shared hidden symmetries it is
possible to recover hidden symmetry operators for the Dirac equation with flux.
