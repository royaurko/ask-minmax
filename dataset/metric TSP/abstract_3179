IT industry should inculcate effective defect management on a continual basis
to deploy nearly a zerodefect product to their customers. Inspection is one of
the most imperative and effective strategies of defect management.
Nevertheless, existing defect management strategies in leading software
industries are successful to deliver a maximum of 96% defect-free product. An
empirical study of various projects across several service-based and
product-based industries proves the above affirmations. This paper provides an
enhanced approach of inspection through a Four-Step Approach Model of
Inspection (FAMI). FAMI consists of i) integration of Inspection Life Cycle in
V-model of software development, ii) implementation of process metric Depth of
Inspection (DI), iii) implementation of people metric Inspection Performance
Metric (IPM), iv) application of Bayesian probability approach for selection of
appropriate values of inspection affecting parameters to achieve the desirable
DI. The managers of software houses can make use of P2 metric as a benchmarking
tool for the projects in order to improve the in-house defect management
process. Implementation of FAMI in software industries reflects a continual
process improvement and leads to the development of nearly a zero-defect
product through effective defect management.
