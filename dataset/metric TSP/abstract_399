We prove that each sub-Riemannian manifold can be embedded in some Euclidean
space preserving the length of all the curves in the manifold. The result is an
extension of Nash C^1 Embedding Theorem. For more general metric spaces the
same result is false, e.g., for Finsler non-Riemannian manifolds. However, we
also show that any metric space of finite Hausdorff dimension can be embedded
in some Euclidean space via a Lipschitz map.
