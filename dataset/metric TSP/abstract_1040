Here we study novel effects associated with electromagnetic wave propagation
in a Robertson-Walker universe and the Schwarzschild spacetime with a small
amount of metric stochasticity. We find that localization of electromagnetic
waves occurs in a Robertson-Walker universe with time-independent metric
stochasticity, while time-dependent metric stochasticity induces exponential
instability in the particle production rate. For the Schwarzschild metric,
time-independent randomness can decrease the total luminosity of Hawking
radiation due to multiple scattering of waves outside the black hole and gives
rise to event horizon fluctuations and thus fluctuations in the Hawking
temperature.
