We extend the results obtained in a previous paper about a class of
Lagrangian systems which admit alternative kinetic energy metrics to
second-order mechanical systems with explicit time-dependence. The main results
are that a time-dependent alternative metric will have constant eigenvalues,
and will give rise to a time-dependent coordinate transformation which
partially decouples the system.
