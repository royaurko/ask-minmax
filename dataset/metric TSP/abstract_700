In the paper arXiv:1411.4887 [math.AP] it is shown that the set of Riemannian
metrics which do not admit global limiting Carleman weights is open and dense,
by studying the conformally invariant Weyl and Cotton tensors. In the paper
arXiv:1011.2507 [math.DG] it is shown that the set of Riemannian metrics which
do not admit local limiting Carleman weights at any point is residual, showing
that it contains the set of metrics for which there are no local conformal
diffeomorphisms between any distinct open subsets. This note is a continuation
of arXiv:1411.4887 [math.AP] in order to prove that the set of Riemannian
metrics which do not admit local limiting Carleman weights \emph{at any point}
is open and dense.
