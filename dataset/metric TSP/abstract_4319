The h-index can be a useful metric for evaluating a person's output of
Internet media. Here we advocate and demonstrate adaption of the h-index and
the g-index to the top video content creators on YouTube. The h-index for
Internet video media is based on videos and their view counts. The index h is
defined as the number of videos with >= h*10^5 views. The index g is defined as
the number of videos with >= g*10^5 views on average. When compared to a video
creator's total view count, the h-index and g-index better capture both
productivity and impact in a single metric.
