We examine charged slowly rotating perfect fluids in the presence of a
cosmological constant. The asymptotic form of the vacuum solutions to the
linearised Einstein-Maxwell field equations is found and the possibility of
matching this vacuum to the slow rotating Garc\'ia metric is considered. We
show that, contrary to the case of zero cosmological constant, this Garc\'ia
metric can be matched to an asymptotically de Sitter vacuum in the slow
rotation limit. We conclude the Garc\'ia metric may potentially be suitable for
describing a charged isolated rotating body in a cosmological background.
