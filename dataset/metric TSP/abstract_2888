In this paper, we study the quasi-Einstein and generalized quasi-Einstein
warped products with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection. We give the
expressions of the Ricci tensors and scalar curvatures for the bases and
fibres. In some cases we give some obstructions to the existence of the
quasi-Einstein and generalized quasi-Einstein warped products with a
semi-symmetric non-metric connection.
