We consider spaces M_7 and M_8 of G_2 holonomy and Spin(7) holonomy in seven
and eight dimensions, with a U(1) isometry. For metrics where the length of the
associated circle is everywhere finite and non-zero, one can perform a
Kaluza-Klein reduction of supersymmetric M-theory solutions (Minkowksi)_4\times
M_7 or (Minkowksi)_3\times M_8, to give supersymmetric solutions
(Minkowksi)_4\times Y_6 or (Minkowksi)_3\times Y_7 in type IIA string theory
with a non-singular dilaton. We study the associated six-dimensional and
seven-dimensional spaces Y_6 and Y_7 perturbatively in the regime where the
string coupling is weak but still non-zero, for which the metrics remain
Ricci-flat but that they no longer have special holonomy, at the linearised
level. In fact they have ``almost special holonomy,'' which for the case of Y_6
means almost Kahler, together with a further condition. For Y_7 we are led to
introduce the notion of an ``almost G_2 manifold,'' for which the associative
3-form is closed but not co-closed. We obtain explicit classes of non-singular
metrics of almost special holonomy, associated with the near Gromov-Hausdorff
limits of families of complete non-singular G_2 and Spin(7) metrics.
