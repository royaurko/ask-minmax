We give new examples of closed smooth 4-manifolds which support singular
metrics of nonpositive curvature, but no smooth ones, thereby answering
affirmatively a question of Gromov. The obstruction comes from patterns of
incompressible 2-tori sufficiently complicated to force branching of geodesics
for nonpositively curved metrics.
