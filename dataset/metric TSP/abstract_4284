The universal conductance fluctuations of quasi-two-dimensional systems are
analyzed with experimental considerations in mind. The traditional statistical
metrics of these fluctuations (such as variance) are shown to have large
statistical errors in such systems. An alternative characteristic is
identified, the inflection point of the correlation function in magnetic field,
which is shown to be significantly more useful as an experimental metric and to
give a more robust measure of phase coherence.
