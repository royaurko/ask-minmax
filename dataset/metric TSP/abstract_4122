Let M be a smooth compact connected oriented manifold of dimension at least
two endowed with a volume form. Assuming certain conditions on the fundamental
group $\pi_1(M)$ we construct quasi-isometric embeddings of either free Abelian
or direct products of non-Abelian free groups into the group of volume
preserving diffeomorphisms of M equipped with the L^p metric induced by a
Riemannian metric on M.
