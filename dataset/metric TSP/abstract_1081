We give an answer to the following question: for which metric in an abstract
lattice the completion as a metric space coincides with the completion as a
lattice. We obtain the answer for inductive limits of lattices which are
complete in both senses. As an application we construct such a metric in the
lattice of continuous functions endowed with the uniform convergence.
