In the context of general iterated function systems (IFSs), we introduce
bilinear fractal interpolants as the fixed points of certain
Read-Bajraktarevi\'{c} operators. By exhibiting a generalized "taxi-cab"
metric, we show that the graph of a bilinear fractal interpolant is the
attractor of an underlying contractive bilinear IFS. We present an explicit
formula for the box-counting dimension of the graph of a bilinear fractal
interpolant in the case of equally spaced data points.
