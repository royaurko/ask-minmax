We present a general fixed point theorem which can be seen as the
quintessence of the principles of proof for Banach's Fixed Point Theorem,
ultrametric and certain topological fixed point theorems. It works in a minimal
setting, not involving any metrics. We demonstrate its applications to the
metric, ultrametric and topological cases, and to ordered abelian groups and
fields.
