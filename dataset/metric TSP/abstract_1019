We prove existence results for invariant metrics of positive scalar curvature
on certain non-semi-free $S^1$-manifolds. As a result after inverting two there
is only one obstruction against such metrics on these manifolds. For free
actions of even type on spin manifolds this obstruction coincides with the
$\hat{A}$-genus of the orbit space of the action.
