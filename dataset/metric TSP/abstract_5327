Within the theory of the ghost-free bigravity, we present the most general
cosmological solution for which the physical metric is homogeneous and
isotropic, while the second metric is inhomogeneous. The solution includes a
matter source and exists for any values of the theory parameters. The physical
metric describes a universe with the late time acceleration due to the
effective cosmological term mimicked by the graviton mass. When perturbed, this
universe should rest approximately homogeneous and isotropic in space regions
small compared to the graviton Compton length. In the limit where the massless
graviton decouples, the solution fulfills the equations of the ghost-free
massive gravity.
