We investigate a possible way of establishing a parallel between the third
law of black hole mechanics, and the strong version of the third law of
thermodynamics. We calculate the surface gravity and area for a naked singular
null surface in the Gamma-metric and explain in what sense this behaviour
violates thermodynamics.
