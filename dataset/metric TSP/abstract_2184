Let $(M,g,\sigma)$ be a compact Riemmannian surface equipped with a spin
structure $\sigma$. For any metric $\tilde{g}$ on $M$, we denote by
$\mu\_1(\tilde{g})$ (resp. $\lambda\_1(\tilde{g})$) the first positive
eigenvalue of the Laplacian (resp. the Dirac operator) with respect to the
metric $\tilde{g}$. In this paper, we show that $$\inf
\frac{\lambda\_1(\tilde{g})^2}{\mu\_1(\tilde{g})} \leqslant {1/2}.$$ where the
infimum is taken over the metrics $\tilde{g}$ conformal to $g$. This answer a
question asked by Agricola, Ammann and Friedrich
