The Schwarzschild metric giving the space time due to a spherically symmetric
object is derived in the background of the Robertson Walker metric. In other
words the two metrics are merged. It is found that under certain conditions the
merger is at a distance less than the radius of the spherically symmetric
object, thus not separating the object from the rest of the universe.
