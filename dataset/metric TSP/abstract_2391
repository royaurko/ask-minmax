It is time to make changes to the current research evaluation system, which
is built on the journal selection. In this study, we propose the idea of
continuous, dynamic and comprehensive article-level-evaluation based on
article-level-metrics. Different kinds of metrics are integrated into a
comprehensive indicator, which could quantify both the academic and societal
impact of the article. At different phases after the publication, the weights
of different metrics are dynamically adjusted to mediate the long term and
short term impact of the paper. Using the sample data, we make empirical study
of the article-level-evaluation method.
