We examine some of the subtleties inherent in formulating a theory of spinors
on a manifold with a smooth degenerate metric. We concentrate on the case where
the metric is singular on a hypersurface that partitions the manifold into
Lorentzian and Euclidean domains. We introduce the notion of a complex spinor
fibration to make precise the meaning of continuity of a spinor field and give
an expression for the components of a local spinor connection that is valid in
the absence of a frame of local orthonormal vectors. These considerations
enable one to construct a Dirac equation for the discussion of the behavior of
spinors in the vicinity of the metric degeneracy. We conclude that the theory
contains more freedom than the spacetime Dirac theory and we discuss some of
the implications of this for the continuity of conserved currents.
