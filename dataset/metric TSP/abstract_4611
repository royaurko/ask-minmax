Complete sequences of new analytic solutions of Einstein's equations which
describe thin super massive disks are constructed. These solutions are derived
geometrically. The identification of points across two symmetrical cuts through
a vacuum solution of Einstein's equations defines the gradient discontinuity
from which the properties of the disk can be deduced. The subset of possible
cuts which lead to physical solutions is presented. At large distances, all
these disks become Newtonian, but in their central regions they exhibit
relativistic features such as velocities close that of light, and large
redshifts. Sections with zero extrinsic curvature yield cold disks. Curved
sections may induce disks which are stable against radial instability. The
general counter rotating flat disk with planar pressure tensor is found. Owing
to gravomagnetic forces, there is no systematic method of constructing vacuum
stationary fields for which the non-diagonal component of the metric is a free
parameter. However, all static vacuum solutions may be extended to fully
stationary fields via simple algebraic transformations. Such disks can generate
a great variety of different metrics including Kerr's metric with any ratio of
a to m. A simple inversion formula is given which yields all distribution
functions compatible with the characteristics of the flow, providing formally a
complete description of the stellar dynamics of flattened relativistic disks.
It is illustrated for the Kerr disk.
