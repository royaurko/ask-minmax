We show that there are isometrically nonequivalent Robertson-Walker metrics
which have the same set of geodesics. While one of these metrics satisfies the
Einstein equations of pure dust without a cosmological constant, all the other
describe pure dust with additional energy momentum tensor of cosmological
constant type. Since each of these metrics have the same geodesics it is not
clear how to distinguish experimentally between the Universes whose energy
momentum tensor includes or not the cosmological constant type term.
