The contribution of gravitational neutrino oscillations to the solar neutrino
problem is studied by constructing the Dirac Hamiltonian and calculating the
corresponding dynamical phase in the vicinity of the Sun in a non-Riemann
background Kerr space-time with torsion and non-metricity. We show that certain
components of non-metricity and the axial as well as non-axial components of
torsion may contribute to neutrino oscillations. We also note that the rotation
of the Sun may cause a suppression of transitions among neutrinos. However, the
observed solar neutrino deficit could not be explained by any of these effects
because they are of the order of Planck scales.
