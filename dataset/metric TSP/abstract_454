The paper is devoted to investigation of the spectrum of a perturbed
Laplace-Beltrami operator on manifolds with closed geodesics of the same length
and where metric is a perturbation of the metric of the unit sphere. As the
result, we give the regularized trace formula for the eigenvalues ??of this
operator when the metric of manifold is presented in abstract form.
