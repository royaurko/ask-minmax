An exact solution of Einsteins equations which represents a pair of
accelerating and rotating black holes was presented by J. B. Griffiths and J.
Podolsky [2]. In the paper [2] they have shown the explicit form of a spinning
C-metric starting from the Plebanski-Demianski metric, and transformed it using
NUT and angular velocity parameters in addition to the usual parameters and
thus gave a generalized form of such solutions. In the forthcoming discussion,
an attempt has been made to realize the Riemann components of the proposed
metric. Furthermore, certain optical characteristics of the metric have been
analyzed using the Newman-Penrose formalism.
