We prove that every acyclic normal one-dimensional real Ambrosio-Kirchheim
current in a Polish (i.e. complete separable metric) space can be decomposed in
curves, thus generalizing the analogous classical result proven by S. Smirnov
in Euclidean space setting.
  The same assertion is true for every complete metric space under a suitable
set-theoretic assumption.
