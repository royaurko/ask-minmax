The metrics of S. Y. Cheng and S.-T. Yau are considered on a strictly
pseudoconvex domains in a complex manifold. Such a manifold carries a complete
K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric if and only if its canonical bundle is positive. We
consider the restricted case in which the CR structure on $\partial M$ is
normal. In this case M must be a domain in a resolution of the Sasaki cone over
$\partial M$. We give a condition on a normal CR manifold which it cannot
satisfy if it is a CR infinity of a K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifold. We are able
to mostly determine those normal CR 3-manifolds which can be CR infinities.
Many examples are given of K\"{a}hler-Einstein strictly pseudoconvex manifolds
on bundles and resolutions.
