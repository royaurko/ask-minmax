Metric projection operators  can be defined in similar wayin Hilbert and
Banach spaces. At the same time, they differ signifitiantly in their
properties.
Metric projection operator in Hilbert space is a monotone and nonexpansive
operator. It provides an absolutely best approximation for arbitrary elements
from Hilbert space by the elements of convex closed sets . This leads to a
variety of applications of this operator for investigating theoretical
questions in analysis and  for approximation methods.
Metric projection operators in Banach space do not have properties
mentioned above and their applications are not straightforward.
Two of  the most important applications of the method of metric
projection  operators are as follows:
 1. Solve a variational inequality by the iterative-projection method,
 2. Find common point of convex sets by the iterative-projection method.
  In Banach space these problems can not be solved in the framework of metric
projection operators. Therefore, in the present paper we introduce  new
generalized projection operators in Banach space as a natural generalization
of metric projection operators in Hilbert space.
In Sections 2 and 3 we introduce notations and recall some results from the
theory of variational inequalities and theory of approximation. Then in
Sections 4 and 5 we describe the properties of metric projection operators
$P_\Omega$ in Hilbert and Banach spaces and also formulate equivalence theorems
between variational inequalities and direct projection equations with these
