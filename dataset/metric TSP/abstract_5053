Four-dimensional massive N=2 nonlinear sigma models and BPS wall solutions
are studied in the off-shell harmonic superspace approach in which N=2
supersymmetry is manifest. The general nonlinear sigma model can be described
by an analytic harmonic potential which is the hyper-Kahler analog of the
Kahler potential in N=1 theory. We examine the massive nonlinear sigma model
with multi-center four-dimensional target hyper-Kahler metrics and derive the
corresponding BPS equation. We study in some detail two particular cases with
the Taub-NUT and double Taub-NUT metrics. The latter embodies, as its two
separate limits, both Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson metrics. We find that domain
wall solutions exist only in the double Taub-NUT case including its
Eguchi-Hanson limit.
