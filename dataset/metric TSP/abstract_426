In this paper we investigate complete critical metrics of the $L^{2}$-norm of
the scalar curvature. We prove that any complete critical metric with positive
scalar curvature has constant scalar curvature and we characterize critical
metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature in dimension three and four.
