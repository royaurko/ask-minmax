In our paper we compute the energy distribution of a magnetic stringy black
hole solution in the Weinberg prescription. The metric under consideration
describes the dual solution in the string frame that is known as the magnetic
stringy black hole solution. The metric is obtained by multiplying the electric
metric in the Einstein frame by a factor . The energy distribution depends on
the mass M and charge Q. Also, we make a discussion of the results and we
compare our result with those obtained in the Einstein and Landau and Lifshitz
prescriptions and investigate the connections between the expressions of the
energy obtained in these prescriptions.
