We give two new applications of an observation from \cite{ADFGW11}. The first
is an almost linear sized constant time data structure for reporting very large
distances in undirected graphs. The second is a generic transformation of
results about $\ell_1$-embeddability of metrics to a setting, where we are
interested in preservation of large distances only.
