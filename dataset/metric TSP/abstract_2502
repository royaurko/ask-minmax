We prove that there exists a metric of positive curvature in a three-sphere
which admits a given torus knot as a closed geodesic.We also sketch a
construction of a metric in a four sphere, very likely of positive curvature,
which admits a totally geodesic projective plane with Euler number four.
Surpisingly, the technique borrows a lot from the Mostow-Siu-Gromov-Thurston
constuction of exotic negatively curved manifolds.
