We present a thorough analysis on the invariance of the most widely used
metrics in the Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) programme. We centre our attention
in the invariance of the curvature of the space of equilibrium states under a
change of fundamental representation. Assuming that the systems under
consideration can be described by a fundamental relation which is a homogeneous
function of a definite order, we demonstrate that such invariance is only
compatible with total Legendre transformations in the present form of the
programme. We give the explicit form of a metric which is invariant under total
Legendre transformations and whose induced metric produces a curvature which is
independent of the fundamental representation. Finally, we study a generic
system with two degrees of freedom and whose fundamental relation is
homogeneous of order one.
