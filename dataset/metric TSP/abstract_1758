Let X be a smooth projective Berkovich space over a complete discrete
valuation field K of residue characteristic zero, endowed with an ample line
bundle L. We introduce a general notion of (possibly singular) semipositive (or
plurisubharmonic) metrics on L, and prove the analogue of the following two
basic results in the complex case: the set of semipositive metrics is compact
modulo constants, and each semipositive metric is a decreasing limit of smooth
semipositive ones. In particular, for continuous metrics our definition agrees
with the one by S.-W. Zhang. The proofs use multiplier ideals and the
construction of suitable models of X over the valuation ring of K, using
toroidal techniques.
