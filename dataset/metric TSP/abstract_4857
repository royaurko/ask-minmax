The performance analysis of random vector channels, particularly
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels, has largely been established in
the asymptotic regime of large channel dimensions, due to the analytical
intractability of characterizing the exact distribution of the objective
performance metrics. This paper exposes a new non-asymptotic framework that
allows the characterization of many canonical MIMO system performance metrics
to within a narrow interval under moderate-to-large channel dimensionality,
provided that these metrics can be expressed as a separable function of the
singular values of the matrix. The effectiveness of our framework is
illustrated through two canonical examples. Specifically, we characterize the
mutual information and power offset of random MIMO channels, as well as the
minimum mean squared estimation error of MIMO channel inputs from the channel
outputs. Our results lead to simple, informative, and reasonably accurate
control of various performance metrics in the finite-dimensional regime, as
corroborated by the numerical simulations. Our analysis framework is
established via the concentration of spectral measure phenomenon for random
matrices uncovered by Guionnet and Zeitouni, which arises in a variety of
random matrix ensembles irrespective of the precise distributions of the matrix
entries.
