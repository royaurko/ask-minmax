We give a new characterization of (homogeneous) Triebel-Lizorkin spaces
$\dot{\mathcal F}^{s}_{p,q}(Z)$ in the smoothness range $0 < s < 1$ for a quite
general class of metric measure spaces $Z$. The characterization uses Gromov
hyperbolic fillings of $Z$. This gives a short proof of the quasisymmetric
invariance of these spaces in case $Z$ is $Q$-Ahlfors regular and $sp = Q > 1$.
We also obtain first results on complex interpolation for these spaces in the
metric space framework.
