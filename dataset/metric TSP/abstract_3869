The role of torsion in f(R) gravity is considered in the framework of
metric-affine formalism. We discuss the field equations in empty space and in
presence of perfect fluid matter taking into account the analogy with the
Palatini formalism. As a result, the extra curvature and torsion degrees of
freedom can be dealt as an effective scalar field of fully geometric origin.
  From a cosmological point of view, such a geometric description could account
for the whole Dark Side of the Universe.
