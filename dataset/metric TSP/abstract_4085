We investigate the consequences of the pseudo-complex General Relativity
within a pseudo-complexified Roberston-Walker metric. A contribution to the
energy-momentum tensor arises, which corresponds to a dark energy and may
change with the radius of the universe, i.e., time. Only when the Hubble
function $H$ does not change in time, the solution is consistent with a
constant $\Lambda$.
