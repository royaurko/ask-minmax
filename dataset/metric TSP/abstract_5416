Single-particle states in electronic Bloch bands form a Riemannian manifold
whose geometric properties are described by two gauge invariant tensors, one
being symmetric the other being antisymmetric, that can be combined into the
so-called Fubini-Study metric tensor of the projective Hilbert space. The
latter directly controls the Hall conductivity. Here we show that the symmetric
part of the Fubini-Study metric tensor also has measurable consequences by
demonstrating that it enters the current noise spectrum. In particular, we show
that a non-vanishing equilibrium current noise spectrum at zero temperature is
unavoidable whenever Wannier states have non-zero minimum spread, the latter
being quantifiable by the symmetric part of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. We
illustrate our results by three examples: (1) atomic layers of hexagonal boron
nitride, (2) graphene, and (3) the surface states of three-dimensional
topological insulators when gaped by magnetic dopants.
