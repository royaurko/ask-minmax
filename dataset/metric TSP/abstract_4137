A high-speed multiprocessor architecture for brain-like analyzing information
represented in analytic, graph- and table forms of associative relations to
search, recognize and make a decision in n-dimensional vector discrete space is
offered. Vector-logical process models of actual applications, where the
quality of solution is estimated by the proposed integral non-arithmetical
metric of the interaction between binary vectors, are described. The
theoretical proof of the metric for a vector logical space and the quality
criteria for estimating solutions is created.
