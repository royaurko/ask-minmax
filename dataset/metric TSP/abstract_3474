Among the monotone metrics on the (n^{2} - 1)-dimensional convex set of n x n
density matrices, as Petz and Sudar have recently elaborated, there are a
minimal (Bures) and a maximal one. We examine the proposition that it is
physically meaningful to treat the volume elements of these metrics as
densities-of-states for thermodynamic purposes. In the n = 2 (spin-1/2) case,
use of the maximal monotone metric, in fact, does lead to the adoption of the
Langevin (and not the Brillouin) functions, thus, completely conforming with a
recent probabilistic argument of Lavenda. Brody and Hughston also arrived at
the Langevin function in an analysis based on the Fubini-Study metric. It is a
matter of some interest, however, that in the first (subsequently modified)
version of their paper, they had reported a different result, one fully
consistent with the alternative use of the minimal monotone metric. In this
part I of our investigation, we first study scenarios involving partially
entangled spin-1/2 particles (n = 4, 6,...) and then a certain three-level
extension of the two-level systems. In part II, we examine, in full generality,
and with some limited analytical success, the cases n = 3 and 4.
