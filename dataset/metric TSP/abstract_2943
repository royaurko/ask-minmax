Recently, an approximated solution of the Einstein equations for a rotating
body whose mass effects are negligible with respect to the rotational ones has
been derived by Tartaglia. At first sight, it seems to be interesting because
both external and internal metric tensors have been consistently found,
together an appropriate source tensor; moreover, it may suggest possible
experimental checks since the conditions of validity of the considered metric
are well satisfied at Earth laboratory scales. However, it should be pointed
out that reasonable doubts exist if it is physically meaningful because it is
not clear if the source tensor related to the adopted metric can be realized by
any real extended body. Here we derive the geodesic equations of the metric and
analyze the allowed motions in order to disclose possible unphysical features
which may help in shedding further light on the real nature of such
approximated solution of the Einstein equations.
