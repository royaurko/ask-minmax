It is shown that for a wide class of analytic Lagrangians which depend only
on the scalar curvature of a metric and a connection, the application of the
so--called ``Palatini formalism'', i.e., treating the metric and the connection
as independent variables, leads to ``universal'' equations. If the dimension
$n$ of space--time is greater than two these universal equations are Einstein
equations for a generic Lagrangian and are suitably replaced by other universal
equations at bifurcation points. We show that bifurcations take place in
particular for conformally invariant Lagrangians $L=R^{n/2} \sqrt g$ and prove
that their solutions are conformally equivalent to solutions of Einstein
equations. For 2--dimensional space--time we find instead that the universal
equation is always the equation of constant scalar curvature; the connection in
this case is a Weyl connection, containing the Levi--Civita connection of the
metric and an additional vectorfield ensuing from conformal invariance. As an
example, we investigate in detail some polynomial Lagrangians and discuss their
bifurcations.
