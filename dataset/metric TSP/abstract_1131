Starting from a 5D Riemann flat metric, we have induced an effective 4D
Hermitian metric which has an antisymmetric part which is purely imaginary. We
have worked an example in which both, non-metricity and contorsion are zero. We
obtained that the production of monopoles should be insignificant at the end of
inflation and the tensor metric should come asymptotically diagonal and
describing a nearly 4D de Sitter expansion.
