We consider a preferred-frame bimetric theory in which the scalar
gravitational field both influences the metric and has direct dynamical
effects. A modified version ("v2") is built, by assuming now a
locally-isotropic dilation of physically measured distances, as compared with
distances evaluated with the Euclidean space metric. The dynamical equations
stay unchanged: they are based on a consistent formulation of Newton's second
law in a curved space-time. To obtain a local conservation equation for energy
with the new metric, the equation for the scalar field is modified: now its
l.h.s. is the flat wave operator. Fluid dynamics is formulated and the
asymptotic scheme of post-Newtonian approximation is adapted to v2. The latter
also explains the gravitational effects on light rays, as did the former
version (v1). The violation of the weak equivalence principle found for
gravitationally-active bodies at the point-particle limit, which discarded v1,
is proved to not exist in v2. Thus that violation was indeed due to the
anisotropy of the space metric assumed in v1.
