We describe "small bodies" in a non-metric gravity theory previously studied
by this contributor. The main dynamical field of the theory is a certain triple of
two-forms rather than the metric, with only the spacetime conformal structure,
not metric, being canonically defined. The theory is obtained from general
relativity (GR) in Plebanski formulation by adding to the action a certain
potential. Importantly, the modification does not change the number of
propagating degrees of freedom as compared to GR. We find that "small bodies"
move along geodesics of a certain metric that is constructed with the help of a
new potential function that appears in the matter sector. We then use the
"small body" results to formulate a prescription for coupling the theory to
general stress-energy tensor. In its final formulation the theory takes an
entirely standard form, with matter propagating in a metric background and only
the matter-gravity coupling and the gravitational dynamics being modified. This
completes the construction of the theory and opens way to an analysis of its
physical predictions.
