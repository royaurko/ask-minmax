Based on Stein's method, we derive upper bounds for Poisson process
approximation in the $L_1$-Wasserstein metric $d_2^{(p)}$, which is based on a
slightly adapted $L_p$-Wasserstein metric between point measures. For the case
$p=1$, this construction yields the metric $d_2$ introduced in [Barbour and
Brown Stochastic Process. Appl. 43 (1992) 9--31], for which Poisson process
approximation is well studied in the literature. We demonstrate the usefulness
of the extension to general $p$ by showing that $d_2^{(p)}$-bounds control
differences between expectations of certain $p$th order average statistics of
point processes. To illustrate the bounds obtained for Poisson process
approximation, we consider the structure of 2-runs and the hard core model as
concrete examples.
