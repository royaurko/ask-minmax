We relate a recently introduced non-local geometric invariant of compact
strictly pseudoconvex Cauchy-Riemann (CR) manifolds of dimension 3 to various
eta-invariants in CR geometry: on the one hand a renormalized eta-invariant
appearing when considering a sequence of metrics converging to the CR structure
by expanding the size of the Reeb field; on the other hand the eta-invariant of
the middle degree operator of the contact complex. We then provide explicit
computations for a class of examples: transverse circle invariant CR structures
on Seifert manifolds. Applications are given to the problem of filling a CR
manifold by a complex hyperbolic manifold, and more generally by a
Kahler-Einstein or an Einstein metric.
