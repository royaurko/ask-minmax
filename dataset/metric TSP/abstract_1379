We review the geometry of K3 surfaces and then describe this geometry from
the point of view of an approximate metric of Gibbons-Hawking form. This metric
arises from the M-theory lift of the tree-level supergravity description of
type IIA string theory on the T^3/Z_2 orientifold, the D6/O6 orientifold T-dual
to type I on T^3. At large base, it provides a good approximation to the exact
K3 metric everywhere except in regions that can be made arbitrarily small. The
metric is hyperk\"ahler, and we give explicit expressions for the hyperk\"ahler
forms as well as harmonic representatives of all cohomology classes. Finally we
compute the metric on the moduli space of approximate metrics in two ways,
first by projecting to transverse traceless deformations (using compensators),
and then by computing the naive moduli space metric from dimensional reduction.
In either case, we find agreement with the exact coset moduli space of K3
metrics. The T^3/Z_2 orientifold provides a simple example of a warped
compactification. In a companion paper, the results of this paper will be
applied to study the procedure for warped Kaluza-Klein reduction on T^3/Z_2.
