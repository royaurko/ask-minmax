A classic result by Gromov and Lawson states that a Riemannian metric of
non--negative scalar curvature on the Torus must be flat. The analogous
rigidity result for the standard sphere was shown by Llarull. Later Goette and
Semmelmann generalized it to locally symmetric spaces of compact type and
nontrivial Euler characteristic. In this paper we improve the results by
Llarull and Goette, Semmelmann. In fact we show that if $(M,g_0)$ is a locally
symmetric space of compact type with $\chi (M)\neq 0$ and $g$ is a Riemannian
metric on $M$ with $\mathrm{scal}_g\cdot g\geq \mathrm{scal}_0\cdot g_0$, then
$g$ is a constant multiple of $g_0$. The previous results by Llarull and
Goette, Semmelmann always needed the two inequalities $g\geq g_0$ and
$\mathrm{scal}_g\geq \mathrm{scal}_0$ in order to conclude $g=g_0$. Moreover,
if $(S^{2m},g_0)$ is the standard sphere, we improve this result further and
show that any metric $g$ on $S^{2m}$ of scalar curvature $\mathrm{scal}_g\geq
(2m-1)\mathrm{tr}_g(g_0)$ is a constant multiple of $g_0$.
