We consider asymptotic dimension of coarse spaces. We analyse coarse
structures induced by metrisable compactifications. We calculate asymptotic
dimension of coarse cell complexes. We calculate the asymptotic dimension of
certain negatively curved spaces, e.g. for complete, simply connected manifolds
with bounded, strictly negative sectional curvature.
