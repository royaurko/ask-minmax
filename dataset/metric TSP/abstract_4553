The Perron method for solving the Dirichlet problem for p-harmonic functions
is extended to unbounded open sets in the setting of a complete metric space
with a doubling measure supporting a p-Poincar\'e inequality, 1<p<oo. The upper
and lower (p-harmonic) Perron solutions are studied for p-parabolic open sets.
It is shown that continuous functions and quasicontinuous Dirichlet functions
are resolutive (i.e., that their upper and lower Perron solutions coincide) and
that the Perron solution coincides with the p-harmonic extension. It is also
shown that Perron solutions are invariant under perturbation of the function on
a set of capacity zero.
