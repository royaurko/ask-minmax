The isometric immersion of two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds or surfaces
with negative Gauss curvature into the three-dimensional Euclidean space is
studied in this paper. The global weak solutions to the Gauss-Codazzi equations
with large data in $L^\infty$ are obtained through the vanishing viscosity
method and the compensated compactness framework. The $L^\infty$ uniform
estimate and $H^{-1}$ compactness are established through a transformation of
state variables and construction of proper invariant regions for two types of
given metrics including the catenoid type and the helicoid type. The global
weak solutions in $L^\infty$ to the Gauss-Codazzi equations yield the
$L^\infty$ isometric immersions of surfaces with the given metrics.
