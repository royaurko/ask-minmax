We provide further crucial support for a refined, area metric structure of
spacetime. Based on the solution of conceptual issues, such as the consistent
coupling of fermions and the covariant identification of radiation fields on
area metric backgrounds, we show that the radiation-dominated epoch of area
metric cosmology is equivalent to that epoch in standard Einstein cosmology.
This ensures, in particular, successful nucleosynthesis. This surprising result
complements the previously derived prediction of a small late-time acceleration
of an area metric universe.
