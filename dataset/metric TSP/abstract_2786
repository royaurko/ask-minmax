We give an explicit representation formula for the p-energy of Sobolev maps
with values in a metric space as defined by Korevaar and Schoen (Comm. Anal.
Geom. 1 (1993), no.~3-4, 561--659). The formula is written in terms of the
Lipschitz compositions introduced by Ambrosio (Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup. Pisa Cl.
Sci.(4) 3 (1990), n.17, 439--478), thus further relating the two different
definitions considered in the literature.
