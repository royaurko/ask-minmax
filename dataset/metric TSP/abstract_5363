Clustering under most popular objective functions is NP-hard, even to
approximate well, and so unlikely to be efficiently solvable in the worst case.
Recently, Bilu and Linial \cite{Bilu09} suggested an approach aimed at
bypassing this computational barrier by using properties of instances one might
hope to hold in practice. In particular, they argue that instances in practice
should be stable to small perturbations in the metric space and give an
efficient algorithm for clustering instances of the Max-Cut problem that are
stable to perturbations of size $O(n^{1/2})$. In addition, they conjecture that
instances stable to as little as O(1) perturbations should be solvable in
polynomial time. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true for any
center-based clustering objective (such as $k$-median, $k$-means, and
$k$-center). Specifically, we show we can efficiently find the optimal
clustering assuming only stability to factor-3 perturbations of the underlying
metric in spaces without Steiner points, and stability to factor $2+\sqrt{3}$
perturbations for general metrics. In particular, we show for such instances
that the popular Single-Linkage algorithm combined with dynamic programming
will find the optimal clustering. We also present NP-hardness results under a
weaker but related condition.
