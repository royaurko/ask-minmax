A family of non-radial solutions of the Yamabe equation, with reference the
hyperbolic space, is constructed using power series. As a result, we obtain a
family of asymptotically hyperbolic metrics, with spherical conformal infinity,
with scalar curvature greater than -n(n - 1), but which are a priori not
complete. Moreover, any vector of R^n+1 is performed by an energy-momentun
vector of one suitable metric of this family. They can in particular provide
counter-examples to the positive energy-momentum theorem when one removes the
completeness assumption.
