We prove new results for approximating Graphic TSP. Specifically, we provide
a polynomial-time \frac{9}{7}-approximation algorithm for cubic bipartite
graphs and a (\frac{9}{7}+\frac{1}{21(k-2)})-approximation algorithm for
k-regular bipartite graphs, both of which are improved approximation factors
compared to previous results. Our approach involves finding a cycle cover with
relatively few cycles, which we are able to do by leveraging the fact that all
cycles in bipartite graphs are of even length along with our knowledge of the
structure of cubic graphs.
