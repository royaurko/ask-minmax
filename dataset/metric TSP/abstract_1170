One dimensional metrical geometry may be developed in either an affine or
projective setting over a general field using only algebraic ideas and
quadratic forms. Some basic results of universal geometry are already present
in this situation, such as the Triple quad formula, the Triple spread formula
and the Spread polynomials, which are universal analogs of the Chebyshev
polynomials of the first kind. Chromogeometry appears here, and the related
metrical and algebraic properties of the projective line are brought to the
fore.
