Let $({\mathcal X},d,\mu)$ be a metric measure space satisfying both the
upper doubling and the geometrically doubling conditions. In this paper, the
contributors establish some equivalent characterizations for the boundedness of
fractional integrals over $({\mathcal X},d,\mu)$. The contributors also prove that
multilinear commutators of fractional integrals with
${\mathop\mathrm{\,RBMO(\mu)}}$ functions are bounded on Orlicz spaces over
$({\mathcal X},d,\mu)$, which include Lebesgue spaces as special cases. The
weak type endpoint estimates for multilinear commutators of fractional
integrals with functions in the Orlicz-type space ${\mathrm{Osc}_{\exp
L^r}(\mu)}$, where $r\in [1,\infty)$, are also presented. Finally, all these
results are applied to a specific example of fractional integrals over
non-homogeneous metric measure spaces.
