A Lorentzian flat Lie group is a Lie group $G$ with a flat left invariant
metric $\mu$ with signature $(1,n-1)=(-,+,\ldots,+)$. The Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}=T_eG$ of $G$ endowed with $\langle\;,\;\rangle=\mu(e)$ is called
flat Lorentzian Lie algebra. It is known that the metric of a flat Lorentzian
Lie group is geodesically complete if and only if its Lie algebra is
unimodular. In this paper, we characterise nonunimodular Lorentzian flat Lie
algebras as double extensions (in the sense of Aubert-Medina \cite{Aub-Med}) of
Riemannian flat Lie algebras. As application of this result, we give all
nonunimodular Lorentzian flat Lie algebras up to dimension 4.
