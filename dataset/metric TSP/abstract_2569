We prove a Model Existence Theorem for a fully infinitary logic for metric
structures. This result is based on a generalization of the notions of
approximate formulas and approximate truth in normed structures introduced by
Henson and studied in different forms by Anderson and Fajardo & Keisler. This
theorem extends Henson's Compactness Theorem for approximate truth in normed
space structures to infinitary formulas.
