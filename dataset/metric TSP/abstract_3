In this paper, we study the approximability of the metric Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) and prove new explicit inapproximability bounds for that problem.
The best up to now known hardness of approximation bounds were 185/184 for the
symmetric case (due to Lampis) and 117/116 for the asymmetric case (due to
Papadimitriou and Vempala). We construct here two new bounded occurrence CSP
reductions which improve these bounds to 123/122 and 75/74, respectively. The
latter bound is the first improvement in more than a decade for the case of the
asymmetric TSP. One of our main tools, which may be of independent interest, is
a new construction of a bounded degree wheel amplifier used in the proof of our
results.
