The system consisting of slowly-moving, maximally charged, nonrotating
dilaton black holes is investigated. We obtain the metric on the moduli space
of the system in the low-velocity limit. We find that: (1) only two-body
interactions exist between the extreme black holes in string theory; (2) the
mutual interaction between the black holes vanishes if the dilaton can be
interpreted as a Kaluza-Klein scalar; and (3) for general dilaton couplings,
there exist many-body interactions among the extreme black holes. We analyze
the low-energy classical scattering of the two extreme black holes in string
theory by utilizing the moduli space metric.
