We present a model that unites the electroweak interaction with general
relativity without specifying a space-time metric. This is made possible by
embedding the kinetic terms for gravity and electroweak theory using one $\SL$
connection variable. The gauge theory is specified without relying on a
space-time metric. We show that once a symmetry breaking mechanism is
implemented that selects a global time-like direction, the electroweak theory
and general relativity emerges with their associated massless degrees of
freedom; the spin 1 vector boson and the spin 2 graviton.
