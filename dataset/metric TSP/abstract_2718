In this note, stimulated by the existence result of Futaki-Ono-Wang for toric
Sasaki-Einstein metrics, we obtain new examples of Sasaki-Einstein metrics on
  S^1-bundles associated to canonical line bundles of P^1-bundles over
K\"ahler-Einstein Fano manifolds, even though the Futaki's obstruction does not
vanish.
  Here the method of Sakane and Koiso is used, and our examples include
non-toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds.
