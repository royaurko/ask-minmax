A static Einstein metric that generalizes the Schwarzschild metric is
considered. The event horizon is not necessarily a sphere and the term $dt\sp2$
is a function on such horizon. That the metric is Einstein establishes a
relation between its terms. One demonstrates that the scalar curvature of the
horizon is constant, and that the term $dt\sp2$ gives rise to (i) the metric of
the horizon being Einstein, or (ii) the scalar curvature of the horizon being
proportional to an eigenvalue of the Laplace operator.
