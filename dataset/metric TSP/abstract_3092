We obtain an explicit solution of the 5d Einstein equations in a dilaton
background model. We demonstrate that for each metric ansatz that only depends
on the extra coordinate, it is possible to uniquely determine the dilaton field
and its potential consistently with the 5d Einstein equation. In this
holographic dual model of QCD, conformal symmetry of the Anti-de-Sitter metric
near the 4d boundary is broken by a term that leads to an area law for the
Wilson loop. We verify that confinement of the string modes dual to mesons
follows from the metric background and the corresponding dilaton solution of
the gravity-dilaton coupled equations. In addition, we show that the meson
Regge trajectories constrain the metric and corresponding dilaton background
within the area law requirement. We can also incorporate asymptotic freedom in
the gravity background within the model.
