We use the functional form of the QCD running coupling to modify the
conformal metric in AdS/CFT mapping the fifth-dimensional z-coordinate to the
energy scale in the four-dimensional QCD. The resulting type-0 string theory in
five dimensions is solved with the Nambu-Goto action giving good agreement with
the Coulombic and confinement $Q \bar Q$ potential.
