We investigate the consequences of generalizing certain well established
properties of the open string metric to the conjectured open membrane and open
Dp-brane metrics. By imposing deformation independence on these metrics their
functional dependence on the background fields can be determined including the
notorious conformal factor. In analogy with the non-commutativity parameter
$\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ in the string case, we also obtain `generalized' theta
parameters which are rank q+1 antisymmetric tensors (polyvectors) for open
Dq-branes and rank 3 for the open membrane case. The expressions we obtain for
the open membrane quantities are expected to be valid for general background
field configurations, while the open D-brane quantities are only valid for one
parameter deformations. By reducing the open membrane data to five dimensions,
we show that they, modulo a subtlety with implications for the relation between
OM-theory and NCYM, correctly generate the open string and open D2-data.
