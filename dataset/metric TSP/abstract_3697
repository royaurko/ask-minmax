We present the metric for a rotating black hole with a cosmological constant
and with arbitrary angular momenta in all higher dimensions. The metric is
given in both Kerr-Schild and Boyer-Lindquist form. In the Euclidean-signature
case, we also obtain smooth compact Einstein spaces on associated S^{D-2}
bundles over S^2, infinitely many for each odd D\ge 5. Applications to string
theory and M-theory are indicated.
