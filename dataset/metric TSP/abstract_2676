In an earlier paper we discussed soldered forms, multivector fields and
Riemannian metrics. In particular, we showed that a Riemannian submanifold is
totally geodesic iff the metric is soldered to the submanifold. In the present
note we discuss general, soldered tensor fields. In particular, we prove that
the almost complex structure of an almost K\"ahler manifold is soldered to a
submanifold iff the latter is an invariant, totally geodesic submanifold.
