We present a study of what may be called an intrinsic metric for a general
regular Dirichlet form. For such forms we then prove a Rademacher type theorem.
For strongly local forms we show existence of a maximal intrinsic metric (under
a weak continuity condition) and for Dirichlet forms with an absolutely
continuous jump kernel we characterize intrinsic metrics by bounds on certain
integrals. We then turn to applications on spectral theory and provide for
(measure perturbation of) general regular Dirichlet forms an
Allegretto-Piepenbrinck type theorem, which is based on a ground state
transform, and a Shnol type theorem. Our setting includes Laplacian on
manifolds, on graphs and $\alpha$-stable processes.
