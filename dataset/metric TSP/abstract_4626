This paper deals with the geometry of supermassive cosmic strings. We have
used an approach that enforces the spacetime of cosmic strings to also satisfy
the conservation laws of a cylindric gravitational topological defect, that is
a spacetime kink. In the simplest case of kink number unity, the entire energy
range of supermassive strings becomes then quantized so that only cylindrical
defects with linear energy density $G\mu=1/4$ (critical string) and $G\mu=1/2$
(extreme string) are allowed to occur in this range. It has been seen that the
internal spherical coordinate $\theta$ of the string metric embedded in an
Euclidean three-space also evolves on imaginary values, leading to the creation
of a covering shell of broken phase that protects the core with trapped energy,
even for $G\mu=1/2$. Then the conical singularity becomes a removable horizaon
singularity. We re-express the extreme string metric in the Finkelstein-
McCollum standard form and remove the geodesic incompleteness by using the
Kruskal technique. The z=const. sections of the resulting metric are the same
as the hemispherical section of the metric of a De Sitter kink. Some physical
consequences from these results, including the possibility that the extreme
string drives inflation and thermal effects in its core, are also discussed.
