The n-th symmetric product of a metric space is the set of its nonempty
subsets with cardinality at most n, equipped with the Hausdorff metric. We
prove that every symmetric product of the line is an absolute Lipschitz retract
and admits a bi-Lipschitz embedding into a Euclidean space of sufficiently high
dimension.
