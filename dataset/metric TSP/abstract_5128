We consider hypersurfaces in Einstein-Sasaki 5-manifolds which are tangent to
the characteristic vector field. We introduce evolution equations that can be
used to reconstruct the 5-dimensional metric from such a hypersurface,
analogous to the (nearly) hypo and half-flat evolution equations in higher
dimensions. We use these equations to classify Einstein-Sasaki 5-manifolds of
cohomogeneity one.
