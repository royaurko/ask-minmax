Rosenbloom and Tsfasman introduced a new metric (RT metric) which is a
generalization of the Hamming metric. In this paper we study the distance
graphs of spaces $Z_q^n$ and $S_n$ with Rosenbloom -Tsfasman metric. We also
describe the degrees of vertices, components and the chromatic number of these
graphs.
