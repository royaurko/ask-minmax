We extend the results of B. Minemyer by showing that any indefinite metric
polyhedron (either compact or not) with the vertex degree bounded from above
admits an isometric simplicial embedding into a Minkowski space of the lowest
possible dimension. We provide a simple algorithm of constructing such
embeddings. We also show that every partial simplicial isometric embedding of
such space in general position extends to a simplicial isometric embedding of
the whole space.
