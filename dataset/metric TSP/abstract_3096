We present conformal structures in signature (3,2) for which the holonomy of
the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric is equal to the non-compact exceptional Lie
group G_{2(2)}. We write down the resulting 8-parameter family of
G_{2(2)}-metrics in dimension seven explicitly in an appropriately chosen
coordinate system on the ambient space.
