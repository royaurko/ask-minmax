In this article the algebra and the basis of corresponding analysis in
4-dimensional spaces are constructed, in pseudoeuclidean with signature (1, -1,
-1, -1) and pseudo-Riemannian corresponding to the real space-time. In both
cases the analogues of Cauchy-Riemann conditions are obtained. They are the
systems of 1-st order partial differential equations, linear for the
pseudoeuclidean and quasi-linear for the pseudo-Riemannian space (linear as
about the components of differentiable function ant its derivatives so about
the derivatives of metric tensor). The general solution for pseudoeuclidean
space which is the flat waves of components of dependent function, and special
(spherical-symmetric) wave-like (as for the components of differentiable
function so for the components of metric tensor) solution for the
pseudo-Riemannian space are got. In the last case the absence of central
singularity for the components of metric tensor is interesting. From the
Cauchy-Riemann condition follows that the differentiable function is constant
along some isotropic curves given by 1-st order differential equations. The
demand these curves to be geodetic lines leads to the differential restrictions
for the metric tensor itself. The special kind of these restrictions is
obtained. The hypothesis that the differentiable function can be interpreted as
an electromagnetic field is expressed.
