On a complex manifold an Hermitian metric which is simultaneously SKT and
balanced has to be necessarily K\"ahler. It has been conjectured that if a
compact complex manifold (M,J) has an SKT metric and a balanced metric both
compatible with J, then (M, J) is necessarily K\"ahler. We show that the
conjecture is true for nilmanifolds.
