The first section of this modest survey reviews some basic notions and
describes some families of examples, and the second section briefly indicates
some general aspects of analysis on metric spaces. The remaining three sections
are concerned with some particular situations involving sub-Riemannian
geometry, hyperbolic groups, and p-adic numbers.
