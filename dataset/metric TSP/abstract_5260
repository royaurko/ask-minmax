A set of vertices $W$ resolves a graph $G$ if every vertex is uniquely
determined by its vector of distances to the vertices in $W$. A metric
dimension of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set of $G$. A
bipartite graph G(n,n) is a graph whose vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into
two subsets $V_1$ and $V_2,$ with $|V_1|=|V_2|=n,$ such that every edge of $G$
joins $V_1$ and $V_2$. The graph $G$ is called $k$-regular if every vertex of
$G$ is adjacent to $k$ other vertices. In this paper, we determine the metric
dimension of $k$-regular bipartite graphs G(n,n) where $k=n-1$ or $k=n-2$.
