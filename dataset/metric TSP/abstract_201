Numerous metrics of heart rate variability (HRV) have been described,
analyzed, and compared in the literature. However, they rarely cover the actual
metrics used in a class of HRV data acquisition devices - those designed
primarily to produce real-time metrics. This paper characterizes a class of
metrics that we term dynamic metrics. We also report the results of a pilot
study which compares one such dynamic metric, based on photoplethysmographic
data using a moving sampling window set to the length of an estimated breath
cycle (EBC), with established HRV metrics. The results show high correlation
coefficients between the dynamic EBC metrics and the established static SDNN
metric (standard deviation of Normal-to-Normal) based on electrocardiography.
These results demonstrate the usefulness of data acquisition devices designed
for real-time metrics.
