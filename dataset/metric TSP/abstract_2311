We study local connectedness, local accessibility and finite connectedness at
the boundary, in relation to the compactness of the Mazurkiewicz completion of
a bounded domain in a metric space. For countably connected planar domains we
obtain a complete characterization. It is also shown exactly which parts of
this characterization fail in higher dimensions and in metric spaces.
