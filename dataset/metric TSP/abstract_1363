The necessity of a theory of General Topology and, most of all, of Algebraic
Topology on locally finite metric spaces comes from many areas of research in
both Applied and Pure Mathematics: Molecular Biology, Mathematical Chemistry,
Computer Science, Topological Graph Theory and Metric Geometry. In this paper
we propose the basic notions of such a theory and some applications: we replace
the classical notions of continuous function, homeomorphism and homotopic
equivalence with the notions of NPP-function, NPP-local-isomorphism and
NPP-homotopy (NPP stands for Nearest Point Preserving); we also introduce the
notion of NPP-isomorphism. We construct three invariants under NPP-isomorphisms
and, in particular, we define the fundamental group of a locally finite metric
space. As first applications, we propose the following: motivated by the
longstanding question whether there is a purely metric condition which extends
the notion of amenability of a group to any metric space, we propose the
property SN (Small Neighborhood); motivated by some applicative problems in
Computer Science, we prove the analog of the Jordan curve theorem in $\mathbb
Z^2$; motivated by a question asked during a lecture at Lausanne, we extend to
any locally finite metric space a recent inequality of P.N.Jolissaint and
Valette regarding the $\ell_p$-distortion.
