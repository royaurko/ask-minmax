We study metric solutions of Einstein-anti-Maxwell theory admitting Killing
spinors. The analogue of the IWP metric which admits a space-like Killing
vector is found and is expressed in terms of a complex function satisfying the
wave equation in flat (2+1)-dimensional space-time. As examples, electric and
magnetic Kasner spaces are constructed by allowing the solution to depend only
on the time coordinate. Euclidean solutions are also presented.
