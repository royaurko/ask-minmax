The curved geometry of a spacetime manifold arises as a solution of
Einstein's gravitational field equation. We show that the metric of a
spherically symmetric gravitational field configuration can be viewed as an
optical metric created by the moving material fluid with nontrivial dielectric
and magnetic properties. Such a "hydrodynamical" approach provides a simple
physical interpretation of a horizon.
