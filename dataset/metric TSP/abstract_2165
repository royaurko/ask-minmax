Consider a metric graph G with set of vertices V. Assume that for every
vertex in V one is given a Wentzell boundary condition. It is shown how one can
construct the paths of a Brownian motion on G such that its generator - viewed
as an operator on the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity - has
a domain consisting of twice continuously differentiable functions satisfying
these boundary conditions.
