There are three main components to this article:
  (i) A formula for the eta invariant of the signature complex for any finite
subgroup of ${\rm{SO}}(4)$ acting freely on $S^3$ is given. An application of
this is a non-existence result for Ricci-flat ALE metrics on certain spaces.
  (ii) A formula for the orbifold correction term that arises in the index of
the self-dual deformation complex is proved for all finite subgroups of
${\rm{SO}}(4)$ which act freely on $S^3$. Some applications of this formula to
the realm of self-dual and scalar-flat K\"ahler metrics are also discussed.
  (iii) Two infinite families of scalar-flat anti-self-dual ALE spaces with
groups at infinity not contained in ${\rm{U}}(2)$ are constructed. Using these
spaces, new examples of self-dual metrics on $n \# \mathbb{CP}^2$ are obtained
for $n \geq 3$.
