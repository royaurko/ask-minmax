We study the implications of a scalar-tensorial gravity for the metric of an
isolated self-gravitating superconducting cosmic string. These modifications
are induced by an arbitrary coupling of a massless scalar field to the usual
tensorial field in the gravitational Lagrangian. We derive the metric in the
weak-field approximation and we analyse the behaviour of light in this
spacetime. We end with some discussions.
