In 1978, Gibbons-Pope and Page proposed a physical picture for the Ricci flat
K\"ahler metrics on the K3 surface based on a gluing construction. In this
construction, one starts from a flat torus with $16$ orbifold points, and
resolves the orbifold singularities by gluing in $16$ Eguchi-Hanson manifolds
which all have the same orientation. This construction was carried out
rigorously by Topiwala, LeBrun-Singer, and Donaldson.
  In 1981, Page asked whether the above construction can be modified by
reversing the orientations of some of the Eguchi-Hanson manifolds. This is a
subtle question: if successful, this construction would produce Einstein
metrics which are neither K\"ahler nor self-dual.
  In this paper, we focus on a configuration involving $8$ Eguchi-Hanson
manifolds of each orientation which are arranged according to a chessboard
pattern. By analyzing the interactions between Eguchi-Hanson manifolds with
opposite orientation, we identify a non-vanishing obstruction to the gluing
problem, thereby destroying any hope of producing a metric of zero Ricci
curvature in this way. Using this obstruction, we are able to understand the
dynamics of such metrics under Ricci flow. In particular, for the configuration
described above, we obtain an ancient solution to the Ricci flow with the
property that the maximum of the Riemann curvature tensor blows up at a rate of
$(-t)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, while the maximum of the Ricci curvature converges to
$0$.
