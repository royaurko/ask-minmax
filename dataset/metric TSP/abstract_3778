Given a compact four dimensional manifold, we prove existence of conformal
metrics with constant $Q$-curvature under generic assumptions. The problem
amounts to solving a fourth-order nonlinear elliptic equation with variational
structure. Since the corresponding Euler functional is in general unbounded
from above and from below, we employ topological methods and minimax schemes,
jointly with a compactness result by the second contributor.
