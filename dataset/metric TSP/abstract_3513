We compute the group element of SO(2,2) associated with the spinning black
hole found by Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli in (2+1)-dimensional anti-de
Sitter space-time. We show that their metric is built with SO(2,2) gauge
invariant quantities and satisfies Einstein's equations with negative
cosmological constant everywhere except at $r=0$. Moreover, although the metric
is singular on the horizons, the group element is continuous and possesses a
kink there.
