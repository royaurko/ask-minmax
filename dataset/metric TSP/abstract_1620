A family of spherically symmetric solutions in the model with m-component
anisotropic fluid is considered. The metric of the solution depends on
parameters q_s, s = 1,...,m, relating radial pressures and the densities and
contains (n -1)m parameters corresponding to Ricci-flat "internal space"
metrics and obeying certain m(m-1)/2 ("orthogonality") relations. For q_s = 1
(for all s) and certian equations of state (p_i^s = \pm \rho^s) the metric
coincides with the metric of intersecting black brane solution in the model
with antisymmetric forms. A family of solutions with (regular) horizon
corresponding to natural numbers q_s = 1,2,... is singled out. Certain examples
of "generalized simulation" of intersecting M-branes in D=11 supergravity are
considered. The post-Newtonian parameters \beta and \gamma corresponding to the
4-dimensional section of the metric are calculated.
