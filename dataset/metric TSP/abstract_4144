We study Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories with a cosmological constant and
U(1)^N gauge symmetry, considering metrics asymptotically approaching the
Lifshiftz metric. We study the dependence of the phase diagram on the value of
the dynamical exponent. Along the way, we apply holographic renormalization and
propose a counterterm valid for arbitrary dimension and dynamical exponent in
our setup.
