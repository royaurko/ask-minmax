Stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in 2D and 3D possibly unbounded domains
driven by a multiplicative Gaussian noise are considered. The noise term
depends on the unknown velocity and its spatial derivatives. The existence of a
martingale solution is proved. The construction of the solution is based on the
classical Faedo-Galerkin approximation, the compactness method and the
Jakubowski version of the Skorokhod Theorem for non-metric spaces. Moreover,
some compactness and tightness criteria in non-metric spaces are proved.
Compactness results are based on a certain generalization of the classical
Dubinsky Theorem.
