We extend to 5D an approach of a 4D non-perturbative formalism to study
scalar metric fluctuations of a 5D Riemann-flat de Sitter background metric. In
contrast with the results obtained in 4D, the spectrum of cosmological scalar
metric fluctuations during inflation can be scale invariant and the background
inflaton field can take sub-Planckian values.
