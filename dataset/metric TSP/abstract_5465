We exhibit novel effects (absent in GR) of sources in massive gravity. First,
we show that removing its ghost mode forces a field-current identity: The
metric's trace is locally proportional to that of its stress tensor; a point
source implies a metric singularity enhanced by the square of the graviton's
range. Second, exterior solutions acquire spatial stress hair--their metric
components depend on the interior T_ij. Also, in contrast to naive
expectations, the Newtonian potential of a source is now determined by both its
spatial stress and mass. Our explicit results are obtained at linear,
Fierz-Pauli, level, but qualitatively persist nonlinearly.
