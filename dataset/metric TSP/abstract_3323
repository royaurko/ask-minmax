The gravitational field of a static body with quadrupole moment is described
by an exact solution found by Erez and Rosen. Here we investigate the role of
the quadrupole in the motion, deflection and lensing of a light ray in the
above metric. The standard lensing observables like image positions and
magnification have been explicitly obtained in the weak field and small
quadrupole limit. In this limit the spacetime metric appears as the natural
generalization to quadrupole corrections of the metric form adopted also in
current astrometric models. Hence, the corresponding analytical solution of the
inverse ray tracing problem as well as the consistency with other approaches
are also discussed.
