We derive the equations of motion of extended deformable bodies in
metric-affine gravity. The conservation laws which follow from the invariance
of the action under the general coordinate transformations are used as a
starting point for the discussion of the dynamics of extended deformable test
bodies. By means of a covariant approach, based on Synge's world function, we
obtain the master equation of motion for an arbitrary system of coupled
conserved currents. This unified framework is then applied to metric-affine
gravity. We confirm and extend earlier findings; in particular, we once again
demonstrate that it is only possible to detect the post-Riemannian spacetime
geometry by ordinary (non-microstructured) test bodies if gravity is
nonminimally coupled to matter.
