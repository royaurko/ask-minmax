We establish upper and lower bounds for the metric entropy and bracketing
entropy of the class of $d$-dimensional bounded monotonic functions under $L^p$
norms. It is interesting to see that both the metric entropy and bracketing
entropy have different behaviors for $p<d/(d-1)$ and $p>d/(d-1)$. We apply the
new bounds for bracketing entropy to establish a global rate of convergence of
the MLE of a $d$-dimensional monotone density.
