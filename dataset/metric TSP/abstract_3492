I show that all FRW models (four dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with
maximally symmetric space) can be embedded in a flat Minkowski manifold with 5
dimensions. The pseudo Riemannian metric of space-time is induced by the flat
metric. This generalizes the usual embedding widely used for the \dS ~models. I
give the coordinate transformations for the embedding. Taking into account the
spatial isotropy, one can reduce space-time to a two-dimensional surface,
embedded in a three-dimensional Minkowski space. This allows to give exact
graphic representations of the FRW models, and in particular of their
curvature.
