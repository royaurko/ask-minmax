A metric representing the Kerr geometry has been obtained by Pretorius and
Israel. We make a coordinate transformation on this metric, thereby bringing it
into Bondi-Sachs form. In order to validate the metric, we evaluate it
numerically on a regular grid of the new coordinates. The Ricci tensor is then
computed, for different discretizations, and found to be convergent to zero. We
also investigate the behaviour of the metric near the axis of symmetry and
confirm regularity. Finally we investigate a Bondi-Sachs representation of the
Kerr geometry reported by Fletcher and Lun; we confirm numerically that their
metric is Ricci flat, but find that it has an irregular behaviour at the pole.
