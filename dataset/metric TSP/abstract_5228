In this article, we define the transport dimension of probability measures on
$\mathbb{R}^m$ using ramified optimal transportation theory. We show that the
transport dimension of a probability measure is bounded above by the Minkowski
dimension and below by the Hausdorff dimension of the measure. Moreover, we
introduce a metric, called "the dimensional distance", on the space of
probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^m$. This metric gives a geometric meaning
to the transport dimension: with respect to this metric, we show that the
transport dimension of a probability measure equals to the distance from it to
any finite atomic probability measure.
