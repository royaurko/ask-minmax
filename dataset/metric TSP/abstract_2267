In this expository note, we present a transparent proof of Toponogov's
theorem for Alexandrov spaces in the general case, not assuming local
compactness of the underlying metric space. More precisely, we show that if M
is a complete geodesic metric space such that the Alexandrov triangle
comparisons for curvature greater than or equal to k are satisfied locally,
then these comparisons also hold in the large. The proof is a modification of
an argument due to Plaut.
