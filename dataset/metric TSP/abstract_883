We compare three notions of genericity of separable metric structures. Our
analysis provides a general model theoretic technique of showing that
structures are generic in descriptive set theoretic (topological) sense and in
measure theoretic sense.
  In particular, it gives a new perspective on Vershik's theorems on genericity
and randomness of Urysohn's space among separable metric spaces.
