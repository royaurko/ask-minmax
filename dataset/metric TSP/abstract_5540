Metrics are used mainly to predict software engineering efforts such as
maintenance effort, error Prone ness, and error rate. This document emphasis on
experimental study based on two open source systems namely MARF and GIPSY. With
the help of various research papers we were able to analyze and give priorities
to various metrics that are implemented with JDeodrant. LOGISCOPE and McCabe
tools are used to identify problematic classes with help of Kiviat graph and
average Cyclomatic Complexity that further are implemented with highest
priority metric with JDeodrant. To obtain accurate results we collected data
using different tools. The analysis of the two systems is done as a conclusion
of study using different tools.
