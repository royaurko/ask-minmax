We present a solution for rotating black holes in massive gravity. We first
give a solution of massive gravity with one dynamical metric. Both metrics of
this solution are expressed in the advanced Eddington-Finkelstein-like
coordinates: the physical metric has the original Kerr line element, while the
fiducial metric is flat, but written in a rotating Eddington-Finkelstein form.
For the bi-gravity theory we give an analogue of this solution: the two metrics
have the original Kerr form, but, in general, different black hole masses. The
generalisation of the solution to include the electric charge is also given, it
is an analogue of the Kerr-Newman solution in General Relativity. We also
discuss further possible ways to generalise the solutions.
