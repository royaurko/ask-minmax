In this paper we propose two behavioral distances that support approximate
reasoning on Stochastic Markov Models (SMMs), that are continuous-time
stochastic transition systems where the residence time on each state is
described by a generic probability measure on the positive real line. In
particular, we study the problem of measuring the behavioral dissimilarity of
two SMMs against linear real-time specifications expressed as Metric Temporal
Logic (MTL) formulas or Deterministic Timed-Automata (DTA). The most natural
choice for such a distance is the one that measures the maximal difference that
can be observed comparing two SMMs with respect to their probability of
satisfying an arbitrary specification. We show that computing this metric is
NP-hard. In addition, we show that any algorithm that approximates the distance
within a certain absolute error, depending on the size of the SMMs, is NP-hard.
Nevertheless, we introduce an alternative distance, based on the Kantorovich
metric, that is an over-approximation of the former and we show that, under
mild assumptions on the residence time distributions, it can be computed in
polynomial time.
