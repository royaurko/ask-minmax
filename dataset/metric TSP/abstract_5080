We investigate an action that includes simultaneously original and dual
gravitational fields (in the first order formalism), where the dual fields are
completely determined in terms of the original fields through axial gauge
conditions and partial (non-covariant) duality constraints. We introduce two
kinds of matter, one that couples to the original metric, and dual matter that
couples to the dual metric. The linear response of both metrics to the
corresponding stress energy tensors coincides with Einstein's equations. In the
presence of nonvanishing standard and dual cosmological constants a stable
solution with a time independent dual scale factor exists that could possibly
solve the cosmological constant problem, provided our world is identified with
the dual sector of the model.
