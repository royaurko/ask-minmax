We consider compact complex surfaces with Hermitian metrics which are
Einstein but not Kaehler. It is shown that the manifold must be CP2 blown up at
1,2, or 3 points, and the isometry group of the metric must contain a 2-torus.
Thus the Page metric on CP2#(-CP2) is almost the only metric of this type.
