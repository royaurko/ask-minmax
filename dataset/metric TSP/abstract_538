We compute the asymptotic metrics for moduli spaces of SU(N) monopoles with
maximal symmetry breaking. These metrics are exponentially close to the exact
monopole metric as soon as, for each simple root, the individual monopoles
corresponding to that root are well separated. We also show that the estimates
can be differentiated term by term in natural coordinates, which is a new
result even for SU(2) monopoles.
