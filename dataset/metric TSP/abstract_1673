A Fuchsian polyhedron in hyperbolic space is a polyhedral surface invariant
under the action of a Fuchsian group of isometries (i.e. a group of isometries
leaving globally invariant a totally geodesic surface, on which it acts
cocompactly). The induced metric on a convex Fuchsian polyhedron is isometric
to a hyperbolic metric with conical singularities of positive singular
curvature on a compact surface of genus greater than one. We prove that these
metrics are actually realised by exactly one convex Fuchsian polyhedron (up to
global isometries). This extends a famous theorem of A.D. Alexandrov.
