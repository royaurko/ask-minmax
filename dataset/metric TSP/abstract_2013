We propose an algebraic geometric stability criterion for a polarised variety
to admit an extremal Kaehler metric. This generalises conjectures by Yau, Tian
and Donaldson which relate to the case of Kaehler-Einstein and constant scalar
curvature metrics. We give a result in geometric invariant theory that
motivates this conjecture, and an example computation that supports it.
