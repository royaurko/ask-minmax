Let $D$ be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbf C^n$, $n > 1$.
Using the Robin function $\Lambda(p)$ that arises from the Green function $G(z,
p)$ for $D$ with pole at $p \in D$ associated with the standard sum-of-squares
Laplacian, N. Levenberg and H. Yamaguchi had constructed a K\"{a}hler metric
(the so-called $\Lambda$-metric) on $D$. In this article, we study the
existence of geodesic spirals for this metric.
