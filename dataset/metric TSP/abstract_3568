We extend Dirac's approach about the quantization of the electric charge to
the case of gravitational configurations. The spacetime curvature is used to
define a phase-like object which allows us to extract information about the
behavior of the corresponding spacetime. We show that all spacetimes that
satisfy certain simple symmetry condition and for which the Petrov type is the
same whitin a specific region, quantization conditions can be derived that
impose constraints on the possible values of the parameters entering the
respective metrics. As a general result we obtain that for the gravitational
configurations described by those metrics, the behavior under rotations can be
only of bosonic or fermionic nature.
