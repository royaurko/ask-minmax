We prove that if $(X,\mathfrak{d},\mathfrak{m})$ is a metric measure space
with $\mathfrak{m}(X)=1$ having (in a synthetic sense) Ricci curvature bounded
from below by $K>0$ and dimension bounded above by $N\in [1,\infty)$, then the
classic L\'evy-Gromov isoperimetric inequality (together with the recent
sharpening counterparts proved in the smooth setting by E. Milman for any $K\in
\mathbb{R}$, $N\geq 1$ and upper diameter bounds) hold, i.e. the isoperimetric
profile function of $(X,\mathfrak{d},\mathfrak{m})$ is bounded from below by
the isoperimetric profile of the model space. Moreover, if equality is attained
for some volume $v \in (0,1)$ and $K$ is strictly positive, then the space must
be a spherical suspension and in this case we completely classify the
isoperimetric regions. To our knowledge this is the first result about
isoperimetric comparison for non smooth metric measure spaces satisfying Ricci
curvature lower bounds. Examples of spaces fitting our assumptions include
measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Riemannian manifolds satisfying Ricci
curvature lower bounds and Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded from below;
the result seems new even in these celebrated classes of spaces.
