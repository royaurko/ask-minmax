We study the collapsing behaviour of Ricci-flat Kahler metrics on a
projective Calabi-Yau manifold which admits an abelian fibration, when the
volume of the fibers approaches zero. We show that away from the critical locus
of the fibration the metrics collapse with locally bounded curvature, and along
the fibers the rescaled metrics become flat in the limit. The limit metric on
the base minus the critical locus is locally isometric to an open dense subset
of any Gromov-Hausdorff limit space of the Ricci-flat metrics. We then apply
these results to study metric degenerations of families of polarized
hyperkahler manifolds in the large complex structure limit. In this setting we
prove an analog of a result of Gross-Wilson for K3 surfaces, which is motivated
by the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow picture of mirror symmetry.
