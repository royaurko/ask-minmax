Let (M,g) be a compact n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary. This
article is concerned with the set of scalar-flat metrics on M which are in the
conformal class of g and have the boundary as a constant mean curvature
hypersurface. We construct examples of metrics on the unit ball, in dimensions
n>=25, for which this set is noncompact. These manifolds have umbilic boundary,
but they are not conformally equivalent to the unit ball.
