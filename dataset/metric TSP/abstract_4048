We study the inverse resonance problem for conformally compact manifolds
which are hyperbolic outside a compact set. Our results include compactness of
isoresonant metrics in dimension two and of isophasal negatively curved metrics
in dimension three. In dimensions four or higher we prove topological
finiteness theorems under the negative curvature assumption.
