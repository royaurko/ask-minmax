The present work deals with the search of useful physical applications of
some generalized groups of metric transformations. We put forward different
proposals and focus our attention on the implementation of one of them.
Particularly, the results show how one can control very efficiently the kind of
spacetimes related by a Generalized Kerr-Schild (GKS) Ansatz through
Kerr-Schild groups. Finally a preliminar study regarding other generalized
groups of metric transformations is undertaken which is aimed at giving some
hints in new Ans\"atze to finding useful solutions to Einstein's equations.
