Metric perturbations the stability of solution of Einstein-Cartan cosmology
(ECC) are given. The first addresses the stability of solutions of
Einstein-Cartan (EC) cosmological model against Einstein static universe
background. In this solution we show that the metric is stable against
first-order perturbations and correspond to acoustic oscillations. The second
example deals with the stability of de Sitter metric also against first-order
perturbations. Torsion and shear are also computed in these cases. The
resultant perturbed anisotropic spacetime with torsion is only de Sitter along
one direction or is unperturbed along one direction and perturbed against the
other two. Cartan torsion contributes to the frequency of oscillations in the
model. Therefore gravitational waves could be triggered by the spin-torsion
scalar density .
