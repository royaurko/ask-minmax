We study the out of equilibrium dynamics of inflationary phase transitions
and compute the resulting spectrum of metric perturbations relevant to
observation. We show that simple single field models of inflation may produce
an adiabatic perturbation spectrum with a blue spectral tilt and that the
precise spectrum depends on initial conditions at the outset of inflation.
