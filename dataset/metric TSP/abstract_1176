For an ordered set $W=\{w_1,w_2,...,w_k\}$ of vertices and a vertex $v$ in a
connected graph $G$, the ordered $k$-vector
$r(v|W):=(d(v,w_1),d(v,w_2),...,d(v,w_k))$ is called the (metric)
representation of $v$ with respect to $W$, where $d(x,y)$ is the distance
between the vertices $x$ and $y$. The set $W$ is called a resolving set for $G$
if distinct vertices of $G$ have distinct representations with respect to $W$.
The minimum cardinality of a resolving set for $G$ is its metric dimension. In
this paper, we characterize all graphs of order $n$ with metric dimension
$n-3$.
