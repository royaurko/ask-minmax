We develop the metric theory of Diophantine approximation on homogeneous
varieties of semisimple algebraic groups and prove results analogous to the
classical Khinchin and Jarnik theorems. In full generality our results
establish simultaneous Diophantine approximation with respect to several
completions, and Diophantine approximation over general number fields using
S-algebraic integers. In several important examples, the metric results we
obtain are optimal. The proof uses quantitative equidistribution properties of
suitable averaging operators, which are derived from spectral bounds in
automorphic representations.
