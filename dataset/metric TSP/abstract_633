We introduce the tractor formalism from conformal geometry to the study of
smooth metric measure spaces. In particular, this gives rise to a
correspondence between quasi-Einstein metrics and parallel sections of certain
tractor bundles. We use this formulation to give a sharp upper bound on the
dimension of the vector space of quasi-Einstein metrics, providing a different
perspective on some recent results of He, Petersen and Wylie.
