For stationary cylindrically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell
equation we have shown that the "charged" solutions of McCrea, Chitre et
al.(CGN), Van den Bergh and Wils (VW) can be obtained from the seed metrics
using generating conjecture. The McCrea "charged" solution has as a seed vacuum
metric the Van Stockum solution with a Killing vector (0,0,1,0). The CGN
"charged" solution and the VW "charged" solution have the static seed metrics
connected by the complex substitution (t --> iz), (z --> it) and the Killing
vector which is a simple linear combination of ${\partial}_{\phi}$ and
${\partial}_{t}$ Killing vectors (VW), respectively ${\partial}_{\phi}$ and
${\partial}_{z}$ Killing vectors (CGN).
