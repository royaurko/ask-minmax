We study the Kaehler metric given by the logarithm of a cubic form on its
complexified index cone. Under mirror symmetry, this metric should
asymptotically correspond to the Weil-Petersson metric. Using the theory of
special Kaehler manifolds, a proof of a curvature formula for this metric is
given.
