The cosmic, general analitic solutions of the Brans--Dicke Theory for the flat
space of homogeneous and isotropic models containing perfect, barotropic,
fluids are seen to belong to a wider class of solutions --which includes
cosmological models with the open and the closed spaces of the
Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric, as well as solutions for models with
homogeneous but anisotropic spaces corresponding to the Bianchi--Type metric
clasification-- when all these solutions are expressed in terms of reduced
variables. The existence of such a class lies in the fact that the scalar
field, $\phi$, times a function of the mean scale factor or ``volume element'',
$a^3 = a_1 a_2 a_3$, which depends on time and on the barotropic index of the
equation of state used, can be written as a function of a ``cosmic time''
reduced in terms of another function of the mean scale factor depending itself
again on the barotropic index but independent of the metrics here employed.
This reduction procedure permites one to analyze if explicitly given
anisotropic cosmological solutions ``isotropize'' in the course of their time
evolution. For if so can happen, it could be claimed that there exists a
subclass of solutions that is stable under anisotropic perturbations.
