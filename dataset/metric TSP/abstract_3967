We compare the homology groups $H_n ^{IC}(X)$ of the chain complex of
integral currents with compact support of a metric space $X$ with the singular
Lipschitz homology $H^L_n (X)$ and with ordinary singular homology. If $X$
satisfies certain cone inequalities all these homology theories coincide. On
the other hand, for the Hawaiian Earring the homology of integral currents
differs from the singular Lipschitz homology and it differs also from the
classical singular homology $H_n(X)$.
