In this note, we prove that there is a canonical continuous Hermitian metric
on the CM line bundle over the proper moduli space $\bar{\mathcal{M}}$ of
smoothable Kahler-Einstein Fano varieties. The curvature of this metric is the
Weil-Petersson current, which exists as a positive (1,1)-current on
$\bar{\mathcal{M}}$ and extends the canonical Weil-Petersson current on the
moduli space parametrizing smooth Kahler-Einstein Fano manifolds $\mathcal{M}$.
As a consequence, we show that the CM line bundle is nef and big on
$\bar{\mathcal{M}}$ and its restriction on $\mathcal{M}$ is ample.
