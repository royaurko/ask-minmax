This paper is a sequel to \cite{Choi} in Math. Ann. In that paper we studied
the subharmonicity of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on strongly pseudoconvex
domains of dimension greater than or equal to $3$. In this paper, we study the
variations K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains
of dimension $2$. In addition, we discuss the previous result with general
bounded pseudoconvex domain and local triviality of a family of bounded
strongly pseudoconvex domains.
