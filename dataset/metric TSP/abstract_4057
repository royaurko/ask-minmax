We consider perturbations of Dirac type operators on complete, connected
metric spaces equipped with a doubling measure. Under a suitable set of
assumptions, we prove quadratic estimates for such operators and hence deduce
that these operators have a bounded functional calculus. In particular, we
deduce a Kato square root type estimate.
