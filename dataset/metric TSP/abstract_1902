A new method is presented for obtaining the general conformally flat
radiation metric by using the differential operators of Machado Ramos and
Vickers (a generalisation of the GHP operators) which are invariant under null
rotations and spin and boosts. The solution is found by constructing involutive
tables of these derivatives applied to the quantities which arise in the
Karlhede classification of metrics.
