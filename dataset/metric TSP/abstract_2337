We introduce the concept of effective dimension for a general metric space.
Effective dimension was defined by Lutz in (Lutz 2003) for Cantor space and has
also been extended to Euclidean space. Our extension to other metric spaces is
based on a supergale characterization of Hausdorff dimension. We present here
the concept of constructive dimension and its characterization in terms of
Kolmogorov complexity. Further research directions are indicated.
