We prove the existence of Sasakian-Einstein metrics on infinitely many
rational homology spheres in all odd dimensions greater than 3. In dimension 5
we obain somewhat sharper results. There are examples where the number of
effective parameters in the Einstein metric grows exponentially with dimension.
