The notion that the metric field in general relativity can be understood as a
property of space-time rests on a feature of the theory sometimes called
universal coupling -- the claim that rods and clocks "measure" the metric in a
way that is independent of their constitution. It is pointed out that this
feature is not strictly a consequence of the central dynamical tenets of the
theory, and argued that the metric field would better be regarded as a
(possibly emergent) field in space-time, rather than as the very fabric of
space-time itself.
