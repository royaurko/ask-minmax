Within the scope of Bianchi type-I cosmological model we study the role of
spinor field in the evolution of the Universe. It is found that due to the
spinor affine connections the energy momentum tensor of the spinor becomes
non-diagonal, whereas the Einstein tensor is diagonal. This non-triviality of
non-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor imposes some severe
restrictions either on the spinor field or on the metric functions or on both
of them. In case if the restrictions are imposed on the components of spinor
field only, we come to a situation when spinor field becomes massless and
invariants constructed from bilinear spinor forms also become trivial. Imposing
restriction wholly on metric functions we obtain FRW model, while if the
restrictions are imposed both on metric functions and spinor field components,
we come to LRS BI model. In both cases the system is solved completely. It was
found that if the relation between the pressure and energy density obeys a
barotropic equation of state, only a non-trivial spinor mass can give rise to a
dynamic EoS parameter.
