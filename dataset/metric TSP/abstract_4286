The aim of this paper is to present some structural equations for generalized
quasi-Einstein metrics which was defined recently by Catino in [12]. In
addition, supposing that the Riemannian manifold is Einstein we shall show that
it is a space form with a well defined potential function f. Finally, we shall
derive some integral formulae for such a class of compact manifolds which
permit to obtain some rigidity results.
