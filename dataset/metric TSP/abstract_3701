We study the gravitational field of a spinning radiation beam-pulse (a
gyraton) in a D-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime. It is shown that the
Einstein equations for such a system reduce to a set of two linear equations in
a (D-2)-dimensional space. By solving these equations we obtain a metric which
is an exact solution of gravitational equations with the (negative)
cosmological constant. The explicit metrics for 4D and 5D gyratons in
asymptotically AdS spacetime are given and their properties are discussed.
