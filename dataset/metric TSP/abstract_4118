This work is constructed on two main concepts: Killing-Yano symmetry and the
Kaluza-Klein theory. Those concepts are reviewed in the first three chapters.
In the fourth chapter firstly Killing-Yano equations of valence-2 are obtained
for a general 5-dimensional metric and then reduced for the Minkowski metric.
It is seen that in order to save the existence of Killing-Yano tensors with the
fifth components some conditions must be satisfied
