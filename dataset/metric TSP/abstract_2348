Smooth Kahler-Einstein metrics have been studied for the past 80 years. More
recently, singular Kahler-Einstein metrics have emerged as objects of intrinsic
interest, both in differential and algebraic geometry, as well as a powerful
tool in better understanding their smooth counterparts. This article is mostly
a survey of some of these developments.
