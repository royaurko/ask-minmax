This work proposes a quantitative metric to analyze potential reusability of
a BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) Process. The approach is based on
Description and Logic Mismatch Probability of a BPEL Process that will be
reused within potential contexts. The mismatch probabilities have been
consolidated to a metric formula for quantifying the probability of potential
reuse of BPEL processes. An initial empirical evaluation suggests that the
proposed metric properly predict potential reusability of BPEL processes.
According to the experiment, there exists a significant statistical correlation
between results of the metric and the experts judgements. This indicates a
predictive dependency between the proposed metric and potential reusability of
BPEL processes as a measuring stick for this phenomena. If future studies
ascertain these findings by replicating this experiment, the practical
implications of such a metric are early detection of the design flaws and
aiding architects to judge various design alternatives.
