For the wave equation associated to the Laplacian on a compact manifold with
boundary with a conic metric (with respect to which the boundary is metrically
a point) the propagation of singularities through the boundary is analyzed.
Under appropriate regularity assumptions the diffracted, non-direct, wave
produced by the boundary is shown to have Sobolev regularity greater than the
incoming wave.
