We fully describe the horofunction boundary $\partial_h L_2$ with the word
metric associated with the generating set $\{t, at\}$ (i.e the metric arising
in the Diestel-Leader graph $\text{DL}_2(2)$). The visual boundary of $L_2$
with this metric is a subset of $\partial_h L_2$. The height function on
$\text{DL}_2(2)$ provides a natural stratification of $\partial_h L_2$.
Further, the height function and its negation are themselves non-Busemann
functions in $\partial_h L_2$ and are global fixed points of the action of
$L_2$.
