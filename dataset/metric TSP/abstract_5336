On complete metric spaces that support doubling measures, we show that the
validity of a Rademacher theorem for Lipschitz functions can be characterised
by Keith's "Lip-lip" condition. Roughly speaking, this means that at almost
every point, the infinitesmal behavior of every Lipschitz function is
essentially independent of the scales used in the blow-up at that point.
Moreover, the doubling property can be further weakened to a local hypothesis
on the measure; we also present results in this direction.
  Our techniques of proof are new and may be of independent interest. They
include an explicit use of coordinate charts for measurable differentiable
structures, as well as a blow-up procedure on Euclidean spaces that preserves
Weaver derivations.
