The evolution of a soliton star filled with fermions is studied in the
framework of general relativity. Such a system can be described by the surface
tension $\sigma$, the bag constant $B$, and the fermion number density
$\rho_{0}$. Usually one of these parameters prevails in the system and thus
affects the spacetime inside the soliton. Whether it is described by Friedman
or de Sitter metric depends on the prevailing parameter. The whole spacetime is
devided by the surface of the soliton into the false vacuum region inside the
soliton and the true vacuum region outside, the latter being described by the
Schwarzschild line element. The aim of this paper is to study the equations of
motion of the domain wall in two cases. In the first case the de Sitter metric
describes the interior in the first case, and in the second case it is replaced
by the Friedman metric. In both of them the Schwarzschild metric is outside the
soliton. From the analysis of obtained equations one can draw conclusions
concerning further evolution of a soliton star.
