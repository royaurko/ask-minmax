In this work we study static perfect fluid stars in 2+1 dimensions with an
exterior BTZ spacetime. We found the general expression for the metric
coefficients as a function of the density and pressure of the fluid. We found
the conditions to have regularity at the origin throughout the analysis of a
set of linearly independent invariants. We also obtain an exact solution of the
Einstein equations, with the corresponding equation of state $p=p(\rho)$, which
is regular at the origin.
