We define thin and asymptotically scattered metric spaces as asymptotic
counterparts of discrete and scattered metric spaces respectively. We
characterize asymptotically scattered spaces in terms of prohibited subspaces,
and classify thin metric spaces up to coarse equivalence. We introduce the
types of asymptotically scattered spaces and construct the spaces of distinct
types. We transfer the notion of asymptotically scattered spaces to $G$-spaces
and characterize asymptotically scattered spaces of groups.
