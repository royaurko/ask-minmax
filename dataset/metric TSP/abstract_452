The possibility of spherically symmetric solutions in bi-metric theory of
gravity is examined. It is shown that two possible black hole type solutions
exists in the model. Spherically symmetric solution of general theory of
relativity is recovered in the absence of the second metric. The result is
compared with other bi-metric models as well as general theory of relativity.
