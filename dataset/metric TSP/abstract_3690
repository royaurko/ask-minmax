We obtain the energy distribution in the Kerr-Newman metric with the help of
Bergmann-Thomson energy-momentum complex. We find that the energy-momentum
definitions prescribed by Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Papapetrou, Weinberg, and
Bergmann-Thomson give the same and acceptable result and also support the {\em
Cooperstock Hypothesis} for energy localization in general relativity. The
repulsive effect due to the electric charge and rotation parameters of the
metric is also reflected from the energy distribution expression.
