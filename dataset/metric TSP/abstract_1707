Shibata, Ury\=u and Friedman recently suggested a new decomposition of
Einstein's equations that is useful for constructing initial data. In contrast
to previous decompositions, the conformal metric is no longer treated as a
freely-specifiable variable, but rather is determined as a solution to the
field equations. The new set of freely-specifiable variables includes only
time-derivatives of metric quantities, which makes this decomposition very
attractive for the construction of quasiequilibrium solutions. To date, this
new formalism has only been used for binary neutron stars. Applications
involving black holes require new boundary conditions for the conformal metric
on the domain boundaries. In this paper we demonstrate how these boundary
conditions follow naturally from the conformal geometry of the boundary
surfaces and the inherent gauge freedom of the conformal metric.
