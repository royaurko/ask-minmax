For a compact connected set $X\subseteq \ell^{\infty}$, we define a quantity
$\beta'(x,r)$ that measures how close $X$ may be approximated in a ball
$B(x,r)$ by a geodesic curve. We then show there is $c>0$ so that if
$\beta'(x,r)>\beta>0$ for all $x\in X$ and $r<r_{0}$, then $\dim
X>1+c\beta^{2}$. This generalizes a theorem of Bishop and Jones and answers a
question posed by Bishop and Tyson.
