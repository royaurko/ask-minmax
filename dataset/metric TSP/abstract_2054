It is supposed the alternative to Quantum Mechanics Axiomatic. Fluctuational
Theory save the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanic without change, naming this
Mathematics as Method of Indirect Computation.
  Fluctuational Theory is delete the axiomatic of Quantum Mechanics and
replaces it by the assumption of Gravitational Noise. This assumption is
connects the Method of Indirect Computation to the Classical Physics.
  Physical fluctuations of classical gravitational fields are mathematically
expressed through geometric fluctuations of metrics of Riemann Space.
  Metrics Fluctuational Theory and Quantum Mechanic is describe the classical
experiment of electrons interference by two different way.
