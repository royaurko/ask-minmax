An isotropic metric for a black hole and a better vacuum condition \nabla^2
V_G =0 are presented which yield distinct terms for the energy densities of
ordinary matter and gravitational fields in the Einstein tensor (G^44 =-g^2
(2\nabla^2 V_G +(\nabla V_G)^2)) This model resolves an inconsistency between
electromagnetism and gravity in the calculation of field energy. Resolution of
this inconsistency suggests a slight modification of the Einstein equation to
gG^\mu\nu = 8\pi G T^\mu\nu.
