The cut pseudo-metric on the space of graph limits induces an equivalence
relation. The quotient space obtained by collapsing each equivalence class to a
point is a metric space with appealing analytic properties. We show that the
equivalence relation admits a Borel lifting: There exists a Borel-measurable
mapping which maps each equivalence class to one of its elements.
