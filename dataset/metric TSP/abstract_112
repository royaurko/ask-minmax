In this paper, a characteristic condition of Einstein Kropina metrics is
given. By the characteristic condition, we prove that a non-Riemannian Kropina
metric $F=\frac{\alpha^2}{\beta}$ with constant Killing form $\beta$ on an
n-dimensional manifold $M$, $n\geq 2$, is an Einstein metric if and only if
$\alpha$ is also an Einstein metric. By using the navigation data $(h,W)$, it
is proved that an n-dimensional ($n\geq2$) Kropina metric
$F=\frac{\alpha^2}{\beta}$ is Einstein if and only if the Riemannian metric $h$
is Einstein and $W$ is a unit Killing vector field with respect to $h$.
Moreover, we show that every Einstein Kropina metric must have vanishing
S-curvature, and any conformal map between Einstein Kropina metrics must be
homothetic.
