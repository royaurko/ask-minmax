Cyclic metric Lie groups are Lie groups equipped with a left-invariant metric
which is in some way far from being biinvariant, in a sense made explicit in
terms of Tricerri and Vanhecke's homogeneous structures. The semisimple and
solvable cases are studied. We extend to the general case, Kowalski-Tricerri's
and Bieszk's classifications of connected and simply-connected unimodular
cyclic metric Lie groups for dimensions less than or equal to five.
