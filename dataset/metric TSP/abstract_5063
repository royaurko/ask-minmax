In this paper, we introduce the concept of N-dimensional generalized
Minkowski space, i.e. a space endowed with a (in general non-diagonal) metric
tensor, whose coefficients do depend on a set of non-metrical coodinates. This
is the first of a series of papers devoted to the investigation of the Killing
symmetries of generalized Minkowski spaces. In particular, we discuss here the
infinitesimal-algebraic structure of the space-time rotations in such spaces.
It is shown that the maximal Killing group of these spaces is the direct
product of a generalized Lorentz group and a generalized translation group. We
derive the explicit form of the generators of the generalized Lorentz group in
the self-representation and their related, generalized Lorentz algebra. The
results obtained are specialized to the case of a 4-dimensional, ''deformed''
Minkowski space $% \widetilde{M_{4}}$, i.e. a pseudoeuclidean space with metric
coefficients depending on energy.
