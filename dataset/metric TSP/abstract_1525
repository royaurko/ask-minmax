The article deals with intrinsic metrics, Dirac operators and spectral
triples induced by regular Dirichlet and resistance forms. We show, in
particular, that if a local resistance form is given and the space is compact
in resistance metric, then the intrinsic metric yields a geodesic space. Given
a regular Dirichlet form, we consider Dirac operators within the framework of
differential 1-forms proposed by Cipriani and Sauvageot, and comment on its
spectral properties. If the Dirichlet form admits a carr\'e operator and the
generator has discrete spectrum, then we can construct a related spectral
triple, and in the compact and strongly local case the associated Connes
distance coincides with the intrinsic metric. We finally give a description of
the intrinsic metric in terms of vector fields.
