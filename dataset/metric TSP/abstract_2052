A linear real 4-dimensional space structured by Lorentz metric implies six
2-dimensional singular subspaces and three independent 1-dimensional subspaces
called radicals. If we consider meaningful to use them as representing six
quarks and three gluons, respectively, then antiquarcs and antigluons are
implicitly defined. Since Lorentz metric is not singular, the dual metric space
of X denoted in general by X* is well defined and follow the structure of X.
The peculiar properties of singular subspaces guaranty what we call
confinement. For precision, we define first what means free system using the
structure of X and X*and thereby how X are lodging six quarks and three gluons.
