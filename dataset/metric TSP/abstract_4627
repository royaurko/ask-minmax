I show that all inertial systems are not equivalent, and the Lorentz
transformation is not the space-time transformation over two inertial systems
moving with relative constant velocity. To do this, I consider imaginary
signals travelling over any inertial system K with arbitrarily large
velocities. The travelling of an imaginary signal over K is just a time lapse
over K. Then I present an example to show that all coordinate systems are not
equivalent when the related theory is restricted over tensor-based coordinate
transformations, i.e., the genereal relativity principle is not valid. Instead
of the relativity principle, I propose the twofold metric principle which may
be roughly stated to assert that the set of equations H(v) describing the
motion of a material body with velocity v> 0 can be obtained from the
corresponding set of equations H(0) for velocity v=0 by replacing, in each
differential equation in H(0), each infinitesimal time variable dt with dt /
\beta(v) , each maximal velocity-critical infinitesimal length variable dr with
beta(v) dr, and each zero velocity-critical infinitesimal length variable dx
with dx, where beta(v) = 1/ sqrt {1- v^2/c^2}. By depending on the twofold
metric principle and the energy-velocity equation, I derive beta(v)mc^2, the
twofold Schwarzshild metric, the centennial procession of planatery orbits and
deflection of light. We also present a reason why the Michelson-Morley
experiment is observed. Several other topics are also studied.
