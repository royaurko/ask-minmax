We consider a special class of Finsler metrics --- square metrics which are
defined by a Riemannian metric and a 1-form on a manifold. We show that an
analogue of the Beltrami Theorem in Riemannian geometry is still true for
square metrics in dimension $n\ge 3$, namely, an $n(\ge 3)$-dimensional square
metric is locally projectively flat if and only if it is of scalar flag
curvature. Further, we determine the local structure of such metrics and
classify closed manifolds with a square metric of scalar flag curvature in
dimension $n\ge 3$.
