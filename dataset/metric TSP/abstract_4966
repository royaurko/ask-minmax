Deviation equation of Synge and Schild has been investigated over spaces with
affine connections and metrics. It is shown that the condition for the
vanishing of the Lie derivative of a vector field along a given non-null
(non-isotropic) vector field u for obtaining this equation is only a sufficient
(but not necessary) condition. By means of the vector field u and the
projective metric (orthogonal to it) projected deviation equations of Synge and
Schild have been obtained for a vector field, orthogonal to the given vector
field u, as well as for the square of its length. For a given non-isotropic,
auto-parallel and normalized vector field u this equation could have some
simple solutions.
