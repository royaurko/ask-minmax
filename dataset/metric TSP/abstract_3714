Let $X$ be a complex toric Fano $n$-fold and ${\cal N}(T)$ the normalizer of
a maximal torus $T$ in the group of biholomorphic authomorphisms $Aut(X)$. We
call $X$ {\em symmetric} if the trivial character is a single ${\cal
N}(T)$-invariant algebraic character of $T$. Using an invariant $\alpha_G(X)$
introduced by Tian, we show that all symmetric toric Fano $n$-folds admit an
Einstein-K\"ahler metric. We remark that so far one doesn't know any example of
a toric Fano $n$-fold $X$ such that $Aut(X)$ is reductive, the Futaki character
of $X$ vanishes, but $X$ is not symmetric.
