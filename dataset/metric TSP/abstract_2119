This note demonstrates how both the concept of distance and the concept of
holonomy can be constructed from a suitable network with directed edges (and no
lengths). The number of different edge types depends on the signature of the
metric and the dimension of the holonomy group. If the holonomy group is of
dimension one and the metric is positive-definite, a single type of directed
edges is needed.
