Distributed consensus in the Wasserstein metric space of probability measures
is introduced in this work. Convergence of each agent's measure to a common
measure value is proven under a weak network connectivity condition. The common
measure reached at each agent is one minimizing a weighted sum of its
Wasserstein distance to all initial agent measures. This measure is known as
the Wasserstein barycentre. Special cases involving Gaussian measures,
empirical measures, and time-invariant network topologies are considered, where
convergence rates and average-consensus results are given. This algorithm has
potential applicability in computer vision, machine learning and distributed
estimation, etc.
