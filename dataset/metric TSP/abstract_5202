The full metric describing two counter-rotating identical Kerr black holes
separated by a massless strut is derived in the explicit analytical form. It
contains three arbitrary parameters which are the Komar mass M, Komar angular
momentum per unit mass a of one of the black holes (the other has the same mass
and equal but opposite angular momentum) and the coordinate distance R between
the centers of the horizons. In the limit of extreme black holes, the metric
becomes a special member of the Kinnersly-Chitre five-parameter family of
vacuum solutions generalizing the Tomimatsu-Sato delta=2 spacetime, and we
present the complete set of metrical fields defining this limit.
