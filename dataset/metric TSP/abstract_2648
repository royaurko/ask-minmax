We consider examples of the $\mathbb H$-type groups with the natural
horizontal distribution generated by the commutation relations of the group. In
the contrast with the previous studies we furnish the horizontal distribution
with the Lorentzian metric, which is nondegenerate metric of index 1 instead of
a positive definite quadratic form. The causal character is defined. We study
the reachable set by timelike future directed curves. The parametric equations
of geodesics are obtained.
