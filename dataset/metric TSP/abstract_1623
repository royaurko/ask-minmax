Affine variational principle for General Relativity, proposed in 1978 by one
of us (J.K.), is a good remedy for the non-universal properties of the
standard, metric formulation, arising when the matter Lagrangian depends upon
the metric derivatives. Affine version of the theory cures the standard
drawback of the metric version, where the leading (second order) term of the
field equations depends upon matter fields and its causal structure violates
the light cone structure of the metric. Choosing the affine connection (and not
the metric one) as the gravitational configuration, simplifies considerably the
canonical structure of the theory and is more suitable for purposes of its
quantization along the lines of Ashtekar and Lewandowski (see
http://www.arxiv.org/gr-qc/0404018). We show how the affine formulation
provides a simple method to handle boundary integrals in general relativity
theory.
