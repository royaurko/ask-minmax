Let $M^{2n-1}$ be the smooth boundary of a bounded strongly pseudo-convex
domain $\Omega$ in a complete Stein manifold $V^{2n}$. Then (1) For $n \ge 3$,
$M^{2n-1}$ admits a pseudo-Eistein metric; (2) For $n \ge 2$, $M^{2n-1}$ admits
a Fefferman metric of zero CR Q-curvature; and (3) for a compact strictly
pseudoconvex CR embeddable 3-manifold $M^3$, its CR Paneitz operator $P$ is a
closed operator.
