Domain specific (dis-)similarity or proximity measures used e.g. in alignment
algorithms of sequence data, are popular to analyze complex data objects and to
cover domain specific data properties. Without an underlying vector space these
data are given as pairwise (dis-)similarities only. The few available methods
for such data focus widely on similarities and do not scale to large data sets.
Kernel methods are very effective for metric similarity matrices, also at large
scale, but costly transformations are necessary starting with non-metric (dis-)
similarities. We propose an integrative combination of Nystroem approximation,
potential double centering and eigenvalue correction to obtain valid kernel
matrices at linear costs in the number of samples. By the proposed approach
effective kernel approaches, become accessible. Experiments with several larger
(dis-)similarity data sets show that the proposed method achieves much better
runtime performance than the standard strategy while keeping competitive model
accuracy. The main contribution is an efficient and accurate technique, to
convert (potentially non-metric) large scale dissimilarity matrices into
approximated positive semi-definite kernel matrices at linear costs.
