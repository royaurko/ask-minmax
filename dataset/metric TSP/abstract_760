For an ordered set $W=\{w_1,w_2,...,w_k\}$ of vertices and a vertex $v$ in a
connected graph $G$, the ordered $k$-vector
$r(v|W):=(d(v,w_1),d(v,w_2),...,d(v,w_k))$ is called the (metric)
representation of $v$ with respect to $W$, where $d(x,y)$ is the distance
between the vertices $x$ and $y$. The set $W$ is called a resolving set for $G$
if distinct vertices of $G$ have distinct representations with respect to $W$.
The minimum cardinality of a resolving set for $G$ is its metric dimension. In
this paper, we study the metric dimension of the lexicographic product of
graphs $G$ and $H$, $G[H]$. First, we introduce a new parameter which is called
adjacency metric dimension of a graph. Then, we obtain the metric dimension of
$G[H]$ in terms of the order of $G$ and the adjacency metric dimension of $H$.
