Asymptotic dimension was defined by M.Gromov for metric spaces in a manner
dual to the covering dimension for topological spaces. Since the covering
dimension can be characterized via extension properties of maps to spheres, it
makes sense to seek analogs of that phenomenon in the large scale category.
There have been two approaches in that direction so far (A.Dranishnikov's using
extension of proper asymptotically Lipschitz functions to euclidean spaces, and
by Repov\vs-Zarichnyi using maps to open cones). Our approach is specifically
designed to seek relation to the covering dimension of the Higson corona
$\nu(X)$ in case of proper metric spaces $X$. As an application we recover
results of Dranishnikov-Keesling-Uspenskiy ($\dim(\nu(X)\leq \asdim(X)$) and
Dranishnikov ($\dim(\nu(X)= \asdim(X)$ if $\asdim(X) < \infty$).
