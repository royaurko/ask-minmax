It is a known fact that the Kerr-Schild type solutions in general relativity
satisfy both exact and linearized Einstein field equations. We show that this
property remains valid also for a special class of the Kerr-Schild metrics in
arbitrary dimensions in generic quadratic curvature theory. In addition to the
AdS-wave (or Siklos) metric which represents plane waves in an AdS background,
we present here a new exact solution, in this class, to the quadratic gravity
in D-dimensions which represents a spherical wave in an AdS background. The
solution is a special case of the Kundt metrics belonging to spacetimes with
constant curvature invariants.
