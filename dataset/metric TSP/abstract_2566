By including potential into the flat metric, we study interaction of
sine-Gordon soliton with potentials. We will show numerically that while the
soliton-barrier system shows fully classical behaviour, the soliton-well system
demonstrates non-classical behaviour. In particular, solitons with low
velocities are trapped in the well and emit energy radiation.
