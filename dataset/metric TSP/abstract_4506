In this paper, we address the following question of Zhongmin Shen, [11, page
184]. Is it possible to have two projectively related Finsler metrics with the
same Riemann curvature? In Theorem 3.1, we show that the answer is negative,
when referring to Finsler metrics of scalar flag curvature. In other words, we
show that for an isotropic spray, its projective class contains at most one
Finsler metrizable spray having the same Riemann curvature as the original
spray. Moreover, in Proposition 3.3, we show how to construct a spray whose
projective class does not contain any Finsler metrizable spray with the same
Riemann curvature.
