We compute the corrections to the Schwarzschild metric necessary to reproduce
the Hawking temperature derived from a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP),
so that the GUP deformation parameter is directly linked to the deformation of
the metric. Using this modified Schwarzschild metric, we compute corrections to
the standard General Relativistic predictions for the light deflection and
perihelion precession, both for planets in the solar system and for binary
pulsars. This analysis allows us to set bounds for the GUP deformation
parameter from well-known astronomical measurements.
