By inspecting some known solutions to Einstein equations, we present the
metric of higher dimensional Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black hole in the
background of Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe. Then we verify the solution
with a perfect fluid. The discussion of the event horizon of the black hole
reveals that the scale of the black hole would increase with the expansion of
the universe and decrease with the contraction of the universe.
