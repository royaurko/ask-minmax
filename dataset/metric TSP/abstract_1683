Geometrization of dynamics using (non)-affine parametization of arc length
with time is investigated. The two archetypes of such parametrizations, the
Eisenhart and the Jacobi metrics, are applied to a system of linear harmonic
oscillators. Application of the Jacobi metric results in positive values of
geometrical lyapunov exponent. The non-physical instabilities are shown to be
due to a non-affine parametrization. In addition the degree of instability is a
monotonically increasing function of the fluctuations in the kinetic energy. We
argue that the Jacobi metric gives equivalent results as Eisenhart metric for
ergodic systems at equilibrium, where number of degrees of freedom
$N\to\infty$. We conclude that, in addition to being computationally more
expensive, geometrization using the Jacobi metric is meaningful only when the
kinetic energy of the system is a positive constant.
