A new metric is obtained by applying a complex coordinate trans- formation to
the static metric of the self-gravitating Born-Infeld monopole. The behaviour
of the new metric is typical of a rotating charged source, but this source is
not a spherically symmetric Born-Infeld monopole with rotation. We show that
the structure of the energy-momentum tensor obtained with this new metric does
not correspond to the typical structure of the energy momentum tensor of
Einstein-Born-Infeld theory induced by a rotating spherically symmetric source.
This also show, that the complex coordinate transformations have the
interpretation given by Newman and Janis only in space-time solutions with
linear sources.
