Let $M(\alpha)$ denote the (logarithmic) Mahler measure of the algebraic
number $\alpha$. Dubickas and Smyth, and later Fili and the contributor, examined
metric versions of $M$. The contributor generalized these constructions in order to
associate, to each point in $t\in (0,\infty]$, a metric version $M_t$ of the
Mahler measure, each having a triangle inequality of a different strength. We
further examine the functions $M_t$, using them to present an equivalent form
of Lehmer's conjecture. We show that the function $t\mapsto M_t(\alpha)^t$ is
constructed piecewise from certain sums of exponential functions. We pose a
conjecture that, if true, enables us to graph $t\mapsto M_t(\alpha)$ for
rational $\alpha$.
