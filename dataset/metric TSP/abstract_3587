Aguirregabiria et al showed that Einstein, Landau and Lifshitz, Papapetrou,
and Weinberg energy-momentum complexes coincide for all Kerr-Schild metric.
Bringely used their general expression of the Kerr-Schild class and found
energy and momentum densities for the Bonnor metric. We obtain these results
without using Aguirregabiria et al results and verify that Bringley's results
are correct. This also supports Aguirregabiria et al results as well as
Cooperstock hypothesis. Further, we obtain the energy distribution of the
space-time under consideration.
