We show that the $L^{\infty}$-norm of the contact Hamiltonian induces a
non-degenerate right-invariant metric on the group of contactomorphisms of any
closed contact manifold. This contact Hofer metric is not left-invariant, but
rather depends naturally on the choice of a contact form $\alpha,$ whence its
restriction to the subgroup of $\alpha$-strict contactomorphisms is
bi-invariant. The non-degeneracy of this metric follows from an analogue of the
energy-capacity inequality. We show furthermore that this metric has infinite
diameter in a number of cases by investigating its relations to previously
defined metrics on the group of contact diffeomorphisms. We study its relation
to Hofer's metric on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, in the case of
prequantization spaces. We further consider the distance in this metric to the
Reeb one-parameter subgroup, which yields an intrinsic formulation of a
small-energy case of Sandon's conjecture on the translated points of a
contactomorphism. We prove this Chekanov-type statement for contact manifolds
admitting a strong exact filling.
