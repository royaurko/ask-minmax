We prove that a certain class of ALE spaces always has a Kahler conformal
compactification, and moreover provide explicit formulas for the conformal
factor and the Kahler potential of said compactification. We then apply this to
give a new and simple construction of the canonical Bochner-K\"ahler metric on
certain weighted projective spaces, and also to explicitly construct a family
Kahler edge-cone metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^2$, with singular set $\mathbb{CP}^1$,
having cone angles $2\pi\beta$ for all $\beta>0$. We conclude by discussing how
these results can be used to obtain certain well-known Einstein metrics.
