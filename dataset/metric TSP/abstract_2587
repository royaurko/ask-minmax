In this paper we prove that every Riemannian metric on a locally conformally
flat manifold with umbilic boundary can be conformally deformed to a scalar
flat metric having constant mean curvature. This result can be seen as a
generalization to higher dimensions of the well known Riemann mapping Theorem
in the plane.
