"An invariant of metric spaces under bornologous equivalences" gives an
invariant and "A coarse invariant" extends the invariant to coarse
equivalences. In both papers the invariant is defined for a class of metric
spaces called sigma stable. This paper extends the invariant to all metric
spaces and also gives an example of a space that is not sigma stable.
