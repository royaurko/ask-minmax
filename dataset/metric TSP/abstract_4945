A class of metrics solving Einstein's equations with negative cosmological
constant and representing rotating, topological black holes is presented. All
such solutions are in the Petrov type-$D$ class, and can be obtained from the
most general metric known in this class by acting with suitably chosen discrete
groups of isometries. First, by analytical continuation of the Kerr-de Sitter
metric, a solution describing uncharged, rotating black holes whose event
horizon is a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus $g > 1$, is obtained. Then a
solution representing a rotating, uncharged toroidal black hole is also
presented. The higher genus black holes appear to be quite exotic objects, they
lack global axial symmetry and have an intricate causal structure. The toroidal
blackholes appear to be simpler, they have rotational symmetry and the amount
of rotation they can have is bounded by some power of the mass.
