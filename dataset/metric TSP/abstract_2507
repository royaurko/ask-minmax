We show that every complete metric space is homeomorphic to the precise locus
of zeros of an entire analytic map from a Hilbert space to a Banach space. As a
corollary, every complete separable metric space is homeomorphic to the precise
locus of zeros of an entire analytic map between two separable complex Hilbert
spaces. AmS TeX 2.1.
