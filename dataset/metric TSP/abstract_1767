We present an analysis of the classic Alcubierre metric based on conformal
gravity, rather than standard general relativity. The main characteristics of
the resulting warp drive remain the same as in the original study by
Alcubierre, namely that effective super-luminal motion is a viable outcome of
the metric. We show that for particular choices of the shaping function, the
Alcubierre metric in the context of conformal gravity does not violate the weak
energy condition, as was the case of the original solution. In particular, the
resulting warp drive does not require the use of exotic matter. Therefore, if
conformal gravity is a correct extension of general relativity, super-luminal
motion via an Alcubierre metric might be a realistic solution, thus allowing
faster-than-light interstellar travel.
