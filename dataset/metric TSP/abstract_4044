Gravity theories that can be viewed as dynamics for area metric manifolds,
for which Brans-Dicke theory presents a recently studied example, require for
their physical interpretation the identification of the distinguished curves
that serve as the trajectories of light and massive matter. Complementing
previous results on the propagation of light, we study effective massive point
particle motion. We show that the relevant geometrical structure is a special
Finsler norm determined by the area metric, and that massive point particles
follow Finsler geodesics.
