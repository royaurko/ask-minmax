We develop a kind of pregeometry consisting of a web of overlapping fuzzy
lumps which interact with each other. The individual lumps are understood as
certain closely entangled subgraphs (cliques) in a dynamically evolving network
which, in a certain approximation, can be visualized as a time-dependent random
graph. This strand of ideas is merged with another one, deriving from ideas,
developed some time ago by Menger et al, that is, the concept of probabilistic-
or random metric spaces, representing a natural extension of the metrical
continuum into a more microscopic regime. It is our general goal to find a
better adapted geometric environment for the description of microphysics. In
this sense one may it also view as a dynamical randomisation of the causal-set
framework developed by e.g. Sorkin et al. In doing this we incorporate, as a
perhaps new aspect, various concepts from fuzzy set theory.
