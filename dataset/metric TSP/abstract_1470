The paper is concerned with the asymptotic distribution of Laplace
eigenvalues on Liouville tori. Liouville metrics are the largest known class of
integrable metrics on two-dimensional tori; they contain flat metrics and
metrics of revolution as special cases. Using separation of variables, we
reduce the eigenvalue counting problem to the problem of counting lattice
points in certain planar domains. This allows us to improve the remainder
estimate in Weyl's law on a large class of Liouville tori. For flat metrics,
such an estimate has been known for more than a century due to classical
results of W. Sierpinski and J.G. van der Corput. Our proof combines the method
of Y. Colin de Verdiere, who proved an analogous result for metrics of
revolution on a sphere, with the techniques developed by P. Bleher, D. Kosygin,
A. Minasov and Y. Sinai in their study of the almost periodic properties of the
remainder in Weyl's law on Liouville tori.
