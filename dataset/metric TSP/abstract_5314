Suppose $M$ is a manifold with boundary. Choose a point $o\in\partial M$. We
investigate the prescribed Ricci curvature equation $\Ric(G)=T$ in a
neighborhood of $o$ under natural boundary conditions. The unknown $G$ here is
a Riemannian metric. The letter $T$ in the right-hand side denotes a
(0,2)-tensor. Our main theorems address the questions of the existence and the
uniqueness of solutions. We explain, among other things, how these theorems may
be used to study rotationally symmetric metrics near the boundary of a solid
torus $\mathcal T$. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the Einstein
equation on $\mathcal T$.
