We study Gauss curvature for random Riemannian metrics on a compact surface,
lying in a fixed conformal class; our questions are motivated by comparison
geometry. Next, analogous questions are considered for the scalar curvature in
dimension $n>2$, and for the $Q$-curvature of random Riemannian metrics.
