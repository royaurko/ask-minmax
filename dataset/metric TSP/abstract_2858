We completely describe paracontact metric three-manifolds whose Reeb vector
field satisfies the Ricci soliton equation. While contact Riemannian (or
Lorentz\-ian) Ricci solitons are necessarily trivial, that is, $K$-contact and
Einstein, the paracontact metric case allows nontrivial examples. Both
homogeneous and inhomogeneous nontrivial three-dimensional examples are
explicitly described. Finally, we correct the main result of [AGAG-D-13-00189],
concerning three-dimensional normal paracontact Ricci solitons.
