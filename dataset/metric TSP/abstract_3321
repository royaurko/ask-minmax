We discuss geodesic motion in the vacuum C metric using Bondi-like spherical
coordinates, with special attention to the role played by the "equatorial
plane." We show that the spatial trajectory of photons on such a hypersurface
is formally the same of photons on the equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild
spacetime, apart from an energy shift involving the spacetime acceleration
parameter. Furthermore, we show that photons starting their motion from this
hypersurface with vanishing component of the momentum along $\theta$, remain
confined on it, differently from the case of massive particles. This effect is
shown to have a counterpart also in the massless limit of the C metric, i.e. in
Minkowski spacetime. Finally, we give the explict map between Bondi-like
spherical coordinates and Fermi coordinates (up to the second order) for the
world line of an observer at rest at a fixed spatial point of the equatorial
plane of the C metric, a result which may be eventually useful to estimate both
the mass and the acceleration parameter of accelerated sources.
