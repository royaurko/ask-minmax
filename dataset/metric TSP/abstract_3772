Motivated by understanding the limiting case of a certain systolic inequality
we study compact Riemannian manifolds having all harmonic 1-forms of constant
length. We give complete characterizations as far as K\"ahler and hyperbolic
geometries are concerned. In the second part of the paper, we give algebraic
and topological obstructions to the existence of a geometrically 2-formal
K\"ahler metric, at the level of the second cohomology group. A strong
interaction with almost K\"ahler geometry is to be noted. In complex dimension
3, we list all the possible values of the second Betti number of a
geometrically 2-formal K\"ahler metric.
