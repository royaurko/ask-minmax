We find some explicit bounds on the ${\mathcal L}(L^2)$-norm of
pseudo-differential operators with symbols defined by a metric on the phase
space. In particular, we prove that this norm depends only on the "structure
constants" of the metric and a fixed semi-norm of the symbol. Analogous
statements are made for the Fefferman-Phong inequality.
