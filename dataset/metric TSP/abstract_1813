The form of the resulting Feynman propagators in a proposed local and gauge
invariant QCD for massive fermions suggests the existence of indefinite metric
associated to quark states, a property that might relate it with the known
Lee-Wick theories. Thus, the nature of the asymptotic free quark states in the
theory is investigated here by quantizing the quadratic part of the quark
action. As opposite to the case in the standard QCD, the free theory does not
show Hamiltonian constraints. The propagation modes include a family of
massless waves and a complementary set of massive oscillations. The theory can
be quantized in a way that the massive modes show positive metric and the
massless ones exhibit negative norms. It is remarked that, since QCD is
expected to not exhibit gluon or quark asymptotic states, the presence of
negative metric massless modes does not constitute a definite drawback of the
theory. In addition, the fact that the positive metric quark states are
massive, seems to be a good feature of the model, being consistent with the
approximate existence of asymptotically free massive states in high energy
processes.
