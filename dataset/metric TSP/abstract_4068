We describe an expansion of the solution of the wave equation in the De
Sitter - Schwarzschild metric in terms of resonances. The main term in the
expansion is due to a zero resonance. The error term decays polynomially if we
permit a logarithmic derivative loss in the angular directions and
exponentially if we permit an small derivative loss in the angular directions.
