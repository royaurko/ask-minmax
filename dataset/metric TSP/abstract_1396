It is no longer a debate that quality is an essential requirement in any
software product, especially in a highly competitive market and a context of
mission critical product. To obtain better product quality, software metrics
are the only reliable indicators provided to assess and measure this attribute
of a software product. Several metrics have been elaborated but none of them
were really convenient in an object oriented ecosystem. However, the MOOD
metrics have proven their efficiency in gauging the software quality at system
level, while CK Metrics measure the quality of software at class level . These
metrics, well suited for Object-Oriented design, allow measuring object
oriented design properties such as coupling, cohesion, encapsulation,
Inheritance and polymorphism. The goal of the present study is using the
mentioned metrics to assess the quality of two different case studies, MARF and
GIPSY. For this purpose, different tools such as McCabe, Logiscope and,
JDeodorant have been used to measure the quality of these projects by
implementing in different manners the metrics composing the CK and MOOD suite
metrics, whilst MARFCAT has been used to detect vulnerable code files in both
case studies. The present study puts the light on the strengths of these tools
to measure the quality of proven and largely researched software products.
