In this paper, we study a class of Finsler metrics called general
$(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics, which are defined by a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and
a $1$-form $\beta$. We find an equation which is necessary and sufficient
condition for such Finsler metric to be a Douglas metric. By solving this
equation, we obtain all of general $(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics with vanishing
Douglas curvature under certain condition. Many new non-trivial examples are
explicitly constructed.
