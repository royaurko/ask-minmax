We investigate the large intersection properties of the set of points that
are approximated at a certain rate by a family of affine subspaces. We then
apply our results to various sets arising in the metric theory of Diophantine
approximation, in the study of the homeomorphisms of the circle and in the
perturbation theory for Hamiltonian systems.
