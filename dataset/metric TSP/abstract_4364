We explore a natural generalization of systolic geometry to Finsler metrics
and optical hypersurfaces with special emphasis on its relation to the Mahler
conjecture and the geometry of numbers. In particular, we show that if an
optical hypersurface of contact type in the cotangent bundle of the
2-dimensional torus encloses a volume $V$, then it carries a periodic
characteristic whose action is at most $\sqrt{V/3}$. This result is deduced
from an interesting dual version of Minkowski's lattice-point theorem: if the
origin is the unique integer point in the interior of a planar convex body, the
area of its dual body is at least 3/2.
