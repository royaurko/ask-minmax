We demonstrate that the general (A)dS-Kerr-NUT solutions in D dimensions with
([D/2], [(D+1)/2]) signature admit [D/2] linearly-independent,
mutually-orthogonal and affinely-parameterised null geodesic congruences. This
enables us to write the metrics in a multi-Kerr-Schild form, where the mass and
all of the NUT parameters enter the metrics linearly. In the case of D=2n, we
also obtain n harmonic 2-forms, which can be viewed as charged (A)dS-Kerr-NUT
solution at the linear level of small-charge expansion, for the
higher-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theories. In the BPS limit, these 2-forms
reduce to n-1 linearly-independent ones, whilst the resulting Calabi-Yau metric
acquires a Kahler 2-form, leaving the total number the same.
