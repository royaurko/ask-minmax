In this paper the notion of modular cone metric space is introduced and some
properties of such spaces are investigated. Also we define convex modular cone
metric which takes values in CR(Y) where Y is a compact Hausdorff space. Then a
fixed point theorem is proved for contractions in these spaces. Furthermore, we
make a remark on paper [9] and it will be proved that their fixed point result
in modular metric spaces is not true.
