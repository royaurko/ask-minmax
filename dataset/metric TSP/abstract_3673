Theories in 5 dimensions with minimal supersymmetry are studied for
domain-wall solutions and in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The
scalar manifold is a product of a very special real manifold and a
quaternionic-Kaehler manifold. Superconformal methods can clarify the structure
of these manifolds, which are part of the family of special manifolds. BPS
solutions depending on the scalars and a warp factor of the 5-dimensional
metric with a flat 4-dimensional metric can interpolate between critical points
determined by algebraic attractor equations. The mixing of vector and
hypermultiplets is essential to obtain UV and IR critical points.
