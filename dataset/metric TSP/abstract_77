A generalization of metric space is presented which is shown to admit a
theory strongly related to that of ordinary metric spaces. To avoid the
topological effects related to dropping any of the axioms of metric space,
first a new, and equivalent, axiomatization of metric space is given which is
then generalized from a fresh point of view. Naturally arising examples from
metric geometry are presented.
