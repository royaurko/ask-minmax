The gravitational field exterior respectively interior to a metrically
stationary, axially symmetric, isolated spinning source made of perfect fluid
is examined within the quasi-metric framework. (A metrically stationary system
is defined as a system which is stationary except for the direct effects of the
global cosmic expansion on the space-time geometry.) Field equations are set up
and solved approximately for the exterior part. To lowest order in small
quantities, the gravitomagnetic part of the found metric family corresponds
with the Kerr metric in the metric approximation. On the other hand, the
gravitoelectric part of the found metric family includes a tidal term
describing the effect of source deformation due to the rotation. This tidal
term has a counterpart in Newtonian gravitation, but not in the Kerr metric.
Finally, the predicted geodetic effect for a gyroscope in a circular orbit is
calculated. There is a correction term, unfortunately barely too small to be
detectable by Gravity Probe B, to the standard expression.
