Experiments have investigated shape changes of polymer films induced by
asymmetric swelling by a chemical vapor. Inspired by recent work on the shaping
of elastic sheets by non-Euclidean metrics [Y. Klein, E. Efrati, and E. Sharon,
Science 315, 1116 (2007)], we represent the effect of chemical vapors by a
change in the target metric tensor. In this problem, unlike that earlier work,
the target metric is asymmetric between the two sides of the film. Changing
this metric induces a curvature of the film, which may be curvature into a
partial cylinder or a partial sphere. We calculate the elastic energy for each
of these shapes, and show that the sphere is favored for films smaller than a
critical size, which depends on the film thickness, while the cylinder is
favored for larger films.
