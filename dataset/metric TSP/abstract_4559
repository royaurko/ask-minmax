We prove that the modular curvature of a conformal metric structure on the
noncommutative torus $T^2_\theta$ ($\theta$ not rational) is invariant under
Morita equivalence. More precisely, the curvature associated to a Hermitian
structure on a Heisenberg bimodule E realizing the Morita equivalence between
$A_\theta = C(T^2_\theta)$ and $A_{\theta'}$, with $A_\theta$ identified to the
algebra of endomorphisms of E, coincides with the intrinsic curvature of the
conformal metric on $T^2_\theta$ with corresponding Weyl factor. The main
analytical tool is the extension of Connes' pseudodifferential calculus to
Heisenberg modules, the novel technical aspect being that the entire
computation is free of any computer assistance.
