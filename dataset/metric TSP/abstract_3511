We consider the problem of whether it is possible to improve the Novikov
inequalities for closed 1-forms, or any other inequalities of a similar nature,
if we assume, additionally, that the given 1-form is harmonic with respect to
some Riemannian metric. We show that, under suitable assumptions, it is
impossible. We use, in an essential way, a theorem of E.Calabi characterizing
1-forms which are harmonic with respect to some metric. We also study some
interesting examples illustrating our results.
