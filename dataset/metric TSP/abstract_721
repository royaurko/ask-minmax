We analyse in a systematic way the four dimensionnal Einstein-Weyl spaces
equipped with a diagonal K\"ahler Bianchi IX metric. In particular, we show
that the subclass of Einstein-Weyl structures with a constant conformal scalar
curvature is the one with a conformally scalar flat - but not necessarily
scalar flat - metric ; we exhibit its 3-parameter distance and Weyl one-form.
This extends previous analysis of Pedersen, Swann and Madsen , limited to the
scalar flat, antiself-dual case. We also check that, in agreement with a
theorem of Derdzinski, the most general conformally Einstein metric in the
family of biaxial K\"ahler Bianchi IX metrics is an extremal metric of Calabi,
conformal to Carter's metric, thanks to Chave and Valent's results.
