`Einstein-Aether' theory, in which gravity couples to a dynamical, time-like,
unit-norm vector field, provides a means for studying Lorentz violation in a
generally covariant setting. Demonstrated here is the effect of a redefinition
of the metric and vector field in terms of the original fields and two free
parameters. The net effect is a change of the coupling constants appearing in
the action. Using such a redefinition, one of the coupling constants can be set
to zero, simplifying studies of solutions of the theory.
