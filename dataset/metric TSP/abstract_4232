The approach to p-adic wavelet theory from the point of view of
representation theory is discussed. p-Adic wavelet frames can be constructed as
orbits of some p-adic groups of transformations. These groups are automorphisms
of the tree of balls in the p-adic space. In the present paper we consider
deformations of the standard p-adic metric in many dimensions and construct
some corresponding groups of transformations. We build several examples of
p-adic wavelet bases. We show that the constructed wavelets are eigenvectors of
some pseudodifferential operators.
