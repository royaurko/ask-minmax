S. Donaldson introduced a metric on the space of volume forms, with fixed
total volume on any compact Riemmanian manifold. With this metric, the space of
volume forms formally has non-positive curvature. The geodesic equation is a
fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation. We solve the geodesic equation
and its perturbed equation and prove that the space of volume forms is an
infinite dimensional non-positively curved metric space in the sense of
Alexandrov.
