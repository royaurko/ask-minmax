We present a gluing construction which adds, via a localized deformation,
exactly Delaunay ends to generic metrics with constant positive scalar
curvature. This provides time-symmetric initial data sets for the vacuum
Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant with exactly
Kottler-Schwarzschild-de Sitter ends, extending the results in arXiv:0710.3365
[gr-qc].
