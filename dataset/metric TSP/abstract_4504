In this paper we prove two general results related to Marstrand's projection
theorem in a quite general formulation over separable metric spaces under a
suitable transversality hypothesis (the "projections" are in principle only
measurable) - the result is flexible enough to, in particular, recover most of
the classical Marstrand-like theorems. Our proofs use simpler tools than many
classical works in the subject, where some techniques from harmonic analysis or
special geometrical structures on the spaces are used.
