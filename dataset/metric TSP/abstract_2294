Here, I aim to immerse myself in the heart of the metric jets, more precisely
of those which are representable, restricting myself to the main basic
concepts, while going deeper into some notions already mentionned in our
previous papers; this will give me the opportunity of lightening the previous
texts (including some proofs), while precising some ideas and giving new
examples (as the bifractal wave function) with a proof at the end of this
paper. Concerning the concrete examples found all along this paper: they play
the "starring role" in the understanding of our metric Differential Calculus!
