It is shown that, for any K\"ahler manifold, there exist parametrizations
such that the metric takes a block-form identical to the light-cone metric
introduced by Polyakov for two-dimensional gravity. Besides its possible
relevence for various aspects of K\"ahlerian geometry, this fact allows us to
change gauge in W gravities, and explicitly go from the conformal (Toda) gauge
to the light-cone gauge using the W-geometry we proposed earlier (this will be
discussed in detail in a forthcoming article).
