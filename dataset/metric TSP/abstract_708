For a standard Finsler metric F on a manifold M, its domain is the whole
tangent bundle TM and its fundamental tensor g is positive-definite. However,
in many cases (for example, the well-known Kropina and Matsumoto metrics),
these two conditions are relaxed, obtaining then either a pseudo-Finsler metric
(with arbitrary g) or a conic Finsler metric (with domain a "conic" open domain
of TM).
  Our aim is twofold. First, to give an account of quite a few subtleties which
appear under such generalizations, say, for conic pseudo-Finsler metrics
(including, as a previous step, the case of Minkowski conic pseudo-norms on an
affine space).
  Second, to provide some criteria which determine when a pseudo-Finsler metric
F obtained as a general homogeneous combination of Finsler metrics and
one-forms is again a Finsler metric ---or, with more accuracy, the conic domain
where g remains positive definite. Such a combination generalizes the known
(alpha,beta)-metrics in different directions. Remarkably, classical examples of
Finsler metrics are reobtained and extended, with explicit computations of
their fundamental tensors.
