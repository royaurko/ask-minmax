In this note we give an example of a compact metric space which is
homeomorphic to the Cantor space and whose Lipschitz-free space fails the
approximation property. This answers a question by G. Godefroy. We also prove
that there exists an uncountable family of topologically equivalent distances
on the Cantor space whose free spaces are pairwise non isomorphic.
