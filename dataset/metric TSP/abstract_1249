We prove the following results: (i) A Sasakian metric as a non-trivial Ricci
soliton is null $\eta$-Einstein, and expanding. Such a characterization permits
to identify the Sasakian metric on the Heisenberg group $\mathcal{H}^{2n+1}$ as
an explicit example of (non-trivial) Ricci soliton of such type. (ii) If an
$\eta$-Einstein contact metric manifold $M$ has a vector field $V$ leaving the
structure tensor and the scalar curvature invariant, then either $V$ is an
infinitesimal automorphism, or $M$ is $D$-homothetically fixed $K$-contact.
