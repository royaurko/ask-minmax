We show that for every vector bundle E over any given symplectic manifold M
there exists an explicitly given super-Poisson bracket on the space of sections
of the dual Grassmann bundle associated to E built out of symplectic structure
of M, a fibre metric on E, and a connection in E compatible with the given
fibre metric. Moreover, we construct a deformation quantization for this space
of sections by means of a Fedosov type procedure.
