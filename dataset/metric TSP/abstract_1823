Let $(M,g)$ be an $n-$dimensional Riemannian manifold and $T_{1}^{1}(M)$ be
its $(1,1)-$tensor bundle equipped with the rescaled Sasaki type metric $%
^{S}g_{f}$ which rescale the horizontal part by a nonzero differentiable
function $f$. In the present paper, we discuss curvature properties of the
Levi-Civita connection and another metric connection of $T_{1}^{1}(M)$. We
construct almost paracomplex Norden structures on $T_{1}^{1}(M)$ and
investigate conditions for these structures to be para-K\"{a}hler
(paraholomorphic) and quasi-K\"{a}hler. Also, some properties of almost
paracomplex Norden structures in context of almost product Riemannian manifolds
are presented. Finally we introduce the rescaled Sasaki type metric $^{S}g_{f}$
on the $(p,q)-$\ tensor bundle and characterize the geodesics on the
$(p,q)$-tensor bundle with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of
\textit{${}$}$^{S}g_{f}$ and another metric connection of
\textit{${}$}$^{S}g_{f}.$
