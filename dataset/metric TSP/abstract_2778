We present analytic solutions for membrane metric function based on
transverse $k$-center instanton geometries. The membrane metric functions
depend on more than two transverse coordinates and the solutions provide
realizations of fully localized type IIA D2/D6 and NS5/D6 brane intersections.
All solutions have partial preserved supersymmetries.
