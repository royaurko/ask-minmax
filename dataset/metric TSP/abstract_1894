A manifestly diffeomorphism invariant extension of Einstein gravity is
constructed, which includes singular metrics, and whose ADM formulation is
Ashtekar's gravity. The latter is shown to be locally equivalent to the
covariant theory. It turns out that exactly those kinds of degenerate four
dimensional metrics are allowed which do not destroy the causal structure of
spacetime. It is also shown that Ashtekar's gravity possesses an extension that
provides a local SO(3,C) invariance, without complexifying or changing the
signature of the metric.
