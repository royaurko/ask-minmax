The metric Mahler measure was first studied by Dubickas and Smyth in 2001 as
a means of phrasing Lehmer's conjecture in topological language. More recent
work of the contributor examined a parametrized family of generalized metric Mahler
measures that gives rise to a series of new, and apparently difficult,
problems. We establish a connection between these metric Mahler measures and
the theory of continued fractions in a certain class of special cases. Our
results enable us to calculate metric Mahler measures in several new examples.
