We prove that the space of convex real projective structures on a surface of
genus $g\ge 2$ admits a mapping class group invariant
  K\"ahler metric where Teichm\"uller space with the Weil-Petersson metric is a
totally geodesic complex submanifold. Also we calculate the Zariski tangent
space of a character variety $\chi(\pi_1(M),SL(n+1,\mathbb R)), n>2$ at
Fuchisan loci to show that the tangent space consists of cubic forms.
