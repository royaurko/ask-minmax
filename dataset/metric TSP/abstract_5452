Let $X$ be a non-singular compact K\"ahler manifold, endowed with an
effective divisor $D= \sum (1-\beta_k) Y_k$ having simple normal crossing
support, and satisfying $\beta_k \in (0,1)$. The natural objects one has to
consider in order to explore the differential-geometric properties of the pair
$(X, D)$ are the so-called metrics with conic singularities. In this article,
we complete our earlier work \cite{CGP} concerning the Monge-Amp\`ere equations
on $(X, D)$ by establishing Laplacian and ${\mathscr C}^{2,\alpha, \beta}$
estimates for the solution of this equations regardless to the size of the
coefficients $0<\beta_k< 1$. In particular, we obtain a general theorem
concerning the existence and regularity of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics with conic
singularities along a normal crossing divisor.
