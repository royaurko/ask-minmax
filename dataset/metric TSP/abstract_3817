John Roe \cite{Roe lectures} introduced coarse structures for arbitrary sets
$X$ by considering subsets of $X\times X$. That definition, while natural for
analysts, is a bit more difficult to digest for topologists and geometers. In
this paper we introduce large scale structures on $X$ via the notion of
uniformly bounded families and we show their equivalence to coarse structures
on $X$. That way all basic concepts of large scale geometry (asymptotic
dimension, slowly oscillating functions, Higson compactification) have natural
definitions and basic results from metric geometry carry over to coarse
geometry.
