The notions of a twistor space of a contact manifold and a contact connection
on such a manifold have been introduced by L. Vezzoni as extensions of the
corresponding notions in the case of a symplectic manifold. Given a contact
connection on a contact manifold one can define an almost $CR$-structure on its
twistor space and Vezzoni has found the integrability condition for this
structure. In the present paper it is observed that the $CR$-structure is
induced by an almost contact metric structure. The main goal of the paper is to
obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for normality of this structure in
terms of the curvature of the given contact connection. Illustrating examples
are discussed at the end of the paper.
