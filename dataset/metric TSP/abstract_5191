We apply the formalism of geometrothermodynamics to the case of black holes
with cosmological constant in four and higher dimensions. We use a
thermodynamic metric which is invariant with respect to Legendre
transformations and determines the geometry of the space of equilibrium states.
For all known black holes in higher dimensions, we show that the curvature
scalar of the thermodynamic metric in all the cases is proportional to the heat
capacity. As a consequence, phase transitions, which correspond to divergencies
of the heat capacity, are represented geometrically as true curvature
singularities. We interpret this as a further indication that the curvature of
the thermodynamic metric is a measure of thermodynamic interaction.
