Yau proved an existence theorem for Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics in the
1970's, but we still have no closed form expressions for them. Nevertheless
there are several ways to get approximate expressions, both numerical and
analytical. We survey some of this work and explain how it can be used to
obtain physical predictions from superstring theory.
