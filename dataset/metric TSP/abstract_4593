Motivated by the theory of proper convex real projective manifolds we study
$G/P$-geometric structures on compact manifolds where
$G=\operatorname{PGL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ and $P \leq G$ is a parabolic subgroup. We
show that a "proper" $G/P$-structure on a compact manifold always satisfies a
natural convexity condition and there is a intrinsic metric which generalizes
the classical Hilbert metric. Using these structural results, we prove several
rigidity results: a compact manifold with Gromov hyperbolic fundamental group
never admits a proper "higher rank" $G/P$-structure and a compact aspherical
manifold never admits a proper $G/P$-structure when $P$ is a non-maximal
parabolic subgroup.
