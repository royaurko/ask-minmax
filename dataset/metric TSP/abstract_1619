Explicit Riemannian metrics with Euclidean signature and anti-self dual
curvature that do not admit any Killing vectors are presented. The metric and
the Riemann curvature scalars are homogenous functions of degree zero in a
single real potential and its derivatives. The solution for the potential is a
sum of exponential functions which suggests that for the choice of a suitable
domain of coordinates and parameters it can be the metric on a compact
manifold. Then, by the theorem of Hitchin, it could be a class of metrics on
$K3$, or on surfaces whose universal covering is $K3$.
