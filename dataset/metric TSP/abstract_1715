In this work we study the existence of homogeneous Einstein metrics on the
total space of homogeneous fibrations such that the fibers are totally geodesic
manifolds. We obtain the Ricci curvature of an invariant metric with totally
geodesic fibers and some necessary conditions for such a metric to be Einstein
in terms of Casimir operators. Some particular cases are studied, for instance,
for normal base or fiber, symmetric fiber, Einstein base or fiber, for which
the Einstein equations are manageable. We show the existence of new invariant
Einstein metrics on homogeneous bisymmetric fibrations of maximal rank. For
such spaces we describe explicitly the isotropy representation in terms subsets
of roots and compute the eigenvalues of the Casimir operators of the fiber
along the horizontal direction. Results for compact simply connected
4-symmetric spaces of maximal rank follow from this. Also, new invariant
Einstein metrics are found on Kowalski $n$-symmetric spaces.
