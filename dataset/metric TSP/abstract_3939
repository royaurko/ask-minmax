We consider an approach to the Hawking effect which is free of the asymptotic
behavior of the metric or matter fields, and which is not confined to one
specific metric configuration. As a result, we find that for a wide class of
spacetime horizons there exists an emission of particles out of the horizon. As
expected, the energy distribution of the radiating particles turns out to be
thermal.
