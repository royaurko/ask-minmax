Searches for gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black holes using
interferometric GW detectors require the construction of template banks for
performing matched filtering while analyzing the data. Placement of templates
over the parameter space of binaries, as well as coincidence tests of GW
triggers from multiple detectors make use of the definition of a metric over
the space of gravitational waveforms. Although recent searches have employed
waveform templates coherently describing the inspiral, merger and ringdown
(IMR) of the coalescence, the metric used in the template banks and coincidence
tests was derived from post-Newtonian inspiral waveforms. In this paper, we
compute the template-space metric of the IMR waveform family IMRPhenomB over
the parameter space of masses and the effective spin parameter. We also propose
a coordinate system, which is a modified version of post-Newtonian chirp time
coordinates, in which the metric is slowly varying over the parameter space.
The match function analytically computed using the metric has excellent
agreement with the "exact" match function computed numerically. We show that
the metric is able to provide a reasonable approximation to the match function
of other IMR waveform families, such that the effective-one-body model
calibrated to numerical relativity (EOBNRv2). The availability of this metric
can contribute to improving the sensitivity of searches for GWs from binary
black holes in the advanced detector era.
