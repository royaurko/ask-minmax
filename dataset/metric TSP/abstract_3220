In this article we investigate deformations of a scalar-flat K\"ahler metric
on the total space of complex line bundles over CP^1 constructed by C. LeBrun.
In particular, we find that the metric is included in a one-dimensional family
of such metrics on the four-manifold, where the complex structure in the
deformation is not the standard one.
