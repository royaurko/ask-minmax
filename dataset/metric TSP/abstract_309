A vertex $v\in V(G)$ is said to distinguish two vertices $x,y\in V(G)$ of a
nontrivial connected graph $G$ if the distance from $v$ to $x$ is different
from the distance from $v$ to $y$.
  A set $S\subset V(G)$ is a \emph{local metric generator} for $G$ if every two
adjacent vertices of $G$ are distinguished by some vertex of $S$. A minimum
local metric generator is called a \emph{local metric basis} for $G$ and its
cardinality, the \emph{local metric dimension} of G. In this paper we study the
problem of finding exact values for the local metric dimension of corona
product of graphs.
