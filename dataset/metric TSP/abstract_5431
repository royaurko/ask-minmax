We consider the problem of computing the time-convex hull of a point set
under the general $L_p$ metric in the presence of a straight-line highway in
the plane. The traveling speed along the highway is assumed to be faster than
that off the highway, and the shortest time-path between a distant pair may
involve traveling along the highway. The time-convex hull ${TCH}(P)$ of a point
set $P$ is the smallest set containing both $P$ and \emph{all} shortest
time-paths between any two points in ${TCH}(P)$. In this paper we give an
algorithm that computes the time-convex hull under the $L_p$ metric in optimal
$O(n\log n)$ time for a given set of $n$ points and a real number $p$ with
$1\le p \le \infty$.
