In 1972, K. Kenmotsu studied a class of almost contact Riemannian manifolds.
Later, such a manifold was called a Kenmotsu manifold. This paper, we studied
Kenmotsu manifolds with $(2n+s)$-dimensional $s-$contact metric manifold and
this manifold, we have called generalized Kenmotsu manifolds. Necessary and
sufficient condition is given for an almost $s-$contact metric manifold to be a
generalized Kenmotsu manifold.We show that a generalized Kenmotsu manifold is a
locally warped product space. In addition, we study some curvature properties
of generalized Kenmotsu manifolds. Moreover, we show that the $\varphi $%
-sectional curvature of any semi-symmetric and projective semi-symmetric $%
(2n+s)$-dimensional generalized Kenmotsu manifold is $-s$.
