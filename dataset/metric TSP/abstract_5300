Kinematic quantities for finite elastic and plastic deformations are defined
via an approach that does not rely on auxiliary elements like reference frame
and reference configuration, and that gives account of the inertial-noninertial
aspects explicitly. These features are achieved by working on Galilean
spacetime directly. The quantity expressing elastic deformations is introduced
according to its expected role: to measure how different the current metric is
from the relaxed/stressless metric. Further, the plastic kinematic quantity is
the change rate of the stressless metric. The properties of both are analyzed,
and their relationship to frequently used elastic and plastic kinematic
quantities is discussed. One important result is that no objective elastic or
plastic quantities can be defined from deformation gradient.
