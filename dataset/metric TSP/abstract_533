The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be the largest time-domain
photometric survey ever. In order to maximize the LSST science yield for a
broad array of transient stellar phenomena, it is necessary to optimize the
survey cadence, coverage, and depth via quantitative metrics that are
specifically designed to characterize the time-domain behavior of various types
of stellar transients. In this paper we present three such metrics built on the
LSST Metric Analysis Framework (MAF) model (Jones et al. 2014). Two of the
metrics quantify the ability of LSST to detect non-periodic and/or
non-recurring transient events, and the ability of LSST to reliably measure
periodic signals of various timescales. The third metric provides a way to
quantify the range of stellar parameters in the stellar populations that LSST
will probe. We provide example uses of these metrics and discuss some
implications based on these metrics for optimization of the LSST survey for
observations of stellar variables and transients.
