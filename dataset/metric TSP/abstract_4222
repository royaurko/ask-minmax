Thermodynamic geometry is applied to the Born-Infeld-anti-de Sitter black
hole (BIAdS) in the four dimensions, which is a nonlinear generalization of the
Reissner-Norstr\"Aom-AdS black hole (RNAdS). We compute the Weinhold as well as
the Ruppeiner scalar curvature and find that the singular points are not the
same with the ones obtained using the heat capacity. Legendre-invariant metric
proposed by Quevedo and the metric obtained by using the free energy as the
thermodynamic potential are obtained and the corresponding scalar curvatures
diverge at the Davies points.
