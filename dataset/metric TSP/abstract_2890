Consider a uniformly coarsely proper visual Gromov hyperbolic metric space
with Gromov boundary containing at least two points. If the boundary is
connected, we show that the fundamental class of the space vanishes in the
controlled coarse homology of P. W. Nowak and J. \v{S}pakula. As an
application, we consider locally compact compactly generated hyperbolic groups.
