We Study instanton solutions in general relativity with a scalar field. The
metric ansatz we use is composed of a particular warp product of general
Einstein metrics, such as those found in a number of cosmological settings,
including string cosmology, supergravity compactifications and general Kaluza
Klein reductions. Using the Hartle-Hawking prescription the instantons we
obtain determine whether metrics involving extra compact dimensions of this
type are favoured as initial conditions for the universe. Specifically, we find
that these product metric instantons, viewed as constrained instantons, do have
a local minima in the action. These minima are then compared with the higher
dimensional version of the Hawking-Turok instantons, and we argue that the
latter always have lower action than those associated with these product
metrics.
