A family of spherically symmetric solutions with horizon in the model with
multi-component anisotropic fluid (MCAF) is obtained. The metric of any
solution contains n-1 Ricci-flat ``internal space'' metrics and for certain
equations of state (p_i = \pm \rho) coincides with the metric of intersecting
black brane solution in the model with antisymmetric forms. Examples of
simulation of intersecting M2 and M5 black branes are considered. The
post-Newtonian parameters beta and gamma corresponding to the 4-dimensional
section of the metric are calculated.
