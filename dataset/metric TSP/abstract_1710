We study two metrics, the quasihyperbolic metric and the distance ratio
metric of a subdomain $G \subset {\mathbb R}^n$. In the sequel, we investigate
a class of domains, so called $\varphi$-uniform domains, defined by the
property that these two metrics are comparable with respect to a homeomorphism
$\varphi$ from $[0,\infty)$ to itself. Finally, we discuss a number of
stability properties of $\varphi$-uniform domains. In particular, we show that
the class of $\varphi$-uniform domains is stable in the sense that removal of a
geometric sequence of points from a $\varphi$-uniform domain yields a
$\varphi_1$-uniform domain.
