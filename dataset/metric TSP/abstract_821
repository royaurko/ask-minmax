A formalism (zeta-complex analysis), allowing one to construct global
Einstein metrics by matching together local ones described in the papers Phys.
Lett. B 513(2001)142-146; Diff. Geom. Appl. 16(2002)95-120, is developed. With
this formalism the singularities of the obtained metrics are described
naturally as well.
