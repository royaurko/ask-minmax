In the standard brane world models, the bulk metric ansatz is usually assumed
to be factorizable in brane and bulk coordinates. However, it is not
self-evident that it is always possible to factorize the bulk metric. Using the
gradient expansion scheme, which involves the expansion of bulk quantities in
terms of the brane-to-bulk curvature ratio, as a perturbative parameter, we
explicitly show that metric factorizability is a valid assumption upto second
order in the perturbative expansion. We also argue from our result that the
same should be true for all orders in the perturbation scheme. We further
establish that the nonlocal terms present in the bulk gravitational field
equation can be replaced by the radion field; the effective action on the brane
thereby obtained resembles the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity.
