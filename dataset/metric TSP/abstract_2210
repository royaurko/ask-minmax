We investigate conditions under which a co-computably enumerable set in a
computable metric space is computable. Using higher-dimensional chains and
spherical chains we prove that in each computable metric space which is locally
computable each co-computably enumerable sphere is computable and each co-c.e.
cell with co-c.e. boundary sphere is computable.
