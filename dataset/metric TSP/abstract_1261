In this work, the dual flatness, which is connected with Statistics and
Information geometry, of general $(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics (a new class of
Finsler metrics) is studied. A nice characterization for such metrics to be
dually flat under some suitable conditions is provided and all the solutions
are completely determined. By using an original kind of metrical deformations,
many non-trivial explicit examples are constructed. Moreover, the relationship
of dual flatness and projective flatness of such metrics is shown.
