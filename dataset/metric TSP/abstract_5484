For a finitely generated group $G$, we introduce an asymmetric pseudometric
on projectivized deformation spaces of $G$-trees, using stretching factors of
$G$-equivariant Lipschitz maps, that generalizes the Lipschitz metric on Outer
space and is an analogue of the Thurston metric on Teichm\"uller space. We show
that in the case of irreducible $G$-trees distances are always realized by
minimal stretch maps, can be computed in terms of hyperbolic translation
lengths, and geodesics exist. We then study displacement functions on
projectivized deformation spaces of $G$-trees and classify automorphisms of
$G$. As an application, we prove existence of train track representatives for
irreducible automorphisms of virtually free groups and nonelementary
generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups that contain no solvable Baumslag-Solitar
group $BS(1,n)$ with $n\geq 2$.
