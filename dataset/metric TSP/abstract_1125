In this paper, we investigate geometrical properties of the rank metric space
and covering properties of rank metric codes. We first establish an analytical
expression for the intersection of two balls with rank radii, and then derive
an upper bound on the volume of the union of multiple balls with rank radii.
Using these geometrical properties, we derive both upper and lower bounds on
the minimum cardinality of a code with a given rank covering radius. The
geometrical properties and bounds proposed in this paper are significant to the
design, decoding, and performance analysis of rank metric codes.
