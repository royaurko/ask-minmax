We examine generalizations of the five-dimensional canonical metric by
including a dependence of the extra coordinate in the four-dimensional metric.
We discuss a more appropriate way to interpret the four-dimensional
energy-momentum tensor induced from the five-dimensional space-time and show it
can lead to quite different physical situations depending on the interpretation
chosen. Furthermore, we show that the assumption of five-dimensional null
trajectories in Kaluza-Klein gravity can correspond to either four-dimensional
massive or null trajectories when the path parameterization is chosen properly.
Retaining the extra-coordinate dependence in the metric, we show the
possibility of a cosmological variation in the rest masses of particles and a
consequent departure from four-dimensional geodesic motion by a geometric
force. In the examples given, we show that at late times it is possible for
particles traveling along 5D null geodesics to be in a frame consistent with
the induced matter scenario.
