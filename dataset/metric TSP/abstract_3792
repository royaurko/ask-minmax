Gromov \cite{Gr$_1$} and Dranishnikov \cite{Dr$_1$} introduced asymptotic and
coarse dimensions of proper metric spaces via quite different ways. We define
coarse and asymptotic dimension of all metric spaces in a unified manner and we
investigate relationships between them generalizing results of Dranishnikov
\cite{Dr$_1$} and Dranishnikov-Keesling-Uspienskij
 \cite{DKU}.
