We prove that the Euler form of a metric connection on real oriented vector
bundle $E$ over a compact oriented manifold $M$ can be identified, as a
current, with the expectation of the random current defined by the zero-locus
of a certain random section of the bundle. We also explain how to reconstruct
probabilistically the metric and the connection on $E$ from the statistics of
random sections of $E$.
