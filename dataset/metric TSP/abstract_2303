We study here the error of numerical integration on metric measure spaces
adapted to a decomposition of the space into disjoint subsets. We consider both
the error for a single given function, and the worst case error for all
functions in a given class of potentials. The main tools are the classical
Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality and ad hoc definitions of Sobolev classes on
metric measure spaces.
