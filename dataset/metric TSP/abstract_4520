We study a capacity theory based on a definition of a Riesz potential in
metric spaces with a doubling measure. In this general setting, we study the
basic properties of the Riesz capacity, including monotonicity, countable
subadditivity and several convergence results. We define a modified version of
the Hausdorff measure and provide lower bound and upper bound estimates for the
capacity in terms of the modified Hausdorff content. We also study
isocapacitary inequalities and boundedness of the Riesz potential.
