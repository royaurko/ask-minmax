In a previous paper, under the assumption that the Riemannian metric is
special, the contributor proved some results about the moduli spaces and CW
structures arising from Morse theory. By virtue of topological equivalence,
this paper extends those results by dropping the assumption on the metric. In
particular, we give a strong solution to the following classical question: Does
a Morse function on a compact Riemannian manifold gives rise to a CW
decomposition that is homeomorphic to the manifold?
