An anti-Kaehlerian manifold is a complex manifold with an anti-Hermitian
metric and a parallel almost complex structure. It is shown that a metric on
such a manifold must be the real part of a holomorphic metric. It is proved
that all odd Chern numbers of an anti-Kaehlerian manifold vanish and that
complex parallelisable manifolds (in particular the factor space G/D of a
complex Lie group G over the discrete subgroup D) are anti-Kaehlerian
manifolds. A method of generating new solutions of Einstein equations by using
the theory of anti-Kaehlerian manifolds is presented.
