Certain semi-Riemannian metrics can be decomposed into a Riemannian part and
an isochronal part. The properties of such metrics are particularly easy to
visualize in a coordinate-free way, using isometric embedding. We present such
an isochronal, isometric embedding of the well known Schwarzschild ideal fluid
metric in an attempt to see what is happening when the pressure becomes
singular.
