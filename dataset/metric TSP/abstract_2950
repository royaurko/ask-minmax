The main purpose of this work is to obtain the metric of a Charge Tempered
Cosmological Model, a slightly modified Standard Cosmological Model by a small
excess of charge density, distributed uniformly in accordance with the
Cosmological Principle, the global Coulomb interaction incorporated in this
metric. The particularity of this model is that the commoving observer
referential where the metric belongs is non inertial, which consequence is that
clocks at different position can not be synchronized. The new metric is
constrained to k goint to 0, with dependence on a charge parameter, and related
to a modified Friedmann equation, but it is constrained to a positive
deceleration parameter and the hyperbolic solution . Nevertheless, there are
corrections to do, valid just for a long range distances. For example, the red
shift has, now, dependences on the gravitational potential together the
recessional motion. In any way, this model accepts as well the cosmological
constant and its physical counterpart, the dark energy.
