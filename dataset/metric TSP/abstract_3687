We prove that M-theory plane waves with extra supersymmetries are necessarily
homogeneous (but possibly time-dependent), and we show by explicit construction
that such time-dependent plane waves can admit extra supersymmetries. To that
end we study the Penrose limits of Goedel-like metrics, show that the Penrose
limit of the M-theory Goedel metric (with 20 supercharges) is generically a
time-dependent homogeneous plane wave of the anti-Mach type, and display the
four extra Killings spinors in that case. We conclude with some general remarks
on the Killing spinor equations for homogeneous plane waves.
