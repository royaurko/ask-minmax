Locally rotationally symmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's
gravitational equations are matched along the hypersurface of vanishing
pressure with the NUT metric. These rigidly rotating fluids are interpreted as
sources for the vacuum exterior which consists only of a stationary region of
the Taub-NUT space-time. The solution of the matching conditions leaves
generally three parameters in the global solution. Examples of perfect fluid
sources are discussed.
