Firstly we derive peculiar spherical Weyl solutions, using a general
spherically symmetric metric due to a massive charged object with definite mass
and radius. Afterwards, we present new analytical solutions for relevant
cosmological terms, which appear in the metrics. Connecting the metrics to a
new geometric definition of a charged Black Hole, we numerically investigate
the effective potentials of the total dynamical system, considering massive and
massless test particles, moving on such Black Holes.
