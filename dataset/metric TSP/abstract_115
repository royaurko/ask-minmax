In Theorem 1, we generalize the results of Szabo for Berwald metrics that are
not necessary strictly convex: we show that for every Berwald metric F there
always exists a Riemannian metric affine equivalent to F. As an application we
show (Corollary 3) that every Berwald projectively flat metric is a Minkowski
metric; this statement is a "Berwald" version of Hilbert's 4th problem.
  Further, we investigate geodesic equivalence of Berwald metrics. Theorem 2
gives a system of PDE that has a (nontrivial) solution if and only if the given
essentially Berwald metric admits a Riemannian metric that is (nontrivially)
geodesically equivalent to it. The system of PDE is linear and of
Cauchy-Frobenius type, i.e., the derivatives of unknown functions are explicit
expressions of the unknown functions.
  As an application (Corollary 2), we obtain that geodesic equivalence of an
essentially Berwald metric and a Riemannian metric is always affine equivalence
provided both metrics are complete.
