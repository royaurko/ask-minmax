A new, simple and unified approach in the theory of contractive mappings was
recently given by Samet \emph{et al.} (Nonlinear Anal. 75, 2012, 2154-2165) by
using the concepts of $\alpha$-$\psi$-contractive type mappings and
$\alpha$-admissible mappings in metric spaces. The purpose of this paper is to
present a new class of contractive pair of mappings called generalized
$\alpha$-$\psi$ contractive pair of mappings and study various fixed point
theorems for such mappings in complete metric spaces. For this, we introduce a
new notion of $\alpha$-admissible w.r.t $g$ mapping which in turn generalizes
the concept of $g$-monotone mapping recently introduced by
$\acute{C}$iri$\acute{c}$ et al. (Fixed Point Theory Appl. 2008(2008), Article
ID 131294, 11 pages). As an application of our main results, we further
establish common fixed point theorems for metric spaces endowed with a partial
order as well as in respect of cyclic contractive mappings. The presented
theorems extend and subsumes various known comparable results from the current
literature. Some illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the main
results and to show the genuineness of our results.
