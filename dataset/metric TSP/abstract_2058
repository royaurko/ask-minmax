We show that a weighted homogeneous complex surface singularity is metrically
conical (i.e., bi-Lipschitz equivalent to a metric cone) only if its two lowest
weights are equal. We also give an example of a pair of weighted homogeneous
complex surface singularities that are topologically equivalent but not
bi-Lipschitz equivalent.
