For a given metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, which is identified as Fisher information
metric, we generate new constraints for the probability distributions for
physical systems. We postulate the existence of intrinsic probability
distributions for physical systems, and calculate the probability distribution
by optimizing the Fisher information metric under specified constraints.
Accordingly, we get differential equations for the probability distributions.
