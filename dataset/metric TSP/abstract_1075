The Horrocks-Mumford bundle $E$ is a famous stable complex vector bundle of
rank 2 on 4-dimensional complex projective space. By construction, $E$ has a
natural Hermitian metric $h_1$. On the other hand, stability implies the
existence of a Hermitian-Einstein metric in $E$ which is unique up to a
positive scalar. Now the obvious question is if $h_1$ is in fact the
Hermitian-Einstein metric. In this note we indicate how to show by computation
that this is not the case.
