The \emph{flat deformation theorem} states that given a semi-Riemannian
analytic metric $g$ on a manifold, locally there always exists a two-form $F$,
a scalar function $c$, and an arbitrarily prescribed scalar constraint
depending on the point $x$ of the manifold and on $F$ and $c$, say $\Psi (c, F,
x)=0$, such that the \emph{deformed metric} $\eta = cg -\epsilon F^2$ is
semi-Riemannian and flat. In this paper we first show that the above result
implies that every (Lorentzian analytic) metric $g$ may be written in the
\emph{extended Kerr-Schild form}, namely $\eta_{ab} := a g_{ab} - 2 b k_{(a}
l_{b)}$ where $\eta$ is flat and $k_a, l_a$ are two null covectors such that
$k_a l^a= -1$; next we show how the symmetries of $g$ are connected to those of
$\eta$, more precisely; we show that if the original metric $g$ admits a
Conformal Killing vector (including Killing vectors and homotheties), then the
deformation may be carried out in a way such that the flat deformed metric
$\eta$ `inherits' that symmetry.
