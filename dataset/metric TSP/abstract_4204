The aim of this paper is to develop on the 1-jet space J^1(R,M^3) the
Finsler-like geometry (in the sense of distinguished (d-) connection,
d-torsions and d-curvatures) of the rheonomic Berwald-Moor metric of order
three. Some natural geometrical field theories (gravitational and
electromagnetic) produced by the preceding rheonomic Berwald-Moor metric of
order three are also exposed.
