We study the problem of conformally deforming a metric to a prescribed
symmetric function of the eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor. We prove an
existence theorem for a wide class of symmetric functions on manifolds with
positive Ricci curvature, provided the conformal class admits an admissible
metric.
