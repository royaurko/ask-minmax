We solve for the SO(3)-invariant Kahler-Einstein metric on $\mathbb{P}^2$
with cone singularities along a smooth conic curve using numerical approach.
The numerical results show the sharp range of angles ($(\pi/2,2\pi]$) for the
solvability of equations, and the right limit metric space ($P(1,1,4)$). These
results exactly match our theoretical conclusions.
