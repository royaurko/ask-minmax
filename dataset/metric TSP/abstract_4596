The double field theory action in the flux formulation is dimensionally
reduced on a Calabi-Yau three-fold equipped with non-vanishing type IIB
geometric and non-geometric fluxes. First, we rewrite the metric-dependent
reduced DFT action in terms of quantities that can be evaluated without
explicitly knowing the metric on the Calabi-Yau manifold. Second, using
properties of special geometry we obtain the scalar potential of N=2 gauged
supergravity. After an orientifold projection, this potential is consistent
with the scalar potential arising from the flux-induced superpotential, plus an
additional D-term contribution.
