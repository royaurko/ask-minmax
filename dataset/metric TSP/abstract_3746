In this paper we construct a family of examples of self-dual Einstain metrics
of neutral signature, which are not Ricci flat, nor locally homogenous.
Curvature of these manifolds is studied in details. These are obtained by the
para-quaternionic reduction. We compare our examples with the orbifolds $\oo$
given by Galicki and Lawson, for which some new properties are also
established. Particularly, the sign and the pinching of their sectional
curvatures are studied.
