We propose a new nonabelian Kaluza-Klein dyon solution in the
seven-dimensional spacetimes. This is a Wu-Yang-like Kaluza-Klein dyon. The
dyonic metric is spherically symmetric, two spherical coordinate systems are
used, and the metric admits SO(3) Killing vectors. It can be verified that the
Einstein equation is satisfied in seven-dimensional spacetimes. The
stress-energy tensor of the Yang-Mills field in Einstein equation is derived
from Ricci tensor automatically, not put by hand from outside. The Ricci scalar
curvature \bar{R} vanishes. The four-dimensional part of the dyonic metric is
just the Schwarzschild black hole metric.
