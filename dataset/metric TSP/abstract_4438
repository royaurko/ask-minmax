For every smooth del Pezzo surface $S$, smooth curve $C\in|-K_{S}|$ and
$\beta\in(0,1]$, we compute the $\alpha$-invariant of Tian
$\alpha(S,(1-\beta)C)$ and prove the existence of K\"ahler--Einstein metrics on
$S$ with edge singularities along $C$ of angle $2\pi\beta$ for $\beta$ in
certain interval. In particular we give lower bounds for the invariant
$R(S,C)$, introduced by Donaldson as the supremum of all $\beta\in(0,1]$ for
which such a metric exists.
