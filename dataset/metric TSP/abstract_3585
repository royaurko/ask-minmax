In this short note, we verify explicitly in static coordinates that the non
trivial asymptotic Killing vectors at spatial infinity for anti-de Sitter
space-times correspond one to one to the conformal Killing vectors of the
conformally flat metric induced on the boundary. The fall-off conditions for
the metric perturbations that guarantee finiteness of the associated conserved
charges are derived.
