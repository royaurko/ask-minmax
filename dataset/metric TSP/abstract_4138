A {\em 2-Riemannian manifold} is a differentiable manifold exhibiting a
2-inner product on each tangent space. We first study lower dimensional
2-Riemannian manifolds by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for
flatness. Afterward we associate to each 2-Riemannian manifold a unique torsion
free compatible pseudoconnection. Using it we define a curvature for
2-Riemannian manifolds and study its properties. We also prove that
2-Riemannian pseudoconnections do not have Koszul derivatives. Moreover, we
define stationary vector field with respect to a 2-Riemannian metric and prove
that the stationary vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to the
2-Riemannian metric induced by the Euclidean product are the divergence free
ones.
