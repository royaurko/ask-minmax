We present a cosmological model in which the metric allows for an
inhomogeneous Universe with no intrinsic symmetries (Stephani models),
providing the ideal features to describe a fractal distribution of matter.
Constraints on the metric functions are derived using the expansion and
redshift relations and allowing for scaling number counts, as expected in a
fractal set. The main characteristics of such a cosmological model are
discussed.
