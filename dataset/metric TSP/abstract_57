A supercooled liquid is said to have a kinetic spinodal if a temperature Tsp
exists below which the liquid relaxation time exceeds the crystal nucleation
time. We revisit classical nucleation theory taking into account the
viscoelastic response of the liquid to the formation of crystal nuclei and find
that the kinetic spinodal is strongly influenced by elastic effects. We
introduce a dimensionless parameter \lambda, which is essentially the ratio
between the infinite frequency shear modulus and the enthalpy of fusion of the
crystal. In systems where \lambda is larger than a critical value \lambda_c the
metastability limit is totally suppressed, independently of the surface
tension. On the other hand, if \lambda < \lambda_c a kinetic spinodal is
present and the time needed to experimentally observe it scales as
exp[\omega/(\lambda_c-\lambda)^2], where \omega is roughly the ratio between
surface tension and enthalpy of fusion.
