In this paper the symmetries of the dual manifold were investigated. We found
the conditions when the manifold and its dual admit the same Killing vectors
and Killing-Yano tensors. In the case of an Einstein's metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ the
corresponding equations for its dual were found. The examples of Kerr-Newman
geometry and the separable coordinates in 1+1 dimensions were analyzed in
details.
