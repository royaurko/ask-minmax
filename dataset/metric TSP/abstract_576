We use a recent result by Cabezas et al. to build up an approximate solution
to the gravitational field created by a rigidly rotating polytrope. We solve
the linearized Einstein equations inside and outside the surface of zero
pressure including second-order corrections due to rotational motion to get an
asymptotically flat metric in a global harmonic coordinate system. We prove
that if the metric and their first derivatives are continuous on the matching
surface up to this order of approximation, the multipole moments of this metric
cannot be fitted to those of the Kerr metric.
