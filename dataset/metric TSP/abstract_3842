Consider a surface described by a Hamiltonian which depends only on the
metric and extrinsic curvature induced on the surface. The metric and the
curvature, along with the basis vectors which connect them to the embedding
functions defining the surface, are introduced as auxiliary variables by adding
appropriate constraints, all of them quadratic. The response of the Hamiltonian
to a deformation in each of the variables is examined and the relationship
between the multipliers implementing the constraints and the conserved stress
tensor of the theory established.
