We show a general relation between the spatially disjoint product of
probability density functions and the sum of their Fisher information metric
tensors. We then utilise this result to give a method for constructing the
probability density functions for an arbitrary Riemannian Fisher information
metric tensor. We note further that this construction is extremely
unconstrained, depending only on certain continuity properties of the
probability density functions and a select symmetry of their domains.
