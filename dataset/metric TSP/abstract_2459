Entity resolution (ER) is the task of identifying records belonging to the
same entity (e.g. individual, group) across one or multiple databases.
Ironically, it has multiple names: deduplication and record linkage, among
others. In this paper we survey metrics used to evaluate ER results in order to
iteratively improve performance and guarantee sufficient quality prior to
deployment. Some of these metrics are borrowed from multi-class classification
and clustering domains, though some key differences exist differentiating
entity resolution from general clustering. Menestrina et al. empirically showed
rankings from these metrics often conflict with each other, thus our primary
motivation for studying them. This paper provides practitioners the basic
knowledge to begin evaluating their entity resolution results.
