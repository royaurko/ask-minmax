The Eddington Lagrangian in the purely affine formulation of general
relativity generates the Einstein equations with the cosmological constant. The
Ferraris-Kijowski purely affine Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field, which
has the form of the Maxwell Lagrangian with the metric tensor replaced by the
symmetrized Ricci tensor, is dynamically equivalent to the Einstein-Maxwell
Lagrangian in the metric formulation. We show that the sum of the two affine
Lagrangians is dynamically inequivalent to the sum of the analogous Lagrangians
in the metric-affine/metric formulation. We also show that such a construction
is valid only for weak electromagnetic fields. Therefore the purely affine
formulation that combines gravitation, electromagnetism and the cosmological
constant cannot be a simple sum of terms corresponding to separate fields.
Consequently, this formulation of electromagnetism seems to be unphysical,
unlike the purely metric and metric-affine pictures, unless the electromagnetic
field couples to the cosmological constant.
