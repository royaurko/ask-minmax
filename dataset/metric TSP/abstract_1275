Let the metric space $\mathbb R^n \setminus \sim$ be the metric space of
$n$-sized unordered tuples of real numbers. In the following, it will be shown
that if a function $\varphi: \mathbb R^m \to \mathbb R^n \setminus \sim$ is
continuous, then there is a continuous function $f: \mathbb R^m \to \mathbb
R^n$ such that a natural embedding of $f$ into $\mathbb R^n \setminus \sim$ is
equal to $\varphi$. This theorem is wrong in the complex case. A counterexample
is given in [1].
