We prove a structure theorem for Lie n-algebras possessing an invariant inner
product. We define the notion of a double extension of a metric Lie n-algebra
by another Lie n-algebra and prove that all metric Lie n-algebras are obtained
from the simple and one-dimensional ones by iterating the operations of
orthogonal direct sum and double extension.
