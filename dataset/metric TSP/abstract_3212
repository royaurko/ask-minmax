Recently, the contributors have proposed a new approach to the theory of random
metrics, making an explicit link between probability measures on the space of
metrics on a Kahler manifold and random matrix models. We consider simple
examples of such models and compute the one and two-point functions of the
metric. These geometric correlation functions correspond to new interesting
types of matrix model correlators. We study a large class of examples and
provide in particular a detailed study of the Wishart model.
