Basic notions of continuous media mechanics are introduced for spaces with
affine connections and metrics. Stress (tension) tensors are considered,
obtained by the use of the method of Lagrangians with covariant derivatives
(MLCD). On the basis of the covariant Noether's identities for the
energy-momentum tensors, Navier-Stokes' identities are found and generalized
Navier-Cauchy as well as Navier-Stokes' equations are investigated over spaces
with affine connections and metrics. PACS numbers: 11.10.-z; 11.10.Ef; 7.10.+g;
