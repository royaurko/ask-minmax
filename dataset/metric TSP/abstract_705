We pursue the symplectic description of toric Kahler manifolds. There exists
a general local classification of metrics on toric Kahler manifolds equipped
with Hamiltonian two-forms due to Apostolov, Calderbank and Gauduchon(ACG). We
derive the symplectic potential for these metrics. Using a method due to Abreu,
we relate the symplectic potential to the canonical potential written by
Guillemin. This enables us to recover the moment polytope associated with
metrics and we thus obtain global information about the metric. We illustrate
these general considerations by focusing on six-dimensional Ricci flat metrics
and obtain Ricci flat metrics associated with real cones over L^{pqr} and
Y^{pq} manifolds. The metrics associated with cones over Y^{pq} manifolds turn
out to be partially resolved with two blowup parameters taking special
(non-zero)values. For a fixed Y^{pq} manifold, we find explicit metrics for
several inequivalent blow-ups parametrised by a natural number k in the range
0<k<p. We also show that all known examples of resolved metrics such as the
resolved conifold and the resolution of C^3/Z_3 also fit the ACG
classification.
