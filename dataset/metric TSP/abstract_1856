Massive bigravity models are interesting alternatives to standard cosmology.
In most cases however these models have been studied for a simplified scenario
in which both metrics take homogeneous and isotropic forms
(Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker; FLRW) with the same spatial
curvatures. The interest to consider more general geometries arises in
particular in view of the difficulty so far encountered in building stable
cosmological solutions with homogeneous and isotropic metrics. Here we consider
a number of cases in which the two metrics take more general forms, namely FLRW
with different spatial curvatures, Lema\^{i}tre, Lema\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi
(LTB), and Bianchi I, as well as cases where only one metric is linearly
perturbed. We discuss possible consistent combinations and find that only some
special cases of FLRW-Lema\^{i}tre, LTB-LTB and FLRW-Bianchi I combinations
give consistent, non-trivial solutions.
