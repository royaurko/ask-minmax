If a metric subspace $M^{o}$ of an arbitrary metric space $M$ carries a
doubling measure $\mu$, then there is a simultaneous linear extension of all
Lipschitz functions on $M^{o}$ ranged in a Banach space to those on $M$.
Moreover, the norm of this linear operator is controlled by logarithm of the
doubling constant of $\mu$.
