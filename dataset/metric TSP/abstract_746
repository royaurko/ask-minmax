We study model theoretic properties of valued fields (equipped with a
real-valued multiplicative valuation), viewed as metric structures in
continuous first order logic. For technical reasons we prefer to consider not
the valued field $(K,|{\cdot}|)$ directly, but rather the associated projective
spaces $K\bP^n$, as bounded metric structures. We show that the class of
(projective spaces over) metric valued fields is elementary, with theory $MVF$,
and that the projective spaces $\bP^n$ and $\bP^m$ are bi\"interpretable for
every $n,m \geq 1$. The theory $MVF$ admits a model completion $ACMVF$, the
theory of algebraically closed metric valued fields (with a non trivial
valuation). This theory is strictly stable (even up to perturbation).
Similarly, we show that the theory of real closed metric valued fields,
$RCMVF$, is the model companion of the theory of formally real metric valued
fields, and that it is dependent.
