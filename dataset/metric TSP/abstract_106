A reliable support detection is essential for a greedy algorithm to
reconstruct a sparse signal accurately from compressed and noisy measurements.
This paper proposes a novel support detection method for greedy algorithms,
which is referred to as maximum a posteriori (MAP) support detection. Unlike
the existing support detection method that identifies support indices with the
largest correlation value in magni- tude per iteration, the proposed method
selects them with the largest likelihood ratios computed under the true and
null support hypotheses by simultaneously exploiting the distributions of
sensing matrix, sparse signal, and noise. Leveraging this technique,
MAP-Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (MAP-OMP) is first presented to show the
vantages of exploiting the proposed support detection method, and the
sufficient condition for the perfect signal recovery is derived when the sparse
signal is binary. Subsequently, a set of iterative greedy algorithms, called
MAP-generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (MAP-gOMP), MAP-Compressive
Sampling Matching Pursuit (MAP-CoSaMP), and MAP-Subspace Pursuit (MAP-SP) are
presented to demonstrate how the proposed support detection method can be
applied into the existing greedy algorithms. From the empirical results, it is
shown that the proposed greedy algorithms with highly reliable support
detection can be better, faster, and easier to implement than basis pursuit via
linear programing.
