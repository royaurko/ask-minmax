In a viscous Bianchi type I metric of the Kasner form, it is well known that
it is not possible to describe an anisotropic physical model of the universe,
which satisfies the second law of thermodynamics and the dominant energy
condition (DEC) in Einstein's theory of gravity. We examine this problem in
scalar-tensor theories of gravity. In this theory we show that it is possible
to describe the growth of entropy, keeping the thermodynamics and the dominant
energy condition.
