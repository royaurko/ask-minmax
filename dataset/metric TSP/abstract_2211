We study the linearization of three dimensional Regge calculus around
Euclidean metric. We provide an explicit formula for the corresponding
quadratic form and relate it to the curlTcurl operator which appears in the
quadratic part of the Einstein-Hilbert action and also in the linear elasticity
complex. We insert Regge metrics in a discrete version of this complex,
equipped with densely defined and commuting interpolators. We show that the
eigenpairs of the curlTcurl operator, approximated using the quadratic part of
the Regge action on Regge metrics, converge to their continuous counterparts,
interpreting the computation as a non-conforming finite element method.
