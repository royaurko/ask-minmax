Advancement in fundamental engineering aspects of software development
enables IT enterprises to develop a more cost effective and better quality
product through aptly organized defect management strategies. Inspection
continues to be the most effective and efficient technique of defect
management. To have an appropriate measurement of the inspection process, the
process metric, Depth of Inspection (DI) and the people metric, Inspection
Performance Metric (IPM) are introduced. The introduction of these pair of
metrics can yield valuable information from a company in relation to the
inspection process.
