We construct a simply connected compact manifold which has complex and
symplectic structures but does not admit K\"ahler metrics, in the lowest
possible dimension where this can happen, that is, dimension 6. Such a manifold
is automatically formal and has even odd-degree Betti numbers but it does not
satisfy the Lefschetz property for any symplectic form.
