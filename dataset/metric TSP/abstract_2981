We investigate the dynamics of gauge and scalar fields on unstable D-branes
with rolling tachyons. Assuming an FRW metric on the brane, we find a solution
of the tachyon equation of motion which is valid for arbitrary tachyon
potentials and scale factors. The equations of motion for a U(1) gauge field
and a scalar field in this background are derived. These fields see an
effective metric which differs from the original FRW metric. The field
equations receive large corrections due to the curvature of the effective
metric as well as the time variation of the gauge coupling. The equations of
state for these fields resemble those of nonrelativistic matter rather than
those of massless particles.
