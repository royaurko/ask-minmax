We show that the metrical connection can be introduced in the two-dimensional
Finsler space such that entailed parallel transports along curves joining
points of the underlying manifold keep the two-vector angle as well as the
length of the tangent vector, thereby realizing isometries of tangent spaces
under the parallel transports. The curvature tensor is found. In case of the
Finsleroid-regular space, constructions possess the $C^{\infty}$-regular status
globally regarding the dependence on tangent vectors. Many involved and
important relations are explicitly derived.
