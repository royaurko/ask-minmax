The persistence diagram is the fundamental object in topological data
analysis. It inherits the stochastic variability of the data we use as input.
As such we need to understand how to perform statistics on the space of
persistence diagrams. This paper looks at the space of persistence diagrams
under a variety of different metrics which are analogous to $L^p$ metrics on
the space of functions. Using these metrics we can form different cost
functions defining different central tendencies and their corresponding
measures of variability. This gives us the natural definitions of both the mean
and median of a finite number of persistence diagrams. We give a
characterization of the mean and the median of an odd number of persistence
diagrams. Although we have examples of the mean not being unique nor continuous
we prove that generically the mean of sets of persistence diagrams with
finitely many off diagonal points is unique. In comparison the sets of
persistence diagrams with finitely many off diagonal points which do not have a
unique median is of positive measure.
