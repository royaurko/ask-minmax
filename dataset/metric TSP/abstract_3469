We describe a new metric that uses machine learning to determine if a
periodic signal found in a photometric time series appears to be shaped like
the signature of a transiting exoplanet. This metric uses dimensionality
reduction and k-nearest neighbors to determine whether a given signal is
sufficiently similar to known transits in the same data set. This metric is
being used by the Kepler Robovetter to determine which signals should be part
of the Q1-Q17 DR24 catalog of planetary candidates. The Kepler Mission reports
roughly 20,000 potential transiting signals with each run of its pipeline, yet
only a few thousand appear sufficiently transit shaped to be part of the
catalog. The other signals tend to be variable stars and instrumental noise.
With this metric we are able to remove more than 90% of the non-transiting
signals while retaining more than 99% of the known planet candidates. When
tested with injected transits, less than 1% are lost. This metric will enable
the Kepler mission and future missions looking for transiting planets to
rapidly and consistently find the best planetary candidates for follow-up and
cataloging.
