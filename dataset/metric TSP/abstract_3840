We present a class of three-dimensional integrable structures associated with
the Darboux-Egoroff metric and classical Euler equations of free rotations of a
rigid body. They are obtained as canonical structures of rational
Landau-Ginzburg potentials and provide solutions to the Painleve VI equation.
