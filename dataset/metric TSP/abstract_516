Using the family of multi-detector F-statistic metrics for short duration,
nonprecessing inspiral signals, we derive a marginalized metric that is
directly applicable to the problem of generating template banks for coincident
and coherent multi-detector searches for gravitational-waves. This metric is
compared to other average metrics, such as that proposed for the case of
searches associated with continuous signals from rotating neutron stars. We
show how the four-dimensional metric can be separated into two two-dimensional
metrics associated with the sky and mass parameter subspaces, allowing the
creation of separate template banks for these subspaces. Finally, we present an
algorithm for computing the mass space metric associated with both coincident
and coherent multi-detector targeted or all-sky searches for short duration,
nonprecessing inspiral gravitational-wave signals.
