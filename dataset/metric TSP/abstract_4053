Various Hamiltonian formulations of f(R) gravity can be found in the
literature. Some contributors follow the Ostrogradsky treatment of higher derivative
theories and introduce as extra variables first order time derivatives of the
metric (typically the extrinsic curvature). Some others take advantage of the
conformal equivalence of f(R) theory with Einstein's gravity coupled to a
scalar field and introduce as an extra variable the scalar curvature R itself,
which includes second time derivatives of the metric. We show that, contrarily
to some claims, these formulations are related by canonical transformations.
