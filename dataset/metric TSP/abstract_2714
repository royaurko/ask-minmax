In analogy to the situation for continuous lattices which were introduced by
Dana Scott as precisely the injective T$_0$ spaces via the (nowadays called)
Scott topology, we study those metric spaces which correspond to injective
T$_0$ approach spaces and characterise them as precisely the continuous
lattices equipped with an unitary and associative $[0,\infty]$-action. This
result is achieved by a thorough analysis of the notion of cocompleteness for
approach spaces.
