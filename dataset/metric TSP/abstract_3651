We examine the Toda frame formulation of the SO(3)-invariant hyper-Kahler
4-metrics, namely Eguchi-Hanson, Taub-NUT and Atiyah-Hitchin. Our method
exploits the presence of a rotational SO(2) isometry, leading to the explicit
construction of all three complex structures as a singlet plus a doublet. The
Atiyah-Hitchin metric on the moduli space of BPS SU(2) monopoles with magnetic
charge 2 is purely rotational.
