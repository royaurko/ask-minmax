In this paper we study problems related to parabolic partial differential
equations in metric measure spaces equipped with a doubling measure and
supporting a Poincare' inequality. We give a definition of parabolic De Giorgi
classes and compare this notion with that of parabolic quasiminimizers. The
main result, after proving the local boundedness, is a scale and location
invariant Harnack inequality for functions belonging to parabolic De Giorgi
classes. In particular, the results hold true for parabolic quasiminimizers.
