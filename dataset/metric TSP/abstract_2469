We construct new classes of exact solutions in metric--affine gravity (MAG)
with string corrections by the antisymmetric $H$--field. The solutions are
parametrized by generic off--diagonal metrics possessing noncommutative
symmetry associated to anholonomy framerelations and related nonlinear
connection (N--connection) structure. We analyze the horizon and geodesic
properties of a class of off--diagonal metrics with deformed spherical
symmetries. The maximal analytic extension of ellipsoid type metrics are
constructed and the Penrose diagrams are analyzed with respect to adapted
frames. We prove that for small deformations (small eccentricities) there are
such metrics that the geodesic behaviour is similar to the Schwarzcshild one.
The new class of spacetimes do not possess Killing symmetries even in the
limits to the general relativity and, in consequence, they are not prohibited
by black hole uniqueness theorems. Such static ellipsoid (rotoid)
configurations are compatible with the cosmic cenzorship criteria. We study the
perturbations of two classes of static black ellipsoid solutions of four
dimensional gravitational field equations. We conclude that such anisotropic
black hole objects may be stable with respect to the perturbations parametrized
by the Schrodinger equations in the framework of the one--dimensional inverse
scattering theory.
