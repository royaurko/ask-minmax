We obtain global Strichartz estimates for the solution $u$ of the wave
equation $\partial_t^2 u-\Div_x(a(t,x)\nabla_xu)=0$ with time-periodic metric
$a(t,x)$ equal to 1 outside a compact set with respect to $x$. We assume
$a(t,x)$ is a non-trapping perturbation and moreover, we suppose that there are
no resonances $z_j\in\mathbb{C}$ with $|z_j|\geq1$.
