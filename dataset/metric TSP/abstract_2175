The metric Bezout Theorem proved in an earlier paper can be extended to a
derivative version that compares derivatives of the algebraic distance of a
point $\theta$ to two properly intersecting cycles in projective space with the
derivatives of the algebraic distance of $\theta$ to their intersection.
  This improvement can be used to make algebraic independence criteria, to be
proved in a forthcoming paper, more flexible and to refine Approximation
results that are proved using the metric Bezout Theorem.
