We show that the pseudotensors of Einstein, Tolman, Landau and Lifshitz,
Papapetrou, and Weinberg (ETLLPW) give the same distributions of energy, linear
momentum and angular momentum, for any Kerr-Schild metric. This result
generalizes a previous work by G\"urses and G\"ursey that dealt only with the
pseudotensors of Einstein and Landau and Lifshitz. We compute these
distributions for the Kerr-Newman and Bonnor-Vaidya metrics and find reasonable
results. All calculations are performed without any approximation in
Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates. For the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric these
definitions give the same result as the Penrose quasi-local mass. For the Kerr
black hole the entire energy is confined to its interior whereas for the
Kerr-Newman black hole, as expected, the energy is shared by its interior as
well as exterior. The total energy and angular momentum of the Kerr-Newman
black hole are $M$ and $ M a$, respectively ($M$ is the mass parameter and $a$
is the rotation parameter). The energy distribution for the Bonnor-Vaidya
metric is the same as the Penrose quasi-local mass obtained by Tod.
