We obtain rotating black hole metric for higher dimensional Einstein and pure
Lovelock gravity by employing two independent and well motivated methods. One
is based on the principle of incorporation of Newtonian acceleration for
timelike motion while no acceleration for null motion. The other is the well
known Newman-Janis alogrithm that converts a static black hole into a rotating
one through a complex transformation. It turns out that both the methods give
the same metric which for Einst of the eour pure Lovelock metricein black hole
is an exact vacuum solution while for pure Lovelock black hole it satisfies the
vacuum equation in the leading order. However it shares all the physical
properties with the well known Kerr black hole.
