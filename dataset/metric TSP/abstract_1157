During the past thirty years hyperbolic type metrics have become popular
tools also in modern mapping theory, e.g., in the study of quasiconformal and
quasiregular maps in the euclidean $n$-space. We study here several metrics
that one way or another are related to modern mapping theory and point out many
open problems dealing with the geometry of such metrics.
