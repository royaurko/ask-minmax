In the present paper, we consider list decoding for both random rank metric
codes and random linear rank metric codes. Firstly, we show that, for arbitrary
$0<R<1$ and $\epsilon>0$ ($\epsilon$ and $R$ are independent), if
$0<\frac{n}{m}\leq \epsilon$, then with high probability a random rank metric
code in $F_{q}^{m\times n}$ of rate $R$ can be list-decoded up to a fraction
$(1-R-\epsilon)$ of rank errors with constant list size $L$ satisfying $L\leq
O(1/\epsilon)$. Moreover, if $\frac{n}{m}\geq\Theta_R(\epsilon)$, any rank
metric code in $F_{q}^{m\times n}$ with rate $R$ and decoding radius
$\rho=1-R-\epsilon$ can not be list decoded in ${\rm poly}(n)$ time. Secondly,
we show that if $\frac{n}{m}$ tends to a constant $b\leq 1$, then every
$F_q$-linear rank metric code in $F_{q}^{m\times n}$ with rate $R$ and list
decoding radius $\rho$ satisfies the Gilbert-Varsharmov bound, i.e., $R\leq
(1-\rho)(1-b\rho)$. Furthermore, for arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ and any $0<\rho<1$,
with high probability a random $F_q$-linear rank metric codes with rate
$R=(1-\rho)(1-b\rho)-\epsilon$ can be list decoded up to a fraction $\rho$ of
rank errors with constant list size $L$ satisfying $L\leq O(\exp(1/\epsilon))$.
