Thermodynamic length is a metric distance between equilibrium thermodynamic
states. Among other interesting properties, this metric asymptotically bounds
the dissipation induced by a finite time transformation of a thermodynamic
system. It is also connected to the Jensen-Shannon divergence, Fisher
information and Rao's entropy differential metric. Therefore, thermodynamic
length is of central interest in understanding matter out-of-equilibrium. In
this paper, we will consider how to define thermodynamic length for a small
system described by equilibrium statistical mechanics and how to measure
thermodynamic length within a computer simulation. Surprisingly, Bennett's
classic acceptance ratio method for measuring free energy differences also
measures thermodynamic length.
