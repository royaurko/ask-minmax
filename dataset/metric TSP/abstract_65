We propose a fast sequential algorithm for the fundamental problem of
estimating continuous-valued frequencies and amplitudes using samples of a
noisy mixture of sinusoids. The algorithm is a natural generalization of
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to the continuum using Newton refinements,
and hence is termed Newtonized OMP (NOMP). Each iteration consists of two
phases: detection of a new sinusoid, and sequential Newton refinements of the
parameters of already detected sinusoids. The refinements play a critical role
in two ways: (1) sidestepping the potential basis mismatch from discretizing a
continuous parameter space, (2) providing feedback for locally refining
parameters estimated in previous iterations. We characterize convergence, and
provide a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) based termination criterion. By
benchmarking against the Cramer Rao Bound, we show that NOMP achieves
near-optimal performance under a variety of conditions. The algorithm
significantly outperforms classical algorithms such as MUSIC in terms of
estimation accuracy, and yields comparable (slightly better) accuracy at much
lower computational cost relative to more recent atomic norm Soft Thresholding
(AST) and Lasso algorithms.
