In this paper, the equations of motion for geodesics in the neutral rotating
Black Ring metric are derived and the separability of these equations is
considered. The bulk of the paper is concerned with sets of solutions where the
geodesic equations can be examined analytically - specifically geodesics
confined to the axis of rotation, geodesics restricted to the equatorial plane,
and geodesics that circle through the centre of the ring. The geodesics on the
rotational axis behave like a particle in a potential well, while the geodesics
confined to the equatorial plane mimic those of the Schwarzschild metric. It is
shown that it is impossible to have circular orbits that pass through the ring,
but some numerical results are presented which suggest that it is possible to
have bound orbits that circle through the ring.
