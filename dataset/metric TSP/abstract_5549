This article develops analysis on fractal $3N$-gaskets, a class of
post-critically finite fractals which include the Sierpinski triangle for
$N=1$, specifically properties of the Laplacian $\Delta$ on these gaskets. We
first prove the existence of a self-similar geodesic metric on these gaskets,
and prove heat kernel estimates for this Laplacian with respect to the geodesic
metric. We also compute the elements of the method of spectral decimation, a
technique used to determine the spectrum of post-critically finite fractals.
Spectral decimation on these gaskets arises from more complicated dynamics than
in previous examples, i.e. the functions involved are rational rather than
polynomial. Due to the nature of these dynamics, we are able to show that there
are gaps in the spectrum.
