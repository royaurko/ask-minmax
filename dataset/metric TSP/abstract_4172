Working in doubling metric spaces, we examine the connections between
different dimensions, Whitney covers, and geometrical properties of tubular
neighborhoods. In the Euclidean space, we relate these concepts to the behavior
of the surface area of the boundaries of parallel sets. In particular, we give
characterizations for the Minkowski and the spherical dimensions by means of
the Whitney ball count.
