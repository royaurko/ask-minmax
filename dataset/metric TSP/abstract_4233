We develop a notion of entropy, using hyperbolic time, for laminations by
hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. When the lamination is compact and transversally
smooth, we show that the entropy is finite and the Poincare metric on leaves is
transversally Holder continuous. A notion of metric entropy is also introduced
for harmonic measures.
