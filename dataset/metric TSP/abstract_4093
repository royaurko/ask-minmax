Our goal is to show, in two different contexts, that "random" surfaces have
large pants decompositions. First we show that there are hyperbolic surfaces of
genus $g$ for which any pants decomposition requires curves of total length at
least $g^{7/6 - \epsilon}$. Moreover, we prove that this bound holds for most
metrics in the moduli space of hyperbolic metrics equipped with the
Weil-Petersson volume form. We then consider surfaces obtained by randomly
gluing euclidean triangles (with unit side length) together and show that these
surfaces have the same property.
