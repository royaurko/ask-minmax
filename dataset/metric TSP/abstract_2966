The connection between the proper time equation and the Zamolodchikov metric
is discussed. The connection is two-fold: First, as already known, the proper
time equation is the product of the Zamolodchikov metric and the
renormalization group beta function. Second, the condition that the two-point
function is the Zamolodchikov metric, implies the proper time equation. We
study the massless vector of the open string in detail. In the exactly
calculable case of a uniform electromgnetic field strength we recover the
Born-Infeld equation. We describe the systematics of the perturbative
evaluation of the gauge invariant proper time equation for the massless vector
field. The method is valid for non-uniform fields and gives results that are
exact to all orders in derivatives. As a non trivial check, we show that in the
limit of uniform fields it reproduces the lowest order Born-Infeld equation.
