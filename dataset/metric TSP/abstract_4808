Lower estimates are obtained for the macroscopic scale of affine
approximability of vector-valued Lipschitz functions on finite dimensional
normed spaces, completing the work of Bates, Johnson, Lindenstrass, Preiss and
Schechtman. This yields a new approach to Bourgain's discretization theorem for
superreflexive targets.
