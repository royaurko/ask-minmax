We study completeness properties of Sobolev metrics on the space of immersed
curves and on the shape space of unparametrized curves. We show that Sobolev
metrics of order $n\geq 2$ are metrically complete on the space $\mathcal
I^n(S^1,\mathbb R^d)$ of Sobolev immersions of the same regularity and that any
two curves in the same connected component can be joined by a minimizing
geodesic. These results then imply that the shape space of unparametrized
curves has the structure of a complete length space.
