In the space of thermodynamic equilibrium states we introduce a Legendre
invariant metric which contains all the information about the thermodynamics of
black holes. The curvature of this thermodynamic metric becomes singular at
those points where, according to the analysis of the heat capacities, phase
transitions occur. This result is valid for the Kerr-Newman black hole and all
its special cases and, therefore, provides a unified description of black hole
phase transitions in terms of curvature singularities.
