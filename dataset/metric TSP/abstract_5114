A well known consequence of the Wirtinger inequality is that in a Kaehler
surface a holomorphic curve is an area minimizer in its homology class. In
light of this result it is natural, given a Kaehler surface, to investigate the
relation between area minimizers and complex curves. When the Kaehler surface
is a K3 surface this problem takes on a new character. A Ricci flat
(Calabi-Yau) metric on a K3 surface X is hyperkaehler in the sense that there
is a two-sphere of complex structures, called the hyperkaehler line, each of
which is compatible with the metric. A minimizer of area among surfaces
representing a homology class \alpha consists of a sum of branched immersed
surfaces and it is then reasonable to ask whether each surface in this
collection is holomorphic for some complex structure on the hyperkaehler line.
Though this is true for many homology classes and there is other evidence that
makes this pausible, in this paper we show that there is an integral homology
class \alpha and a hyperkaehler metric g such that no area minimizer of \alpha
has this property.
