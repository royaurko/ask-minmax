q-ary lattices can be obtained from q-ary codes using the so-called
Construction A. We investigate these lattices in the Lee metric and show how
their decoding process can be related to the associated codes. For prime q we
derive a Lee sphere decoding algorithm for q-ary lattices, present a brief
discussion on its complexity and some comparisons with the classic sphere
decoding.
