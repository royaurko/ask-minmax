We describe all local Riemannian metrics on surfaces whose geodesic flows are
superintegrable with one integral linear in momenta and one integral cubic in
momenta.
  We also show that some of these metrics can be extended to the 2-sphere. This
gives us new examples of Hamiltonian systems on the sphere with integrals of
degree three in momenta, and the first examples of superintegrable metrics of
nonconstant curvature on a closed surface
