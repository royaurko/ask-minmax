Inspired by a construction due to Hitchin, we produce strongly bihermitian
metrics on certain Hopf complex surfaces, which integrate the locally
conformally Kaehler metrics found by Gauduchon and Ornea. We also show that the
Inoue complex surfaces with zero second Betti number do not admit bihermitian
metrics. This completes the classification of the compact complex surfaces
admitting strongly bihermitian metrics.
