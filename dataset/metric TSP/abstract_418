In this paper we get a necessary and sufficient condition for the Ricci
operator of a solvable metric Lie algebra to have at least two negative
eigenvalues. In particular, this condition implies that the Ricci operator of
every non-unimodular solvable metric Lie algebra or every non-abelian nilpotent
metric Lie algebra has this property.
