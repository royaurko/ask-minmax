In this paper we present a class of metrics to be considered as new possible
sources for the Kerr metric. These new solutions are generated by applying the
Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) to any static spherically symmetric (SSS) ``seed''
metric. The continuity conditions for joining any two of these new metrics is
presented. A specific analysis of the joining of interior solutions to the Kerr
exterior is made. The boundary conditions used are those first developed by
Dormois and Israel. We find that the NJA can be used to generate new physically
allowable interior solutions. These new solutions can be matched smoothly to
the Kerr metric. We present a general method for finding such solutions with
oblate spheroidal boundary surfaces. Finally a trial solution is found and
presented.
