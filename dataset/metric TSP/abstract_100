From the list of 2321 transiting planet candidates announced by the Kepler
Mission, we select seven targets with favorable properties for the capacity to
dynamically maintain an exomoon and present a detectable signal. These seven
candidates were identified through our automatic target selection (TSA)
algorithm and target selection prioritization (TSP) filtering, whereby we
excluded systems exhibiting significant time-correlated noise and focussed on
those with a single transiting planet candidate of radius less than 6 Earth
radii. We find no compelling evidence for an exomoon around any of the seven
KOIs but constrain the satellite-to-planet mass ratios for each. For four of
the seven KOIs, we estimate a 95% upper quantile of M_S/M_P<0.04, which given
the radii of the candidates, likely probes down to sub-Earth masses. We also
derive precise transit times and durations for each candidate and find no
evidence for dynamical variations in any of the KOIs. With just a few systems
analyzed thus far in the in-going HEK project, projections on eta-moon would be
premature, but a high frequency of large moons around
Super-Earths/Mini-Neptunes would appear to be incommensurable with our results
so far.
