Gravitational waves in isotropic cosmologies were recently studied using the
gauge-invariant approach of Ellis-Bruni. We now construct the linearised metric
perturbations of the background Robertson-Walker space-time which reproduce the
results obtained in that study. The analysis carried out here also facilitates
an easy comparison with Bardeen.
