Given any closed Kaehler manifold we define, following an idea by Eugenio
Calabi, a Riemannian metric on the space of Kaehler metrics regarded as an
infinite dimensional manifold. We prove several geometrical features of the
resulting space, some of which we think were already known to Calabi. In
particular, the space is a portion of an infinite dimensional sphere and admits
explicit unique smooth solutions for the Cauchy and the Dirichlet problems for
the geodesic equation.
