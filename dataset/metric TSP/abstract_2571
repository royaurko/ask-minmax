We give a wedge removability theorem for metrically thin sets of two
codimensional Hausdorff null measure.
 This removability theorem combined with the wedge removability theorem of
Merker for closed subsets of two codimensional manifolds, gives a
CR-meromorphic extension theorem in the greater codimensional case.
