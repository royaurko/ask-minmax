This paper is devoted to the study of quotients of finite metric spaces. The
basic type of question we ask is: Given a finite metric space M, what is the
largest quotient of (a subset of) M which well embeds into Hilbert space. We
obtain asymptotically tight bounds for these questions, and prove that they
exhibit phase transitions. We also study the analogous problem for embedings
into l_p, and the particular case of the hypercube.
