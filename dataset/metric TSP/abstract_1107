In this paper we investigate algorithmic randomness on more general spaces
than the Cantor space, namely computable metric spaces. To do this, we first
develop a unified framework allowing computations with probability measures. We
show that any computable metric space with a computable probability measure is
isomorphic to the Cantor space in a computable and measure-theoretic sense. We
show that any computable metric space admits a universal uniform randomness
test (without further assumption).
