We find a new obstruction for a real Einstein 4-orbifold with an
A1-singularity to be a limit of smooth Einstein 4-manifolds. The obstruction is
a curvature condition at the singular point. For asymptotically hyperbolic
metrics, with boundary at infinity a conformal metric, we prove that if the
obstruction vanishes, one can desingularize Einstein orbifolds with such
singularities. The Dirichlet problem consists in finding Einstein metrics with
given conformal infinity on the boundary: we prove that our obstruction defines
a wall in the space of conformal metrics on the boundary, and that all the
Einstein metrics must have their conformal infinity on one side of the wall.
