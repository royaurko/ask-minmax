In the previous work, the notion of the Finsleroid--Finsler space have been
formulated and the necessary and sufficient conditions for the space to be of
the Landsberg type have been found. In the present paper, starting with
particular spray coefficients, we demonstrate how the Landsberg condition can
explicitly appear in case of the Finsleroid--type metric function. Calculations
are supplementing by a convenient special Maple--program. The general form of
the associated geodesic spray coefficients is presented for such metric
function under the condition of constancy of the Finsleroid charge.
  Key words: Finsler geometry, metric spaces, spray.
