A basic extension of the exterior part of the extreme Reissner-Nordstroem
solution in terms of a continuous metric and gauge potential is constructed.
This extension is not smooth at the null hypersurface given by the
Cauchy-Killing horizon which separates isometric copies of the exterior metric.
The Maxwell-Einstein system of equations is satisfied only in a weak sense. The
manifold is topologically incomplete and the spherical symmetry is globally
broken down to an axial symmetry. This behaviour can be attributed to the
effect of a 'topological string', in the sense of a infinitesimally thin closed
stringlike object 'sitting on the rim' of the black hole and holding it open by
means of an accompanying impulsive gravitational wave. The resulting
differentiable manifold and the corresponding horizons are not anymore simply
connected, being 'pierced' by the strings.
