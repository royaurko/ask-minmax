In this paper, the modern theory of infinitesimals is applied to the General
Relativity metric dS and its geometric and physical meanings are rigorously
investigated. Employing results obtained via the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation, gravitational time-dilation expressions are obtained and are shown to
be caused by gravitationally altered photon interactions with atomic
structures.
