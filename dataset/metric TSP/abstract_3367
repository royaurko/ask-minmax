The goal of this work is to study probability inequalities leading to tail
estimates in a general metric semigroup $\mathscr{G}$ with a
translation-invariant metric $d_{\mathscr{G}}$. We begin by proving
inequalities including those by Ottaviani-Skorohod, L\'evy, Mogul'skii, and
Khinchin-Kahane in arbitrary semigroups $\mathscr{G}$. We then show a variant
of Hoffmann-J{\o}rgensen's inequality, which unifies and significantly
strengthens several versions in the Banach space literature, including those by
Johnson and Schechtman [Ann. Prob. 17], Klass and Nowicki [Ann. Prob. 28], and
Hitczenko and Montgomery-Smith [Ann. Prob. 29]. Moreover, our version of the
inequality holds more generally, in the minimal mathematical framework of a
metric semigroup $\mathscr{G}$. This inequality has important consequences (as
in the Banach space literature) in obtaining tail estimates and approximate
bounds for sums of independent semigroup-valued random variables, their
moments, and decreasing rearrangements. In particular, we obtain the "correct"
universal constants in several cases, including in all normed linear spaces as
well as in all compact, discrete, or abelian Lie groups.
