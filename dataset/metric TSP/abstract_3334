There are many known examples of scalar-flat K\"ahler ALE surfaces, all of
which have group at infinity either cyclic or contained in ${\rm{SU}}(2)$. The
main result in this paper shows that for any non-cyclic finite subgroup $\Gamma
\subset {\rm{U}}(2)$ containing no complex reflections, there exist scalar-flat
K\"ahler ALE metrics on the minimal resolution of $\mathbb{C}^2 / \Gamma$, for
which $\Gamma$ occurs as the group at infinity. Furthermore, we show that these
metrics admit a holomorphic isometric circle action. It is also shown that
there exist scalar-flat K\"ahler ALE metrics with respect to some small
deformations of complex structure of the minimal resolution. Lastly, we show
the existence of extremal K\"ahler metrics admitting holomorphic isometric
circle actions in certain K\"ahler classes on the complex analytic
compactifications of the minimal resolutions.
