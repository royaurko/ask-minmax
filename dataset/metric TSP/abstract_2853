The Metric Coalescent (MC) is a measure-valued Markov Process generalizing
the classical Kingman Coalescent. We show how the MC arises naturally from a
discrete agent based model (Compulsive Gambler) of social dynamics and prove an
existence and uniqueness theorem extending the MC to the space of all Borel
probability measures on any locally compact Polish space.
