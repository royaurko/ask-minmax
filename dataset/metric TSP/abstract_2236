In our previous works on deformation limits of projective and Moishezon
manifolds, we introduced and made crucial use of the notion of strongly
Gauduchon metrics as a reinforcement of the earlier notion of Gauduchon
metrics. Using direct and inverse images of closed positive currents of type
$(1, \, 1)$ and regularisation, we now show that compact complex manifolds
carrying strongly Gauduchon metrics are stable under modifications. This
stability property, known to fail for compact K\"ahler manifolds, mirrors the
modification stability of balanced manifolds proved by Alessandrini and
Bassanelli.
