We prove the existence of Sasakian metrics with positive Ricci curvature on
certain highly connected odd dimensional manifolds. In particular, we show that
manifolds homeomorphic to the 2k-fold connected sum of S^{2n-1} x S^{2n} admit
Sasakian metrics with positive Ricci curvature for all k. Furthermore, a
formula for computing the diffeomorphism types is given and tables are
presented for dimensions 7 and 11.
