For a submanifold \[ \Sigma\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}% \] Belkin and Niyogi showed
that one can approximate the Laplacian operator using heat kernels. Using a
definition of coarse Ricci curvature derived by iterating Laplacians, we
approximate the coarse Ricci curvature of submanifolds $\Sigma$ in the same
way. More generally, on any metric measure space we are able to approximate a
1-parameter family of coarse Ricci functions that include the coarse
Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature.
