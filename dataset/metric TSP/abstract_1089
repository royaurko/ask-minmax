In this paper, we define precompact set in intuitionistic fuzzy metric spaces
and prove that any subset of an intuitionistic fuzzy metric space is compact if
and only if it is precompact and complete. Also we define topologically
complete intuitionistic fuzzy metrizable spaces and prove that any $G_{\delta
}$ set in a complete intuitionistic fuzzy metric spaces is a topologically
complete intuitionistic fuzzy metrizable space and vice versa. Finally, we
define intuitionistic fuzzy normed spaces and fuzzy boundedness for linear
operators and so we prove that every finite dimensional intuitionistic fuzzy
normed space is complete.
