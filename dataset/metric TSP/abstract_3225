We give an extension of the theory of relaxation of variational integrals in
classical Sobolev spaces to the setting of metric Sobolev spaces. More
precisely, we establish a general framework to deal with the problem of finding
an integral representation for relaxed variational functionals of variational
integrals of the calculus of variations in the setting of metric measure
spaces. We prove integral representation theorems, both in the convex and
non-convex case, which extend and complete previous results in the setting of
euclidean measure spaces to the setting of metric measure spaces. We also show
that these integral representation theorems can be applied in the setting of
Cheeger-Keith's differentiable structure.
