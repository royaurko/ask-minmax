We study the existence of a metric with zero scalar curvature maximizing the
isoperimetric ratio among all zero scalar curvature metrics in a fixed
conformal class of metrics on a compact manifold with boundary. The question
may be reduced to an extremal problem for the harmonic extension of functions
and the related nonlinear integral equation is discussed.
