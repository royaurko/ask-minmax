Let G be a finitely generated, torsion-free, two-step nilpotent group. Let
C^*(G) be the universal C^*-algebra of G. We show that acsr(C^*(G)) =
acsr(C((\hat{G})_1)), where for a unital C^*-algebra A, acsr(A) is the absolute
connected stable rank of A, and (\hat{G})_1 is the space of one-dimensional
representations of G. For the case of stable rank, we have close results. In
the process, we give a stable rank estimate for maximal full algebras of
operator fields over a metric space.
