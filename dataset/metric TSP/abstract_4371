We present a unifying approach where weak forces and neutrino oscillations
are interpreted under the same standards of torsional hybrid gravity. This
gravitational theory mixes metric and metric-affine formalism in presence of
torsion and allows to derive an effective scalar field which gives rise to a
running coupling for Dirac matter fields. In this picture, two phenomena
occurring at different energy scales can be encompassed under the dynamics of
such a single scalar field, which represents the further torsional and
curvature degrees of freedom.
