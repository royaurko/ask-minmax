We introduce a version of logic for metric structures suitable for
applications to C*-algebras and tracial von Neumann algebras. We also prove a
purely model-theoretic result to the effect that the theory of a separable
metric structure is stable if and only if all of its ultrapowers associated
with nonprincipal ultrafilters on N are isomorphic even when the Continuum
Hypothesis fails.
