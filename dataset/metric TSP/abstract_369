We define and study certain hyperkaehler manifolds which capture the
asymptotic behaviour of the SU(2)-monopole metric in regions where monopoles
break down into monopoles of lower charges. The rate at which these new metrics
approximate the monopole metric is exponential, as for the Gibbons-Manton
metric.
