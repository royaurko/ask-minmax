Starting with Newton's law of universal gravitation, we generalize it
step-by-step to obtain Einstein's geometric theory of gravity. Newton's
gravitational potential satisfies the Poisson equation. We relate the potential
to a component of the metric tensor by equating the nonrelativistic result of
the principle of stationary proper time to the Lagrangian for a classical
gravitational field. In the Poisson equation the Laplacian of the component of
the metric tensor is generalized to a cyclic linear combination of the second
derivatives of the metric tensor. In local coordinates it is a single component
of the Ricci tensor. This component of the Ricci tensor is proportional to the
mass density that is related to a single component of the energy-momentum
stress tensor and its trace. We thus obtain a single component of Einstein's
gravitational field equation in local coordinates. From the principle of
general covariance applied to a single component, we obtain all tensor
components of Einstein's gravitational field equation.
