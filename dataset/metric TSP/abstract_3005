We study the space of positive scalar curvature (psc) metrics on a
4-manifold, and give examples of simply connected manifolds for which it is
disconnected. These examples imply that concordance of psc metrics does not
imply isotopy of such metrics. This is demonstrated using a modification of the
1-parameter Seiberg-Witten invariants which we introduced in earlier work. The
invariant shows that the diffeomorphism group of the underlying 4-manifold is
disconnected. We also study the moduli space of positive scalar curvature
metrics modulo diffeomorphism, and give examples to show that this space can be
disconnected. The (non-orientable) 4--manifolds in this case are explicitly
described, and the components in the moduli space are distinguished by a Pin^c
eta invariant.
