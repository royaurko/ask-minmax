For single input single output systems, we give a refinement of the
generalized chordal metric. Our metric is given in terms of coprime
factorizations, but it coincides with the extension of Vinnicombe's nu-metric
given in earlier work by Ball and Sasane if the coprime factorizations happens
to be normalized. The advantage of the metric introduced in this article is its
easy computability (since it relies only on coprime factorizations, and does
not require normalized coprime factorizations). We also give concrete
formulations of our abstract metric for standard classes of stable transfer
functions.
