We study the asymptotic behavior of piecewise constant least squares
regression estimates, when the number of partitions of the estimate is
penalized. We show that the estimator is consistent in the relevant metric if
the signal is in $L^2([0,1])$, the space of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions equipped
with the Skorokhod metric or $C([0,1])$ equipped with the supremum metric.
Moreover, we consider the family of estimates under a varying smoothing
parameter, also called scale space. We prove convergence of the empirical scale
space towards its deterministic target.
