We consider the Riemann moduli space $\mathcal M_{\gamma}$ of conformal
structures on a compact surface of genus $\gamma>1$ together with its
Weil-Petersson metric $g_{\mathrm{WP}}$. Our main result is that
$g_{\mathrm{WP}}$ admits a complete polyhomogeneous expansion in powers of the
lengths of the short geodesics up to the singular divisors of the
Deligne-Mumford compactification of $\mathcal M_{\gamma}$.
