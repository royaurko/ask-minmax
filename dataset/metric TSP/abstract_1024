Combining several previously known arguments, we prove marked length spectrum
rigidity for surfaces with nonpositively curved Riemannian metrics away from a
finite set of cone-type singularities with cone angles $>2\pi$. With an
additional condition, we can weaken the requirement on one metric to `no
conjugate points.'
