We consider axially symmetric static metrics in arbitrary dimension, both
with and without a cosmological constant. The most obvious such solutions have
an SO(n) group of Killing vectors representing the axial symmetry, although one
can also consider abelian groups which represent a flat `internal space'. We
relate such metrics to lower dimensional dilatonic cosmological metrics with a
Liouville potential. We also develop a duality relation between vacuum
solutions with internal curvature and those with zero internal curvature but a
cosmological constant. This duality relation gives a solution generating
technique permitting the mapping of different spacetimes. We give a large class
of solutions to the vacuum or cosmological constant spacetimes. We comment on
the extension of the C-metric to higher dimensions and provide a novel solution
for a braneworld black hole.
