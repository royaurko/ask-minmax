We analyze the moduli-space metric in the static non-Abelian charge-two
sector of the Moyal-deformed CP^1 sigma model in 1+2 dimensions. After
carefully reviewing the commutative results of Ward and Ruback, the
noncommutative K"ahler potential is expanded in powers of dimensionless moduli.
In two special cases we sum the perturbative series to analytic expressions.
For any nonzero value of the noncommutativity parameter, the logarithmic
singularity of the commutative metric is expelled from the origin of the moduli
space and possibly altogether.
