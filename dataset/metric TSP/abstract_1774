In this paper, isometric embedding results of Greene, Gromov and Rokhlin are
extended to what are called "indefinite metric polyhedra". Two definitions for
an indefinite metric polyhedron are given, an intuitive definition and a more
useful definition. The more useful definition is used to show that every
indefinite metric polyhedron (with the maximal degree of every vertex bounded
above) admits a simplicial isometric embedding into Minkowski space of an
appropriate signature. This result is then used to show that the two
definitions coincide. A simple example is given to show that the dimension
bounds in the compact case are essentially sharp. Finally it is shown that if
we relax our embedding conditions to be pl instead of simplicial, then the
necessary dimension bounds can be reduced to a surprisingly low signature.
