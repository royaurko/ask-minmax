We introduce a model for Hermitian holormorphic Deligne cohomology on a
projective algebraic manifold which allows to incorporate singular hermitian
structures along a normal crossing divisor. In the case of a projective curve,
the cup-product in cohomology is shown to correspond to a generalization of the
Deligne pairing to line bundles with "good" hermitian metrics in the sense of
Mumford and others. A particular case is that of the tangent bundle of the
curve twisted by the negative of the singularity divisor of a hyperbolic
metric: its cup square (corrected by the total area) is shown to be a
functional whose extrema are the metrics of constant negative curvature.
