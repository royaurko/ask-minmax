When we calculate gravitational waveforms from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals
(EMRIs) by metric perturbation, it is a common strategy to use the adiabatic
approximation. Under that approximation, we first calculate the linear metric
perturbation induced by geodesics orbiting a black hole, then we calculate the
adiabatic evolution of the parameters of geodesics due to the radiation
reaction effect through the calculation of the self-force. This procedure is
considered to be reasonable, however, there is no direct proof that it can
actually produce the correct waveform we would observe. In this paper, we study
the formal expression of the second order metric perturbation and show that it
be expressed as the linear metric perturbation modulated by the adiabatic
evolution of the geodesic. This evidence supports the assumption that the
adiabatic approximation can produce the correct waveform, and that the
adiabatic expansion we propose in Ref.\cite{adi} is an appropriate perturbation
expansion for studying the radiation reaction effect on the gravitational
waveform.
