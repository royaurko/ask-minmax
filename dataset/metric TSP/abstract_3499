Since its launch in April 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has produced
an increasing flow of scientific results. The large number of refereed
publications based on HST data allows a detailed evaluation of the
effectiveness of this observatory and of its scientific programs. This paper
presents the results of selected science metrics related to paper counts,
citation counts, citation history, high-impact papers, and the most productive
programs and most cited papers, through the end of 2003. All these indicators
point towards the high-quality scientific impact of HST.
