In this article, we present some fixed point theorems in partially ordered
G-metric space using the concept of $(\psi,\phi)$- weak contraction which
extend many existing fixed point theorems in such space. We also give some
examples to show that if we transform a metric space into a G-metric space our
results are not equivalent to the existing results in metric space.
