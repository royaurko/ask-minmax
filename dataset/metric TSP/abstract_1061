Recently K. Lee, E.J. Weinberg and P. Yi in CU-TP-739, hep-th/9602167,
calculated the asymptotic metric on the moduli space of (1, 1, ..., 1) BPS
monopoles and conjectured that it was globally exact. I lend support to this
conjecture by showing that the metric on the corresponding space of Nahm data
is the same as the metric they calculate.
