In this paper we focus on determining for which degenerations the central
fibre is at finite distance with respect to Weil-Petersson metric. We obtain a
simple condition on the limiting mixed Hodge structure. Then we combine the
result with the canonical mixed Hodge structure of the central fibre and obtain
a simple cohomological condition for the central fibre to be at finite
distance. As a corollary, we prove that a central fibre with simple nodes is at
finite distance. This issue has been raised in the Physics literature including
the recent development of so-called "mass-less black holes".
