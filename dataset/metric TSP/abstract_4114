This paper is devoted to explore the energy-momentum of non-static plane
symmetric spacetimes in the context of General Relativity and teleparallel
theory of gravity. For this purpose, we use four prescriptions, namely,
Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Bergmann-Thomson and M{\o}ller in both theories. It
is shown that the results for the first three prescriptions turn out to be same
in both the theories but different for last prescription. It is mentioning here
that our results coincide with the results obtained by Sharif and kanwal [1]
for Bell-Szekeres metric under certain choice of the metric functions.
