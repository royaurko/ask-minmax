We study the K-stability of a polarised variety with non-reductive
automorphism group. We associate a canonical filtration of the co-ordinate ring
to each variety of this kind, which destabilises the variety in several
examples which we compute. We conjecture this holds in general. This is an
algebro-geometric analogue of Matsushima's theorem regarding the existence of
constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. As an application, we give an
example of an orbifold del Pezzo surface without a K\"ahler-Einstein metric.
