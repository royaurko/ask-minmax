Braided Thompson's groups are finitely presented groups introduced by Brin
and Dehornoy which contain the ordinary braid groups $B_n$, the finitary braid
group $B_{\infty}$ and Thompson's group $F$ as subgroups. We describe some of
the metric properties of braided Thompson's groups and give upper and lower
bounds for word length in terms of the number of strands and the number of
crossings in the diagrams used to represent elements.
