A Riemannian metric on a manifold M induces a family of Riemannian metrics on
the loop space LM depending on a Sobolev space parameter s. We compute the
connection forms of these metrics and the higher symbols of their curvature
forms, which take values in pseudodifferential operators. These calculations
are used in a followup paper "The Geometry of Loop Spaces II: Characteristic
Classes" to construct Chern-Simons classes on the tangent bundle TLM which
detect nontrivial elements in the diffeomorphism group of certain Sasakian
5-manifolds associated to Kaehler surfaces.
