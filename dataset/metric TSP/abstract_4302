In the eikonal approach, we describe sound propagation near to topological
defects of nematic liquid crystal as geodesics of a non-euclidian manifold
endowed with an effective metric tensor. The relation between the acoustics of
the medium and this geometrical description is given by Fermat's principle. We
calculate the ray trajectories and propose a diffraction experiment to retrieve
informations about the elastic constants.
