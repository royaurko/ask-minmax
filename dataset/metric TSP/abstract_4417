We introduce and investigate in this short report the new notion of uniform
measure (distribution) on the arbitrary compact metric space. We consider also
some possible applications of these measures in the theory of imbedding
theorems and in the theory of random processes (fields), in particular, in the
so-called majorizing (and minorizing) measures method, belonging to X.Fernique
and M.Talagrand. These considerations based on the L.Arnold and P.Imkeller
generalization of the classical A.M.Garsia-E.Rodemich-H.Jr.Rumsey inequality
and X.Fernique-M.Talagrand estimation for random fields.
