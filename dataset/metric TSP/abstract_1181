The smallest $r$ so that a metric $r$-ball covers a metric space $M$ is
called the radius of $M$. The volume of a metric $r$-ball in the space form of
constant curvature $k$ is an upper bound for the volume of any Riemannian
manifold with sectional curvature $\geq k$ and radius $\leq r$. We show that
when such a manifold has volume almost equal to this upper bound, it is
diffeomorphic to a sphere or a real projective space.
