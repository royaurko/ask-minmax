The geometry of thermodynamic state space is studied for asymptotically
anti-de Sitter black holes in D-dimensional space times. Convexity of
thermodynamic potentials and the analytic structure of the response functions
is analysed. The thermodynamic potentials can be used to define a metric on the
space of thermodynamic variables and two commonly used such metrics are the
Weinhold metric, derived from the internal energy, and the Ruppeiner metric,
derived from the entropy. The intrinsic curvature of these metrics is
calculated for charged and for rotating black holes and it is shown that the
curvature diverges when heat capacities diverge but, contrary to general
expectations, the singularities in the Ricci scalars do not reflect the
critical behaviour.
  When a cosmological constant is included as a state space variable it can be
interpreted as a pressure and the thermodynamically conjugate variable as a
thermodynamic volume. The geometry of the resulting extended thermodynamic
state space is also studied, in the context of rotating black holes, and there
are curvature singularities when the heat capacity at constant angular velocity
diverges and when the black hole is incompressible. Again the critical
behaviour is not visible in the singularities of the thermodynamic Ricci
scalar.
