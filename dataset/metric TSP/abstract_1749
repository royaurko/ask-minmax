We produce open subsets of the moduli space of metric graphs without
separating edges where the dimensions of Brill-Noether loci are larger than the
corresponding Brill-Noether numbers. These graphs also have minimal rank
determining sets that are larger than expected, giving couterexamples to a
conjecture of Luo. Furthermore, limits of these graphs have Brill-Noether loci
of the expected dimension, so dimensions of Brill-Noether loci of metric graphs
do not vary upper semicontinuously in families. Motivated by these examples, we
study a notion of rank for the Brill-Noether locus of a metric graph, closely
analogous to the Baker-Norine definition of the rank of a divisor. We show that
ranks of Brill-Noether loci vary upper semicontinuously in families of metric
graphs and are related to dimensions of Brill-Noether loci of algebraic curves
by a specialization inequality.
