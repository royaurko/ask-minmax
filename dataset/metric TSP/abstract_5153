We relax a simplification of Axelrod's (1997) model of cultural dissemination
that has not yet been studied, the assumption that all cultural states are
nominal. We integrate metric states into the original model. Computational
experiments demonstrate that metric states undermine cultural diversity, even
without noise, by creating sufficient overlap between agents for mutual
influence. We then show how adding "bounded confidence" - a recent innovation
in models of social influence - allows cultural diversity to persist. However,
further experiments reveal that the solution is fragile. Diversity can be
sustained only with a relatively small number of metric states, low levels of
noise or narrow confidence intervals.
