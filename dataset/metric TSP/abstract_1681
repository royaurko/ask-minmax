The group SU(2)*SU(2) acts naturally on SL(2,C) by simultaneous right and
left multiplication. We study the Kahler metrics invariant under this action
using global Kahler potentials. The volume growth and various curvature
quantities are then explicitly computable. Examples include metrics of
positive, negative and zero Ricci curvature, and the 1-lump metric of the
CP^1-model on a sphere.
  We then look at the holomorphic quantization of these metrics, where some
physically satisfactory results on the dimension of the Hilbert space can be
obtained. These give rise to an interesting geometrical conjecture, regarding
the dimension of this space for general Stein manifolds in the semi-classical
limit.
