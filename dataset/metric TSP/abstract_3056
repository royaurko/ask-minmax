We show that every inner metric space X is the metric quotient of a complete
R-tree via a free isometric action, which we call the covering R-tree of X. The
quotient mapping is a weak submetry (hence, open) and light. In the case of
compact 1-dimensional geodesic space X, the free isometric action is via a
subgroup of the fundamental group of X. In particular, the Sierpin'ski gasket
and carpet, and the Menger sponge all have the same covering R-tree, which is
complete and has at each point valency equal to the continuum. This latter
R-tree is of particular interest because it is "universal" in at least two
senses: First, every R-tree of valency at most the continuum can be
isometrically embedded in it. Second, every Peano continuum is the image of it
via an open light mapping. We provide a sketch of our previous construction of
the uniform universal cover in the special case of inner metric spaces, the
properties of which are used in the proof.
