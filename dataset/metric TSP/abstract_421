Recently, a new embedding/compactness theorem for integral currents in a
sequence of metric spaces has been established by the second contributor. We present
a version of this result for locally integral currents in a sequence of pointed
metric spaces. To this end we introduce another variant of the
Ambrosio--Kirchheim theory of currents in metric spaces, including currents
with finite mass in bounded sets.
