Airspace sectorisation provides a partition of a given airspace into sectors,
subject to geometric constraints and workload constraints, so that some cost
metric is minimised. We survey the algorithmic aspects of methods for automatic
airspace sectorisation, for an intended readership of experts on air traffic
management.
