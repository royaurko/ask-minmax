In this paper, we first discussed multiplicative metric mapping by giving
some topological properties of the relevant multiplicative metric space. As an
interesting result of our discussions, we observed that the set of positive
real numbers $\mathbb{R}_+$ is a complete multiplicative metric space with
respect to the multiplicative absolute value function. Furthermore, we
introduced concept of multiplicative contraction mapping and proved some fixed
point theorems of such mappings on complete multiplicative metric spaces
