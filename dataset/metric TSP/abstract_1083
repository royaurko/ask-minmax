There are several characterizations of coarse embeddability of a discrete
metric space into a Hilbert space. In this note we give such characterizations
for general metric spaces. By applying these results to the spaces $L_p(\mu)$,
we get their coarse embeddability into a Hilbert space for $0<p<2$. This
together with a theorem by Banach and Mazur yields that coarse embeddability
into $\ell_2$ and into $L_p(0,1)$ are equivalent when $1 \le p<2$. A theorem by
G.Yu and the above allow to extend to $L_p(\mu)$, $0<p<2$, the range of spaces,
coarse embedding into which guarantees for a finitely generated group $\Gamma$
to satisfy the Novikov Conjecture.
