We construct and solve the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) of quark propagator
with a parameterized metric, which connects the Euclidean metric with the
Minkowskian one. We show, in some models, the Minkowskian vacuum is different
from the Euclidean vacuum. The usual analytic continuation of Green function
does not make sense in these cases. While with the algorithm we proposed and
the quark-gluon vertex ansatz which preserves the Ward-Takahashi identity, the
vacuum keeps being unchanged in the evolution of the metric. In this case,
analytic continuation becomes meaningful and can be fully carried out.
