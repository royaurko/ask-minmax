We discuss the limits of validity of the semiclassical theory of gravity in
which a classical metric is coupled to the expectation value of the stress
tensor. It is argued that this theory is a good approximation only when the
fluctuations in the stress tensor are small. We calculate a dimensionless
measure of these fluctuations for a scalar field on a flat background in
particular cases, including squeezed states and the Casimir vacuum state. It is
found that the fluctuations are small for states which are close to a coherent
state, which describes classical behavior, but tend to be large otherwise. We
find in all cases studied that the energy density fluctuations are large
whenever the local energy density is negative. This is taken to mean that the
gravitational field of a system with negative energy density, such as the
Casimir vacuum, is not described by a fixed classical metric but is undergoing
large metric fluctuations. We propose an operational scheme by which one can
describe a fluctuating gravitational field in terms of the statistical behavior
of test particles. For this purpose we obtain an equation of the form of the
Langevin equation used to describe Brownian motion.
