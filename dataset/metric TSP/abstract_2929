A Bianchi type -I metric of Kasner form is considered, when the space is
filled with a viscous fluid. Whereas an ideal (nonviscous) fluid permits the
Kasner metric to be anisotropic provided that the fluid satisfies the
Zel'dovich equation of state, the viscous fluid does not permit the Kasner
metric to be anisotropic at all. In the latter case, we calculate the Kasner
(isotropic) metric expressed by the fluid's density, pressure, and bulk
viscosity, at some chosen instant $t=t_0$. The equation of state is also
calculated. The present paper is related to a recent Comment of Cataldo and del
Campo [Phys. Rev. D, scheduled to April 15, 2000], on a previous work of the
present contributors [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 56}, 3322 (1997)].
