In this note we consider the Schr\"odinger equation on compact manifolds
equipped with possibly degenerate metrics. We prove Strichartz estimates with a
loss of derivatives. The rate of loss of derivatives depends on the degeneracy
of metrics. For the non-degenerate case we obtain, as an application of the
main result, the same Strichartz estimates as that in the elliptic case. This
extends Strichartz estimates for Riemannian metrics proved by
Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov to the non-elliptic case and improves the result by
Salort. We also investigate the optimality of the result for the case on
$\mathbb{S}^3\times \mathbb{S}^3$.
