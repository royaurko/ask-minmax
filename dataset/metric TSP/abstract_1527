Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold and $\a \in H^{1,1}(X,\R)$ a K\"ahler
class. We study the metric completion of the space $\HH_\a$ of K\"ahler metrics
in $\a$, when endowed with the Mabuchi $L^2$-metric $d$.
  Using recent ideas of Darvas, we show that the metric completion
$(\overline{\HH}_\a,d)$ of $(\HH_\a,d)$ is a CAT(0) space which can be
identified with $\E^2(\a)$, a subset of the class $\E^1(\a)$ of positive closed
currents with finite energy.
  We further prove, in the toric setting, that
$\overline{\HH}_{\a,tor}=\E_{tor}^2(\a)$.
