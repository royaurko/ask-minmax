The collection of all projective vector fields on a Finsler space $(M, F)$ is
a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with respect to the usual Lie bracket, called
the projective algebra denoted by $p(M,F)$ and is the Lie algebra of the
projective group $P(M,F)$. The projective algebra $p(M,F=\alpha+\beta)$ of a
Randers space is characterized as a certain Lie subalgebra of the projective
algebra $p(M,\alpha)$. Certain subgroups of the projective group $P(M,F)$ and
their invariants are studied. The projective algebra of Randers metrics of
constant flag curvature is studied and it is proved that the dimension of the
projective algebra of Randers metrics constant flag curvature on a compact
$n$-manifold either equals $n(n+2)$ or at most is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
