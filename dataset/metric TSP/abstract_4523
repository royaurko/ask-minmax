We prove that for certain subsets $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$, $N \geqslant
1$, the Lipschitz-free space $\mathcal{F}(M)$ has the metric approximation
property (MAP), with respect to any norm on $\mathbb{R}^N$. In particular,
$\mathcal{F}(M)$ has the MAP whenever $M$ is a finite-dimensional compact
convex set. This should be compared with a recent result of Godefroy and Ozawa,
who showed that there exists a compact convex subset $M$ of a separable Banach
space, for which $\mathcal{F}(M)$ fails the approximation property.
