We prove local Lipschitz property of the map which puts in correspondence to
each $N$--net different from $(N-1)$--net its Chebyshev center. If dimension of
Eucledean or Lobachevskii space is greater than 1 and net consists of more than
2 points we show that this map is not Lipschits in a neighbourhood of the space
of 2--nets embedded into the space of all $N$--nets endowed by Hausdorff
metric.
