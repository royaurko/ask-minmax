The space of all non degenerate bilinear structures on a manifold $M$
carries a one parameter family of pseudo Riemannian metrics. We determine the
geodesic equation, covariant derivative, curvature, and we solve the geodesic
equation explicitly. Each space of pseudo Riemannian metrics with fixed
signature is a geodesically closed submanifold. The space of non degenerate
2-forms is also a geodesically closed submanifold. Then we show that, if we
fix a distribution on $M$, the space of all Riemannia metrics splits as the
product of three spaces which are everywhere mutually orthogonal, for the
usual metric. We investigate this situation in detail.
