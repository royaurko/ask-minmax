The sound mode hydrodynamic dispersion relation is computed up to order $q^3$
for a class of gravitational duals which includes both Schwarzschild $AdS$ and
Dp-Brane metrics. The implications for second order transport coefficients are
examined within the context of Israel-Stewart theory. These sound mode results
are compared with previously known results for the shear mode. This comparison
allows one to determine the third order hydrodynamic contributions to the shear
mode for the class of metrics considered here.
