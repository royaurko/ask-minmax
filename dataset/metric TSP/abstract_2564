We consider a scalar field interacting with a quantized metric varying on a
submanifold (e.g. a scalar field interacting with a quantized gravitational
wave). We explicitly sum up the perturbation series for the time-ordered vacuum
expectation values of the scalar field. As a result we obtain a modified
non-canonical short distance behavior.
