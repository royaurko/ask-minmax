We introduce and study the operation, called dense amalgam, which to any
tuple X_1,...,X_k of non-empty compact metric spaces associates some
disconnected perfect compact metric space, denoted
$\widetilde\sqcup(X_1,...,X_k)$, in which there are many appropriately
distributed copies of the spaces X_1,...,X_k. We then show that, in various
settings, the ideal boundary of the free product of groups is homeomorphic to
the dense amalgam of boundaries of the factors. We give also related more
general results for graphs of groups with finite edge groups. We justify these
results by referring to a convenient characterization of dense amalgams, in
terms of a list of properties, which we also provide in the paper. As another
application, we show that the boundary of a Coxeter group which has infinitely
many ends, and which is not virtually free, is the dense amalgam of the
boundaries of its maximal 1-ended special subgroups.
