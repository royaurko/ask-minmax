Motivated by conformal field theory studies we investigate Quantum Einstein
Gravity with a new field parametrization where the dynamical metric is
basically given by the exponential of a matrix-valued fluctuating field,
$g_{\mu\nu}=\bar{g}_{\mu\rho}(e^h)^\rho_{\nu}$. In this way, we aim to
reproduce the critical value of the central charge when considering
$2+\epsilon$ dimensional spacetimes. With regard to the Asymptotic Safety
program, we take special care of possible fixed points and new structures of
the corresponding RG flow in $d=4$ for both single- and bi-metric truncations.
Finally, we discuss the issue of restoring background independence in the
bi-metric setting.
