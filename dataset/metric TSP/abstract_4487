In this paper we prove, as conjectured by B.Banachewski and C.J.Mulvey, that
the constructive Gelfand duality can be extended into a duality between compact
regular locales and unital abelian localic C*-algebras. In order to do so we
develop a constructive theory of localic metric spaces and localic Banach
spaces, we study the notion of localic completion of such objects and the
behaviour of these constructions with respect to pull-back along geometric
morphisms.
