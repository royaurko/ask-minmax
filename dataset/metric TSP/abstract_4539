We present a class of exact solutions of Einstein field equations for a
shear-free spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid undergoing radial heat flow.
The interior metric fulfilled all the relevant physical and thermodynamic
conditions and matched with Vaidya exterior metric over the boundary. Initially
the interior solutions represent a static configuration of dissipative fluid
which then gradually starts evolving into radiating collapse. The apparent
luminosity observed by the distant observer at rest at infinity and the
effective surface temperature are zero in remote past at the instance when
collapse begins and at the stage when collapsing configuration reach the
horizon of the black hole.
