We present short proofs of all known topological properties of general
Busemann $G$-spaces (at present no other property is known for dimensions more
than four). We prove that all small metric spheres in locally $G$-homogeneous
Busemann $G$-spaces are homeomorphic and strongly topologically homogeneous.
This is a key result in the context of the classical Busemann conjecture
concerning the characterization of topological manifolds, which asserts that
every $n$-dimensional Busemann $G$-space is a topological $n$-manifold. We also
prove that every Busemann $G$-space which is uniformly locally $G$-homogeneous
on an orbal subset must be finite-dimensional.
