Most of parameters used to describe states and dynamics of financial market
depend on proportions of the appropriate variables rather than on their actual
values. Therefore, projective geometry seems to be the correct language to
describe the theater of financial activities. We suppose that the object of
interest of agents, called here baskets, form a vector space over the reals. A
portfolio is defined as an equivalence class of baskets containing assets in
the same proportions. Therefore portfolios form a projective space. Cross
ratios, being invariants of projective maps, form key structures in the
proposed model. Quotation with respect to an asset X (i.e. in units of X) are
given by linear maps. Among various types of metrics that have financial
interpretation, the min-max metrics on the space of quotations can be
introduced. This metrics has an interesting interpretation in terms of rates of
return. It can be generalized so that to incorporate a new numerical parameter
(called temperature) that describes agent's lack of knowledge about the state
of the market. In a dual way, a metrics on the space of market quotation is
defined. In addition, one can define an interesting metric structure on the
space of portfolios/quotation that is invariant with respect to hyperbolic
(Lorentz) symmetries of the space of portfolios. The introduced formalism opens
new interesting and possibly fruitful fields of research.
