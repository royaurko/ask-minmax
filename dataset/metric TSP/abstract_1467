We formulate an approach to the geometry of Riemann-Cartan spaces provided
with nonholonomic distributions defined by generic off-diagonal and
nonsymmetric metrics inducing effective nonlinear and affine connections. Such
geometries can be modelled by moving nonholonomic frames on (pseudo) Riemannian
manifolds and describe various types of nonholonomic Einstein, Eisenhart-Moffat
and Finsler-Lagrange spaces with connections compatible to a general
nonsymmetric metric structure. Elaborating a metrization procedure for
arbitrary distinguished connections, we define the class of distinguished
linear connections which are compatible with the nonlinear connection and
general nonsymmetric metric structures. The nonsymmetric gravity theory is
formulated in terms of metric compatible connections. Finally, there are
constructed such nonholonomic deformations of geometric structures when the
Einstein and/or Lagrange-Finsler manifolds are transformed equivalently into
spaces with generic local anisotropy induced by nonsymmetric metrics and
generalized connections. We speculate on possible applications of such
geometric methods in Einstein and generalized theories of gravity, analogous
gravity and geometric mechanics.
