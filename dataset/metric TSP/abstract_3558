Global harmonic coordinates for the complete Schwarzschild metric are found
for a more general case than that addressed in a previous work by Quan-Hui Liu.
The supplementary constant that appears, in addition to the mass, is related to
the stress quadrupole moment of a singular energy--momentum tensor. Similar
calculations are also carried out in q--harmonic coordinates.
