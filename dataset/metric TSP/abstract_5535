Starting from the ACV approach to transplanckian scattering, we present a
development of the reduced-action model in which the (improved) eikonal
representation is able to describe particles' motion at large scattering angle
and, furthermore, UV-safe (regular) rescattering solutions are found and
incorporated in the metric. The resulting particles' shock-waves undergo
calculable trajectory shifts and time delays during the scattering process ---
which turns out to be consistently described by both action and metric, up to
relative order $R^2/b^2$ in the gravitational radius over impact parameter
expansion. Some suggestions about the role and the (re)scattering properties of
irregular solutions --- not fully investigated here --- are also presented.
