A metric vector space is asymptotically metrically normable (AMN) if there
exists a norm asymptotically isometric to the distance. We prove that AMN
vector spaces are rigid in the class of metric vector spaces under
asymptotically isometric perturbations. This result follows from a general
metric normability criterium.
 If the distance is translation invariant and satisfies an approximate
multiplicative condition then there exists a lipschitz equivalent norm.
Furthermore, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the distance to be
asymptotically isometric to the norm.
