This paper is devoted to find the Locally Rotationally Symmetric (LRS) vacuum
solutions in the context of f(R) theory of gravity. Actually, we have
considered the three metrics representing the whole family of LRS spacetimes
and solved the field equations by using metric approach as well as the
assumption of constant scalar curvature. It is mention here that R may be zero
or non-zero. In all we found 10 different solutions.
