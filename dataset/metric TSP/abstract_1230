For interactions to be possible within the Service Oriented Architecture
(SOA) ecosystem, each actor must be enough confident of other actors to engage
safely in the interactions. Therefore, the establishing of objective metrics
tailored to the context of SOA that show security of a system and lead to
enhancements is very attractive. The purpose of our paper is to present a GQM
(Goal Question Metric) approach based on Standard security metrics and on SOA
maturity that can be a support for organizations to assess SOA Security and to
ensure the safety of their SOA based collaborations
