We present a new 3D general relativistic hydrodynamics code for simulations
of stellar core collapse to a neutron star, as well as pulsations and
instabilities of rotating relativistic stars. It uses spectral methods for
solving the metric equations, assuming the conformal flatness approximation for
the three-metric. The matter equations are solved by high-resolution
shock-capturing schemes. We demonstrate that the combination of a finite
difference grid and a spectral grid can be successfully accomplished. This
"Mariage des Maillages" (French for grid wedding) approach results in high
accuracy of the metric solver and allows for fully 3D applications using
computationally affordable resources, and ensures long term numerical stability
of the evolution. We compare our new approach to two other, finite difference
based, methods to solve the metric equations. A variety of tests in 2D and 3D
is presented, involving highly perturbed neutron star spacetimes and
(axisymmetric) stellar core collapse, demonstrating the ability to handle
spacetimes with and without symmetries in strong gravity. These tests are also
employed to assess gravitational waveform extraction, which is based on the
quadrupole formula.
