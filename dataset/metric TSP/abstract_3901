In this short communication, we observe that the Graphical Traveling Salesman
Polyhedron is the intersection of the positive orthant with the Minkowski sum
of the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Polytope and the polar of the metric cone.
This follows almost trivially from known facts. There are two reasons why we
find this observation worth communicating none-the-less: It is very surprising;
it helps to understand the relationship between these two important families of
polyhedra.
