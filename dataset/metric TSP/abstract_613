In this review, we collect several results for conformally standard
stationary spacetimes (SxR,g) obtained in terms of a Finsler metric of Randers
type on the orbit manifold S that we call Fermat metric. This metric is
obtained by applying the relativistic Fermat principle and it turns out that it
encodes all the causal aspects of the spacetime.
