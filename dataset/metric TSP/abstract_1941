An exact solution has an axial symmetry is obtained in the teleparallel
theory of gravitation. The associated metric has the structure function
G(xi)=1-xi^2-2mA(xi)^3. The cubic nature of the structure function can make
calculations cumbersome. Using a coordinate transformation we get a tetrad that
its associated metric has the structure function in a factorisable form. This
new form has the advantage that its roots are now trivial to write down. The
singularities of the obtained tetrad are studied. Using another coordinate
transformation we get a tetrad that its associated metric gives the
Schwarzschild spacetime. Calculate the energy content of this tetrad we get a
meaningless result!
