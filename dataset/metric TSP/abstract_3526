We present the conditions when a Killing-Yano tensor becomes a Nambu tensor.
We have shown that in the flat space case all Killing-Yano tensors are Nambu
tensors.
 In the case of Taub-NUT metric and Kerr-Newmann metric we found that a
Killing-Yano tensor of order two generate a Nambu tensor of order three.
