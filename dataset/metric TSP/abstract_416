An abstract chordal metric is defined on linear control systems described by
their transfer functions. Analogous to a previous result due to Jonathan
Partington ("Robust control and approximation in the chordal metric", in Robust
Control, LNCIS 183, Springer, 1992) for H^infty, it is shown that strong
stabilizability is a robust property in this metric.
