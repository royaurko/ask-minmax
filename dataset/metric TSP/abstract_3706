We study an extension of the gravity dual to a perfect fluid model found by
Janik and Peschanski. By relaxing one of the constraints, namely invariance
under reflection in the longitudinal direction, we introduce a metric ansatz
which includes off-diagonal terms. We also include an $R$-charge following Bak
and Janik. We solve the Maxwell-Einstein equations and through holographic
renormalization, we show that the off-diagonal components of the bulk metric
give rise to heat conduction in the corresponding CFT on the boundary.
