We study non-degenerate (Petrov type I) silent universes in the presence of a
non-vanishing cosmological constant L. In contrast to the L=0 case, for which
the orthogonally spatially homogeneous Bianchi type I metrics most likely are
the only admissible metrics, solutions are shown to exist when L is positive.
The general solution is presented for the case where one of the eigenvalues of
the expansion tensor is 0.
