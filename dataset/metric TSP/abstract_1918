The conformal Killing equations for the most general (non-plane wave)
conformally flat pure radiation field are solved to find the conformal Killing
vectors. As expected fifteen independent conformal Killing vectors exist, but
in general the metric admits no Killing or homothetic vectors. However for
certain special cases a one-dimensional group of homotheties or motions may
exist and in one very special case, overlooked by previous investigators, a
two-dimensional homethety group exists. No higher dimensional groups of motions
or homotheties are admitted by these metrics.
