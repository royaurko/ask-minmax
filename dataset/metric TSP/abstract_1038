Once the action for Einstein's equations is rewritten as a functional of an
SO(3,C) connection and a conformal factor of the metric, it admits a family of
``neighbours'' having the same number of degrees of freedom and a precisely
defined metric tensor. This paper analyzes the relation between the Riemann
tensor of that metric and the curvature tensor of the SO(3) connection. The
relation is in general very complicated. The Einstein case is distinguished by
the fact that two natural SO(3) metrics on the GL(3) fibers coincide. In the
general case the theory is bimetric on the fibers.
