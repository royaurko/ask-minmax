For a contravariant 4-metric which changes signature from Lorentzian to
Riemannian across a spatial hypersurface, the mixed Einstein tensor is
manifestly non-singular. In Gaussian normal coordinates, the metric contains a
step function and the Einstein tensor contains the Dirac delta function with
support at the junction. The coefficient of the Dirac function is a linear
combination of the second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature) of the
junction. Thus, unless the junction has vanishing extrinsic curvature, the
physical interpretation of the metric is that it describes a layer of matter
(with stresses but no energy or momentum) at the junction. In particular, such
metrics do not satisfy the vacuum Einstein equations, nor the
Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations and so on. Similarly, the d'Alembertian of a
Klein-Gordon field contains the Dirac function with coefficient given by the
momentum of the field. Thus, if the momentum of the field does not vanish at
the junction, the physical interpretation is that there is a source (with step
potential) at the junction. In particular, such fields do not satisfy the
massless Klein-Gordon equation. These facts contradict claims in the
literature.
