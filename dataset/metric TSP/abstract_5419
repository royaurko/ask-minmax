We examine some differential geometric approaches to finding approximate
solutions to the continuous time nonlinear filtering problem. Our primary focus
is a new projection method for the optimal filter infinite dimensional
Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE), based on the direct L2 metric
and on a family of normal mixtures. We compare this method to earlier
projection methods based on the Hellinger distance/Fisher metric and
exponential families, and we compare the L2 mixture projection filter with a
particle method with the same number of parameters, using the Levy metric. We
prove that for a simple choice of the mixture manifold the L2 mixture
projection filter coincides with a Galerkin method, whereas for more general
mixture manifolds the equivalence does not hold and the L2 mixture filter is
more general. We study particular systems that may illustrate the advantages of
this new filter over other algorithms when comparing outputs with the optimal
filter. We finally consider a specific software design that is suited for a
numerically efficient implementation of this filter and provide numerical
examples.
