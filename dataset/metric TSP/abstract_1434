A new infinite series of Einstein metrics is constructed explicitly on S^2 x
S^3, and the non-trivial S^3-bundle over S^2, containing infinite numbers of
inhomogeneous ones. They appear as a certain limit of a nearly extreme
5-dimensional AdS Kerr black hole. In the special case, the metrics reduce to
the homogeneous Einstein metrics studied by Wang and Ziller. We also construct
an inhomogeneous Einstein metric on the non-trivial S^{d-2}-bundle over S^2
from a d-dimensional AdS Kerr black hole. Our construction is a higher
dimensional version of the method of Page, which gave an inhomogeneous Einstein
metric on CP^2\sharp\bar{CP^2}.
