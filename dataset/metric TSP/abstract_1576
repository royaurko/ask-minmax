We derive some necessary conditions on a Riemannian metric $(M, g)$ in four
dimensions for it to be locally conformal to K\"ahler. If the conformal
curvature is non anti--self--dual, the self--dual Weyl spinor must be of
algebraic type $D$ and satisfy a simple first order conformally invariant
condition which is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a K\"ahler
metric in the conformal class. In the anti--self--dual case we establish a one
to one correspondence between K\"ahler metrics in the conformal class and
non--zero parallel sections of a certain connection on a natural rank ten
vector bundle over $M$. We use this characterisation to provide examples of ASD
metrics which are not conformal to K\"ahler. We establish a link between the
`conformal to K\"ahler condition' in dimension four and the metrisability of
projective structures in dimension two. A projective structure on a surface $U$
is metrisable if and only if the induced (2, 2) conformal structure on $M=TU$
admits a K\"ahler metric or a para-K\"ahler metric.
