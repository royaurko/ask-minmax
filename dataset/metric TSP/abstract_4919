The aim of this paper is to propose a geometric framework for modelling
similarity search in large and multidimensional data spaces of general nature,
which seems to be flexible enough to address such issues as analysis of
complexity, indexability, and the `curse of dimensionality.' Such a framework
is provided by the concept of the so-called similarity workload, which is a
probability metric space $\Omega$ (query domain) with a distinguished finite
subspace $X$ (dataset), together with an assembly of concepts, techniques, and
results from metric geometry. They include such notions as metric transform,
$\e$-entropy, and the phenomenon of concentration of measure on
high-dimensional structures. In particular, we discuss the relevance of the
latter to understanding the curse of dimensionality. As some of those concepts
and techniques are being currently reinvented by the database community, it
seems desirable to try and bridge the gap between database research and the
relevant work already done in geometry and analysis.
