In this paper, we investigate critical points of the Laplacian's eigenvalues
considered as functionals on the space of Riemmannian metrics or a conformal
class of metrics on a compact manifold. We obtain necessary and sufficient
conditions for a metric to be a critical point of such a functional. We derive
specific consequences concerning possible locally maximizing metrics. We also
characterize critical metrics of the ratio of two consecutive eigenvalues.
