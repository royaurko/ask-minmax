The ring operations and the metric on $C(X)$ are extended to the set
$\mathbb{H}_{nf}(X)$ of all nearly finite Hausdorff continuous interval valued
functions and it is shown that $\mathbb{H}_{nf}(X)$ is both rationally and
topologically complete. Hence, the rings of quotients of $C(X)$ as well as
their metric completions are represented as rings of Hausdorff continuous
functions.
