The Hamiltonian formalism of bigravity and massive gravity is studied here
for the general form of the interaction potential of two metrics. In the
theories equipped with two spacetime metrics it is natural to use the Kuchar
approach, because then the role played by the lapse and shift variables becomes
more transparent. We find conditions on the potential which are necessary and
sufficient for the existence of four first class constraints. The algebra of
constraints is calculated in Dirac brackets formed on the base of all the
second class constraints. It is the celebrated algebra of hypersurface
deformations. By fixing one metric we obtain a massive gravity theory free of
first class constraints. Then we can use symmetries of the background metric to
derive conserved quantities. These are ultralocal, if expressed in terms of the
metric interaction potential. The special case of potential providing less
number of degrees of freedom is treated in the companion paper.
