In this paper, we evaluate energy and momentum density distributions for the
Weyl metric by using the well-known prescriptions of Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz,
Papaterou and M$\ddot{o}$ller. The metric under consideration is the static
axisymmetric vacuum solution to the Einstein field equations and one of the
field equations represents the Laplace equation. Curzon metric is the special
case of this spacetime. We find that the energy density is different for each
prescription. However, momentum turns out to be constant in each case.
