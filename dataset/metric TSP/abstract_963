The aim of this paper is to relate Thurston's metric on Teichm\"uller space
to several ideas initiated by T. Sorvali on isomorphisms between Fuchsian
groups. In particular, this will give a new formula for Thurston's asymmetric
metric for surfaces with punctures. We also update some results of Sorvali on
boundary isomorphisms of Fuchsian groups.
