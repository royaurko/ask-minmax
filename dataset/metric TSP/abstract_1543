We generalize the notion of Zermelo navigation to arbitrary pseudo-Finsler
metrics possibly defined in conic subsets. The translation of a pseudo-Finsler
metric $F$ is a new pseudo-Finsler metric whose indicatrix is the translation
of the indicatrix of $F$ by a vector field $W$ at each point, where $W$ is an
arbitrary vector field. Then we show that the Matsumoto tensor of a
pseudo-Finsler metric is equal to zero if and only if it is the translation of
a semi-Riemannian metric, and when $W$ is homothetic, the flag curvature of the
translation coincides with the one of the original one up to the addition of a
non-positive constant. In this case, we also give a description of the geodesic
flow of the translation.
