We give a Finsler non-linear connection by a new simplified definition for
not only regular case but also singular case. In regular case, it corresponds
to non-linear connection part of Berwald's connection, but our connection is
expressed not in line element space but in point-Finsler space. In this view we
recognize Finsler metric L(x,dx) as a non-linear form, which is a natural
generalisation of Riemannian metric having original expression,
\sqrt{g_{ab}(x)dx^a dx^b}. Furthermore our formulae provide easier calculation
rather than conventional treatments, so we think that they suits to application
to physics. Our definition can be used in the singular case of Finsler metric,
which correspond to gauged constraint systems in mechanics. Here we give some
non trivial examples of constraint systems for exposition of validity of our
connection.
