We consider polyhedral cones, associated with quasi-semi-metrics (oriented
distances), in particular, with oriented multi-cuts, on n points. We computed
the number of facets and of extreme rays, their adjacencies, and incidences of
the cones QMET_n and OMCUT_n for n=3, 4, 5 (see Table 1) and, partially for
n=6. Some results for general n are also given
