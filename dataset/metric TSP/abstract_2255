Were studied classical oscillations of background metric in the
multidimensional anisotropic model of Kazner in the de-Sitter stage. Obtained
dependence of fluctuations on dimension of space-time with infinite expansion.
Stability of the model could be achieved when number of space-like dimensions
equals or more then four. Were calculated contributions to the density of
"vacuum energy", that are providing by proper oscillations of background metric
and compared with contribution of cosmological arising of particles due to
expansion. As it turned out, contribution of gravitational oscillation of
metric into density of "vacuum energy" should play significant role in the
de-Sitter stage.
