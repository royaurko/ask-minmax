Secure orchestration is an important concern in the internet of service. Next
to providing the required functionality the composite services must also
provide a reasonable level of security in order to protect sensitive data.
Thus, the orchestrator has a need to check whether the complex service is able
to satisfy certain properties. Some properties are expressed with metrics for
precise definition of requirements. Thus, the problem is to analyse the values
of metrics for a complex business process.
  In this paper we extend our previous work on analysis of secure orchestration
with quantifiable properties. We show how to define, verify and enforce
quantitative security requirements in one framework with other security
properties. The proposed approach should help to select the most suitable
service architecture and guarantee fulfilment of the declared security
requirements.
