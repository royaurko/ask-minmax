We study notions of independence appropriate for a stability theory of metric
abstract elementary classes (for short, MAECs). We build on previous notions
used in the discrete case, and adapt definitions to the metric case. In
particular, we study notions that behave well under superstability-like
assumptions. Also, under uniqueness of limit models, we study domination,
orthogonality and parallelism of Galois types in MAECs.
