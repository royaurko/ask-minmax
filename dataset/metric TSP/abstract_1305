An analogue of the Hofer metric $\varrho_H$ on the Hamiltonian group
$Ham(M,\Lambda)$ of a Poisson manifold $(M,\Lambda)$ can be defined but there
is the problem of its non-degeneracy. First we observe that $\varrho_H$ is a
genuine metric on $Ham(M,\Lambda)$ when the union of all closed leaves (as
subsets of $M$) of the corresponding symplectic foliation is dense. Next we
deal with the important class of integrable Poisson manifolds. Recall that a
Poisson manifold is called integrable if it can be realized as the space of
units of a symplectic groupoid. Our main result states that $\varrho_H$ is a
Hofer type metric for every integrable Poisson manifold.
