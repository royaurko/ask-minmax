The assumption that a solution to the Einstein equations is static (or
stationary) very strongly constrains the asymptotic behaviour of the metric. It
is shown that one need only impose very weak differentiability and decay
conditions {\it a priori} on the metric for the field equations to force the
metric to be analytic near infinity and to have the standard Schwarzschildian
falloff.
