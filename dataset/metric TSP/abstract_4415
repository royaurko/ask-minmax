The Lipschitz geometry of segments of the infinite Hamming cube is studied.
Tight estimates on the distortion necessary to embed the segments into spaces
of continuous functions on countable compact metric spaces are given. As an
application, the first nontrivial lower bounds on the $C(K)$-distortion of
important classes of separable Banach spaces, where $K$ is a countable compact
space in the family $ \{ [0,\omega],[0,\omega\cdot 2],\dots, [0,\omega^2],
\dots, [0,\omega^k\cdot n],\dots,[0,\omega^\omega]\}\ ,$ are obtained.
