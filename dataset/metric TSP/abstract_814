Let (M,J) be a compact complex 2-manifold which which admits a Kaehler metric
for which the integral of the scalar curvature is non-negative. Also suppose
that M does not admit a Ricci-flat K\"ahler metric. Then if M is blown up at
sufficiently many points, the resulting complex surface admits Kaehler metrics
with scalar curvature identically equal to zero.
