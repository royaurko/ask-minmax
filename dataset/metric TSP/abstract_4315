The study of controlled hybrid systems requires practical tools for
approximation and comparison of system behaviors. Existing approaches to these
problems impose undue restrictions on the system's continuous and discrete
dynamics. Metrization and simulation of controlled hybrid systems is considered
here in a unified framework by constructing a state space metric. The metric is
applied to develop a numerical simulation algorithm that converges uniformly,
with a known rate of convergence, to orbitally stable executions of controlled
hybrid systems, up to and including Zeno events. Benchmark hybrid phenomena
illustrate the utility of the proposed tools.
