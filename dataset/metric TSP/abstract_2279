In this paper, the problems of perturbation and expression for the
Moore--Penrose metric generalized inverses of bounded linear operators on
Banach spaces are further studied. By means of certain geometric assumptions of
Banach spaces, we first give some equivalent conditions for the Moore--Penrose
metric generalized inverse of perturbed operator to have the simplest
expression $T^M(I+ \delta TT^M)^{-1}$. Then, as an application our results, we
investigate the stability of some operator equations in Banach spaces under
different type perturbations.
