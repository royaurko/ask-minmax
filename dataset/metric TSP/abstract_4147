In the present work, we have considered N-dimensional Einstein field
equations in which 4-dimensional space-time is described by a FRW metric and
that of the extra d-dimensions by an Euclidean metric. Considering the universe
filled with tachyonic field we have reconstructed the potential $V(\phi)$
corresponding to the field reconstructions in an anisotropic universe under
\emph{Emergent-Power law}, \emph{Emergent-Intermediate},
\emph{Emergent-Logamediate}and \emph{Logamediate-Intermediate} scenarios. The
statefinder parameters have been investigated in all of the said scenarios.
