A fast and parallel evolution of ways to measure and assess energy efficiency
in telecom has resulted in an entangled web of drafts and recommendations
originating from government, research, and standards organizations. This paper
focuses primarily on so-called "large network equipment" metrics and intends to
capture state-of-the-art in this area of green communications. Competing
approaches towards efficiency assessment are studied for their applicability
and completeness, with special emphasis on topics relevant to future subject
studies
