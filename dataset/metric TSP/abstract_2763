The subject is the overview of the use of quasi-entropy in finite dimensional
spaces. Matrix monotone functions and relative modular operators are used. The
origin is the relative entropy and the f-divergence, monotone metrics,
covariance and the chi-square-divergence are the most important particular
cases. The extension of the monotone metric to two variables is a new concept.
