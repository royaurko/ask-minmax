Given a compact complex $n$-fold $X$ satisfying the
$\partial\bar\partial$-lemma and supposed to have a trivial canonical bundle
$K_X$ and to admit a balanced (=semi-K\"ahler) Hermitian metric $\omega$, we
introduce the concept of deformations of $X$ that are {\bf co-polarised} by the
balanced class $[\omega^{n-1}]\in H^{n-1,\,n-1}(X,\,\C)\subset
H^{2n-2}(X,\,\C)$ and show that the resulting theory of balanced co-polarised
deformations is a natural extension of the classical theory of K\"ahler
polarised deformations in the context of Calabi-Yau or even holomorphic
symplectic compact complex manifolds. The concept of Weil-Petersson metric
still makes sense in this strictly more general, possibly non-K\"ahler context,
while the Local Torelli Theorem still holds.
