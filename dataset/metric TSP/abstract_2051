Relying on the equivalence principle, a first approach of the general theory
of relativity is presented using the spacetime metric of an observer with a
constant proper acceleration. Within this non inertial frame, the equation of
motion of a freely moving object is studied and the equation of motion of a
second accelerated observer with the same proper acceleration is examined. A
comparison of the metric of the accelerated observer with the metric due to a
gravitational field is also performed.
