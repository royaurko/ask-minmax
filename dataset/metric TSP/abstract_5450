We study thermalization on rotating probe branes in AdS_5 x S^5 background in
the presence of constant external electric and magnetic fields. In the AdS/CFT
framework this corresponds to thermalization in the flavour sector in field
theory. The horizon appears on the worldvolume of the probe brane due to its
rotation in one of the sphere directions. For both electric and magnetic fields
the behaviour of the temperature is independent of the probe brane dimension.
We also study the open string metric and the fluctuations of the probe brane in
such a set-up. We show that the temperatures obtained from open string metric
and observed by the fluctuations are larger than the one calculated from the
induced metric.
