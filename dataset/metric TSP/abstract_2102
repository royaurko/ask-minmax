In this paper we study homotopy type of certain moduli spaces of metric
graphs. More precisely, we show that the spaces $MG_{1,n}^v$, which parametrize
the isometry classes of metric graphs of genus 1 with $n$ marks on vertices are
homotopy equivalent to the spaces $TM_{1,n}$, which are the moduli spaces of
tropical curves of genus 1 with $n$ marked points. Our proof proceeds by
providing a sequence of explicit homotopies, with key role played by the
so-called scanning homotopy. We conjecture that our result generalizes to the
case of arbitrary genus.
