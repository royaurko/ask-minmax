In a previous study (quant-ph/0207181), we formulated a conjecture that
arbitrarily coupled qubits (describable by 4 x 4 density matrices) are
separable with an a priori probability of 8/(11 \pi^2) = 0.0736881. For this
purpose, we employed the normalized volume element of the Bures (minimal
monotone) metric as a probability distribution over the fifteen-dimensional
convex set of 4 x 4 density matrices. Here, we provide further/independent
(quasi-Monte Carlo numerical integration) evidence of a stronger nature (giving
an estimate of 0.0736858 vs. 0.0737012 previously) for this conjecture.
Additionally, employing a certain ansatz, we estimate the probabilities of
separability based on certain other monotone metrics of interest. However, we
find ourselves, at this point, unable to convincingly conjecture exact simple
formulas for these new (smaller) probabilities.
