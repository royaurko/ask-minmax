We consider a sequence of processes defined on half-line for all non negative
t. We give sufficient conditions for Large Deviation Principle (LDP) to hold in
the space of continuous functions with a new metric that is more sensitive to
behaviour at infinity than the uniform metric. LDP is established for Random
Walks, Diffusions, and CEV model of ruin, all defined on the half-line. LDP in
this space is "more precise" than that with the usual metric of uniform
convergence on compacts.
