We describe the structure of $d$-dimensional homogeneous Lorentzian
$G$-manifolds $M=G/H$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$. Due to a result by N.
Kowalsky, it is sufficient to consider the case when the group $G$ acts
properly, that is the stabilizer $H$ is compact. Then any homogeneous space
$G/\bar H$ with a smaller group $\bar H \subset H$ admits an invariant
Lorentzian metric. A homogeneous manifold $G/H$ with a connected compact
stabilizer $H$ is called a minimal admissible manifold if it admits an
invariant Lorentzian metric, but no homogeneous $G$-manifold $G/\tilde H$ with
a larger connected compact stabilizer $\tilde H \supset H$ admits such a
metric. We give a description of minimal homogeneous Lorentzian $n$-dimensional
$G$-manifolds $M = G/H$ of a simple (compact or noncompact) Lie group $G$. For
$n \leq 11$, we obtain a list of all such manifolds $M$ and describe invariant
Lorentzian metrics on $M$.
