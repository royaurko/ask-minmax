Within the framework of the recently proposed ghost-free massive gravity, a
cosmological constant-type self-accelerating solution has been obtained for
Minkowski and de Sitter reference metrics. We ease the assumption on the
reference metric and find the self-accelerating solution for the reference
metric respecting only isotropy, thus considerably extending the range of known
solutions.
