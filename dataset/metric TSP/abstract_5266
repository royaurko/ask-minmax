Over the last few years a certain class of dark-energy models decaying
inversely proportional to the square of the horizon distance emerged on the
basis either of Heisenberg uncertainty relations or of the uncertainty relation
between the four-volume and the cosmological constant. The very nature of these
dark energies is understood to be the same, namely it is the energy of
background space/metric fluctuations. Putting together these uncertainty
relations one finds that the model of random fluctuations of the background
metric is favored over the holographic one.
