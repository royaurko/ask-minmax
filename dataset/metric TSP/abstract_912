We consider metric graphs with Kirchhoff boundary conditions. We study the
intrinsic metric, volume doubling and a Poincar\'e inequality. This enables us
to prove a parabolic Harnack inequality. The proof involves various techniques
from the theory of strongly local Dirichlet forms. Along our way we show
Sobolev and Nash type inequalities and related heat kernel estimates.
