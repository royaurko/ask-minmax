In this paper, we prove a global rigidity theorem for negatively curved
Finsler metrics on a compact manifold of dimension n>2. We show that for such a
Finsler manifold, if the flag curvature is a scalar function on the tangent
bundle, then the Finsler metric is of Randers type. We also study the case when
the Finsler metric is locally projectively flat.
