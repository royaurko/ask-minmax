The static spherically symmetric solution for (R +- {\mu}^4/R) model of
f(R)gravity is investigated. We obtain the metric for space-time in the solar
system that reduces to the Schwarzschild metric, when {\mu} tends to zero. For
the obtained metric, the deviation from Einstein gravity is very small. This
result is different from the other results have been obtained by equivalence
between f(R) gravity and scalar tensor theory. Also it is shown that the vacuum
solution in the solar system depends on the shape of matter distribution which
differ from the Einstein's gravity.
