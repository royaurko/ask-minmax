We construct self-dual(SD) but not locally conformally flat(LCF) metrics on
families of non-simply connected 4-manifolds with small signature. We construct
various sequences with bounded or unbounded Betti numbers and Euler
characteristic. These metrics have negative scalar curvature. As an
application, this addresses the Remark 4.79 of Besse.
