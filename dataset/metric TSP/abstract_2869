We prove a sharp quantitative version of Hales' isoperimetric honeycomb
theorem by exploiting a quantitative isoperimetric inequality for polygons and
an improved convergence theorem for planar bubble clusters. Further
applications include the description of isoperimetric tilings of the torus with
respect to almost unit-area constraints or with respect to almost flat
Riemannian metrics.
