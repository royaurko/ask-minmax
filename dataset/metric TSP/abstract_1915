Using the technique of Rindler and Perlick we calculate the total precession
per revolution of a gyroscope circumventing the source of Weyl metrics. We
establish thereby a link between the multipole moments of the source and an
``observable'' quantity. Special attention deserves the case of the
gamma-metric. As an extension of this result we also present the corresponding
expressions for some stationary space-times.
