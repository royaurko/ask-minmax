We present solutions describing homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies in the
massive gravity theory with two dynamical metrics recently proposed in
arXiv:1109.3515 and claimed to be ghost free. These solutions can be spatially
open, closed, or flat, and at early times they are sourced by the perfect
fluid, while the graviton mass typically manifests itself at late times by
giving rise to a cosmological term. In addition, there are also exotic
solutions, for which already at early times, when the matter density is high,
the contribution of the graviton mass to the energy density is negative and
large enough to screen that of the matter contribution. The total energy can
then be negative, which may result in removing the initial singularity. For
special parameter values there are also solutions for which the two metrics
effectively decouple and evolve independently of each other. In the limit where
one of the gravitational coupling constant vanishes, such special solutions
reduce to those found in arXiv:1107.5504 within the theory where one of the
metrics is flat.
