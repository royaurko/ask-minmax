We discuss and compare at length the results of two methods used recently to
describe the thermodynamics of Taub-NUT solutions in a deSitter background. In
the first approach ($\mathbb{% C}$-approach), one deals with an analytically
continued version of the metric while in the second approach
($\mathbb{R}$-approach), the discussion is carried out using the unmodified
metric with Lorentzian signature. No analytic continuation is performed on the
coordinates and/or the parameters that appear in the metric. We find that the
results of both these approaches are completely equivalent modulo analytic
continuation and we provide the exact prescription that relates the results in
both methods. The extension of these results to the AdS/flat cases aims to give
a physical interpretation of the thermodynamics of nut-charged spacetimes in
the Lorentzian sector. We also briefly discuss the higher dimensional spaces
and note that, analogous with the absence of hyperbolic nuts in AdS
backgrounds, there are no spherical Taub-Nut-dS solutions.
