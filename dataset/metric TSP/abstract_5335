We propose and investigate a numerical shooting method for computing
geodesics in the Weil-Petersson ($WP$) metric on the universal Teichm\"uller
space T(1). This space, or rather the coset subspace
$\PSL_2(\R)\backslash\Diff(S^1)$, has another realization as the space of
smooth, simple closed planar curves modulo translations and scalings. This
alternate identification of T(1) is a convenient metrization of the space of
shapes and provides an immediate application for our algorithm in computer
vision. The geodesic equation on T(1) with the $WP$ metric is EPDiff($S^1$),
the Euler-Poincare equation on the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle
$S^1$, and admits a class of soliton-like solutions named Teichons. Our method
relies on approximating the geodesic with these teichon solutions, which have
momenta given by a finite linear combination of delta functions. The geodesic
equation for this simpler set of solutions is more tractable from the numerical
point of view. With a robust numerical integration of this equation, we
formulate a shooting method utilizing a cross-ratio matching term. Several
examples of geodesics in the space of shapes are demonstrated.
