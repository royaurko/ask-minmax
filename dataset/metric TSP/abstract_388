Tian and Yau constructed a complete Ricci-flat K\"ahler metric on the
complement of an ample and smooth anticanonical divisor. We inquire into the
behaviour of this metric towards the boundary divisor and prove a slow decay
rate of the difference to an appropriate explicitely given referential metric.
