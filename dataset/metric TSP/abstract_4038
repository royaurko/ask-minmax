We present a simple explicit construction of hyper-Kaehler and
hyper-symplectic (also known as neutral hyper-Kaehler or hyper-parakaehler)
metrics in 4D using the Bianchi type groups of class A. The construction
underlies a correspondence between hyper-Kaehler and hyper-symplectic
structures in dimension four.
