All known examples of homogeneous Einstein metrics of negative Ricci
curvature can be realized as left-invariant Riemannian metrics on solvable Lie
groups. After defining a notion of maximal symmetry among left-invariant
Riemannian metrics on a Lie group, we prove that any left-invariant Einstein
metric of negative Ricci curvature on a solvable Lie group is maximally
symmetric. This theorem is motivated both by the Alekseevskii Conjecture and by
the question of stability of Einstein metrics under the Ricci flow. We also
address questions of existence of maximally symmetric left-invariant Riemannian
metrics more generally.
