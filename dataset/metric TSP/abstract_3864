A new definition of quasi--local angular momentum of non--axisymmetric
marginally outer trapped surfaces is proposed. It is based on conformal
decomposition of the two--dimensional metric and the action of the group of
conformal symmetries. The definition is completely general and agrees with the
standard one in axi--symmetric surfaces.
