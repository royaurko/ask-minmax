Given a projective structure on a surface N, we show how to canonically
construct a neutral signature Einstein metric with non-zero scalar curvature on
the total space M of a certain rank 2 affine bundle M->N. The resulting
Einstein metric has anti-self-dual conformal curvature and admits a parallel
field of anti-self-dual planes. We show that Einstein metrics arising from this
construction admit smooth deformations to Ricci--flat metrics if the
corresponding projective structures admit a representative connection with
totally skew-symmetric Ricci tensor. The homogeneous Einstein metric
corresponding to the flat projective structure on RP^2 is the non-compact real
form of the Fubini-Study metric on M=SL(3, R)/GL(2, R).
