In this paper, we derive the general formulation by considering two arbitrary
plane symmetric spacetimes using Israel's method. As an example, we apply this
formulation to known plane symmetric spacetimes. We take the Taub's static
metric in the interior region whereas Kasner's non-static metric in the
exterior region. It is shown that the plane collapses in some cases whereas it
expands in some other cases.
