A physical metric is introduced as one that directly gives experimental data
without further coordinate transformation. It will be shown that the geodesic
equation for the Schwartzschild metric does not give the correct expression for
the Shapiro time delay experiment. In the physical metric the speed of light on
the surface of the earth is exactly the same as that in vacuum to first order
in gravity, and this should eliminate the inconsistency of the speed of the
neutrino exceeding that of light, if enough care is exerted in the discussion.
