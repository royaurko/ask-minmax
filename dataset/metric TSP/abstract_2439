In this paper, we first give a simple counter-example to show again the gap
of Frink's proof. Then we revise the Frink's metrization technique. As
applications, we answer two conjectures posed by Berinde and Choban, calculate
the induced metric from given $b$-metrics, and prove that the generalized
metric in the sense of Branciari is metrizable. We also show that Banach
contraction principles in $b$-metric spaces adn $g.m.s$'s may be deduced from
Banach contraction principle in metric spaces.
