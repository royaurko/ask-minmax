Singularity theorems of general relativity utilize the notion of causal
geodesic incompleteness as a criterion of the presence of a spacetime
singularity. The incompleteness of a causal curve implies the end and/or
beginning of the existence of a particle, which is an event. In the commonly
accepted approach, singularities are not incorporated into spacetime. Thus
spacetime turns out to be event-incomplete. With creation from nothing,
singularities are sources of lawlessness. A straightforward way around those
conceptual problems consists in including metric singularities in spacetime and
then matching metrics and causal geodesics at the singularities. To this end, a
spacetime manifold is assumed to be unboundable, so that singularities may only
be interior. The matching the geodesics is achieved through weakening
conditions for their smoothness. This approach is applied to a black-white hole
and a big crunch-bang.
