Dubickas and Smyth defined the metric Mahler measure on the multiplicative
group of non-zero algebraic numbers. The definition involves taking an infimum
over representations of an algebraic number $\alpha$ by other algebraic
numbers. We verify their conjecture that the infimum in its definition is
always achieved as well as establish its analog for the ultrametric Mahler
measure.
