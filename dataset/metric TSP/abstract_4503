We consider here the Snyder-Oppenheimer collapse from the brane world
viewpoint, we analyzed the collapsing time from the different geometries
associated with the star in addition with the contributions generated by
branes. Also, we propose a renaming of the variables associated with the
stellar dynamics with the aim of study the different components of the star
with the machinery of dynamical systems and its evolution near of the collapse.
Finally, we describe the exterior metric of the star and the conditions to fit
continuously with the interior metric.
