We introduce a new, simple metric method of sampling metric measure spaces,
based on a well-known "snowflakeing operator" and we show that, as a
consequence of a classical result of Assouad, the sampling of doubling metric
spaces is bilipschitz equivalent to that of subsets of some $\mathbb{R}^N$.
Moreover, we compare this new method with two other approaches, in particular
to one that represents a direct application of our triangulation method of
metric measure spaces satisfying a generalized Ricci curvature condition.
