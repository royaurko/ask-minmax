I study a thermodynamical approach to scalar metric perturbations during the
inflationary stage. In the power-law expanding universe here studied, I find a
negative heat capacity as a manifestation of superexponential growing for the
number of states in super Hubble scales. The power spectrum depends on the
Gibbons-Hawking and Hagedorn temperatures.
