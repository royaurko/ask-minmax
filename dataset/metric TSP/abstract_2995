An extended object is considered on the Minkowski background in the form of a
space-time bag, which is bounded by a certain surface confining an internal
substance. An internal metric is built starting from the symmetry principles
rather than from the field equations. Assuming such a surface to be Lorentz
invariant we find that the internal space is proved to be the de Sitter space.
Conformal inversion of the internal metric relative to the bag surface
determines an external space (conformally conjugated de Sitter space) whose
metric may simulate a field of the object. Although the extended object built
in a such a way is noncompact, its cross section by the hyperplane r^0=0, where
r^0 is the temporal coordinate, is compact (a ball) and the associated metric
can model a spherically symmetric extended massless charge in a certain
approximation.
