This paper introduces the FLOSS Free Libre Open Source Software [VEMSA3D], a
contraction of "Visual Electromagnetic Simulator for 3D Antennas", which are
geometrically modeled, either exactly or approximately, as thin wire polygonal
structures; presents its GUI Graphical User Interface capabilities, in
interactive mode and/or in handling suitable formed antenna data files;
demonstrates the effectiveness of its use in a number of practical antenna
applications, with direct comparison to experimental measurements and other
freeware results; and provides the inexperienced user with a specific list of
instructions to successfully build the given source code by using only freely
available IDE Integrated Development Environment tools-including a
cross-platform one. The unrestricted access to source code, beyond the ability
for immediate software improvement, offers to independent users and volunteer
groups an expandable, in any way, visual antenna simulator, for a genuine
research and development work in the field of antennas, adaptable to their
needs.
