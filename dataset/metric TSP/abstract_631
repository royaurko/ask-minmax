In this paper we study the set of balanced metrics (in Donaldson's
terminology) on a compact complex manifold M which are homothetic to a given
balanced one. This question is related to various properties of the
Tian-Yau-Zelditch approximation theorem for Kahler metrics. We prove that this
set is finite when $M$ admits a non-positive Kahler-Einstein metric, in the
case of non-homogenous toric Kaehler-Einstein manifolds of dimension $\leq 4$
and in the case of Arezzo-Pacard constant scalar curvature metrics.
