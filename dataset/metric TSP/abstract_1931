Taking the triangle areas as independent variables in the theory of Regge
calculus can lead to ambiguities in the edge lengths, which can be interpreted
as discontinuities in the metric. We construct solutions to area Regge calculus
using a triangulated lattice and find that on a spacelike hypersurface no such
discontinuity can arise. On a null hypersurface however, we can have such a
situation and the resulting metric can be interpreted as a so-called refractive
wave.
