We prove that the Gromov-Hausdorff compactification of the moduli space of
Kahler-Einstein Del Pezzo surfaces in each degree agrees with certain
algebro-geometric compactification. In particular, this recovers Tian's theorem
on the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on smooth Del Pezzo surfaces and
classifies the degenerations of such metrics. The proof is based on a
combination of both algebraic and differential geometric techniques.
