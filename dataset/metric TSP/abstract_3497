In this paper we present the equations and some basic applications of
relativistic SPH. The equations are generated under the assumption that there
are no interaction terms between the fluid modelled and the background
space-time, i.e. we are neglecting the perturbations to the metric produced by
the modelled fluid. This corresponds to a stationary metric, which for this
work, we further limit to be static as well. The equations use a new signal
velocity term and artificial viscosity to smear out the effects of strong
shocks and are tested here against Newtonian and relativistic shocks.
