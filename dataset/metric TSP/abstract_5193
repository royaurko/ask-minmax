Within the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation it is shown that the equation
of state $p=\rho$ holds near the center of a black hole. For the stiff equation
of state $p=\rho-\rho_c$ the interior metric is solved exactly. It is matched
with the Schwarzschild metric, which is deformed in a narrow range beyond the
horizon. The solution is regular everywhere, with a specific shape at the
origin. The gravitational redshift at the horizon remains finite but is large,
$z\sim 10^{23}$$M_\odot/M$. Time keeps its standard role also in the interior.
The energy of the Schwarzschild metric, shown to be minus infinity in the
General Theory of Relativity, is regularized in this setup, resulting in
$E=Mc^2$.
