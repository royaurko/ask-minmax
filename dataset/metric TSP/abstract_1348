Rank metric codes and constant-dimension codes (CDCs) have been considered
for error control in random network coding. Since decoder errors are more
detrimental to system performance than decoder failures, in this paper we
investigate the decoder error probability (DEP) of bounded distance decoders
(BDDs) for rank metric codes and CDCs. For rank metric codes, we consider a
channel motivated by network coding, where errors with the same row space are
equiprobable. Over such channels, we establish upper bounds on the DEPs of
BDDs, determine the exact DEP of BDDs for maximum rank distance (MRD) codes,
and show that MRD codes have the greatest DEPs up to a scalar. To evaluate the
DEPs of BDDs for CDCs, we first establish some fundamental geometric properties
of the projective space. Using these geometric properties, we then consider
BDDs in both subspace and injection metrics and derive analytical expressions
of their DEPs for CDCs, over a symmetric operator channel, as functions of
their distance distributions. Finally, we focus on CDCs obtained by lifting
rank metric codes and establish two important results: First, we derive
asymptotically tight upper bounds on the DEPs of BDDs in both metrics; Second,
we show that the DEPs for KK codes are the greatest up to a scalar among all
CDCs obtained by lifting rank metric codes.
