Quantum-mechanical analysis shows that the metrics of a centrally symmetric
uncharged gravitational field, which are exact solutions of the general
relativity equations, are physically non-equivalent. The classical
Schwarzschield metric and the Schwarzschild metrics in isotropic and harmonic
coordinates provide for the existence of stationary bound states of Dirac
particles with a real energy spectrum. The Hilbert condition g_{00}>0 is
responsible for zero values of the wave functions under the "event horizon"
that leads to the absence of Hawking radiation. For the Eddington-Finkelstein
and Painleve-Gullstrand metrics, stationary bound states of spin-half particles
cannot exist because Dirac Hamiltonians are non-Hermitian. For these metrics,
the condition g_{00}>0 also leads to the absence of Hawking evaporation. For
the Finkelstein-Lemaitre and Kruskal metrics, Dirac Hamiltonians are explicitly
time-dependent, and stationary bound states of spin-half particles cannot exist
for them. The Hilbert condition for these metrics does not place any
constraints on the domains of the wave functions. Hawking evaporation of black
holes is possible in this case. The results can lead to revisiting some
concepts of the standard cosmological model related to the evolution of the
universe and interaction of collapsars with surrounding matter.
