We develop techniques for classifying the nonnegatively curved left-invariant
metrics on a compact Lie group G. We prove rigidity theorems for general G and
a partial classification for G=SO(4). Our approach is to reduce the general
question to an infinitesimal version; namely, to classify the directions one
can move away from a fixed bi-invariant metric such that curvature variation
formulas predict nearby metrics are nonnnegatively curved.
