We present a path toward determining the statistical origin of the
thermodynamic limit for systems with long-range interactions. We assume
throughout that the systems under consideration have thermodynamic properties
given by the Tsallis entropy. We rely on the composition property of the
Tsallis entropy for determining effective metrics and measures on their
configuration/phase spaces. We point out the significance of Muckenhoupt
weights, of doubling measures and of doubling measure-induced metric
deformations of the metric. We comment on the volume deformations induced by
the Tsallis entropy composition and on the significance of functional spaces
for these constructions.
