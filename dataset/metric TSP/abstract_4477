In this paper, we construct a completion of the moduli space for polarized
Calabi-Yau manifolds by using Ricci-flat K\"ahler-Einstein metrics and the
Gromov-Hausdorff topology, which parameterizes certain Calabi-Yau varieties. We
then study the algebro-geometric perperties and the Weil-Petersson geometry of
such completion. We show that the completion can be exhausted by sequences of
quasi-projective varieties, and new points added have finite Weil-Petersson
distance to the interior.
