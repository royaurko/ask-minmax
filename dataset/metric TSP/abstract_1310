On an open manifold, the spaces of metrics or connections of bounded
geometry, respectively, split into an uncountable number of components. We show
that for a pair of metrics or connections, belonging to the same component,
relative $\zeta$-functions, determinants, torsion for pairs of generalized
Dirac operators are well defined.
