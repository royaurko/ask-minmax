A method for constructing explicit Calabi-Yau metrics in six dimensions in
terms of an initial hyperkahler structure is presented. The equations to solve
are non linear in general, but become linear when the objects describing the
metric depend on only one complex coordinate of the hyperkahler 4-dimensional
space and its complex conjugated. This situation in particular gives a dual
description of D6-branes wrapping a complex 1-cycle inside the hyperkahler
space, which was studied by Fayyazuddin. The present work generalize the
construction given by him. But the explicit solutions we present correspond to
the non linear problem. This is a non linear equation with respect to two
variables which, with the help of some specific anzatz, is reduced to a non
linear equation with a single variable solvable in terms of elliptic functions.
In these terms we construct an infinite family of non compact Calabi-Yau
metrics.
