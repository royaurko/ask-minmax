Well-known conjectures of Tian predict that existence of canonical Kahler
metrics should be equivalent to various notions of properness of Mabuchi's
K-energy functional. In some instances this has been verified, especially under
restrictive assumptions on the automorphism group. We provide counterexamples
to the original conjecture in the presence of continuous automorphisms. The
construction hinges upon an alternative approach to properness that uses in an
essential way the metric completion with respect to a Finsler metric and its
quotients with respect to group actions. This approach also allows us to
formulate and prove new optimal versions of Tian's conjecture in the setting of
smooth and singular Kahler-Einstein metrics, with or without automorphisms, as
well as for Kahler-Ricci solitons. Moreover, we reduce both Tian's original
conjecture (in the absence of automorphisms) and our modification of it (in the
presence of automorphisms) in the general case of constant scalar curvature
metrics to a conjecture on regularity of minimizers of the K-energy in the
Finsler metric completion. Finally, our results also resolve Tian's conjecture
on the Moser-Trudinger inequality for Fano manifolds with Kahler-Einstein
metrics.
