E. D. Fackerell claims: 1) that Alley and Yilmaz treatment of parallel slabs
in general relativity is wrong because the Yilmaz metric used is not a solution
of the field equations of general relativity; 2) he also claims that the
correct treatment of the parallel slab problem in general relativity must be
based on the so-called Taub metric. We show below that both of Fackerell's
claims are false. His first claim is based on his failure to distinguish the
matter-free regions and the regions with matter. His second claim is based on
his failure to recognize that for the Taub metric the left-hand side, hence
also the right-hand side of the field equations, are identically zero
everywhere. Thus no material systems can be treated via the Taub metric.
