We compute the screening length of mesons with different angular momentum $J$
from two gravity dual theories. Both the asymptotically $AdS_{5}$ and
Sakai-Sugimoto metrics are considered in the calculations. Using the dual
description of the quark as a classical string ending on the probe brane, we
obtain the interacting potential between the heavy quark and antiquark after
rotating the background metric. The result shows that the screening length of
mesons with different $J$ is well fit to $a_{J}/T$. The constant $a_{J}$ is
determined for $J=0,1,2$ by taking advantage of numerical techniques. Finally,
we calculate the drag force and relaxation times from the Sakai-Sugimoto metric
and compare with the ones obtained in the $AdS_{5}$. The application of our
result to charmonium and bottomonium at RHIC and LHC is briefly discussed.
