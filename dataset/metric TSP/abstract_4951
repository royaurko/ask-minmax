Transports preserving the angle between two contravariant vector fields but
changing their lengths proportional to their own lengths are introduced as
`conformal' transports and investigated over spaces with one affine connection
and metric. They are more general than the Fermi-Walker transports. In an
analogous way as in the case of Fermi-Walker transports a conformal covariant
differential operator and its conformal derivative are defined and considered
over spaces with one affine connection and metric. Different special types of
conformal transports are determined inducing also Fermi-Walker transports for
orthogonal vector fields as special cases. Conditions under which the length of
a non-null contravariant vector field could swing as a homogeneous harmonic
oscillator are established. The results obtained regardless of any concrete
field (gravitational) theory could have direct applications in such types of
theories. PACS numbers: 04.90.+e; 04.50.+h; 12.10.Gq; 02.40.Vh
