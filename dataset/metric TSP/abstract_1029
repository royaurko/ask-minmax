The aim of this paper is the study of the geodesic distance in operator
groups with several Riemannian metrics. More precisely we study the geodesic
distance in self-adjoint operator groups with the left invariant Riemannian
metric induced by the infinite trace and extend known results about the
completeness of some classical Banach-Lie groups to this general class.
