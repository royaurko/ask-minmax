We show how generic off-diagonal cosmological solutions depending, in
general, on all spacetime coordinates can be constructed in massive gravity
using the anholonomic frame deformation method. There are found new classes of
locally anisotropic and (in) homogeneous cosmological metrics with open and
closed spatial geometries. Such solutions describe the late time acceleration
due to effective cosmological terms induced by nonlinear off-diagonal
interactions and graviton mass. The cosmological metrics and related St\"
uckelberg fields are constructed in explicit form up to nonholonomic frame
transforms of the Friedmann-Lama\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) coordinates.
The solutions include matter, graviton mass and other effective sources
modelling nonlinear gravitational and matter fields interactions with
polarization of physical constants and deformations of metrics, which may
explain certain dark energy and dark matter effects. There are stated the
conditions when such configurations mimic interesting solutions in general
relativity and modifications and recast the general Painlev\' e-Gullstrand and
FLRW metrics. Finally, we sketch a reconstruction procedure for a subclass of
off-diagonal cosmological solutions which describe cyclic and ekpyrotic
universes.
