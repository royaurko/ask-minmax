We consider the five-dimensional bulk spacetime with negative Lambda
described by the Nariai metric (which is not conformally flat) and match it
with a vacuum brane satisfying the proper boundary conditions. It is shown that
the brane metric corresponds to a cloud of string dust of constant energy
density.
