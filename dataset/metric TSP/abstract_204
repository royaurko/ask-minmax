We propose a sufficient condition for a general spherical symmetric static
metric to be compatible with classical tests of gravity. A 1-parametric class
of such metrics are constructed.
  The Schwarzschild metric as well as the Yilmaz-Rosen metric are in this
class.
  By computing the scalar curvature we show that the non-Schwarzschild metrics
can be interpreted as close 2-branes.
  All the manifolds endowed the described metrics contain in a class of
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with a scalar curvature of a fixed sign.
