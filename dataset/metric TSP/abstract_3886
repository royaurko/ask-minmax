Let $f$ be an analytic function on the unit disc which is in the Dirichlet
class, so the Euclidean area of the image, counting multiplicity, is finite.
The Euclidean length of a radial arc of hyperbolic length $\rho$ is then
$o(\rho^1/2)$. In this note we consider the corresponding results when $f$ maps
into the unit disc with the hyperbolic metric or the Riemann sphere with the
spherical metric. Similar but not identical results hold.
