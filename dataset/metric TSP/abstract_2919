A generalized symmetry of a system of differential equations is an
infinitesimal transformation depending locally upon the fields and their
derivatives which carries solutions to solutions. We classify all generalized
symmetries of the vacuum Einstein equations in four spacetime dimensions. To
begin, we analyze symmetries that can be built from the metric, curvature, and
covariant derivatives of the curvature to any order; these are called natural
symmetries and are globally defined on any spacetime manifold. We next classify
first-order generalized symmetries, that is, symmetries that depend on the
metric and its first derivatives. Finally, using results from the
classification of natural symmetries, we reduce the classification of all
higher-order generalized symmetries to the first-order case. In each case we
find that the generalized symmetries are infinitesimal generalized
diffeomorphisms and constant metric scalings. There are no non-trivial
conservation laws associated with these symmetries. A novel feature of our
analysis is the use of a fundamental set of spinorial coordinates on the
infinite jet space of Ricci-flat metrics, which are derived from Penrose's
``exact set of fields'' for the vacuum equations.
