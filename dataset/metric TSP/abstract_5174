The optimal decoder achieving the outage capacity under imperfect channel
estimation is investigated. First, by searching into the family of nearest
neighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded
modulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of
the transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. Next, we
specialize our general expression to obtain the corresponding decoding metric
for fading MIMO channels. According to the notion of estimation-induced outage
(EIO) capacity introduced in our previous work and assuming no channel state
information (CSI) at the transmitter, we characterize maximal achievable
information rates, using Gaussian codebooks, associated to the proposed
decoder. In the case of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, these achievable rates
are compared to the rates achieved by the classical mismatched
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder and the ultimate limits given by the EIO
capacity. Numerical results show that the derived metric provides significant
gains for the considered scenario, in terms of achievable information rates and
bit error rate (BER), in a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) framework,
without introducing any additional decoding complexity.
