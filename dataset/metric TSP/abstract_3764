Let Gamma be a discrete group satisfying the rapid decay property with
respect to a length function which is conditionally negative. Then the reduced
C*-algebra of Gamma has the metric approximation property.
 The central point of our proof is an observation that the proof of the same
property for free groups due to Haagerup transfers directly to this more
general situation. Examples of groups satisfying the hypotheses include free
groups, surface groups, finitely generated Coxeter groups, right angled Artin
groups and many small cancellation groups.
