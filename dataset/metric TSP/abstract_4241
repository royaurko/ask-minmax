We introduce a generalization of structured manifolds as the most general
Riemannian metric g associated to an affinor (tensor field of (1,1)-type) F and
initiate a study of their semi-invariant submanifolds. These submanifolds are
generalization of CR-submanifolds of almost complex geometry and semi-invariant
submanifolds of several interesting geometries (almost product, almost contact
and others). We characterize the integrability of both invariant and
anti-invariant distribution; the special case when F is covariant constant with
respect to g gives major simplifications in computations.
