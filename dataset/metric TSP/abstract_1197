The metric dimension of a graph is the least number of vertices in a set with
the property that the list of distances from any vertex to those in the set
uniquely identifies that vertex. Bailey and Meagher obtained an upper bound on
the metric dimension of Grassmann graphs. In this paper we obtain an upper
bound on the metric dimension of bilinear forms graphs.
