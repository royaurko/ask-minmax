We have examined features in the structure of the heliosheath using the fine
scale time variations of termination shock particles (TSP) between ~0.5 - 20
MeV and electrons between 2.5-14 MeV measured by the CRS instrument as the V2
spacecraft crossed the heliospheric termination shock in 2007. The very
disturbed heliosheath at V2 is particularly noteworthy for strong periodic
intensity variations of the TSP just after V2 crossed the termination shock
(2007.66) reaching a maximum between 2007.75 and 2008.0. A series of 42/21 day
periodicities was observed at V2 along with spectral changes of low energy TSP
and the acceleration of 6-14 MeV electrons. Evidence is presented for the
acceleration of TSP and electrons at the times of the 42/21 day periodicities
just after V2 crossed the HTS. Spectra for TSP between 2-20 MeV and electrons
between 2.5-14 MeV are derived for three time periods including the time of the
HTS crossing. The energy spectra of TSP and electrons at these times of
intensity peaks are very similar above ~3 MeV, with exponents of a power law
spectrum between -3.0 and -3.6. The ratio of TSP intensities to electron
intensities at the same energy is ~500. The electron intensity peaks and minima
are generally out of phase with those of nuclei by ~1/2 of a 42 day cycle.
These charge dependent intensity differences and the large periodic intensity
changes could provide new clues as to a possible acceleration mechanism.
