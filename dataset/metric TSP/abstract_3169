A four dimensional generally covariant modified Yang-Mills action, which
depends on the lorentzian complex structure of spacetime and not its metric, is
presented. The extended Weyl symmetry, implied by the effective metric
independence, makes the lagrangian model renormalizable. The modified
Yang-Mills action generates a linear potential, instead of the Coulomb-like
(1/r) potential of the ordinary action. Therefore the Yang-Mills excitations
must be perturbatively confined. The metric, which admits an integrable
lorentzian complex structure, can be extended to a Kaehler metric and the
spacetime is a totally real CR manifold in $\mathbb{C}^4$. These surfaces are
generally inside the SU(2,2) homogeneous domain. A non-real-analytic point,
transferred to the U(2) characteristic boundary of the classical domain,
spontaneously breaks the SU(2,2) symmetry down to its Poincare subgroup. Hence
the pure geometric modes and solitons of the model must belong to
representations of the Poincare group.
