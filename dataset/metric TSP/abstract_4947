We investigate whether self-maintained vacuum traversible wormhole can exist
described by stationary but nonstatic metric. We consider metric being the sum
of static spherically symmetric one and a small nondiagonal component which
describes rotation sufficiently slow to be taken into account in the linear
approximation. We study semiclassical Einstein equations for this metric with
vacuum expectation value of stress-energy of physical fields as the source. In
suggestion that the static traversible wormhole solution exists we reveal
possible azimuthal angle dependence of angular velocity of the rotation
(angular velocity of the local inertial frame) that solves semiclassical
Einstein equations. We find that in the macroscopic (in the Plank scale)
wormhole case a rotational solution exists but only such that, first, angular
velocity depends on radial coordinate only and, second, the wormhole connects
the two asymptotically flat spacetimes rotating with angular velocities
different in asymptotic regions.
