Of those gauge theories of gravity known to be equivalent to general
relativity, only the biconformal gauging introduces new structures - the
quotient of the conformal group of any pseudo-Euclidean space by its Weyl
subgroup always has natural symplectic and metric structures. Using this metric
and symplectic form, we show that there exist canonically conjugate,
orthogonal, metric submanifolds if and only if the original gauged space is
Euclidean or signature 0. In the Euclidean cases, the resultant configuration
space must be Lorentzian. Therefore, in this context, time may be viewed as a
derived property of general relativity.
