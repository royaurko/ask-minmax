In this paper, we will study non-commutative corrections in the metric tensor
for the G\"{o}del-type universe, a model that has as its main characteristic
the possibility of violation of causality, allowing therefore time travel. We
also find that the critical radius in such a model, which eventually will
determine the time travel possibility, is modified due to the non commutativity
of spatial coordinates.
