Let $P\to M$ be a principal bundle. Consider a sequence of metrics on $P$
obtained by re-scaling the fibers to points. The Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the
tangent bundles over these principal bundles with their Sasaki metric is seen
herein to be a locally trivial fiber bundle containing the tangent space to the
base as a subbundle in a natural way. Berger 3-spheres provide an example where
the limit fibers are still of dimension 3. The fibers are shown to be entirely
determined by the riemannian holonomy of the chosen bi-invariant metric.
