The notions of centrifugal (centripetal) and Coriolis velocities and
accelerations are introduced and considered in spaces with affine connections
and metrics used as models of space or of space-time. It is shown that these
types of velocities and accelerations are generated by the relative motions
between mass elements in a continuous media or of particles. The velocities and
accelerations are closely related to the kinematic characteristics of the
relative velocity and of the relative acceleration. The relation between the
centrifugal (centripetal) velocity and the Hubble law is found. The centrifugal
(centripetal) acceleration could be interpreted as gravitational acceleration
as it has been done in the Einstein theory of gravitation. This fact could be
used as a basis for working out of new gravitational theories in spaces with
affine connections and metrics.
