In this paper, we continue the study of the Killing symmetries of a
N-dimensional generalized Minkowski space, i.e. a space endowed with a (in
general non-diagonal) metric tensor, whose coefficients do depend on a set of
non-metrical coordinates. We discuss here the finite structure of the
space-time rotations in such spaces, by confining ourselves (without loss of
generality) to the four-dimensional case. In particular, the results obtained
are specialized to the case of a ''deformed'' Minkowski space $%
\widetilde{M_{4}}$ (i.e. a pseudoeuclidean space with metric coefficients
depending on energy), for which we derive the explicit general form of the
finite rotations and boosts in different parametric bases.
