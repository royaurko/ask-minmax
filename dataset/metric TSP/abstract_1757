We discuss the scaling limit of large planar quadrangulations with a boundary
whose length is of order the square root of the number of faces. We consider a
sequence $(\sigma_n)$ of integers such that $\sigma_n/\sqrt{2n}$ tends to some
$\sigma\in[0,\infty]$. For every $n \ge 1$, we call $q_n$ a random map
uniformly distributed over the set of all rooted planar quadrangulations with a
boundary having $n$ faces and $2\sigma_n$ half-edges on the boundary. For
$\sigma\in (0,\infty)$, we view $q_n$ as a metric space by endowing its set of
vertices with the graph metric, rescaled by $n^{-1/4}$. We show that this
metric space converges in distribution, at least along some subsequence, toward
a limiting random metric space, in the sense of the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
We show that the limiting metric space is almost surely a space of Hausdorff
dimension 4 with a boundary of Hausdorff dimension 2 that is homeomorphic to
the two-dimensional disc. For $\sigma=0$, the same convergence holds without
extraction and the limit is the so-called Brownian map. For $\sigma=\infty$,
the proper scaling becomes $\sigma_n^{-1/2}$ and we obtain a convergence toward
Aldous's CRT.
