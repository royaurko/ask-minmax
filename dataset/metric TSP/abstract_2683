We study the generalized analogues of conics for normed planes by using the
following natural approach: It is well known that there are different metrical
definitions of conics in the Euclidean plane. We investigate how these
definitions extend to normed planes, and we show that in this more general
framework these different definitions yield, in almost all cases, different
classes of curves.
