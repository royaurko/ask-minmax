In this paper we study consistent solutions of spherically symmetric space in
metric f(R) gravity theory. Here we inversely obtain a generic action from
metric solutions that describe flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies without
dark matter. Then we show that obtained solutions are in conformity with
Tully-Fisher relation and modified Newtonian dynamics, which are two strong
constraints in justification of flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies.
