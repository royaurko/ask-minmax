We report a correlation between the spin polarization of the tunneling
electrons (TSP) and the magnetic moment of amorphous CoFeB alloys. Such a
correlation is surprising since the TSP involves s-like electrons close to the
Fermi level (EF), while the magnetic moment mainly arises due to all
d-electrons below EF. We show that probing the s and d-bands individually
provides clear and crucial evidence for such a correlation to exist through s-d
hybridization, and demonstrate the tuneability of the electronic and magnetic
properties of CoFeB alloys.
