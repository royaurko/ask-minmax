This work is devoted to the geometric analysis of metric-measure spaces
satisfying a Prekopa-Leindler or a more general Borell-Brascamp-Lieb
inequality.
  Completing the early investigations by Cordero-Erausquin, McCann and
Schmuckenschlager, we show that these functional inequalities characterize
lower bounds on the Ricci curvature on a Riemannian manifold, providing thus an
alternate version of Ricci curvature lower bounds in measured length spaces to
the recent developments by Lott, Villani and Sturm. We also investigate
stability properties and geometric and functional inequalities, such as
logarithmic Sobolev inequality and Bishop-Gromov diameter estimate, in measured
length spaces satisfying a Prekopa-Leindler or a Borell-Brascamp-Lieb
inequality.
