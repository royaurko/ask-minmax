We give a method to construct Calabi-Yau metrics on G-invariant vector
bundles over Kahler coset spaces G/H using supersymmetric nonlinear
realizations with matter coupling. As a concrete example we discuss the CP^N
model coupled with matter. The canonical line bundle is reproduced by the
singlet matter and the cotangent bundle with a new non-compact Calabi-Yau
metric which is not hyper-Kahler is obtained by the anti-fundamental matter.
