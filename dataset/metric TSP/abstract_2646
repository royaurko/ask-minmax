In this article we prove a non-vanishing statement, as well as several
properties of metrics with minimal singularities of adjoint bundles. Our
arguments involve many ideas from Y.-T. Siu's analytic proof of the finite
generation of the canonical ring. An important technical tool is the notion of
relative critical exponent of two closed positive currents with respect to a
measure.
