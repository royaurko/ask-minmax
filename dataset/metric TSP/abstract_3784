We define the concept of symmetric sensitivity with respect to initial
conditions for the endomorphisms on Lebesgue metric spaces. The idea is that
the orbits of almost every pair of nearby initial points (for the product of
the invariant measure) of a symmetrically sensitive map may diverge from a
positive quantity independent of the initial points. We study the relationships
between symmetric sensitivity and weak mixing, symmetric sensitivity and
positiveness of metric entropy and we compute the largest sensitivity constant.
