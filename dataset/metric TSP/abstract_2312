In this paper we prove that for all $n=4k-2$, $k\ge2$ there exists closed
$n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds $M$ with negative sectional curvature that
do not have the homotopy type of a locally symmetric space, such that
$\pi_{1}(\mathcal{T}^{<0}(M))$ is non-trivial. $\mathcal{T}^{<0}(M)$ denotes
the Teichm\"uller space of all negatively curved Riemannian metrics on $M$,
which is the topological quotient of the space of all negatively curved metrics
modulo the space of self-diffeomorphisms of $M$ that are homotopic to the
identity. Gromov Thurston branched cover manifolds provide examples of
negatively curved manifolds that do not have the homotopy type of a locally
symmetric space. These manifolds will be used in this paper to prove the above
stated result.
