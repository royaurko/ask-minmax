We describe some of the geometric properties of the automorphism group Aut(F)
of Thompson's group F. We give realizations of Aut(F) geometrically via
periodic tree pair diagrams, which lead to natural presentations and give
effective methods for estimating the word length of elements. We study some
natural subgroups of Aut(F) and their metric properties. In particular, we show
that the subgroup of inner automorphisms of F is at least quadratically
distorted in Aut(F), whereas other subgroups of Aut(F) isomorphic to F are
undistorted.
