In the paper we investigate submanifolds in a tangent bundle endowed with
g-natural metric G, defined by a vector field on a base manifold. We give a
sufficient condition for a vector field on M to defined totally geodesic
submanifold in (TM,G). The parallel vector field is discussed in more detail.
