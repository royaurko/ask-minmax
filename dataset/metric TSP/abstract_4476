In this note we prove that on metric measure spaces, functions of least
gradient, as well as local minimizers of the area functional (after
modification on a set of measure zero) are continuous everywhere outside their
jump sets. As a tool, we develop some stability properties of sequences of
least gradient functions. We also apply these tools to prove a maximum
principle for functions of least gradient that arise as solutions to a
Dirichlet problem.
