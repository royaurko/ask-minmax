In this note we give a characterization of Kaehler metrics which are both
Calabi extremal and Kaehler-Ricci solitons in terms of complex Hessians and the
Riemann curvature tensor. We apply it to prove that, under the assumption of
positivity of the holomorphic sectional curvature, these metrics are Einstein.
