In this paper we investigate possible extensions of the idea of geodesic
completeness in complex manifolds, following two directions: metrics are
somewhere allowed not to be of maximum rank, or to have 'poles' somewhere else.
Geodesics are eventually defined on Riemann surfaces over regions in the
Riemann sphere. Completeness theorems are given in the framework of warped
products of Riemann surfaces.
