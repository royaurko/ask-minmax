Let R denote the smallest class of compact spaces containing all metric
compacta and closed under limits of continuous inverse sequences of
retractions. Class R is striclty larger than the class of Valdivia compact
spaces. We show that every compact connected Abelian group which is a
topological retract of a space from class R is necessarily isomorphic to a
product of metric groups. This completes the result of V. Uspenskij and the
contributor, where a compact connected Abelian group outside class R has been
described.
