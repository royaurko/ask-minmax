We study the canonical metric on a compact Riemann surface of genus at least
two. While it is known that the canonical metric is of nonpositive curvature,
we show that its Gaussian curvatures are not bounded away from zero nor
negative infinity when the surface is close to the compactification divisor of
Riemann's moduli space.
