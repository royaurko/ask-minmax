A method to construct exact general relativistic thick disks that is a simple
generalization of the ``displace, cut and reflect'' method commonly used in
Newtonian, as well as, in Einstein theory of gravitation is presented. This
generalization consists in the addition of a new step in the above mentioned
method. The new method can be pictured as a ``displace, cut, {\it fill} and
reflect'' method. In the Newtonian case, the method is illustrated in some
detail with the Kuzmin-Toomre disk. We obtain a thick disk with acceptable
physical properties. In the relativistic case two solutions of the Weyl
equations, the Weyl gamma metric (also known as Zipoy-Voorhees metric) and the
Chazy-Curzon metric are used to construct thick disks. Also the Schwarzschild
metric in isotropic coordinates is employed to construct another family of
thick disks. In all the considered cases we have non trivial ranges of the
involved parameter that yield thick disks in which all the energy conditions
are satisfied.
