We prove that there are infinitely many pairs of homeomorphic
non-diffeomorphic smooth 4-manifolds, such that in each pair one manifold
admits an Einstein metric and the other does not. We also show that there are
closed 4-manifolds with two smooth structures which admit Einstein metrics with
opposite signs of the scalar curvature.
