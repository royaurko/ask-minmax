We prove that every one-dimensional real Ambrosio-Kirchheim normal current in
a Polish (i.e. complete separable metric) space can be naturally represented as
an integral of simpler currents associated to Lipschitz curves. As a
consequence a representation of every such current with zero boundary (i.e. a
cycle) as an integral of so-called elementary solenoids (which are, very
roughly speaking, more or less the same as asymptotic cycles introduced by S.
Schwartzman)is obtained. The latter result on cycles is in fact a
generalization of the analogous result proven by S. Smirnov for classical
Whitney currents in a Euclidean space. The same results are true for every
complete metric space under suitable set-theoretic assumptions.
