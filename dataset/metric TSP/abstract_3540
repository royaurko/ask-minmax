The theory of General Relativity explaines the advance of Mercury perihelion
using space curvature and the Schwartzschild metric. We demonstrate that this
phenomena can also be interpreted due to the cogravitational field produced by
the apparent motion of the Sun around Mercury giving exactly the same estimate
as derived from the Schwartzschild metric in general relativity theory. This is
a surprising result because the estimate from both theoretical approaches match
exactly the measured value. The discussion and implications of this result is
out of the scope of the present work.
