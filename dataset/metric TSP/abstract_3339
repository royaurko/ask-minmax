The general structure of the spherically symmetric solutions in the Weyl
conformal gravity is described. The corresponding Bach equation are derived for
the special type of metrics, which can be considered as the representative of
the general class. The complete set of the pure vacuum solutions is found. It
consists of two classes. The first one contains the solutions with constant
two-dimensional curvature scalar of our specific metrics, and the
representatives are the famous Robertson-Walker metrics. One of them we called
the "gravitational bubbles", which is compact and with zero Weyl tensor. The
second class is more general, with varying curvature scalar. We found its
representative as the one-parameter family. It appears that it can be
conformally covered by the thee-parameter Mannheim-Kazanas solution. We also
investigated the general structure of the energy-momentum tensor in the
spherical conformal gravity and constructed the vectorial equation that reveals
clearly the same features of non-vacuum solutions. One of them, the metrics a
la Vaidya, is explicitly written.
