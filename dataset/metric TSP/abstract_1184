For spin manifolds with boundary we consider Riemannian metrics which are
product near the boundary and are such that the corresponding Dirac operator is
invertible when half-infinite cylinders are attached at the boundary. The main
result of this paper is that these properties of a metric can be preserved when
the metric is extended over a handle of codimension at least two attached at
the boundary. Applications of this result include the construction of
non-isotopic metrics with invertible Dirac operator, and a concordance
existence and classification theorem.
