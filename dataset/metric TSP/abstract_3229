The classical nu-metric introduced by Vinnicombe in robust control theory for
rational plants was extended to classes of nonrational transfer functions in
Ball and Sasane [Complex Analysis and Operator Theory; 2012]. In Sasane
[Mathematics of Control and Related Fields; 2012], an extension of the
classical nu-metric was given when the underlying ring of stable transfer
functions is the Hardy algebra, H^infty. However, this particular extension to
H^infty did not directly fit in the abstract framework given in Ball and Sasane
[CAOT 2012]. In this paper we show that the case of H^infty also fits into the
general abstract framework in [BS CAOT 2012] and that the nu-metric defined in
this setting is identical to the extension of the nu-metric defined in Sasane
[MCRF 2012]. This is done by introducing a particular Banach algebra, which is
the inductive limit of certain C*-algebras.
