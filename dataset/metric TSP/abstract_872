We show that on Kahler manifolds with negative first Chern class, the
sequence of algebraic metrics introduced by H. Tsuji converges uniformly to the
Kahler-Einstein metric. For algebraic surfaces of general type and orbifolds
with isolated singularities, we prove a convergence result for a modified
version of Tsuji's iterative construction.
