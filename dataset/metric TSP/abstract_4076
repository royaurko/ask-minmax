We demonstrate a family of Strichartz estimates for the conformally invariant
Klein-Gordon equation on a class of asymptotically de Sitter spaces with C^2
metrics by using well-known local Strichartz estimates and a rescaling
argument. This class of metrics includes de Sitter space. We also give an
application of the estimates to a semilinear Klein-Gordon equation on these
spaces.
