We prove that, in dimensions greater than 2, the generic metric is not a
Hessian metric and find a curvature condition on Hessian metrics in dimensions
greater than 3. In particular we prove that the forms used to define the
Pontryagin classes in terms of the curvature vanish on a Hessian manifold. By
contrast all analytic Riemannian 2-metrics are Hessian metrics.
