In this paper, we develop an information entropy based metric that represents
the statistical quality of the generated binary sequence in Truly Random Number
Generators (TRNG). The metric can be used for the design and optimization of
the TRNG circuits as well as the development of efficient post-processing units
for recovering the degraded statistical characteristics of the signal due to
process variations.
