In this paper we study the Sasakian geometry on S^3-bundles over a Riemann
surface of genus g>0 with emphasis on extremal Sasaki metrics. We prove the
existence of a countably infinite number of inequivalent contact structures on
the total space of such bundles that admit 2-dimensional Sasaki cones each with
a Sasaki metric of constant scalar curvature (CSC). This CSC Sasaki metric is
most often irregular. We further study the extremal subset in the Sasaki cone
showing that if 0<g<5 it exhausts the entire cone. Examples are given where
exhaustion fails.
