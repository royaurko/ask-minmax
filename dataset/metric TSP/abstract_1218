We say that a metric graph is uniformly bounded if the degrees of all
vertices are uniformly bounded and the lengths of edges are pinched between two
positive constants; a metric space is approximable by a uniform graph if there
is one within a finite Gromov-Hausdorff distance. We show that the Euclidean
plane and Gromov hyperbolic geodesic spaces with bounded geometry are
approximable by uniform graphs, and pose a number of open problems.
