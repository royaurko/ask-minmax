On the product of two Finsler manifolds M1 M2, we consider the twisted metric
F which is construct by using Finsler metrics F1 and F2 on the manifolds M1 and
M2, respectively. We introduce horizontal and vertical distributions on twisted
product Finsler manifold and study Creducible and semi-C-reducible properties
of this manifold. Then we obtain the Riemannian curvature and some of
non-Riemannian curvatures of the twisted product Finsler manifold such as
Berwald curvature, mean Berwald curvature and we find the relations between
these objects and their corresponding objects on M1 and M2. Finally, we study
locally dually flat twisted product Finsler manifold.
