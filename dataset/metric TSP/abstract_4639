In the first part of this article I present a system of retarded coordinates
based at an arbitrary world line of an arbitrary curved spacetime. The
retarded-time coordinate labels forward light cones that are centered on the
world line, the radial coordinate is an affine parameter on the null generators
of these light cones, and the angular coordinates are constant on each of these
generators. The spacetime metric in the retarded coordinates is displayed as an
expansion in powers of the radial coordinate and expressed in terms of the
world line's acceleration vector and the spacetime's Riemann tensor evaluated
at the world line. The formalism is illustrated in two examples, the first
involving a comoving world line of a spatially-flat cosmology, the other
featuring an observer in circular motion in the Schwarzschild spacetime. The
main application of the formalism is presented in the second part of the
article, in which I consider the motion of a small black hole in an empty
external universe. I use the retarded coordinates to construct the metric of
the small black hole perturbed by the tidal field of the external universe, and
the metric of the external universe perturbed by the presence of the black
hole. Matching these metrics produces the MiSaTaQuWa equations of motion for
the small black hole.
