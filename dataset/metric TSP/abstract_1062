The metric on the moduli space of charge (2,1) SU(3)
Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield monopoles is calculated and investigated. The
hyperKahler quotient construction is used to provide an alternative derivation
of the metric. Various properties of the metric are derived using the
hyperKahler quotient construction and the correspondence between BPS monopoles
and rational maps. Several interesting limits of the metric are also
considered.
