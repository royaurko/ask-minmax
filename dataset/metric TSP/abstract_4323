Using an intuition from metric geometry, we prove that any flag and normal
simplicial complex satisfies the non-revisiting path conjecture. As a
consequence, the diameter of its facet-ridge graph is smaller than the number
of vertices minus the dimension, as in the Hirsch conjecture. This proves the
Hirsch conjecture for all flag polytopes, and more generally, for all
(connected) flag homology manifolds.
