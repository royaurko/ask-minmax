We develop further the integration procedure in the generalised invariant
formalism, and demonstrate its efficiency by obtaining a class of Petrov type N
pure radiation metrics without any explicit integration, and with comparatively
little detailed calculations. The method is similar to the one exploited by
Edgar and Vickers when deriving the general conformally flat pure radiation
metric. A major addition to the technique is the introduction of non-intrinsic
elements in generalised invariant formalism, which can be exploited to keep
calculations manageable.
