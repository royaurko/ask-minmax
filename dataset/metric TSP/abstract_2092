We derive the five dimensional Myers-Perry metric via an elementary method to
solve the vacuum Einstein field equations directly. This method firstly
proposed by Clotz is very simple since it merely involves four components of
Ricci tensor and only requires us to deal with some equations without second
derivatives' terms when the metric ansatz is assumed to take an appropriate
form.
