We show that a compact complex surface which admits a conformally K\"ahler
metric g of positive orthogonal holomorphic bisectional curvature is
biholomorphic to the complex projective plane. In addition, if g is a Hermitian
metric which is Einstein, then the biholomorphism can be chosen to be an
isometry via which g becomes a multiple of the Fubini-Study metric.
