We consider Laplacians on periodic equilateral metric graphs. The spectrum of
the Laplacian consists of an absolutely continuous part (which is a union of an
infinite number of non-degenerated spectral bands) plus an infinite number of
flat bands, i.e., eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity. We estimate the
Lebesgue measure of the bands on a finite interval in terms of geometric
parameters of the graph. The proof is based on spectral properties of discrete
Laplacians.
