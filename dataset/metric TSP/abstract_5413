Let $(N, J)$ be a simply connected $2n$-dimensional nilpotent Lie group
endowed with an invariant complex structure. We define a left invariant
Riemannian metric on $N$ compatible with $J$ to be minimal, if it minimizes the
norm of the invariant part of the Ricci tensor among all compatible metrics
with the same scalar curvature. In [L1], J. Lauret proved that minimal metrics
(if any) are unique up to isometry and scaling. This uniqueness allows us to
distinguish two complex structures with Riemannian data, giving rise to a great
deal of invariants.
  We show how to use a Riemannian invariant: the eigenvalues of the Ricci
operator, polynomial invariants and discrete invariants to give an alternative
proof of the pairwise non-isomorphism between the structures which have
appeared in the classification of abelian complex structures on 6-dimensional
nilpotent Lie algebras given in [ABD]. We also present some continuous families
in dimension 8.
