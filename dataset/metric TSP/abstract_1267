It was recently shown that RGHW (relative generalized Hamming weight) exactly
expresses the security of linear ramp secret sharing scheme. In this paper we
determine the true value of the asymptotic metric for RGHW previously proposed
by Zhuang et al. in 2013. Then we propose new asymptotic metrics useful for
investigating the optimal performance of linear ramp secret sharing scheme
constructed from a pair of linear codes. We also determine the true values of
the proposed metrics in many cases.
