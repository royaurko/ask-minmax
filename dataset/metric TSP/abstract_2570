We show that solutions of the Seiberg-Witten equations lead to non-trivial
lower bounds for the L2-norm of the Weyl curvature of a compact Riemannian
4-manifold. These estimates are then used to derive new obstructions to the
existence of Einstein metrics. These results considerably refine those
previously obtained using scalar-curvature estimates alone.
