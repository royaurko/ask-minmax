A prominent tool in many problems involving metric spaces is a notion of
randomized low-diameter decomposition. Loosely speaking, $\beta$-decomposition
refers to a probability distribution over partitions of the metric into sets of
low diameter, such that nearby points (parameterized by $\beta>0$) are likely
to be "clustered" together. Applying this notion to the shortest-path metric in
edge-weighted graphs, it is known that $n$-vertex graphs admit an $O(\ln
n)$-padded decomposition (Bartal, 1996), and that excluded-minor graphs admit
$O(1)$-padded decomposition (Klein, Plotkin and Rao 1993, Fakcharoenphol and
Talwar 2003, Abraham et al. 2014).
  We design decompositions to the family of $p$-path-separable graphs, which
was defined by Abraham and Gavoille (2006). and refers to graphs that admit
vertex-separators consisting of at most $p$ shortest paths in the graph.
  Our main result is that every $p$-path-separable $n$-vertex graph admits an
$O(\ln (p \ln n))$-decomposition, which refines the $O(\ln n)$ bound for
general graphs, and provides new bounds for families like bounded-treewidth
graphs. Technically, our clustering process differs from previous ones by
working in (the shortest-path metric of) carefully chosen subgraphs.
