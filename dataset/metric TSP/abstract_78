In this paper, we characterize locally dually flat generalized m-th root
Finsler metrics. Then we find a condition under which a generalized m-th root
metric is projectively related to a m-th root metric. Finally, we prove that if
a generalized m-th root metric is conformal to a m-th root metric, then both of
them reduce to Riemannian metrics.
