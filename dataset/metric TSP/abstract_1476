Using methods of A. Grigor'yan and L. Saloff-Coste we prove that on a
manifold with a conical end the heat kernel has a Gaussian bound. This result
is applied to asymptotically conical K\"ahler manifolds. It is a result of the
contributor and R. Goto that a crepant resolution of a Ricci-flat K\"ahler cone
admits a Ricci-flat K\"ahler metric asymptotic to the cone metric in every
K\"ahler class. We prove the sharp rate of convergence of the metric to the
cone metric. For compact K\"ahler classes this is the same as for the
Ricci-flat ALE metrics of P. Kronheimer and D. Joyce.
