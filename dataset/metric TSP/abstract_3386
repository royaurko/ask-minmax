In this note we continue the analysis of metric measure space with variable
ricci curvature bounds. First, we study $(\kappa,N)$-convex functions on metric
spaces where $\kappa$ is a lower semi-continuous function, and gradient flow
curves in the sense of a new evolution variational inequality that captures the
information that is provided by $\kappa$. Then, in the spirit of previous work
by Erbar, Kuwada and Sturm \cite{erbarkuwadasturm} we introduce an entropic
curvature-dimension condition $CD^e(\kappa,N)$ for metric measure spaces and
lower semi-continuous $\kappa$. This condition is stable with respect to Gromov
convergence and we show that is equivalent to the reduced curvature-dimension
condition $CD^*(\kappa,N)$ provided the space is non-branching. Finally, we
introduce a Riemannian curvature-dimension condition in terms of an evolution
variational inequality on the Wasserstein space. A consequence is a new
differential Wasserstein contraction estimate.
