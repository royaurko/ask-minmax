We consider Riemannian metrics compatible with the natural symplectic
structure on T^2 x M, where T^2 is a symplectic 2-Torus and M is a closed
symplectic manifold. To each such metric we attach the corresponding Laplacian
and consider its first positive eigenvalue \lambda_1. We show that \lambda_1
can be made arbitrarily large by deforming the metric structure, keeping the
symplectic structure fixed. The conjecture is that the same is true for any
symplectic manifold of dimension >= 4. We reduce the general conjecture to a
purely symplectic question.
