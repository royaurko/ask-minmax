Given two finitely generated groups that coarsely embed into a Hilbert space,
it is known that their wreath product also embeds coarsely into a Hilbert
space. We introduce a wreath product construction for general metric spaces
X,Y,Z and derive a condition, called the (delta-polynomial) path lifting
property, such that coarse embeddability of X,Y and Z implies coarse
embeddability of X\wr_Z Y. We also give bounds on the compression of X\wr_Z Y
in terms of delta and the compressions of X,Y and Z. Next, we investigate the
stability of the property of admitting a box space which coarsely embeds into a
Hilbert space under the taking of wreath products. We show that if an infinite
finitely generated residually finite group H has a coarsely embeddable box
space, then G\wr H has a coarsely embeddable box space if G is finitely
generated abelian. This leads, in particular, to new examples of bounded
geometry coarsely embeddable metric spaces without property A.
