Heterotic string compactifications on a $K3$ surface $\mathfrak{S}$ depend on
a choice of hyperk\"ahler metric, anti-self-dual gauge connection and
Kalb-Ramond flux, parametrized by hypermultiplet scalars. The metric on
hypermultiplet moduli space is in principle computable within the $(0,2)$
superconformal field theory on the heterotic string worldsheet, although little
is known about it in practice. Using duality with type II strings compactified
on a Calabi-Yau threefold, we predict the form of the quaternion-K\"ahler
metric on hypermultiplet moduli space when $\mathfrak{S}$ is elliptically
fibered, in the limit of a large fiber and even larger base. The result is in
general agreement with expectations from Kaluza-Klein reduction, in particular
the metric has a two-stage fibration structure, where the $B$-field moduli are
fibered over bundle and metric moduli, while bundle moduli are themselves
fibered over metric moduli. A more precise match must await a detailed analysis
of $R^2$-corrected ten-dimensional supergravity.
