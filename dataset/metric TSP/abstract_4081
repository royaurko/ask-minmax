We say that a distribution is harmonic if it is harmonic when considered as a
section of a Grassmann bundle. We find new examples of harmonic distributions
and show nonexistense of harmonic distrubutions on some Riemannian manifolds by
two different approaches. Firstly, we lift distributions to the second tangent
bundle equipped with the Sasaki metric. Secondly, we deform conformally the
metric on a base manifold.
