It has long been known that $d$-dimensional Euclidean point sets admit
$(1+\epsilon)$-stretch spanners with lightness $W_E = \epsilon^{-O(d)}$, that
is total edge weight at most $W_E$ times the weight of the minimum spaning tree
of the set [DHN93]. Whether or not a similar result holds for metric spaces
with low doubling dimension has remained an important open problem, and has
resisted numerous attempts at resolution. In this paper, we resolve the
question in the affirmative, and show that doubling spaces admit
$(1+\epsilon)$-stretch spanners with lightness $W_D =
(ddim/\epsilon)^{O(ddim)}$.
  Important in its own right, our result also implies a much faster
polynomial-time approximation scheme for the traveling salesman problemin
doubling metric spaces, improving upon the bound presented in [BGK-12].
