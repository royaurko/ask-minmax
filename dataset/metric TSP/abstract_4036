We quantize the open string in an arbitrary constant magnetic field with a
non factorized metric on a torus. We then discuss carefully the vertexes which
describe the emission of dipole open strings and closed strings in the non
compact limit. Finally we compute various stringy form factors which in the
compact case induces a Kaehler and complex structure dependence and suppression
of some amplitudes with KK states.
