The action of general relativity proposed by Capovilla, Jacobson and Dell is
written in terms of $SO(3)$ gauge fields and gives Ashtekar's constraints for
Einstein gravity. However, it does not depend on the space-time metric nor its
signature explicitly. We discuss how the space-time metric is introduced from
algebraic relations of the constraints and the Hamiltonian by focusing our
attention on the signature factor. The system describes both Euclidian and
Lorentzian metrics depending on reality assignments of the gauge connections.
That is, Euclidian metrics arise from the real gauge fields. On the other hand,
self-duality of the gauge fields, which is well known in the Ashtekar's
formalism, is also derived in this theory from consistency condition of
Lorentzian metric. We also show that the metric so determined is equivalent to
that given by Urbantke, which is usually accepted as a definition of the metric
for this system.
