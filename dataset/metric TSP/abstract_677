We extend the limit operator machinery of Rabinovich, Roch, and Silbermann
from $\mathbb{Z}^N$ to (bounded geometry, strongly) discrete metric spaces. We
do not assume the presence of any group structure or action on our metric
spaces. Using this machinery and recent ideas of Lindner and Seidel, we show
that if a metric space X has Yu's property A, then a band-dominated operator on
X is Fredholm if and only if all of its limit operators are invertible. We also
show that this always fails for metric spaces without property A.
