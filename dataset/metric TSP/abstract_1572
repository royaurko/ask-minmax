This paper is connected with the problem of describing path metric spaces
which are homeomorphic to manifolds and biLipschitz homogeneous, i.e., whose
biLipschitz homeomorphism group acts transitively.
  Our main result is the following. Let X = G/H be a homogeneous space of a Lie
group G, and let d be a geodesic distance on X inducing the same topology.
Suppose there exists a subgroup G_S of G which acts transitively on X, such
that each element g in G_S induces a locally biLipschitz homeomorphism of the
metric space (X,d). Then the metric is locally biLipschitz equivalent to a
sub-Riemannian metric. Any such metric is defined by a bracket generating
G_S-invariant sub-bundle of the tangent bundle.
  The result is a consequence of a more general fact that requires a transitive
family of uniformly biLipschitz diffeomorphisms with a control on their
differentials. However, we give a generalization that point out how crucial is
the assumption of having a locally compact group acting, since the group of
biLipschitz maps, unlikely the isometry group, is not locally compact.
  Our method also gives an elementary proof of the following fact: given a
Lipschitz sub-bundle of the tangent bundle of a Finsler manifold, then both the
class of piecewise differentiable curves tangent to the sub-bundle and the
class of Lipschitz curves almost everywhere tangent to the sub-bundle give rise
to the same Finsler-Carnot-Caratheodory metric, under the condition that the
topologies induced by these distances coincide with the manifold topology.
