Our interest is a regularity of a minimal singular metric of a line bundle.
One main conclusion of our general result in this paper is the existence of
continuous Hermitian metrics with semi-positive curvatures on the so-called
Zariski's example of a line bundle defined over the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$
at some twelve points. This is an example of a line bundle which is nef, big,
not semi-ample, and whose section ring is not finitely generated. We generalize
this result to the higher dimensional case when the stable base locus of a line
bundle is a smooth hypersurface with a holomorphic tubular neighborhood.
