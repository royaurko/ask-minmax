A generalisation of the four-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter metrics to include a
NUT charge is well known, and is included within a class of metrics obtained by
Plebanski. In this paper, we study a related class of Kerr-Taub-NUT-de Sitter
metrics in arbitrary dimensions D \ge 6, which contain three non-trivial
continuous parameters, namely the mass, the NUT charge, and a (single) angular
momentum. We demonstrate the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi and wave
equations, we construct a closely-related rank-2 Staeckel-Killing tensor, and
we show how the metrics can be written in a double Kerr-Schild form. Our
results encompass the case of the Kerr-de Sitter metrics in arbitrary
dimension, with all but one rotation parameter vanishing. Finally, we consider
the real Euclidean-signature continuations of the metrics, and show how in a
limit they give rise to certain recently-obtained complete non-singular compact
Einstein manifolds.
