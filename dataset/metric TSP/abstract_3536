The constructive method of conformal blocks is developed for the construction
of global solutions for two-dimensional metrics having one Killing vector. The
method is proved to yeild a smooth universal covering space with a smooth
pseudo-Riemannian metric. The Schwarzschild,
  Reisner--Nordstrom solutions, extremal black hole, dilaton black hole, and
constant curvature surfaces are considered as examples.
