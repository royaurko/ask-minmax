A normal form for edge metrics is derived under the necessary conditions that
the metric be normalized and exact. The normal forms for such an edge metric
are shown to be in 1-1 correspondence with representative metrics for a reduced
conformal infinity on the boundary. The normal form is constructed via solution
of a singular eikonal equation at infinity. The eikonal equation is solved by
proving existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions of a class of
characteristic nonlinear first-order initial value problems. This is carried
out by constructing a characteristic version of a Hamiltonian flow-out in the
first jet bundle of the solution.
