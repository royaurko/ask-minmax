Using the canonical Monte Carlo simulation technique, we study a Regge
calculus model on triangulated spherical surfaces. The discrete model is
statistical mechanically defined with the variables $X$, $g$ and $\rho$, which
denote the surface position in ${\bf R}^3$, the metric on a two-dimensional
surface $M$ and the surface density of $M$, respectively. The metric $g$ is
defined only by using the deficit angle of the triangles in {$M$}. This is in
sharp contrast to the conventional Regge calculus model, where {$g$} depends
only on the edge length of the triangles. We find that the discrete model in
this paper undergoes a phase transition between the smooth spherical phase at
$b to infty$ and the crumpled phase at $b to 0$, where $b$ is the bending
rigidity. The transition is of first-order and identified with the one observed
in the conventional model without the variables $g$ and $\rho$. This implies
that the shape transformation transition is not influenced by the metric
degrees of freedom. It is also found that the model undergoes a continuous
transition of in-plane deformation. This continuous transition is reflected in
almost discontinuous changes of the surface area of $M$ and that of $X(M)$,
where the surface area of $M$ is conjugate to the density variable $\rho$.
