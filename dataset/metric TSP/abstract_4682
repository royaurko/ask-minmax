This paper is a study of the interaction between the combinatorics of
boundaries of convex polytopes in arbitrary dimension and their metric
geometry.
  Let S be the boundary of a convex polytope of dimension d+1, or more
generally let S be a `convex polyhedral pseudomanifold'. We prove that S has a
polyhedral nonoverlapping unfolding into R^d, so the metric space S is obtained
from a closed (usually nonconvex) polyhedral ball in R^d by identifying pairs
of boundary faces isometrically. Our existence proof exploits geodesic flow
away from a source point v in S, which is the exponential map to S from the
tangent space at v. We characterize the `cut locus' (the closure of the set of
points in S with more than one shortest path to v) as a polyhedral complex in
terms of Voronoi diagrams on facets. Analyzing infinitesimal expansion of the
wavefront consisting of points at constant distance from v on S produces an
algorithmic method for constructing Voronoi diagrams in each facet, and hence
the unfolding of S. The algorithm, for which we provide pseudocode, solves the
discrete geodesic problem. Its main construction generalizes the source
unfolding for boundaries of 3-polytopes into R^2. We present conjectures
concerning the number of shortest paths on the boundaries of convex polyhedra,
and concerning continuous unfolding of convex polyhedra. We also comment on the
intrinsic non-polynomial complexity of nonconvex polyhedral manifolds.
