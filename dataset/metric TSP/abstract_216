We study the information metric on instanton moduli spaces in two-dimensional
nonlinear sigma models. In the CP^1 model, the information metric on the moduli
space of one instanton with the topological charge Q=k which is any positive
integer is a three-dimensional hyperbolic metric, which corresponds to
Euclidean anti--de Sitter space-time metric in three dimensions, and the
overall scale factor of the information metric is (4k^2)/3; this means that the
sectional curvature is -3/(4k^2). We also calculate the information metric in
the CP^2 model.
