In this work, using Moreau envelopes, we define a complete metric for the set
of proper lower semicontinuous convex functions. Under this metric, the
convergence of each sequence of convex functions is epi-convergence. We show
that the set of strongly convex functions is dense but it is only of the first
category. On the other hand, it is shown that the set of convex functions with
strong minima is of the second category.
