We investigate the relationship between measurable differentiable structures
on doubling metric measure spaces and derivations. We prove: [1] a
decomposition theorem for the module of derivations into free modules; [2] the
existence of a measurable differentiable structure assuming that one can
control the pointwise upper Lipschitz constant of a function through
derivations; [3] an extension of a result of Keith about the choice of chart
functions.
