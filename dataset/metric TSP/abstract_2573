Under mild assumptions on a group G, we prove that the class of complete
Riemannian n-manifolds of uniformly bounded negative sectional curvatures and
with the fundamental groups isomorphic to G breaks into finitely many
tangential homotopy types. It follows that many aspherical manifolds do not
admit complete negatively curved metrics with prescribed curvature bounds.
