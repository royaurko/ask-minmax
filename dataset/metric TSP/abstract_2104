We revisit an extension of the well-known formalism for gauge-invariant
scalar metric fluctuations, to study the spectrums for both, the inflaton and
gauge invariant (scalar) metric fluctuations in the framework of a single field
inflationary model where the quasi-exponential expansion is driven by an
inflation which is minimally coupled to gravity. The proposal here examined is
valid also for fluctuations with large amplitude, but for cosmological scales,
where vector and tensor perturbations can be neglected and the fluid is
irrotacional.
