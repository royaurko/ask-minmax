In this note we review the problem of time delay of photons propagating in a
spacetime with a metric that explicitly depends on the energy of the particles
(Gravity-Rainbow approach). We show that corrections due to this approach --
which is closely related to DSR proposal -- produce for small redshifts
($z<<1$) smaller time delays than in the generic Lorentz Invariance Violating
case.
