By using the generalized version of gauge/gravity correspondence, we study
the mass spectra of several typical QCD$_4$ glueballs in the framework of
AdS$_6$ black hole metric of Einstein gravity theory. The obtained glueball
mass spectra are numerically in agreement with those from the AdS$7 \times S^4$
black hole metric of the 11-dimensional supergravity.
