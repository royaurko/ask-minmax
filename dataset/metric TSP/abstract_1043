The metric to the two-dimensional dilaton gravity can be writen in an
alternative form, similar to the two-dimensional Schwarzschild metric, and
allow us the identification of some quantitiies with those equivalent in the
Schwarzschild solution. This new form, howewer, presents a non-physical
singularity at the horizon in the same way that in the realistic four
dimensional case. We show a procedure to eliminate this horizon singularity
and, as an application, the resulting metric is used to obtain the associated
Hawking temperature. We discuss also some differents between this metric and
the Schwarzcchild one.
