We identify all uniform limits of polynomials on the closed unit disc with
respect to the chordal metric \c{hi} . One such limit is f=oo. The other limits
are holomorphic functions f:-->C so that for every {\zeta} in the boundary of
unit disc D the limf(z) while z-->{\zeta} exists in C U {oo}. The class of the
above functions is denoted by A(D)~. We study properties of the members of
A(D)~, as well as, some topological properties of A(D)~ endowed with its
natural metric topology. There are several open questions and new directions of
investigation.
