We generalize Exel's notion of partial group action to monoids. For partial
monoid actions that can be defined by means of suitably well-behaved systems of
generators and relations, we employ classical rewriting theory in order to
describe the universal induced global action on an extended set. This universal
action can be lifted to the setting of topological spaces and continuous maps,
as well as to that of metric spaces and non-expansive maps. Well-known
constructions such as Shimrat's homogeneous extension are special cases of this
construction. We investigate various properties of the arising spaces in
relation to the original space; in particular, we prove embedding theorems and
preservation properties concerning separation axioms and dimension. These
results imply that every normal (metric) space can be embedded into a normal
(metrically) ultrahomogeneous space of the same dimension and cardinality.
