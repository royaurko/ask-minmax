We prove that spaces of Keplerian curvilinear orbits, all orbits and elliptic
orbits with marked pericenter cannot carry a norm, compatible with their
standard topology. We also prove that the space of Keplerian elliptic orbits
without marked pericenter cannot carry a norm, compatible with the natural
metrics on it.
