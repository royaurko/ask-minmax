We introduce and study $H$-paracontact metric manifolds, that is, paracontact
metric manifolds whose Reeb vector field $\xi$ is harmonic. We prove that they
are characterized by the condition that $\xi$ is a Ricci eigenvector. We then
investigate how harmonicity of the Reeb vector field $\xi$ of a paracontact
metric manifold is related to some other relevant geometric properties, like
infinitesimal harmonic transformations and paracontact Ricci solitons.
