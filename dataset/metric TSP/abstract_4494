We consider an Orlicz space based cohomology for metric (measured) spaces
with bounded geometry. We prove the quasi-isometry invariance for a general
Young function. In the hyperbolic case, we prove that the degree one cohomology
can be identified with an Orlicz-Besov function space on the boundary at
infinity. We give some applications to the large scale geometry of homogeneous
spaces with negative curvature (Heintze groups). As our main result, we prove
that if the Heintze group is not of Carnot type, any self quasi-isometry fixes
a distinguished point on the boundary and preserves a certain foliation on the
complement of that point.
