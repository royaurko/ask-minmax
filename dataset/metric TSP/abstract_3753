We prove that many simply connected symplectic four-manifolds dissolve after
connected sum with only one copy of $S^{2}\times S^{2}$.
  For any finite group G that acts freely on the three-sphere we construct
closed smooth four-manifolds with fundamental group G which do not admit
metrics of positive scalar curvature, but whose universal covers do admit such
metrics.
