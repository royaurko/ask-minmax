We exploit an interpretation of gravity as the symmetry broken phase of a de
Sitter gauge theory to construct new solutions to the first order field
equations. The new solutions are constructed by performing large $Spin(4,1)$
gauge transformations on the ordinary de Sitter solution and extracting first
the tetrad, then the induced metric. The class of metrics so obtained is an
infinite class labelled by an integer, $q$. Each solution satisfies the local
field equations defining constant positive curvature, and is therefore locally
isometric to de Sitter space wherever the metric is non-degenerate. The
degeneracy structure of the tetrad and metric reflects the topological
differences among the solutions with different $q$. By topological arguments we
show that the solutions are physically distinct with respect to the symmetries
of Einstein-Cartan theory. Ultimately, the existence of solutions of this type
may be a distinguishing characteristic of gravity as a metric theory versus
gravity as a gauge theory.
