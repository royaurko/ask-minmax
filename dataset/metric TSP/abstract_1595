We study static massless minimally coupled scalar field created by a source
in a static D-dimensional spacetime. We demonstrate that the corresponding
equation for this field is invariant under a special transformation of the
background metric. This transformation consists of the static conformal
transformation of the spatial part of the metric accompanied by a properly
chosen transformation of the red-shift factor. Both transformations are
determined by one function of the spatial coordinates. We show that in a case
of higher dimensional spherically symmetric black holes one can find such a
bi-conformal transformation that the symmetry of the D-dimensional metric is
enhanced after its application. Namely, the metric becomes a direct sum of the
metric on a unit sphere and the metric of 2D anti-de Sitter space. The method
of the heat kernels is used to find the Green function in this new space, that
allows one, after dimensional reduction, to obtain a static Green function in
the original space of the static black hole. The general useful representation
of static Green functions is obtained in the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini
spacetimes of arbitrary dimension. The exact explicit expressions for the
static Green functions are obtained in such metrics for D < 6. It is shown that
in the four dimensional case the corresponding Green function coincides with
the Copson solution.
