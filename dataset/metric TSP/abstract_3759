We consider whether any two triangulations of a polygon or a point set on a
non-planar surface with a given metric can be transformed into each other by a
sequence of edge flips. The answer is negative in general with some remarkable
exceptions, such as polygons on the cylinder, and on the flat torus, and
certain configurations of points on the cylinder.
