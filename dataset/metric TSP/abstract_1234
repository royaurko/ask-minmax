In this article, we define the Coifman-Meyer-Stein tent spaces
$T^{p,q,\alpha}(X)$ associated with an arbitrary metric measure space
$(X,d,\mu)$ under minimal geometric assumptions. While gradually strengthening
our geometric assumptions, we prove duality, interpolation, and change of
aperture theorems for the tent spaces. Because of the inherent technicalities
in dealing with abstract metric measure spaces, most proofs are presented in
full detail.
