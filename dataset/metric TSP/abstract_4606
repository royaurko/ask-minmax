A relativistic wave equation for spin 1/2 particles in the Melvin space-time,
a space-time where the metric is determined by a magnectic field, is obtained.
The effects of very intense magnetic fields in the energy levels, as intense as
the ones expected to be produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions,
are investigated.
