The symplectic structures on $3$-Lie algebras and metric symplectic $3$-Lie
algebras are studied. For arbitrary $3$-Lie algebra $L$, infinite many metric
symplectic $3$-Lie algebras are constructed. It is proved that a metric $3$-Lie
algebra $(A, B)$ is a metric symplectic $3$-Lie algebra if and only if there
exists an invertible derivation $D$ such that $D\in Der_B(A)$, and is also
proved that every metric symplectic $3$-Lie algebra $(\tilde{A}, \tilde{B},
\tilde{\omega})$ is a $T^*_{\theta}$-extension of a metric symplectic $3$-Lie
algebra $(A, B, \omega)$. Finally, we construct a metric symplectic double
extension of a metric symplectic $3$-Lie algebra by means of a special
derivation.
