The problem of the existence of particles with negative energies inside and
outside of Schwarzschild, charged and rotating black holes is investigated.
Different definitions of the energy of the particle inside the Schwarzschild
black hole are analyzed and it is shown in what cases this energy can be
negative. A comparison is made for the cases of rotating black holes described
by the Kerr metric when the energy of the particle can be negative in the
ergosphere and the Reissner-Nordstrom metric.
