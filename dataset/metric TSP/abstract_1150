The exact static spherically symmetric solutions for pure-aether theory and
Einstein-aether theory are presented. It is shown that both theories can
deliver the Schwarzschild metric, but only the Einstein-aether theory contains
solutions with "almost-Schwarzschild" metrics that satisfy Einstein's
experiments. Two specific solutions are of special interest: one in pure-aether
theory that derives the attractive nature of gravitation as a result of
Minskowski signature of the metric, and one - the Jacobson solution- of
Einstein-aether theory with "almost-Schwarzschild" metric and non-zero Ricci
tensor.
