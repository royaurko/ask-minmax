We study the dynamics of fixed point free mappings on the interior of a
normal, closed cone in a Banach space that are nonexpansive with respect to
Hilbert's metric or Thompson's metric. We establish several Denjoy-Wolff type
theorems that confirm conjectures by Karlsson and Nussbaum for an important
class of nonexpansive mappings. We also extend and put into a broader
perspective results by Gaubert and Vigeral concerning the linear escape rate of
such nonexpansive mappings.
