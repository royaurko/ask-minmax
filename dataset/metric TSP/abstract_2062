In a previous paper (arXiv:math-ph/0604055) we introduced a very simple
PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with real spectrum and derived a closed
formula for the metric operator relating the problem to a Hermitian one. In
this note we propose an alternative formula for the metric operator, which we
believe is more elegant and whose construction -- based on a backward use of
the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators -- provides new insights into
the nature of the model.
