In this paper we study the behaviour of the holomorphic sectional curvature
(or Gaussian curvature) of the Bergman metric of planar annuli. The results are
then utilized to construct a domain for which the curvature is divergent at one
of its boundary points and moreover the limes superior is the maximal possible
for the Bergman metric (2), whereas the limes inferior is $-\infty$.
