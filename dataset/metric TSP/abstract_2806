We provide observations that Finsler geometry could be useful tools to
construct higher-spin theories. We suggest that a Finsler metric of constant
flag curvature can be regarded as a metric encoding higher-spin fields. We also
show that the Fronsdal's equations for free higher-spin fields can be derived
from equations of motion of constant curvature in Finsler geometry.
