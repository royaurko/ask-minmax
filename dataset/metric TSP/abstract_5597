We show that fuzzy spheres are solutions of ${\it Lorentzian}$ IKKT matrix
models. The fuzzy sphere solutions serve as toy models of closed noncommutative
cosmologies where big bang/crunch singularities appear only after taking the
commutative limit. The commutative limit of these solutions corresponds to a
sphere embedded in Minkowski space. This `sphere' has several novel features.
The induced metric does not agree with the standard metric on the sphere, and
moreover, it does not have a fixed signature. The curvature computed from the
induced metric is not constant, has singularities at fixed latitudes (not
corresponding to the poles) and is negative. Perturbations are made about the
solutions, and are shown to yield a scalar field theory on the sphere in the
commutative limit. The scalar field can become tachyonic for a range of the
parameters of the theory.
