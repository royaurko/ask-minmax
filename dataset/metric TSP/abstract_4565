We shall prove that the Hilbert cube cannot be separated by a weakly infinite
dimensional subset. As a corollary we obtain that the complement of a weakly
infinite dimensional subset of the space of complete non negatively curved
metrics is continuum connected. We can extend this result to the associated
moduli space when the set removed is a Hausdorff space with Haver's property C.
These results are refinements of theorems proven by Belegradek and Hu.
