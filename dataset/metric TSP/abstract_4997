We revisit the integral formulation (or Green's function approach) of
Einstein's equations in the context of braneworlds. The integral formulation
has been proposed independently by several contributors in the past, based on the
assumption that it is possible to give a reinterpretation of the local metric
field in curved spacetimes as an integral expression involving sources and
boundary conditions. This allows one to separate source-generated and
source-free contributions to the metric field. As a consequence, an exact
meaning to Mach's Principle can be achieved in the sense that only
source-generated (matter fields) contributions to the metric are allowed for;
universes which do not obey this condition would be non-Machian. In this paper,
we revisit this idea concentrating on a Randall-Sundrum-type model with a
non-trivial cosmology on the brane. We argue that the role of the surface term
(the source-free contribution) in the braneworld scenario may be quite subtler
than in the 4D formulation. This may pose, for instance, an interesting issue
to the cosmological constant problem.
