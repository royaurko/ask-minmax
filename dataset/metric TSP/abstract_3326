In this paper we study the ghost-free bimetric action extended by a recently
proposed coupling to matter through a composite metric. The equations of motion
for this theory are derived using a method which avoids varying the square-root
matrix that appears in the matter coupling. We make an ansatz for which the
metrics are proportional to each other and find that it can solve the equations
provided that one parameter in the action is fixed. In this case, the
proportional metrics as well as the effective metric that couples to matter
solve Einstein's equations of general relativity including a matter source.
Around these backgrounds we derive the quadratic action for perturbations,
diagonalized into a massive and a massless spin-2 fluctuation. We find that
only the massless spin-2 mode interacts with matter; a result which is
independent of the remaining parameters of the theory.
