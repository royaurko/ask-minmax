The M-relative distance, denoted by \rho_M is a generalization of the
p-relative distance, which was introduced by Ren-Cang Li. We establish
necessary and sufficient conditions under which \rho_M is a metric. In two
special cases we derive complete characterizations of the metric. We also
present a way of extending the results to metrics sensitive to the domain in
which they are defined, thus finding some connections to previously studied
metrics.
  An auxiliary result of independent interest is an inequality related to
Pittenger's inequality in Section 4.
