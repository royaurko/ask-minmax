Johnson and Schechtman (2009) characterized superreflexivity in terms of
finite diamond graphs. The present contributor characterized the Radon-Nikod\'ym
property (RNP) for dual spaces in terms of the infinite diamond. This paper is
devoted to further study of relations between metric characterizations of
superreflexivity and the RNP for dual spaces. The main result is that finite
subsets of any set $M$ whose embeddability characterizes the RNP for dual
spaces, characterize superreflexivity. It is also observed that the converse
statement does not hold, and that $M=\ell_2$ is a counterexample.
