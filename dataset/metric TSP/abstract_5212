We investigate Killing tensors for various black hole solutions of
supergravity theories. Rotating black holes of an ungauged theory, toroidally
compactified heterotic supergravity, with NUT parameters and two U(1) gauge
fields are constructed. If both charges are set equal, then the solutions
simplify, and then there are concise expressions for rank-2 conformal
Killing-Stackel tensors. These are induced by rank-2 Killing-Stackel tensors of
a conformally related metric that possesses a separability structure. We
directly verify the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation on this
conformally related metric, and of the null Hamilton-Jacobi and massless
Klein-Gordon equations on the "physical" metric. Similar results are found for
more general solutions; we mainly focus on those with certain charge
combinations equal in gauged supergravity, but also consider some other
solutions.
