We derive a formula for the L^2 norm of the scalar curvature of any extremal
Kaehler metric on a compact toric manifold, stated purely in terms of the
geometry of the corresponding moment polytope. The main interest of this
formula pertains to the case of complex dimension 2, where it plays a key role
in construction of Bach-flat metrics on appropriate 4-manifolds.
