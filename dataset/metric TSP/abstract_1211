We construct quasi-Einstein metrics on some hypersurface families. The
hypersurfaces are circle bundles over the product of Fano, K\"ahler-Einstein
manifolds. The quasi-Einstein metrics are related to various gradient
K\"ahler-Ricci solitons constructed by Dancer and Wang and some Hermitian,
non-K\"ahler, Einstein metrics constructed by Wang and Wang on the same
manifolds.
