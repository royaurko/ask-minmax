We will consider close-to-convexity of the metric balls defined by the
quasihyperbolic metric and the $j$-metric. We will show that the $j$-metric
balls with small radii are close-to-convex in general subdomains of $\Rn$ and
the quasihyperbolic balls with small radii are close-to-convex in the punctured
space.
