When sources are added at their right-hand sides, and g_{(ik)} is a priori
assumed to be the metric, the equations of Einstein's Hermitian theory of
relativity were shown to allow for an exact solution that describes the general
electrostatic field of n point charges. Moreover, the injunction of spherical
symmetry of g_{(ik)} in the infinitesimal neighbourhood of each of the charges
was proved to yield the equilibrium conditions of the n charges in keeping with
ordinary electrostatics. The tensor g_{(ik)}, however, cannot be the metric of
the theory, since it enters neither the eikonal equation nor the equation of
motion of uncharged test particles. A physically correct metric that rules both
the behaviour of wave fronts and of uncharged matter is the one indicated by
H\'ely. In the present paper it is shown how the electrostatic solution
predicts the structure of the n charged particles and their mutual positions of
electrostatic equilibrium when H\'ely's physically correct metric is adopted.
