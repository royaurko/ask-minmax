We study sequences of oriented Riemannian manifolds with boundary and, more
generally, integral current spaces and metric spaces with boundary. We prove
theorems demonstrating when the Gromov-Hausdorff [GH] and Sormani-Wenger
Intrinsic Flat [SWIF] limits of sequences of such metric spaces agree. Thus in
particular the limit spaces are countably $\mathcal{H}^n$ rectifiable spaces.
From these theorems we derive compactness theorems for sequences of Riemannian
manifolds with boundary where both the GH and SWIF limits agree. For sequences
of Riemannian manifolds with boundary we only require nonnegative Ricci
curvature, upper bounds on volume, noncollapsing conditions on the interior of
the manifold and diameter controls on the level sets near the boundary.
