We obtain a constraint on cosmological scalars for the FRW metric with a pure
radiation fluid source and positive cosmological constant. We demonstrate that
this constraint is conformally invariant in the context of Penrose's Conformal
Cyclic Cosmology proposal, where the metrics of the late stages of the previous
aeon and the early stages of the present aeon are described by FRW cosmologies.
