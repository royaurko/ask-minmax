We consider Schr\"odinger operators with real integrable potentials on
periodic metric graphs. We show that the wave operators exist and are complete.
Furthermore, we prove that the standard Fredholm determinant is well-defined
without any modification for any dimension. Moreover, the determinant is
analytic in the upper half-plane and the corresponding S-matrix satisfies the
Birman-Krein identity. The proof is based on a fiber direct integral for metric
Laplacians and a detailed analysis of the eigenvalues and the corresponding
eigenfunctions of the fiber operators. In particular, we show that all
eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are uniformly bounded.
