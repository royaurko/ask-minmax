We prove explicit upper and lower bounds for the $L^1$-moment spectra for the
Brownian motion exit time from extrinsic metric balls of submanifolds $P^m$ in
ambient Riemannian spaces $N^{n}$. We assume that $P$ and $N$ both have
controlled radial curvatures (mean curvature and sectional curvature,
respectively) as viewed from a pole in $N$. The bounds for the exit moment
spectra are given in terms of the corresponding spectra for geodesic metric
balls in suitably warped product model spaces. The bounds are sharp in the
sense that equalities are obtained in characteristic cases. As a corollary we
also obtain new intrinsic comparison results for the exit time spectra for
metric balls in the ambient manifolds $N^n$ themselves.
