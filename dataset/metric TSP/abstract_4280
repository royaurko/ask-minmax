We study the clustering of the lowest non negative eigenvalue of the Dirac
operator on a general Dirac bundle when the metric structure is varied. In the
classical case we show that any closed spin manifold of dimension greater than
or equal to four has a Riemannian metric admitting non trivial harmonic
spinors.
