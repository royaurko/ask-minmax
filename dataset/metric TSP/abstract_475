Most trainable machine translation (MT) metrics train their weights on human
judgments of state-of-the-art MT systems outputs. This makes trainable metrics
biases in many ways. One of them is preferring longer translations. These
biased metrics when used for tuning are evaluating different types of
translations -- n-best lists of translations with very diverse quality. Systems
tuned with these metrics tend to produce overly long translations that are
preferred by the metric but not by humans. This is usually solved by manually
tweaking metric's weights to equally value recall and precision. Our solution
is more general: (1) it does not address only the recall bias but also all
other biases that might be present in the data and (2) it does not require any
knowledge of the types of features used which is useful in cases when manual
tuning of metric's weights is not possible. This is accomplished by
self-training on unlabeled n-best lists by using metric that was initially
trained on standard human judgments. One way of looking at this is as domain
adaptation from the domain of state-of-the-art MT translations to diverse
n-best list translations.
