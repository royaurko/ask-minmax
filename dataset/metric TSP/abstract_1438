We construct propose an anzatz for Spin(7) metrics as an R-bundle over closed
G2 structures. These G2 structures are R3 bundles over 4-dimensional compact
quaternion Kahler spaces. The inspiration for the anzatz metric comes from the
Bryant-Salamon construction of G2 holonomy metrics and from the fact that the
twistor space of any compact quaternion Kahler space is Kahler-Einstein. The
reduction of the holonomy to a subgroup of Spin(7) gives non linear system
relating three unknown functions of one variable. We obtain a particular
solution and we find that the resulting metric is a Calabi-Yau cone over an
Einstein-Sassaki manifold which means that the holonomy is reduced to SU(4).
Another coordinate change show us that our metrics are hyperkahler cones known
as Swann bundles, thus the holonomy is reduced to Sp(2) and the cone is
tri-Sassakian. We revert our argument and state that the Swann bundle define a
closed G2 structure by reduction along an isometry. We calculate the torsion
classes for such structure explicitly.
