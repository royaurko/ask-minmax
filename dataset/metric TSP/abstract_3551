Second rank non-degenerate Killing tensors for some subclasses of spacetimes
admitting parallel null one-planes are investigated. Lichn\'erowicz radiation
conditions are imposed to provide a physical meaning to spacetimes whose
metrics are described through their associated second rank Killing tensors.
Conditions under which the dual spacetimes retain the same physical properties
are presented.
