In this paper we consider cosmological scaling solutions in general
relativity coupled to scalar fields with a non-trivial moduli space metric. We
discover that the scaling property of the cosmology is synonymous with the
scalar fields tracing out a particular class of geodesics in moduli space -
those which are constructed as integral curves of the gradient of the log of
the potential. Given a generic scalar potential we explicitly construct a
moduli metric that allows scaling solutions, and we show the converse - how one
can construct a potential that allows scaling once the moduli metric is known.
