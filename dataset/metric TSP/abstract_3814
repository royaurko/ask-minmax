We formulate the notion of the Finsleroid--Finsler space, including the
positive--definite as well as indefinite cases. The associated concepts of
angle, scalar product, and the distance function are elucidated. If the
Finsleroid--Finsler space is of Landsberg type, then the Finsleroid charge is a
constant. The Finsleroid--Finsler space proves to be a Berwald space if and
only if the Finsleroid--axis 1-form is parallel with respect to the associated
Riemannian metric and, simultaneously, the Finsleroid charge is a constant. The
necessary and sufficient conditions for the Finsleroid--Finsler space to be of
the Landsberg type are found, which are explicit and simple. The structure of
the associated curvature tensors has been elucidated.
