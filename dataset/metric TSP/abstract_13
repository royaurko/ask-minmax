Recent works on cost based relaxations have improved Constraint Programming
(CP) models for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We provide a short survey
over solving asymmetric TSP with CP. Then, we suggest new implied propagators
based on general graph properties. We experimentally show that such implied
propagators bring robustness to pathological instances and highlight the fact
that graph structure can significantly improve search heuristics behavior.
Finally, we show that our approach outperforms current state of the art
results.
