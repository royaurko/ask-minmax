The Caratheodory and Kobayashi metrics have proved to be important tools in
the function theory of several complex variables. But they are less familiar in
the context of one complex variable. Our purpose here is to gather in one place
the basic ideas about these important invariant metrics for domains in the
plane and to provide some illuminating examples and applications.
