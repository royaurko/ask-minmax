We introduce and study a notion of singular hermitian metrics on holomorphic
vector bundles, following Berndtsson and P{\u{a}}un. We define what it means
for such a metric to be curved in the sense of Griffiths and investigate the
assumptions needed in order to locally define the cuvature $\Theta^h$ as a
matrix of currents. We then proceed to show that such metrics can be
regularised in such a way that the corresponding curvature tensors converge
weakly to $\Theta^h$. Finally we define what it means for $h$ to be strictly
negatively curved in the sense of Nakano and show that it is possible to
regularise such metrics with a sequence of smooth, strictly Nakano negative
metrics.
