We show that almost all metric--affine theories of gravity yield Einstein
equations with a non--null cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Under certain
circumstances and for any dimension, it is also possible to incorporate a Weyl
vector field $W_\mu$ and therefore the presence of an anisotropy. The viability
of these field equations is discussed in view of recent astrophysical
observations.
