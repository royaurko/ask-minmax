Software engineering activities in the Industry has come a long way with
various improve- ments brought in various stages of the software development
life cycle. The complexity of modern software, the commercial constraints and
the expectation for high quality products demand the accurate fault prediction
based on OO design metrics in the class level in the early stages of software
development. The object oriented class metrics are used as quality predictors
in the entire OO software development life cycle even when a highly iterative,
incremental model or agile software process is employed. Recent research has
shown some of the OO design metrics are useful for predicting fault-proneness
of classes. In this paper the empirical validation of a set of metrics proposed
by Chidamber and Kemerer is performed to assess their ability in predicting the
software quality in terms of fault proneness and degradation. We have also
proposed the design complexity of object-oriented software with Weighted
Methods per Class metric (WMC-CK metric) expressed in terms of Shannon entropy,
and error proneness.
