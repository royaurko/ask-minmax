We obtain the charged rotating black hole in conformal gravity. The metric is
asymptotic to the (anti-)de Sitter spacetime. The contribution to the metric
from the charges has a slower falloff than that in the Kerr-Newman AdS black
hole. We analyse the global structure and obtain all the thermodynamical
quantities including the mass, angular momentum, electric/magnetic charges and
their thermodynamical conjugates. We verify that the first law of
thermodynamics holds. We also obtain the new neutral rotating black holes that
are beyond Einstein metrics. In contrast to the static ones, these rotating
black holes have no parameters associated with the massive spin-2 hair.
