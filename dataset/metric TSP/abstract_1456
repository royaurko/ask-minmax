We introduce the notion of cotype of a metric space, and prove that for
Banach spaces it coincides with the classical notion of Rademacher cotype. This
yields a concrete version of Ribe's theorem, settling a long standing open
problem in the nonlinear theory of Banach spaces. We apply our results to
several problems in metric geometry. Namely, we use metric cotype in the study
of uniform and coarse embeddings, settling in particular the problem of
classifying when L_p coarsely or uniformly embeds into L_q. We also prove a
nonlinear analog of the Maurey-Pisier theorem, and use it to answer a question
posed by Arora, Lovasz, Newman, Rabani, Rabinovich and Vempala, and to obtain
quantitative bounds in a metric Ramsey theorem due to Matousek.
