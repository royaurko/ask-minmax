Electromagnetism in an inhomogeneous dielectric medium at rest is described
using the methods of differential geometry. In contrast to a general
relativistic approach the electromagnetic fields are discussed in
three-dimensional space only. The introduction of an appropriately chosen
three-dimensional metric leads to a significant simplification of the
description of light propagation in an inhomogeneous medium: light rays become
geodesics of the metric and the field vectors are parallel transported along
the rays. The new metric is connected to the usual flat space metric
diag[1,1,1] via a conformal transformation leading to new, effective values of
the medium parameters leading to an effective constant value of the index of
refraction n=1. The corresponding index of refraction is thus constant and so
is the effective velocity of light. Space becomes effectively empty but curved.
All deviations from straight line propagation are now due to curvature. The
approach is finally used for a discussion of the Riemann-Silberstein vector, an
alternative, complex formulation of the electromagnetic fields.
