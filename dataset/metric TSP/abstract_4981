We study master variables in the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli formalism. We show
that a specific choice of new variables is suitable for studying perturbation
theory from the viewpoint of radiation reaction calculations. With explicit
definition of the improved master variables in terms of components of metric
perturbations, we present the master equations, with source terms, and metric
reconstruction formulas. In the scheme using these new variables, we do not
need any time and radial integrations except for solving the master equation.
We also show that the master variable for even parity modes which satisfies the
same homogeneous equation as the odd parity case, obtained via
 Chandrasekhar transformation, does not have the good property in this sense.
