Geodesic completness and self-adjointness imply that the Hamiltonian for
anyons is the Laplacian with respect to the Weil-Petersson metric. This metric
is complete on the Deligne-Mumford compactification of moduli (configuration)
space. The structure of this compactification fixes the possible anyon
configurations. This allows us to identify anyons with singularities (elliptic
points with ramification $q^{-1}$) in the Poincar\'e metric implying that anyon
spectrum is chaotic for $n\ge 3$. Furthermore, the bound on the holomorphic
sectional curvature of moduli spaces implies a gap in the energy spectrum. For
$q=0$ (punctures) anyons are infinitely separated in the Poincar\'e metric
(hard-core). This indicates that the exclusion principle has a geometrical
intepretation. Finally we give the differential equation satisfied by the
generating function for volumes of the configuration space of anyons.
