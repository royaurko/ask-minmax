Let $X$ denote the complex projective plane, blown up at the nine base points
of a pencil of cubics, and let $D$ be any fiber of the resulting elliptic
fibration on $X$. Using ansatz metrics inspired by work of Gross-Wilson and a
PDE method due to Tian-Yau, we prove that $X \setminus D$ admits complete
Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics in most de Rham cohomology classes. If $D$ is
smooth, the metrics converge to split flat cylinders $\R^+ \times S^1 \times D$
at an exponential rate. In this case, we also obtain a partial uniqueness
result and a local description of the Einstein moduli space, which contains
cylindrical metrics whose cross-section does not split off a circle. If $D$ is
singular but of finite monodromy, they converge at least quadratically to flat
$T^2$-submersions over flat 2-dimensional cones which need not be quotients of
$\R^2$. If $D$ is singular of infinite monodromy, their volume growth rates are
4/3 and 2 for the Kodaira types ${\rm I}_b$ and ${{\rm I}_b}^*$, their
injectivity radii decay like $r^{-1/3}$ and $(\log r)^{-1/2}$, and their
curvature tensors decay like $r^{-2}$ and $r^{-2}(\log r)^{-1}$. In particular,
the ${\rm I}_b$ examples show that the curvature estimate from Cheeger-Tian
\cite{ct-einstein} cannot be improved in general.
