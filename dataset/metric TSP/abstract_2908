We consider a scenario in which our observable universe is a 3-dimensional
surface (3-brane) living in extra dimensions with a warped geometry. We show
that ``lensed'' density perturbations from other branes serve as possible seeds
for structure formation on our observable brane (without inflation), and, in
addition, provide constraints on braneworld scenarios with warped bulk
geometry. Due to the warped bulk metric, any perturbation generated on one
brane (or in the bulk matter) appears to an observer on a second brane to have
a significantly different amplitude. We analyze lensed perturbations in the
Randall-Sundrum type scenarios and the ``shortcut metric'' scenarios. For
Lorentz violating metrics in the bulk, we find the attractive possibility that
large density fluctuations that are causally produced elsewhere can lead to
small density fluctuations on our brane on superhorizon (acausal) length
scales, as required by structure formation. Our most interesting result is that
the ``shortcut metrics'' in which geodesics traverse the extra dimensions
provide an alternative to inflation with two important features: a possible
solution to the horizon problem and a mechanism to generate perturbations
necessary for structure formation.
