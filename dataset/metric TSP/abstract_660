We address the problem of multipermutation code design in the Ulam metric for
novel storage applications. Multipermutation codes are suitable for flash
memory where cell charges may share the same rank. Changes in the charges of
cells manifest themselves as errors whose effects on the retrieved signal may
be measured via the Ulam distance. As part of our analysis, we study
multipermutation codes in the Hamming metric, known as constant composition
codes. We then present bounds on the size of multipermutation codes and their
capacity, for both the Ulam and the Hamming metrics. Finally, we present
constructions and accompanying decoders for multipermutation codes in the Ulam
metric.
