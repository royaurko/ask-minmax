The statistical analysis of covariance matrices occurs in many important
applications, e.g. in diffusion tensor imaging and longitudinal data analysis.
We consider the situation where it is of interest to estimate an average
covariance matrix, describe its anisotropy, to carry out principal geodesic
analysis and to interpolate between covariance matrices. There are many choices
of metric available, each with its advantages. The particular choice of what is
best will depend on the particular application. The use of the Procrustes
size-and-shape metric is particularly appropriate when the covariance matrices
are close to being deficient in rank. We discuss the use of different metrics
for diffusion tensor analysis, and we also introduce certain types of
regularization for tensors.
