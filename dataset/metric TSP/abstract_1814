This study is mainly aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of current health
care systems of several representative countries and improving that of the US.
To achieve these goals, a people-oriented non-linear evaluation model is
designed. It comprises one major evaluation metric and four minor metrics. The
major metric is constituted by combining possible factors that most
significantly determine or affect the life expectancy of people in this
country. The four minor metrics evaluate less important aspects of health care
systems and are subordinate to the major one. The contributors rank some of the
health care systems in the world according to the major metric and detect
problems in them with the help of minor ones. It is concluded that the health
care system of Sweden scores higher than the US and Chinese system scores lower
than that of the US. Especially, the health care system of US lags behind a
little bit compared with its economic power. At last, it is reasonable for the
American government to optimize the arrangement of funding base on the result
of goal programming model.
