A Polish group is surjectively universal if it can be continuously
homomorphically mapped onto every Polish group. Making use of a type of new
metrics on free groups \cite{DG}, we prove the existence of surjectively
universal Polish groups, answering in the positive a question of Kechris. In
fact, we give several examples of surjectively universal Polish groups.
  We find a sufficient condition to guarantee that the new metrics on free
groups can be computed directly. We also compare this condition with CLI
groups.
