An imaginary character named TSP finds himself in a playroom whose floor is
tilted to one side. However, the pooltable in the playroom is horizontal. TSP
wonders how this can be. In doing so, he embarks upon an intellectual journey
which parallels that which has been travelled during the past two decades by
physicists interested in the Strong $CP$ Problem and axion physics.
