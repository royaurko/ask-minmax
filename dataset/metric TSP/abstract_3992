In this paper, we study the hyperbolic geometry of noncommutative balls
generated by the joint operator radius $\omega_\rho$, $\rho\in (0,\infty]$, for
$n$-tuples of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. In particular,
$\omega_1$ is the operator norm, $\omega_2$ is the joint numerical radius, and
$\omega_\infty$ is the joint spectral radius. We provide mapping theorems, von
Neumann inequalities, and Schwarz type lemmas for free holomorphic functions on
noncommutative balls, with respect to the hyperbolic metric $\delta_\rho$, the
Carath\' eodory metric $d_K$, and the joint operator radius $\omega_\rho$.
