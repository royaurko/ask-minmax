In this paper I explain what is a pair of dilatation structures, one looking
down to another. Such a pair of dilatation structures leads to the intrinsic
definition of a distribution as a field of topological filters.
  To any pair of dilatation structures there is an associated notion of
differentiability which generalizes the Pansu differentiability. This allows
the introduction of the Radon-Nikodym property for dilatation structures, which
is the straightforward generalization of the Radon-Nikodym property for Banach
spaces.
  After an introducting section about length metric spaces and metric
derivatives, is proved that for a dilatation structure with the Radon-Nikodym
property the length of absolutely continuous curves expresses as an integral of
the norms of the tangents to the curve, as in Riemannian geometry.
  Further it is shown that Radon-Nikodym property transfers from any "upper"
dilatation structure looking down to a "lower" dilatation structure, theorem
\ref{ttransfer}. Im my opinion this result explains intrinsically the fact that
absolutely continuous curves in regular sub-Riemannian manifolds are derivable
almost everywhere, as proved by Margulis-Mostow, Pansu (for Carnot groups) or
Vodopyanov.
