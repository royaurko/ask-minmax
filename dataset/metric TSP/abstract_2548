The renormalization group method in $R^2$-gravity without matter fields is
discussed. A criterion for the existence of the renormalization constant for
the metric has been found, two-loop higher order poles have been calculated, a
relation which allows us to find the one-loop renormalization constant of the
Newtonian constant has been suggested.
