Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. We show that $M$ is
Gromov-Hausdorff close to a convex Euclidean region $D$ of the same dimension
if the boundary distance function of $M$ is $C^1$-close to that of $D$. More
generally, we prove the same result under the assumptions that the boundary
distance function of $M$ is $C^0$-close to that of $D$, the volumes of $M$ and
$D$ are almost equal, and volumes of metric balls in $M$ have a certain lower
bound in terms of radius.
