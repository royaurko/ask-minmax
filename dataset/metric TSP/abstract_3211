We introduce a family of conformal invariants associated to a smooth metric
measure space which generalize the relationship between the Yamabe constant and
the best constant for the Sobolev inequality to the best constants for
Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities $\|w\r|_q \leq C\|\nabla w\|_2^\theta
\|w\|_p^{1-\theta}$. These invariants are constructed via a minimization
procedure for the weighted scalar curvature functional in the conformal class
of a smooth metric measure space. We then describe critical points which are
also critical points for variations in the metric or the measure. When the
measure is assumed to take a special form --- for example, as the volume
element of an Einstein metric --- we use this description to show that
minimizers of our invariants are only critical for certain values of $p$ and
$q$. In particular, on Euclidean space our result states that either $p=2(q-1)$
or $q=2(p-1)$, giving a new characterization of the GNS inequalities whose
sharp constants were computed by Del Pino and Dolbeault.
