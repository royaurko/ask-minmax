We prove that a product complex manifold cannot admit a complete K\"ahler
metric with sectional curvature $K<c<0$ and Ricci curvature $Ric > d$, where
$c$ and $d$ are constants.
  In particular, a product domain in $\C$ cannot cover a compact K\"ahler
manifold with negative sectional curvature.
  On the other hand, we observe that there are complete K\"ahler metrics with
negative sectional curvature on $\C$. Hence the upper sectional curvature bound
is necessary.
