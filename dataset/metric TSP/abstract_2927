The spinning C-metric was discovered by Plebanski and Demianski as a
generalization of the standard C-metric which is known to represent uniformly
accelerated non-rotating black holes. We first transform the spinning C-metric
into Weyl coordinates and analyze some of its properties as Killing vectors and
curvature invariants. A transformation is then found which brings the metric
into the canonical form of the radiative spacetimes with the boost-rotation
symmetry. By analytically continuing the metric across "acceleration horizons",
two new regions of the spacetime arise in which both Killing vectors are
spacelike.
  We show that this metric can represent two uniformly accelerated, spinning
black holes, either connected by a conical singularity, or with conical
singularities extending from each of them to infinity. The radiative character
of the metric is briefly discussed.
