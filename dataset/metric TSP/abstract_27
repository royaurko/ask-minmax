We present spin transfer switching results for MgO based magnetic tunneling
junctions (MTJs)with large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to
150% and low intrinsic switching current density of 2-3 x 10 MA/cm2. The
switching data are compared to those obtained on similar MTJ nanostructures
with AlOx barrier. It is observed that the switching current density for MgO
based MTJs is 3-4 times smaller than that for AlOx based MTJs, and that can be
attributed to higher tunneling spin polarization (TSP) in MgO based MTJs. In
addition, we report a qualitative study of TSP for a set of samples, ranging
from 0.22 for AlOx to 0.46 for MgO based MTJs, and that shows the TSP (at
finite bias) responsible for the current-driven magnetization switching is
suppressed as compared to zero-bias tunneling spin polarization determined from
TMR.
