We consider generalized metric spaces as first-order structures in a
relational language $\mathcal{L}_S$ consisting of distance inequalities for a
distinguished set of distances $S$. Our first main result is the existence of a
nonstandard extension $S^*$ of $S$ and an ordered additive structure
$\mathcal{S}^*=(S^*,\oplus^*_S,\leq^*,0)$, with the property that if $A$ is a
generalized metric space, with distances in $S$, and $M\models
\text{Th}_{\mathcal{L}}(A)$, with $\mathcal{L}_S\subseteq\mathcal{L}$, then $M$
can be equipped with a "type-definable" $\mathcal{S}^*$-metric. Our primary
application of this framework concerns countable, universal, and homogeneous
metric spaces, obtained as generalizations of the rational Urysohn space. We
adapt previous work of Delhomm\'{e}, Laflamme, Pouzet, and Sauer to fully
characterize the existence of such spaces. For the second main result, we fix a
countable positively ordered commutative monoid $\mathcal{R}$ and consider
$\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{R}$, the countable Urysohn space over $\mathcal{R}$. We
show that quantifier elimination for $\text{Th}(\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{R})$ is
characterized by a natural continuity property in $\mathcal{R}^*$, which can be
expressed as a first-order sentence of $\mathcal{R}$ in the language of ordered
monoids. Finally, we analyze an example of Casanovas and Wagner in this
context.
