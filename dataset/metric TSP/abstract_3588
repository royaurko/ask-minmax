We investigate five dimensional Einstein spaces in warped geometries from the
point of view of the four dimensional physically relevant
Robertson-Walker-Friedman cosmological metric and the Schwarzschild metric. We
show that a four-dimensional cosmology with a closed spacelike section and a
cosmological constant can be imbedded into five-dimensional flat space-time.
