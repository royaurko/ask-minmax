We show that on any Riemannian manifold with H\"older continuous metric
tensor, there exists a $p$-harmonic coordinate system near any point. When $p =
n$ this leads to a useful gauge condition for regularity results in conformal
geometry. As applications, we show that any conformal mapping between manifolds
having $C^\alpha$ metric tensors is $C^{1+\alpha}$ regular, and that a manifold
with $W^{1,n} \cap C^\alpha$ metric tensor and with vanishing Weyl tensor is
locally conformally flat if $n \geq 4$. The results extend the works [LS14,
LS15] from the case of $C^{1+\alpha}$ metrics to the H\"older continuous case.
In an appendix, we also develop some regularity results for overdetermined
elliptic systems in divergence form.
