We present a metric for which Einstein's field equations in vacuum generate
the Kortweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and thus its $N$-soliton solutions solve
the vacuum equations. The metric of the one soliton solution has been
investigated and is a non-singular, Lorentzian metric of type N in the Petrov
classification.
