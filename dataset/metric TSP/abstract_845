In arXiv math.MG/0207296 we introduced a product construction for locally
compact, complete, geodesic hyperbolic metric spaces. In the present paper we
define the hyperbolic product for general Gromov-hyperbolic spaces. In the case
of roughly geodesic spaces we also analyse the boundary at infinity.
