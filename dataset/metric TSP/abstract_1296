For all left-invariant Riemannian metrics on three-dimensional unimodular Lie
groups, there exist particular left-invariant orthonormal frames, so-called
Milnor frames. In this paper, for any left-invariant Riemannian metrics on any
Lie groups, we give a procedure to obtain an analogous of Milnor frames, in the
sense that the bracket relations among them can be written with relatively
smaller number of parameters. Our procedure is based on the moduli space of
left-invariant Riemannian metrics. Some explicit examples of such frames and
applications will also be given.
