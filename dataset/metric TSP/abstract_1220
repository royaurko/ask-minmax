El Soufi-Ilias' theorem establishes a connection between minimal submanifolds
of spheres and extremal metrics for eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator. Recently, this connection was used to provide several explicit
examples of extremal metrics. We investigate the maximality of these metrics
and prove that all of them are not maximal.
