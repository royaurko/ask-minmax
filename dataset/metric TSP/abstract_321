The aim of this note is the study of Einstein condition for para-holomorphic
Riemannian metrics in the para-complex geometry framework. Firstly, we make
some general considerations about para-complex Riemannian manifolds (not
necessarily para-holomorphic). Next, using an one-to-one correspondence between
para-holomorphic Riemannian metrics and para-K\"ahler Norden metrics, we study
the Einstein condition for a para-holomorphic Riemannian metric and the
associated real para-K\"ahler Norden metric on a para-complex manifold.
Finally, it is shown that every semi-simple para-complex Lie group inherits a
natural para-K\"ahlerian Norden Einstein metric.
