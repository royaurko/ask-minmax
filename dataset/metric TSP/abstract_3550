We propose a new presentation of the Demia\'{n}ski-Newman (DN) solution of
the axisymmetric Einstein equations. We introduce new dimensionless parameters
$p$, $q$ and $s$, but keeping the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate transformation
used for the Kerr metric in the Ernst method. The family of DN metrics is
studied and it is shown that the main role of $s$ is to determine the
singularities, which we obtain by calculating the Riemann tensor components and
the invariants of curvature. So, $s$ reveals itself as the parameter of the
singular rings on the inner ergosphere.
