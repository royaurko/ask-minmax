We prove a general relative higher index theorem for complete manifolds with
positive scalar curvature towards infinity. We apply this theorem to study
Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on manifolds. For every two
metrics of positive scalar curvature on a closed manifold and a Galois cover of
the manifold, we define a secondary higher index class. Non-vanishing of this
higher index class is an obstruction for the two metrics to be in the same
connected component of the space of metrics of positive scalar curvature. In
the special case where one metric is induced from the other by a diffeomorphism
of the manifold, we obtain a formula for computing this higher index class. In
particular, it follows that the higher index class lies in the image of the
Baum-Connes assembly map.
