The contributor has proved that a crepant resolution Y of a Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler
cone X admits a complete Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metric asymptotic to the cone
metric in every K\"{a}hler class in H^2_c(Y,\R). These manifolds are
generalizations of the Ricci-flat ALE K\"{a}hler spaces known by the work of P.
Kronheimer, D. Joyce and others.
  This article considers further the problem of constructing examples. We show
that every 3-dimensional Gorenstein toric K\"{a}hler cone admits a crepant
resolution for which the above theorem applies. This gives infinitely many
examples of asymptotically conical Ricci-flat manifolds. Then other examples
are given of which are crepant resolutions hypersurface singularities which are
known to admit Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler cone metrics by the work of C. Boyer, K.
Galicki, J. Koll\'{a}r, and others. Two families of hypersurface examples are
given which are distinguished by the condition b_3(Y)=0 or b_3(Y)>0.
