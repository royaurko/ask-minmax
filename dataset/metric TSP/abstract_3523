It is shown that space-time may be not only in a state which is described by
Riemann geometry but also in states which are described by Finsler geometry.
Transitions between various metric states of space-time have the meaning of
phase transitions in its geometric structure. These transitions together with
the evolution of each of the possible metric states make up the general picture
of space-time manifold dynamics.
