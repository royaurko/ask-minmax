A twenty--dimensional space of charged solutions of spin--2 equations is
proposed. The relation with extended (via dilatation) Poincar\'e group is
analyzed. Locally, each solution of the theory may be described in terms of a
potential, which can be interpreted as a metric tensor satisfying linearized
Einstein equations. Globally, the non--singular metric tensor exists if and
only if 10 among the above 20 charges do vanish. The situation is analogous to
that in classical electrodynamics, where vanishing of magnetic monopole implies
the global existence of the electro--magnetic potentials. The notion of {\em
asymptotic conformal Yano--Killing tensor} is defined and used as a basic
concept to introduce an inertial frame in General Relativity via asymptotic
conditions at spatial infinity. The introduced class of asymptotically flat
solutions is free of supertranslation ambiguities.
