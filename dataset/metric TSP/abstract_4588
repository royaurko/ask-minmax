Given a family of self-adjoint operators $(A_t)_{t\in T}$ indexed by a
parameter $t$ in some topological space $T$, necessary and sufficient
conditions are given for the spectrum $\sigma(A_t)$ to be Fell-continuous with
respect to $t$. Equivalently the boundaries and the gap edges are continuous in
$t$. If $(T,d)$ is a complete metric space with metric $d$, these conditions
are extended to guaranty H\"older's continuity of the spectral boundaries and
the spectral gap edges. As a Corollary, an upper bound is provided on the size
of closing gaps.
