We classify invariant complex structures on 6-dimensional nilmanifolds up to
equivalence. As an application, the behaviour of the associated Fr\"olicher
sequence is studied as well as its relation to the existence of strongly
Gauduchon metrics. We also show that the strongly Gauduchon property and the
balanced property are not closed under holomorphic deformation.
