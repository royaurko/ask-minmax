In this paper we characterize compact extended Ptolemy metric spaces with
many circles up to M\"obius equivalence. This characterization yields a
M\"obius characterization of the $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ and hemispheres
$S^n_+$ when endowed with their chordal metrics. In particular, we show that
every compact extended Ptolemy metric space with the property that every three
points are contained in a circle is M\"obius equivalent to $(S^n,d_0)$ for some
$n\ge 1$, the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ with its chordal metric.
