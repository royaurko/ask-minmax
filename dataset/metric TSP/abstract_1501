In this paper, the contributors propose a software metric called Class Activeness
Metric which helps to determine the level of accessibility of the members of a
class when it is instantiated as objects. Object interactions need to be
straight forward as far as possible as complexity in these interactions can
lead to time delays in accessing members not just confusing inheritance
hierarchies. For object interactions to be non-complex, the classes must be
designed well so that they are easily accessible. This necessitates the
development of a metric for gauging the quality of design of a class. This
metric is the Class Activeness Metric.
