We introduce a notion of fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space for
metric spaces, which is a generalization of Gromov's notion of coarse embedding
into Hilbert space. It turns out that a large class of expander graphs admit
such an embedding. We show that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds
for metric spaces with bounded geometry which admit a fibred coarse embedding
into Hilbert space.
