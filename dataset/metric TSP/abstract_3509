Two Riemannian manifolds are said to be isospectral if the associated
Laplace-Belttrami operators have the same eigenvalue spectrum. If the manifolds
have boundary, one specifies DIrichlet or Neumann isospectrality depending on
the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions. We construct continuous
families of (Neumann and Dirichlet) isospectral metrics which have different
local geometry on manifolds with boundary in every dimension greater than 6 and
also new examples of pairs of closed isospectral manifolds with different local
geometry. These examples illustrate for the first time that the Ricci curvature
of a Riemannian manifold is not spectrally determined.
