We define a notion of renormalized volume of an asymptotically hyperbolic
manifold. Moreover, we prove a sharp volume comparison theorem for metrics with
scalar curvature at least -6. Finally, we show that the inequality is strict
unless the metric is isometric to one of the Anti-deSitter-Schwarzschild
metrics.
