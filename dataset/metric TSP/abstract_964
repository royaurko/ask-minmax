We extend the spectral theory of generalized Laplacians to integrable metrics
on compact Riemann surfaces. As a consequence, we attach in a direct way, a
holomorphic analytic torsion to any integrable metrics. We also provide a
different approach to define the holomorphic analytic torsion. We prove that
both approaches agree.
