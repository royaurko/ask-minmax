The condition R=0, where R is the four-dimensional scalar curvature, is used
for obtaining a large class (with an arbitrary function of r) of static,
spherically symmetric Lorentzian wormhole metrics. The wormholes are globally
regular and traversable, can have throats of arbitrary size and can be both
symmetric and asymmetric. These metrics may be treated as possible wormhole
solutions in a brane world since they satisfy the vacuum Einstein equations on
the brane where effective stress-energy is induced by interaction with the bulk
gravitational field. Some particular examples are discussed.
