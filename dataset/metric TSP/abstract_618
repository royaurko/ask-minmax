We derive explicit expressions for the multi-detector F-statistic metric
applied to short-duration non-precessing inspiral signals. This is required for
template bank production associated with coherent searches for short-duration
non-precessing inspiral signals in gravitational-wave data from a network of
detectors. We compare the metric's performance with explicit overlap
calculations for all relevant dimensions of parameter space and find the metric
accurately predicts the loss of detection statistic above overlaps of 95%. We
also show the effect that neglecting the variations of the detector response
functions has on the metric.
