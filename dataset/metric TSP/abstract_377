In this paper we prove an isoperimetric inequality of euclidean type for
complete metric spaces admitting a cone-type inequality. These include all
Banach spaces and all complete, simply-connected metric spaces of non-positive
curvature in the sense of Alexandrov or, more generally, of Busemann. The main
theorem generalizes results of Gromov and Ambrosio-Kirchheim.
