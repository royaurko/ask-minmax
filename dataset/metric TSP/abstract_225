In this paper, we classify the spherically symmetric Berwald metrics in
$\mathbb{R}^n$. For the spherically symmetric Landsberg metrics, we prove that
there do not exist any non-Berwald metrics among the regular case. The partial
differential equation systems which can respectively characterize the
spherically symmetric Finsler metrics with constant flag curvature and Einstein
metrics of this type is also obtained. Utilizing these equations, we find an
effective way to construct the non-projective, non-Randers Finsler metrics with
constant flag curvature and many explicit examples are given by this method.
