It is well known that isotopic metrics of positive scalar curvature are
concordant. Whether or not the converse holds is an open question, at least in
dimensions greater than four. We show that for a particular type of
concordance, constructed using the surgery techniques of Gromov and Lawson,
this converse holds in the case of closed simply connected manifolds of
dimension at least five.
