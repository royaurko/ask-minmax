We introduce the concept of fuzzy Ciric-Matkowski contractive mappings as a
generalization of fuzzy Meir-Keeler type contractions. We also introduce a
class $\Psi_1$ of gauge functions $\psi:(0,1]\to(0,1]$ in the sense that, for
any $r\in(0,1)$, there exists $\rho\in(r,1)$ such that $1-r> \tau >1-\rho$
implies $\psi(\tau)\geq 1-r$. We show that fuzzy $\psi$-contractive mappings
($\psi\in\Psi_1$) are fuzzy Ciric-Matkowski contractive mappings. Then, we
present a characterization of $M$-Cauchy sequences in fuzzy metric spaces. This
characterization is used to establish new fuzzy fixed point theorems. Our
results include those of Mihet (Fuzzy $\psi$-contractive mappings in
non-Archimedean fuzzy metric spaces, Fuzzy Sets Syst. 159(2008) 739--744.),
Wardowski (Fuzzy contractive mappings and fixed points in fuzzy metric spaces,
Fuzzy Sets Syst. 222(2013) 108--114) and others. Examples are given to support
the results.
