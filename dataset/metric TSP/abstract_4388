In this paper, we present a SRAM-PCM hybrid cache design, along with a cache
replacement policy, named dead fast block (DFB) to manage the hybrid cache.
This design aims to leverage the best features of both SRAM and PCM devices.
Compared to a PCM-only cache, the hybrid cache with DFB policy provides
superior results on all relevant evaluation metrics, viz. cache lifetime,
performance and energy efficiency. Also, use of DFB policy for managing the
hybrid cache provides better results compared to LRU replacement policy on all
the evaluation metrics.
