Hidden symmetry transformations of D-dimensional vacuum metrics with D-3
commuting Killing vectors are studied. We solve directly the Einstein equations
in the Maison formulation under additional assumptions. We relate the
4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution to a particular case of the
5-dimensional Gross-Perry metric.
