The p-hierarchy of Schwarzschild type metrics obtained in a preceing paper is
generalised here to a corresponding Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) type hierarchy in
the presence of a point charge q in d-dimensions. Certain special features
arising, concerning the horizons and the interior region, are discussed.
