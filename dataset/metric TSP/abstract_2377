It is proved by Kawamata that the canonical bundle of a projective manifold
is semi-ample if it is big and nef. We give an analytic proof using the Ricci
flow, degeneration of Riemannian manifolds and $L^2$-theory. Combined with our
earlier results, we construct unique singular Kahler-Einstein metrics with a
global Riemannian structure on canonical models. Our approach can be viewed as
the Kodaira embedding theorem on singular metric spaces with canonical Kahler
metrics.
