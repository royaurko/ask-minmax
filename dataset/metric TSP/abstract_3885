Let R(t) be the remainder term in Weyl's law for a 3-dimensional Riemannian
Heisenberg manifold with a certain arithmetic metric. We prove a third moment
result stating that \int_1^T R(t)^3 dt =d_3
T^(13/4)+O_\delta(T^(45/14+\delta)), where d_3 is a specific positive constant
which can be evaluated explicitly. This proves the asymmetric behavior of R(t)
about the t-axis. This result is consistent with the conjecture of Petridis and
Toth stating that R(t)=O_\delta(t^(3/4+\delta)). Similar results hold for
(2n+1)-dimensional Heisenberg manifolds with arithmetic metrics.
