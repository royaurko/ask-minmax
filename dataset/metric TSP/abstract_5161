All possible transformations from the Robertson-Walker metric to those
conformal to the Lorentz-Minkowski form are derived. It is demonstrated that
the commonly known family of transformations and associated conformal factors
are not exhaustive and that there exists another relatively less well known
family of transformations with a different conformal factor in the particular
case that K = -1. Simplified conformal factors are derived for the special case
of maximally-symmetric spacetimes. The full set of all possible
cosmologically-compatible conformal forms is presented as a comprehensive
table. A product of the analysis is the determination of the set-theoretical
relationships between the maximally symmetric spacetimes, the Robertson-Walker
spacetimes, and functionally more general spacetimes. The analysis is preceded
by a short historical review of the application of conformal metrics to
Cosmology.
