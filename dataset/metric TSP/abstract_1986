Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian dynamical systems are well formalized
mathematically. They give rise to geometric structures describing motion of a
point in smooth manifolds. Riemannian metric is a different geometric structure
formalizing concepts of length and angle. The interplay of Riemannian metric
and its metric connection with mechanical structures produces some features
which are absent in the case of general (non-Riemannian) manifolds. The aim of
present paper is to discuss these features and develop special language for
describing Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian dynamical systems in
Riemannian manifolds.
