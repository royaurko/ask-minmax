The notions of centrifugal (centripetal) and Coriols' velocities and
accelerations are introduced and considered in spaces with affine connections
and metrics as velocities and accelerations of flows of mass elements
(particles) moving in space-time. It is shown that these types of velocities
and accelerations are generated by the relative motions between the mass
elements. They are closely related to the kinematic characteristics of the
relative velocity and the relative acceleration. The null (isotropic) vector
fields are considered and their relations with the centrifugal (centripetal)
velocity are established. The centrifugal (centripetal) velocity is found to be
in connection with the Hubble law and the generalized Doppler effect in spaces
with affine connections and metrics. The centrifugal (centripetal) acceleration
could be interpreted as gravitational acceleration as it has been done in the
Einstein theory of gravitation. This fact could be used as a basis for working
out of new gravitational theories in spaces with affine connections and
metrics.
