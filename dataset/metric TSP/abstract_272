To any metric spaces there is an associated metric profile. The
rectifiability of the metric profile gives a good notion of curvature of a
sub-Riemannian space. We shall say that a curvature class is the rectifiability
class of the metric profile. We classify then the curvatures by looking to
homogeneous metric spaces. The classification problem is solved for contact 3
manifolds, where we rediscover a 3 dimensional family of homogeneous contact
manifolds, with a distinguished 2 dimensional family of contact manifolds which
don't have a natural group structure.
