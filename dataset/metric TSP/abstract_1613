General relativity postulates that the gravity field is defined on a
Riemannian manifold. The field equations are $R^\mu_\nu = 0$ i.e. Ricci's
curvature tensor vanishes. The field equations have to be augmented by natural
physical requirements like orientability, time orientability and existence of a
spinorial structure. Moreover, it is impossible to define the energy of the
gravity field only by the metric tensor. We suggest to impose an additional
structure and consider parallelizable manifold i.e. manifolds for which a
smooth field of frames exists. The derivation of the field equations is by an
action principle. A Lagrangian, which is quadratic in the differentials, is
defined. The minimum of the action is achieved at a $16 \times 16$ second order
quasi linear system. It is of Laplacian type. The system admits a unique exact
solution for a centrally symmetric, static and assimptotically flat field. The
resulting metric is the celebrated Rosen metric, which is very close to the
Schwarzchild metric. The two are intrinsicly different since the scalar
curvature of the Schuarzschild metric is zero, in contrast to Rosen's which is
positive. The suggested field admits black holes which are briefly discussed.
