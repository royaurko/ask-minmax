Area metric manifolds emerge as a refinement of symplectic and metric
geometry in four dimensions, where in numerous situations of physical interest
they feature as effective matter backgrounds. In this article, this prompts us
to identify those area metric manifolds that qualify as viable spacetime
backgrounds in the first place, in so far as they support causally propagating
matter. This includes an identification of the timelike future cones and their
duals associated to an area metric geometry, and thus paves the ground for a
discussion of the related local and global causal structure in standard
fashion. In order to provide simple algebraic criteria for an area metric
manifold to present a consistent spacetime structure, we develop a complete
algebraic classification of area metric tensors up to general transformations
of frame. Remarkably, a suitable coarsening of this classification allows to
prove a theorem excluding the majority of algebraic classes of area metrics as
viable spacetimes.
