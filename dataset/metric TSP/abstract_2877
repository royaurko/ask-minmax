We investigate the possibility of desingularizing a positively curved metric
cone by an expanding gradient Ricci soliton with positive curvature operator.
This amounts to study the deformation of such geometric structures. As a
consequence, we prove that the moduli space of conical positively curved
gradient Ricci expanders is connected.
