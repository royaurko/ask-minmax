In the framework of chaotic inflation we study the case of a massive scalar
field using a semiclassical approach. We derive the energy density fluctuations
in the infrared sector generated by matter field and gauge-invariant metric
fluctuations by means of a different method. We find that the super Hubble
density fluctuations increase during inflation for a massive scalar field, in
agreement with the result obtained in a previous work in which a power-law
expanding universe was considered.
