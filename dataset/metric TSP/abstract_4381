An $(\alpha,\beta)$-metric is defined by a Riemannian metric and $1$-form. In
this paper, we investigate the known characterization for
$(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics of isotropic S-curvature. We show that such a
characterization should hold in dimension $n\ge 3$, and for the 2-dimensional
case, there is one more class of isotropic S-curvature than the higher
dimensional ones. Further, we construct corresponding examples for every
two-dimensional class, especially for the class that the norm of $\beta$ with
respect to $\alpha$ is not a constant.
