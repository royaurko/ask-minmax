We classify all spacetimes with a closed rank-2 conformal Killing-Yano
tensor. They give a generalization of Kerr-NUT-de Sitter spacetimes. The
Einstein condition is explicitly solved and written as an indefinite integral.
It is characterized by a polynomial in the integrand. We briefly discuss the
smoothness conditions of the Einstein metrics over compact Riemannian
manifolds.
