Using a special metric in the space of sequences, we give a geometric
description of almost periodic sets in the $k$-dimensional Euclidean space. We
prove the completeness of the space of almost periodic sets and some analogue
of the Bochner criterion of almost periodicity.
  Also, we show the connection between these sets and almost periodic measures.
