We obtain a geometrical condition on vacuum, stationary, asymptotically flat
spacetimes which is necessary and sufficient for the spacetime to be locally
isometric to Kerr. Namely, we prove a theorem stating that an asymptotically
flat, stationary, vacuum spacetime such that the so-called Killing form is an
eigenvector of the self-dual Weyl tensor must be locally isometric to Kerr.
Asymptotic flatness is a fundamental hypothesis of the theorem, as we
demonstrate by writing down the family of metrics obtained when this
requirement is dropped. This result indicates why the Kerr metric plays such an
important role in general relativity. It may also be of interest in order to
extend the uniqueness theorems of black holes to the non-connected and to the
non-analytic case.
