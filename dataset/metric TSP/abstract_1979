The contributor exposes the metrical multi-time Lagrange geometry of physical
fields which naturally generalizes the classical Lagrangian developped by Miron
and Anastasiei. In other words, one constructs a natural theory of physical
fields on the 1-jet fibre bundle, attached to a Kronecker h-regular multi-time
Lagrangian with partial derivatives of order one.
