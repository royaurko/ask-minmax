In this paper we offer a metric similar to graph edit distance which measures
the distance between two (possibly infinite)weighted graphs with finite norm
(we define the norm of a graph as the sum of absolute values of its edges). The
main result is the completeness of the space. Some other analytical properties
of this space are also investigated. The introduced metric could have some
applications in pattern recognition and face recognition methods.
