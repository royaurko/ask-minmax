The explicit complete Einstein-K\"{a}hler metric on the second type
Cartan-Hartogs domain $Y_{II}(r,p;K)$ is obtained in this paper when the
parameter $K$ equals $\frac p2+\frac 1{p+1}$. The estimate of holomorphic
sectional curvature under this metric is also given which intervenes between
$-2K$ and $-\frac{2K}p$ and it is a sharp estimate. In the meantime we also
prove that the complete Einstein-K\"ahler metric is equivalent to the Bergman
metric on $Y_{II}(r,p;K)$ when $K=\frac p2+\frac 1{p+1}$.
