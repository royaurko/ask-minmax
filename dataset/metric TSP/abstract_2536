Another connection of harmonic maps to gravity is presented. Using 1-soliton
and anti-soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon equation, we construct a pair of
harmonic maps that we express in terms of a particular dilaton field in
Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. This field satisfies a linearized sine-Gordon
equation. We use it also to construct an explicit transformation that relates
the corresponding solitonic metric to a two dimensional black hole metric.
