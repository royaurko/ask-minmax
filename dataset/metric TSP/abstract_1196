None has studied the well-posedness of common fixed points in fuzzy metric
space. In this paper, our target is to develop the well-posedness of common
fixed points in fuzzy metric space. Also using weakly compatibility, implicit
relation, property (E.A.) and strict contractive conditions, we have
established the unique common fixed point for three self mappings and also for
four self mappings in fuzzy metric space.
