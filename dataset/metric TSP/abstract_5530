Games have always been a popular test bed for artificial intelligence
techniques. Game developers are always in constant search for techniques that
can automatically create computer games minimizing the developer's task. In
this work we present an evolutionary strategy based solution towards the
automatic generation of two player board games. To guide the evolutionary
process towards games, which are entertaining, we propose a set of metrics.
These metrics are based upon different theories of entertainment in computer
games. This work also compares the entertainment value of the evolved games
with the existing popular board based games. Further to verify the
entertainment value of the evolved games with the entertainment value of the
human user a human user survey is conducted. In addition to the user survey we
check the learnability of the evolved games using an artificial neural network
based controller. The proposed metrics and the evolutionary process can be
employed for generating new and entertaining board games, provided an initial
search space is given to the evolutionary algorithm.
