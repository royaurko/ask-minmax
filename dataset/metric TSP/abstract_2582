In this note we prove that any closed graph manifold admitting a metric of
non-positive sectional curvature (NPC-metric) has a finite cover, which is
fibered over the circle.
 An explicit criterion to have a finite cover, which is fibered over the
circle, is presented for the graph manifolds of certain class.
