We reformulate the Einstein equations as equations for families of surfaces
on a four-manifold. These surfaces eventually become characteristic surfaces
for an Einstein metric (with or without sources). In particular they are
formulated in terms of two functions on R4xS2, i.e. the sphere bundle over
space-time, - one of the functions playing the role of a conformal factor for a
family of associated conformal metrics, the other function describing an S2's
worth of surfaces at each space-time point. It is from these families of
surfaces themselves that the conformal metric - conformal to an Einstein metric
- is constructed; the conformal factor turns them into Einstein metrics. The
surfaces are null surfaces with respect to this metric.
