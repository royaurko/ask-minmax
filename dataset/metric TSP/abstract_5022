Supersymmetric non--linear $\gs$--models in four dimensions with a $D$--term
potentials can sometimes have singular kinetic metric terms. As the kinetic
terms of scalar fields and their chiral fermionic partners are determine by
this metric, it follow that their kinetic energy vanishes in the vacuum. In
previous work, it has been shown in a simple model that soft supersymmetry
breaking terms can lift the degenerate the sigma-model metric and provide a
consistent mass-spectra. In this letter I introduce soft breaking terms in a
more realistic models based on SO(10) and $E_6$ and compute the resulting mass
spectrum.
