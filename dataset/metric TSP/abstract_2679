This paper is devoted to prove the S. L. Singh's common fixed point Theorem
for commuting mappings in cone metric spaces. In this framework, we introduce
the notions of Generalized Kannan Con- traction, Generalized Zamfirescu
Contraction and Generalized Weak Contraction for a pair of mappings, proving
afterward their respective fixed point results.
