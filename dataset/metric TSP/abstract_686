We give a general description of the construction of weighted spherically
symmetric metrics on vector bundle manifolds, i.e. the total space of a vector
bundle $E\longrightarrow M$, over a Riemannian manifold $M$, when $E$ is
endowed with a metric connection. The tangent bundle of $E$ admits a canonical
decomposition and thus it is possible to define an interesting class of `two
weights' metrics with such weight functions depending on the fibre norm of $E$;
hence the generalized concept of spherically symmetric metrics. We study its
main properties and curvature equations. Finally we compute the holonomy of
Bryant-Salamon type $\mathrm{G}_2$ manifolds.
