This paper contains bounds for the distortion in the spherical metric, that
is to say bounds for the constant of Holder continuity of mappings f : (\Rn,q)
-> (\Rn, q) where q denotes the spherical metric. The mappings considered are
K-quasiconformal (K >= 1) and satisfy some normalizations or restrictions. All
bounds are explicit and asymptotically sharp as K -> 1.
