Topological and metric entropies of the DNA sequences from different
organisms were calculated. Obtained results were compared each other and with
ones of corresponding artificial sequences. For all envisaged DNA sequences
there is a maximum of heterogeneity. It falls in the block length interval
[5,7].
 Maximum distinction between natural and artificial sequences is shifted on 1-3
position from the maximum of heterogeneity to the right as for metric as for
topological entropy. This point on the specificity of real DNA sequences in the
interval.
