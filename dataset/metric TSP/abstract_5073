The semi-classical stability of several AdS NUT instantons is studied.
Throughout, the notion of stability is that of stability at the one-loop level
of Euclidean Quantum Gravity. Instabilities manifest themselves as negative
eigenmodes of a modified Lichnerowicz Laplacian acting on the transverse
traceless perturbations. An instability is found for one branch of the
AdS-Taub-Bolt family of metrics and it is argued that the other branch is
stable. It is also argued that the AdS-Taub-NUT family of metrics are stable. A
component of the continuous spectrum of the modified Lichnerowicz operator on
all three families of metrics is found.
