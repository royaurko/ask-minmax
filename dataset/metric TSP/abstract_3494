The stability of de Sitter metric in spacetimes where inflaton fields are
non-minimally coupled to propagating torsion is investigated. It is shown that
the de Sitter background metric is unstable against small perturbations.
Axionic torsion is generated by inflaton fluctuations and the analysis of
cosmological perturbations in Einstein-Cartan-Klein-Gordon (ECKG) equations is
undertaken. Instabilities in the inflaton massless modes are found when the
minimal coupling constant dominates. Inflaton fluctuations trigger axionic
torsion vector fluctuations. The ECKG equations reduce to Einstein-de Sitter
equations in the case of a constant background inflaton field.
