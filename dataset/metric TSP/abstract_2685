A careful analysis of the maximally extended metrics of Schwarzschild
manifold shows that the original Schwarzschild's solution (1916) and
Brillouin's solution (1923) are the only ones that are adequate from the
physical standpoint. Contrary to the other maximally extended metrics, they
represent faithfully the gravity field created by the mass-point.
