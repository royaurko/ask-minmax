We explore the possibility that spacetime horizons in 4D general relativity
can be treated as manifestations of higher dimensions that induce fields on our
4D spacetime. In this paper we discuss the black hole event horizon, as an
example (we leave the cosmological case for future discussion). Starting off
from the field equations of gravity in 5D and some conditions on the metric we
construct a spacetime whose imbedding is a 4D generalization of the
Schwarzchild metric. The external region of the imbedded spacetime is found to
contain two distinct fields. We discuss the properties of the fields and the
potential implications. Taken as they are, the results suggest that the
collapse of matter to form a horizon may have non-local consequences on the
geometry of spacetime. In general, the use of horizon-confined mass as a
coordinate suggests three potential features of our universe. The first is that
the observed 4D spacetime curvature and ordinary matter fields may be hybrid
features of 5D originating from the mixing of coordinates. Secondly, because
the fifth coordinate induces physical fields on the 4D hyperface, the global
metric of the universe may not be asymptotically flat. And finally, associating
matter with an independent dimension points towards a theory of nature that is
scale invariant.
