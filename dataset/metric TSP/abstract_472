We study complex non-K\"ahler manifolds with Hermitian metrics being locally
conformal to metrics with special cohomological properties. In particular, we
provide examples where the existence of locally conformal holomorphic-tamed
structures implies the existence of locally conformal K\"ahler metrics, too.
