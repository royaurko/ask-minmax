The stability of isotropic cosmological solutions in the Bianchi I model is
considered. We prove that the stability of isotropic solutions in the Bianchi I
metric for a positive Hubble parameter follows from their stability in the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. This result is applied to models inspired by
string field theory, which violate the null energy condition. Examples of
stable isotropic solutions are presented. We also consider the k-essence model
and analyse the stability of solutions of the form $\Phi(t)=t$.
