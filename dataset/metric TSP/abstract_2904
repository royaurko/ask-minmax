In this paper we give various characterizations of quasiopen sets and
quasicontinuous functions on metric spaces. For complete metric spaces equipped
with a doubling measure supporting a p-Poincar\'e inequality we show that
quasiopen and p-path open sets coincide. Under the same assumptions we show
that all Newton-Sobolev functions on quasiopen sets are quasicontinuous.
