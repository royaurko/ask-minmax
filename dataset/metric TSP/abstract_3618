In this paper, we discuss the internal and external metric of the
semi-realistic stars in relativistic MOND theory. We show the
Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in relativistic MOND theory and get the metric and
pressure inside the stars to order of post-Newtonian corrections. We study the
features of motion around the static, spherically symmetric stars by
Hamilton-Jacobi mothod, and find there are only some small corrections in
relativistic MOND theory.
