Some new results on metric ultraproducts of finite simple groups are
presented. Suppose that G is such a group, defined in terms of a non-principal
ultrafilter {\omega} on N and a sequence {(G_i)_{i \in N}} of finite simple
groups, and that G is neither finite nor a Chevalley group over an infinite
field. Then G is isomorphic to an ultraproduct of alternating groups or to an
ultraproduct of finite simple classical groups. The isomorphism type of G
determines which of these two cases arises, and, in the latter case, the
{\omega}-limit of the characteristics of the groups Gi. Moreover G is a
complete path-connected group with respect to the natural metric on G.
