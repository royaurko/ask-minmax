It is known that General Relativity ({\bf GR}) uses Lorentzian Manifold
$(M_4;g)$ as a geometrical model of the physical space-time. $M_4$ means here a
four-dimensional differentiable manifold endowed with Lorentzian metric $g$.
The metric $g$ satisfies Einstein equations. Since the 1970s many contributors have
tried to generalize this geometrical model of the physical space-time by
introducing torsion and even more general metric-affine geometry. In this paper
we discuss status of torsion in the theory of gravity. At first, we emphasize
that up to now we have no experimental evidence for the existence of torsion in
Nature. Contrary, the all experiments performed in weak gravitational field
(Solar System) or in strong regime (binary pulsars) and tests of the Einstein
Equivalence Principle ({\bf EEP}) confirmed {\bf GR} and Lorentzian manifold
$(M_4;g)$ as correct geometrical model of the physical space-time. Then, we
give theoretical arguments against introducing of torsion into geometrical
model of the physical space-time. At last, we conclude that the
general-relativistic model of the physical space-time is sufficient and it
seems to be the most satisfactory.
