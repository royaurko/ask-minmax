Let $g$ be a metric on $S^3$ with positive Yamabe constant. When blowing up
$g$ at two points, a scalar flat manifold with two asymptotically flat ends is
produced and this manifold will have compact minimal surfaces. We introduce the
$\Th$-invariant for $g$ which is an isoperimetric constant for the cylindrical
domain inside the outermost minimal surface of the blown-up metric. Further we
find relations between $\Th$ and the Yamabe constant and the existence of
horizons in the blown-up metric on $\mR^3$.
