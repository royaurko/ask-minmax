Producing overlapping schemes is a major issue in clustering. Recent proposed
overlapping methods relies on the search of an optimal covering and are based
on different metrics, such as Euclidean distance and I-Divergence, used to
measure closeness between observations. In this paper, we propose the use of
another measure for overlapping clustering based on a kernel similarity metric
.We also estimate the number of overlapped clusters using the Gram matrix.
Experiments on both Iris and EachMovie datasets show the correctness of the
estimation of number of clusters and show that measure based on kernel
similarity metric improves the precision, recall and f-measure in overlapping
clustering.
