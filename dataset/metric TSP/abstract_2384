We introduce the notion of large scale inductive dimension for asymptotic
resemblance spaces. We prove that the large scale inductive dimension and the
asymptotic dimensiongrad are equal in the class of r-convex metric spaces. This
class contains the class of all geodesic metric spaces and all finitely
generated groups. This leads to an answer for a question asked by E. Shchepin
concerning the relation between the asymptotic inductive dimension and the
asymptotic dimensiongrad, for r-convex metric spaces.
