We study the Lie point symmetries of a general class of partial differential
equations (PDE) of second order. An equation from this class naturally defines
a second-order symmetric tensor (metric). In the case the PDE is linear on the
first derivatives we show that the Lie point symmetries are given by the
conformal algebra of the metric modulo a constraint involving the linear part
of the PDE. Important elements in this class are the Klein--Gordon equation and
the Laplace equation. We apply the general results and determine the Lie point
symmetries of these equations in various general classes of Riemannian spaces.
Finally we study the type II\ hidden symmetries of the wave equation in a
Riemannian space with a Lorenzian metric.
