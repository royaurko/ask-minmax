This paper concerns the explicit construction of extremal Kaehler metrics on
total spaces of projective bundles, which have been studied in many places. We
present a unified approach, motivated by the theory of hamiltonian 2-forms (as
introduced and studied in previous papers in the series) but this paper is
largely independent of that theory.
  We obtain a characterization, on a large family of projective bundles, of
those `admissible' Kaehler classes (i.e., the ones compatible with the bundle
structure in a way we make precise) which contain an extremal Kaehler metric.
In many cases, such as on geometrically ruled surfaces, every Kaehler class is
admissible. In particular, our results complete the classification of extremal
Kaehler metrics on geometrically ruled surfaces, answering several
long-standing questions.
  We also find that our characterization agrees with a notion of K-stability
for admissible Kaehler classes. Our examples and nonexistence results therefore
provide a fertile testing ground for the rapidly developing theory of stability
for projective varieties, and we discuss some of the ramifications. In
particular we obtain examples of projective varieties which are destabilized by
a non-algebraic degeneration.
