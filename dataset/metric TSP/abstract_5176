The classifications of holonomy groups in Lorentzian and in Euclidean
signature are quite different. A group of interest in Lorentzian signature in n
dimensions is the maximal proper subgroup of the Lorentz group, SIM(n-2).
Ricci-flat metrics with SIM(2) holonomy were constructed by Kerr and Goldberg,
and a single four-dimensional example with a non-zero cosmological constant was
exhibited by Ghanam and Thompson. Here we reduce the problem of finding the
general $n$-dimensional Einstein metric of SIM(n-2) holonomy, with and without
a cosmological constant, to solving a set linear generalised Laplace and
Poisson equations on an (n-2)-dimensional Einstein base manifold. Explicit
examples may be constructed in terms of generalised harmonic functions. A
dimensional reduction of these multi-centre solutions gives new time-dependent
Kaluza-Klein black holes and monopoles, including time-dependent black holes in
a cosmological background whose spatial sections have non-vanishing curvature.
