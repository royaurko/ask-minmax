I present an approach to gravity in which the spacetime metric is constructed
from a non-Abelian gauge potential with values in the Lie algebra of the group
U(2) (or the Lie algebra of quaternions). If the curvature of this potential
vanishes, the metric reduces to a canonical curved background form reminiscent
of the Friedmann S^3 cosmological metric.
