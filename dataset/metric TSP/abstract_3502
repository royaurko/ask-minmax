The use of cortical field potentials rather than the details of spike trains
as the basis for cognitive information processing is proposed. This results in
a space of cognitive elements with natural metrics. Sets of spike trains may
also be considered to be points in a multidimensional metric space. The
closeness of sets of spike trains in such a space implies the closeness of
points in the resulting function space of potential distributions.
