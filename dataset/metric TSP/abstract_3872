We derive several results that describe the rate at which a generic geodesic
makes excursions into and out of a cusp on a finite area hyperbolic surface and
relate them to approximation with respect to the orbit of infinity for an
associated Fuchsian group. This provides proofs of some well known theorems
from metric diophantine approximation in the context of Fuchsian groups. It
also gives new results in the classical setting.
