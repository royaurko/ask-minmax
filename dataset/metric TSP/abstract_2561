We construct new explicit metrics on complete non-compact Riemannian
8-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7). One manifold, which we denote by A_8, is
topologically R^8 and another, which we denote by B_8, is the bundle of
chiral spinors over $S^4$. Unlike the previously-known complete non-compact
metric of Spin(7) holonomy, which was also defined on the bundle of chiral
spinors over S^4, our new metrics are asymptotically locally conical (ALC):
near infinity they approach a circle bundle with fibres of constant length over
a cone whose base is the squashed Einstein metric on CP^3. We construct the
covariantly-constant spinor and calibrating 4-form. We also obtain an
L^2-normalisable harmonic 4-form for the A_8 manifold, and two such
4-forms (of opposite dualities) for the B_8 manifold. We use the metrics to
construct new supersymmetric brane solutions in M-theory and string theory. In
particular, we construct resolved fractional M2-branes involving the use of the
L^2 harmonic 4-forms, and show that for each manifold there is a
supersymmetric example. An intriguing feature of the new A_8 and B_8
Spin(7) metrics is that they are actually the same local solution, with
the two different complete manifolds corresponding to taking the radial
coordinate to be either positive or negative. We make a comparison with the
Taub-NUT and Taub-BOLT metrics, which by contrast do not have special holonomy.
In an appendix we construct the general solution of our first-order equations
for Spin(7) holonomy, and obtain further regular metrics that are complete on
manifolds B^+_8 and B^-_8 similar to B_8.
