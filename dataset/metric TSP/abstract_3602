The approximate stress-energy tensor of the conformally invariant massless
spin-1/2 field in the Hartle-Hawking state in the Schwarzschild spacetime is
constructed. It is shown that by solving the conservation equation in conformal
space and utilizing the regularity conditions in a physical metric one obtains
the stress-energy tensor that is in a good agreement with the numerical
calculations. The back reaction of the quantized field upon the spacetime
metric is briefly discussed.
