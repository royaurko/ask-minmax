We derive two fixed point theorems for a class of metric spaces that includes
all Banach spaces and all complete Busemann spaces. We obtain our results by
the use of a 1-Lipschitz barycenter construction and an existence result for
invariant Radon probability measures. Furthermore, we construct a bounded
complete Busemann space that admits an isometry without fixed points.
