Effective string field equations with zero-constrained torsion have been
studied extensively in the literature. But, one may think that the effects of
vanishing of the non-metricity have not been explained in detail and also in
according to some recent literature [4],[5], the action density in my previous
paper [3] is not complete. For these reasons, in this erratum, in according to
the effects of vanishing of the non-metricity to the field equations, the
action density of my previous paper [3] will be completed in a variational
setting. Furthermore, up to now, an unambiguous derivation of the dilaton
potential has not been given. If one thinks that vanishing of the non-metricity
gives a spontaneous breakdown of local Weyl invariance then a dilaton potential
is obtained unambiguously in this framework.
