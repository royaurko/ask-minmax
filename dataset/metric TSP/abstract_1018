The most common decision criteria for decoding are maximum likelihood
decoding and nearest neighbor decoding. It is well-known that maximum
likelihood decoding coincides with nearest neighbor decoding with respect to
the Hamming metric on the binary symmetric channel. In this work we study
channels and metrics for which those two criteria do and do not coincide for
general codes.
