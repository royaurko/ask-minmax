We examine three-dimensional metric deformations based on a tetrad
transformation through the action the matrices of scalar fields. We describe by
this approach to deformation the results obtained by Coll et al. in [1], where
it is stated that any three--dimensional metric was locally obtained as a
deformation of a constant curvature metric parameterized by a 2--form.To this
aim, we construct the corresponding deforming matrices and provide their
classification according to the properties of the scalar $\sigma$ and of the
vector $\mathbf{s}$ used in [1] to deform the initial metric. The resulting
causal structure of the deformed geometries is examined, too.Finally we apply
our results to a spherically symmetric three geometry and to a space sector of
Kerr metric.
