We give a sharp condition on the lower local Lipschitz constant of a mapping
from a metric space supporting a Poincar\'e inequality to a Banach space with
the Radon-Nikodym property that guarantees differentiability at almost every
point. We apply these results to obtain a non-embedding theorem for a
corresponding class of mappings.
