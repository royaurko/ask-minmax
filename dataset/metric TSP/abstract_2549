In the low-velocity limit, multi-soliton solutions trace out geodesics in the
static solution manifold with distance defined by a metric on moduli space. For
the recently constructed multimonopole solutions of heterotic string theory, we
obtain a flat metric to leading order in the impact parameter. This result
agrees with the trivial scattering predicted by a test monopole calculation.
