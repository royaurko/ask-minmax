In this paper we demonstrate the existence of Sasakian-Einstein structures on
certain 2-connected rational homology 7-spheres. These appear to be the first
non-regular examples of Sasakian-Einstein metrics on simply connected rational
homology spheres. We also briefly describe the rational homology 7-spheres that
admit regular positive Sasakian structures.
