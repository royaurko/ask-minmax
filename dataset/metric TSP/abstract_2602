We compute the covering dimension the asymptotic cone of a connected Lie
group. For simply connected solvable Lie groups, this is the codimension of the
exponential radical.
  As an application of the proof, we give a characterization of connected Lie
groups that quasi-isometrically embed into a non-positively curved metric
space.
