Two solutions of the coupled Einstein-Maxwell field equations are found by
means of the Horsky-Mitskievitch generating conjecture. The vacuum limit of
those obtained classes of spacetimes is the seed gamma-metric and each of the
generated solutions is connected with one Killing vector of the seed spacetime.
Some of the limiting cases of our solutions are identified with already known
metrics, the relations among various limits are illustrated through a limiting
diagram. We also verify our calculation through the Ernst potentials. The
existence of circular geodesics is briefly discussed in the Appendix.
