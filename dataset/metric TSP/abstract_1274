We investigate the invariant metrics and complex geodesics in the universal
Teichm\"{u}ller space and Teichm\"{u}ller space of the punctured disk using
Milin's coefficient inequalities. This technique allows us to establish that
all non-expanding invariant metrics in either of these spaces coincide with its
intrinsic Teichm\"{u}ller metric.
  Other applications concern the variational theory for univalent functions
with quasiconformal extension. It turns out that geometric features caused by
the equality of metrics and connection with complex geodesics provide deep
distortion results for various classes of such functions and create new
phenomena which do not appear in the classical geometric function theory.
