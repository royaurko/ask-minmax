In a separably connected space any two points are contained in a separable
connected subset. We show a mechanism that takes a connected bounded metric
space and produces a complete connected metric space whose separablewise
components form a quotient space isometric to the original space. We repeatedly
apply this mechanism to construct, as an inverse limit, a complete connected
metric space whose each separable subset is zero-dimensional.
