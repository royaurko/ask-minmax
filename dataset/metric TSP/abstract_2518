The following issue is raised and discussed; when do families of foliations
by hypersurfaces on a given four dimensional manifold become the null surfaces
of some unknown, but to be determined, metric $g_{ab}(x)$? It follows from
these results that one can use these surfaces as fundamental variables for GR.
