A new probabilistic/statistical-mechanical approach to the study of canonical
metrics and measures on a complex algebraic variety X is introduced. On any
such variety with positive Kodaira dimension a canonical (birationally
invariant) random point processes is defined and shown to converge in
probability towards a canonical deterministic measure on X, coinciding with the
canonical measure of Song-Tian and Tsuji. More generally, the convergence is
shown to hold in the setting of log canonical pairs. In the case of variety X
of general type we obtain as a corollary that the (possibly singular)
Kahler-Einstein metric on X with negative Ricci curvature is the limit of a
canonical sequence of quasi-explicit Bergman type metrics. When X is defined
over the integers the partition functions of the point processes define height
type arithmetic invariants which, in the case of certain Shimura varieties, are
shown to converge to a logarithmic derivative of the corresponding Dedekind
zeta function. Finally, in the opposite setting of a Fano variety we relate the
canonical point processes to a new notion of stability, that we call Gibbs
stability, which admits a natural algebro-geometric formulation and which we
conjecture is equivalent to the existence of a Kahler-Einstein metric on X and
hence to K-stability as in the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture.
