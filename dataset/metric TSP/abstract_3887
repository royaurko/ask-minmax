We show that if a complete, doubling metric space is annularly linearly
connected then its conformal dimension is greater than one, quantitatively. As
a consequence, we answer a question of Bonk and Kleiner: if the boundary of a
one-ended hyperbolic group has no local cut points, then its conformal
dimension is greater than one.
