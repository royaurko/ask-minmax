We consider dynamical stability for a modified Ricci flow equation whose
stationary solutions include Einstein and Ricci soliton metrics. Our focus is
on homogeneous metrics on non-compact manifolds. Following the program of
Guenther, Isenberg, and Knopf, we define a class of weighted little H\"older
spaces with certain interpolation properties that allow the use of maximal
regularity theory and the application of a stability theorem of Simonett. With
this, we derive two stability theorems, one for a class of Einstein metrics and
one for a class of non-Einstein Ricci solitons. Using linear stability results
of Jablonski, Petersen, and the first contributor, we obtain dynamical stability for
many specific Einstein and Ricci soliton metrics on simply connected solvable
Lie groups.
