The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are considered in a semi-infinite lab
($x > 0$) in the presence of background metrics $ds^2 =u^2(x) \eta_{\mu\nu}
dx^\mu dx^\nu$ and $ds^2=-dt^2+u^2(x)\eta_{ij}dx^i dx^j$ with $u(x)=e^{\pm
gx}$. These metrics have non-constant scalar-curvatures. Various aspects of the
solutions are studied. For the first metric with $u(x)=e^{gx}$, it is shown
that the spectrums are discrete, with the ground state energy $E^2_{min}=p^2c^2
+ g^2c^2\hbar^2$ for spin-0 particles. For $u(x)=e^{-gx}$, the spectrums are
found to be continuous. For the second metric with $u(x)=e^{-gx}$, each
particle, depends on its transverse-momentum, can have continuous or discrete
spectrum. For Klein-Gordon particles, this threshold transverse-momentum is
$\sqrt{3}g/2$, while for Dirac particles it is $g/2$. There is no solution for
$u(x)=e^{gx}$ case. Some geometrical properties of these metrics are also
discussed.
