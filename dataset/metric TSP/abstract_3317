We provide a simple proof that in any homogeneous, compact metric space of
diameter $D$, if one finds the average distance $A$ achieved in $X$ with
respect to some isometry invariant Borel probability measure, then
$$\frac{D}{2} \leq A \leq D.$$ This result applies equally to vertex-transitive
graphs and to compact, connected, homogeneous Riemannian manifolds.
  We then classify the cases where one of the extremes occurs. In particular
any homogeneous compact metric space where $A=\frac{D}{2}$ possesses a strict
antipodal property which implies in particular that the distribution of
distances in $X$ is symmetric about $\frac{D}{2}$ which is hence both mean and
median of the distribution.
  In particular, we show that the only closed, connected, positive-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds with this strict antipodal property are spheres.
