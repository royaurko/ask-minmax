A resolving set of a graph is a set of vertices with the property that the
list of distances from any vertex to those in the set uniquely identifies that
vertex. In this paper, we construct a resolving set of Johnson graphs, doubled
Odd graphs, doubled Grassmann graphs and twisted Grassmann graphs,
respectively, and obtain the upper bounds on the metric dimension of these
graphs.
