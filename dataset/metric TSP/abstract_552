When studying convergence of measures, an important issue is the choice of
probability metric. In this review, we provide a summary and some new results
concerning bounds among ten important probability metrics/distances that are
used by statisticians and probabilists. We focus on these metrics because they
are either well-known, commonly used, or admit practical bounding techniques.
We summarize these relationships in a handy reference diagram, and also give
examples to show how rates of convergence can depend on the metric chosen.
