The notion of $\Gamma$-symmetric space is a natural generalization of the
classical notion of symmetric space based on $\Z_2$-grading of Lie algebras. In
our case, we consider homogeneous spaces $G/H$ such that the Lie algebra $\g$
of $G$ admits a $\Gamma$-grading where $\Gamma$ is a finite abelian group. In
this work we study Riemannian metrics and Lorentzian metrics on the Heisenberg
group $\mathbb{H}_3$ adapted to the symmetries of a $\Gamma$-symmetric
structure on $\mathbb{H}_3$. We prove that the classification of $\z$-symmetric
Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on $\mathbb{H}_3$ corresponds to the
classification of left-invariant Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics, up to
isometry. We study also the $\Z_2^k$-symmetric structures on $G/H$ when $G$ is
the $(2p+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group for $k \geq 1$. This gives examples
of non riemannian symmetric spaces. When $k \geq 1$, we show that there exists
a family of flat and torsion free affine connections adapted to the
$\Z_2^k$-symmetric structures.
