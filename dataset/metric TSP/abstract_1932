The metric for a Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black hole in the background of
the Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe is obtained. Then we verified it and
discussed the influence of the evolution of the universe on the size of the
black hole. To study the problem of the orbits of a planet in the expanding
universe, we rewrote the metric in the Schwarzschild coordinates system and
deduced the equation of motion for a planet.
