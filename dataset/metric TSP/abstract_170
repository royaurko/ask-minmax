We introduce a notion of the Euclidean- and the Minkowski rank for arbitrary
metric spaces and we study their behaviour with respect to products. We show
that the Minkowski rank is additive with respect to metric products, while
additivity of the Euclidean rank only holds under additional assumptions, e.g.
for Riemannian manifolds. We also study products with nonstandard product
metrics.
