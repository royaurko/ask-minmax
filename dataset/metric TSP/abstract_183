We give a construction of two-sided invariant metrics on free products
(possibly with amalgamation) of groups with two-sided invariant metrics and,
under certain conditions, on HNN extensions of such groups. Our approach is
similar to the Graev's construction of metrics on free groups over pointed
metric spaces
