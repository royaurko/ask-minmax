Dimensional types of metric scattered spaces are investigated. Revised proofs
of Mazurkiewicz-Sierpi\'nski and Knaster-Urbanik theorems are presented.
Embeddable properties of countable metric spaces are generalized onto
uncountable metric $\sigma$-discrete spaces. Some related topics are also
explored. For example: For each infinite cardinal number $\frak m$, there exist
$2^{\frak m}$ many non-homeomorphic metric scattered spaces of the cardinality
$\frak m $; If $X \subseteq \omega_1$ is a stationary set, then the poset
formed from dimensional types of subspaces of $X$ contains uncountable
anti-chains and uncountable strictly descending chains.
