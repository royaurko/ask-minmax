Let U denote the Urysohn sphere and consider U as a metric structure in the
empty continuous signature. We prove that every definable function from U^n to
U is either a projection function or else has relatively compact range. As a
consequence, we prove that many functions natural to the study of the Urysohn
sphere are not definable. We end with further topological information on the
range of the definable function in case it is compact.
