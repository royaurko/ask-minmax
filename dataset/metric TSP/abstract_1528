We show that the modulation of the hopping amplitudes in the honeycomb
lattice of the monolayer graphene uniquely defines a metric which corresponds
to the shape of the Dirac cone. The spin connection of this effective metric
field can be obtained from the microscopic tight-binding Hamiltonian exactly,
completing the analogy between the sublattice pseudospin travelling in the
monolayer graphene with ripples and strain fields, and the real spin $1/2$
fermion travelling in a curved space. The effective metric as seen by the
sublattice pseudospin is different from the real space metric as defined by the
two-dimensional manifold of the graphene monolayer. All relevant terms of the
effective gauge field from the microscopic model is calculated exactly for a
unimodular effective metric.
