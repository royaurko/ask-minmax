We completely explore the system of ODE's which is equivalent to the
existence of a parallel $Spin(7)$-structure on the cone over a 7-dimensional
3-Sasakian manifold. The one-dimensional family of solutions of this system is
constructed. The solutions of this family correspond to metrics with holonomy
SU(4) which generalize the Calabi metrics.
