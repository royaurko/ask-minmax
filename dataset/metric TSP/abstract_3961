For several instances of metric largeness like enlargeability or having
hyperspherical universal covers, we construct non-large vector subspaces in the
rational homology of finitely generated groups. The functorial properties of
this construction imply that the corresponding largeness properties of closed
manifolds depend only on the image of their fundamental classes under the
classifying map.
  This is applied to construct examples of essential manifolds whose universal
covers are not hyperspherical, thus answering a question of Gromov (1986), and,
more generally, essential manifolds which are not enlargeable.
