We study asymptotic behavior of positive smooth solutions of the conformal
scalar curvature equation in ${\bf R}^n$. We consider the case when the scalar
curvature of the conformal metric is bounded between two positive numbers
outside a compact set. It is shown that the solution has slow decay if the
radial change is controlled. For a positive solution with slow decay, the
corresponding conformal metric is found to be complete if and only if the total
volume is infinite. We also determine the sign of the Pohozaev number in some
situations and show that if the Pohozaev is equal to zero, then either the
solution has fast decay, or the conformal metric corresponding to the solution
is complete and the corresponding solution in ${\bf R} \times S^{n - 1}$ has a
sequence of local maxima that approach the standard spherical solution.
