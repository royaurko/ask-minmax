In this paper, we give the general form of spherically symmetric Finsler
metrics in $R^n$ and surprisedly find that many well-known Finsler metrics
belong to this class. Then we explicitly express projective metrics of this
type. The necessary and sufficient conditions that projective Finsler metrics
with spherical symmetry have constant flag curvature are also obtained.
