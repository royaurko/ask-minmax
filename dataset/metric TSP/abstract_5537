Let $g$ and $\tilde{g}$ be Riemannian metrics on a noncompact manifold $M$,
which are conformally equivalent. We show that under a very mild \emph{first
order} control on the conformal factor, the wave operators corresponding to the
Hodge-Laplacians $\Delta_g$ and $\Delta_{\tilde{g}}$ acting on differential
forms exist and are complete. We apply this result to Riemannian manifolds with
a bounded geometry and more specifically, to warped product Riemannian
manifolds with a bounded geometry. Finally, we combine our results with some
explicit calculations by Antoci to determine the absolutely continuous spectrum
of the Hodge-Laplacian on $j$-forms for a large class of warped product
metrics.
