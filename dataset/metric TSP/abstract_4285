We study the spectral geometric properties of the scalar Laplace-Beltrami
operator associated to the Weil-Petersson metric $g_{\mathrm{WP}}$ on $\mathcal
M_\gamma$, the Riemann moduli space of surfaces of genus $\gamma > 1$. This
space has a singular compactification with respect to $g_{\mathrm{WP}}$, and
this metric has crossing cusp-edge singularities along a finite collection of
simple normal crossing divisors. We prove first that the scalar Laplacian is
essentially self-adjoint, which then implies that its spectrum is discrete. The
second theorem is a Weyl asymptotic formula for the counting function for this
spectrum.
