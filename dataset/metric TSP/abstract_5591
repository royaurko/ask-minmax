Oeljeklaus-Toma (OT) manifolds are certain compact complex manifolds built
from number fields. Conversely, we show that the fundamental group often pins
down the number field uniquely. We relate the first homology to some
interesting ideal. OT manifolds are never K\"ahler, but carry an LCK metric
(locally conformally K\"ahler). Oeljeklaus and Toma used them to disprove a
conjecture on the Betti numbers of spaces carrying LCK metrics. Mysteriously,
the volume for this metric gives the discriminant and Dirichlet regulator of
the number field. Totally unlike the above topological aspects, there does not
seem to be a conceptual reason why this should be expected. Is it a
coincidence? We explore this and see what happens if we (entirely
experimentally!) regard them as "baby siblings" of, say, hyperbolic manifolds
coming from number fields. We ask the same questions and obtain similar
answers, but ultimately it remains unclear whether we are chasing ghosts or
not.
