We will show that the Nariai metric, i.e. the static spherically symmetric
vacuum spacetime with a cosmological constant, admits a conformally Kerr-Schild
spacetime representation. We find the vacuum solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell
equations for the Nariai metric using the Horsky-Mitskievich generating
conjecture.
