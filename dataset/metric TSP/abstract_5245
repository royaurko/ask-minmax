This paper discusses a new family of bounds for use in similarity search,
related to those used in metric indexing, but based on Ptolemy's inequality,
rather than the metric axioms. Ptolemy's inequality holds for the well-known
Euclidean distance, but is also shown here to hold for quadratic form metrics
in general, with Mahalanobis distance as an important special case. The
inequality is examined empirically on both synthetic and real-world data sets
and is also found to hold approximately, with a very low degree of error, for
important distances such as the angular pseudometric and several Lp norms.
Indexing experiments demonstrate a highly increased filtering power compared to
existing, triangular methods. It is also shown that combining the Ptolemaic and
triangular filtering can lead to better results than using either approach on
its own.
