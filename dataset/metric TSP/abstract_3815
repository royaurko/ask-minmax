For a closed connected surface with a metric g, we consider the regularized
trace of the inverse of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We minimize this on the
class of smooth metrics conformal to g having the same area, and show that the
infimum is less than or equal to the value for the round sphere of the same
area, and if it is equal, then it is attained. In fact we prove the analogs of
these results for general dimensional compact manifolds. Explicitly, the
results are logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalites. By duality they
give analogs of the Onofri-Beckner theorem.
