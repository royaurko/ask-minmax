Let $E\to M$ be a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact Kaehler manifold
$(M, \omega)$. We prove that if $E$ admits a $\omega$-balanced metric (in X.
Wang's terminology) then it is unique. This result together with a result of L.
Biliotti and A. Ghigi implies the existence and uniqueness of $\omega$-balanced
metrics of certain direct sums of irreducible homogeneous vector bundles over
rational homogeneous varieties. We finally apply our result to show the
rigidity of $\omega$-balanced Kaehler maps into Grassmannians.
