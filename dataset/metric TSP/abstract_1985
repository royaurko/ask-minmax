The main purpose of this monograph is to give an elementary and
self-contained account of the existence of asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein
metrics with prescribed conformal infinities sufficiently close to that of a
given asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein metric with nonpositive curvature. The
proof is based on an elementary derivation of sharp Fredholm theorems for
self-adjoint geometric linear elliptic operators on asymptotically hyperbolic
manifolds.
