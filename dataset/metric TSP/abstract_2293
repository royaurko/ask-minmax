In this paper, firstly we study some left invariant Riemannian metrics on
para-hypercomplex 4-dimensional Lie groups. In each Lie group, the Levi-Civita
connection and sectional curvature have been given explicitly. We also show
these spaces have constant negative scalar curvatures. Then by using left
invariant Riemannian metrics introduced in the first part, we construct some
left invariant Randers metrics of Berwald type. The explicit formulas for
computing flag curvature have been obtained in all cases. Some of these Finsler
Lie groups are of non-positive flag curvature.
