Suppose (X,\omega_0) is a compact K\"ahler manifold. In the present work we
propose a simple construction for weak geodesic rays in the space of K\"ahler
metrics that seems to be tied together with properties of the class
E(X,\omega_0). As an application of our construction, we prove a
characterization of E(X,\omega_0) in terms of envelopes.
