Geometric Quantum Mechanics is a novel and prospecting approach motivated by
the belief that our world is ultimately geometrical. At the heart of that is a
quantity called Quantum Geometric Tensor (or Fubini-Study metric), which is a
complex tensor with the real part serving as the Riemannian metric that
measures the `quantum distance', and the imaginary part being the Berry
curvature. Following a physical introduction of the basic formalism, we
illustrate its physical significance in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic
systems.
