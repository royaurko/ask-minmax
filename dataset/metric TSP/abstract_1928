We extend the previously found accelerated Kerr-Schild metrics for
Einstein-Maxwell-null dust and Einstein-Born-Infeld-null dust equations to the
cases including the cosmological constant. This way we obtain the
generalization of the charged de Sitter metrics in static space-times. We also
give a generalization of the zero acceleration limit of our previous
Einstein-Maxwell and Einstein-Born-Infeld solutions.
