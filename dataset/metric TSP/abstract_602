We prove the following conjecture recently formulated by Jakobson,
Nadirashvili and Polterovich \cite{JNP}: on the Klein bottle $\mathbb{K}$, the
metric of revolution $$g_0= {9+ (1+8\cos ^2v)^2\over 1+8\cos ^2v} (du^2 +
{dv^2\over 1+8\cos ^2v}),$$ $0\le u <\frac\pi 2$, $0\le v <\pi$, is the
\emph{unique} extremal metric of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian viewed
as a functional on the space of all Riemannian metrics of given area. The proof
leads us to study a Hamiltonian dynamical system which turns out to be
completely integrable by quadratures.
