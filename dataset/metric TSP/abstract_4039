We show that it is possible to go beyond the simple kinematical aspects of
the analog models of gravity. We exhibit the form of the Lagrangian that
describes the dynamics of a self-interacting field $ \phi $ as an interaction
between $ \phi $ and its associated effective metric $ \hat{g}^{\mu\nu}.$ In
other words the non-linear equation of motion of the field may be interpreted
as the gravitational influence on $ \phi $ by its own effective metric which,
in our scheme becomes an active partner of the dynamics of $ \phi. $
