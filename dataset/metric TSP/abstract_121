We prove an analogue of Farb-Masur's theorem that the length-spectra metric
on moduli space is "almost isometric" to a simple model $\mathcal {V}(S)$ which
is induced by the cone metric over the complex of curves. As an application, we
know that the Teichm\"{u}ller metric and the length-spectra metric are "almost
isometric" on moduli space, while they are not even quasi-isometric on
Teichm\"{u}ller space.
