We study extremal discs for the Kobayashi metric. Inspired by work of Lempert
on strongly convex domains, we present results on strongly pseudoconvex
domains.
  We also consider a useful biholomorphic invariant, inspired by the Kobayashi
(and Carath\'{e}odory) metric, and prove several new results about
biholomorphic equivalence of domains. Some useful results about automorphism
groups of complex domains are also established.
