We study the conditions of the existence of Hawking into Unruh mapping for
hyperbolic (Fronsdal-type) embeddings of metric into the Minkowski space, for
which timelines are hyperbolas. Many examples are known for global embeddings
into the Minkowskian spacetime (GEMS) with such mapping for physically
interesting metrics with some symmetry. However the examples of embeddings,
both smooth and hyperbolic, for which there is no mapping, were also given. In
the present work we prove that Hawking into Unruh mapping takes place for a
hyperbolic embedding of an arbitrary metric with a time-like Killing vector and
a Killing horizon if the embedding of such type exists and smoothly covers the
horizon. At the same time we do not assume any symmetry (spherical for
example), except the time translational invariance which corresponds to the
existence of a time-like Killing vector. We show that the known examples of the
absence of mapping do not satisfy the formulated conditions of its existence.
