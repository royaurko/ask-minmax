Apart from the well known algebraic and arithmetic B\'ezout Theorems, there
also is the metric B\'ezout Theorem. For two properly intersecting effective
cycles in projective space X,Y, and their intersection product Z, it relates
not only the degrees and heights of X,Y, and Z, but also their distances and
algebraic distances to a given point $\theta$. Applications of this Theorem
will lie in the area of Diophantine Approximation, where one wants to estimate
approximation properties of Z with respect to $\theta$ against the ones of X,
and Y.
