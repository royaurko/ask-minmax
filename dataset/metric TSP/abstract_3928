The purpose of the present expository paper is to give an account of the
recent progress and present status of the classification of solvable Lie groups
admitting an Einstein left invariant Riemannian metric, the only known examples
so far of noncompact Einstein homogeneous manifolds. The problem turns to be
equivalent to the classification of Ricci soliton left invariant metrics on
nilpotent Lie groups.
