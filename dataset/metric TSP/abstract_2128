In this paper we study asymptotic properties of symmetric and non-degenerate
random walks on transient hyperbolic groups. We prove a central limit theorem
and a law of iterated logarithm for the drift of a random walk, extending
previous results by S. Sawyer and T. Steger and F. Ledrappier for certain CAT
minus one groups. The proofs use a result by A. Ancona on the identification of
the Martin boundary of a hyperbolic group with its Gromov boundary. We also
give a new interpretation, in terms of Hilbert metrics, of the Green metric,
first introduced by S. Brofferio and S. Blachere.
