We consider the stochastic quantization method for scalar fields defined in a
curved manifold. The two-point function associated to a massive
self-interacting scalar field is evaluated, up to the first order level in the
coupling constant $\lambda$, for the case of de Sitter Euclidean metric. Its
value for the asymptotic limit of the Markov parameter $\tau\to\infty$ is
exhibited. We discuss in detail the covariant stochastic regularization to
render the one-loop two-point function finite in the de Sitter Euclidean
metric.
