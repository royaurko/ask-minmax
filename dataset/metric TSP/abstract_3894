We construct a five dimensional exact solution of the orthogonal black
di-ring which has two black rings whose $S^1$-rotating planes are orthogonal.
This solution has four free parameters which represent radii of and speeds of
$S^1$-rotation of the black rings. We use the inverse scattering method. This
method needs the seed metric. We also present a systematic method how to
construct a seed metric. Using this method, we can probably construct other
solutions having many black rings on the two orthogonal planes with or without
a black hole at the center.
