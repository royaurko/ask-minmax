In this work we present a new criterion to check if a given rank-metric code
is a maximum rank distance (MRD) code. Moreover, we derive a criterion to check
if a given rank-metric code is a generalized Gabidulin code. We then use these
results to come up with constructions of linear MRD codes of length 4 and
dimension 2 that are not generalized Gabidulin codes.
