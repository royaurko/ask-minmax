We derive Bogomolny equations for an Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton-$\sigma$
model (EYMD-$\sigma$) on a static spacetime, showing that the Einstein
equations are satisfied if and only if the associated (conformally scaled)
three-metric is flat. These are precisely the static metrics for which
super-covariantly constant spinors exist. We study some general properties of
these equations and then consider the problem of obtaining axially symmetric
solutions for the gauge group SU(2).
