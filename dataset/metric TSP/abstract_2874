A remarkable example of a nonempty closed convex set in the Euclidean plane
for which the directional derivative of the metric projection mapping fails to
exist was constructed by A. Shapiro. In this paper, we revisit and modify that
construction to obtain a convex set with smooth boundary which possesses the
same property.
