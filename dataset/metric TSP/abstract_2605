Many manifestly non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (typically, PT-symmetric complex
anharmonic oscillators) possess a strictly real, "physical" bound-state
spectrum. This means that they are (quasi-)Hermitian with respect to a suitable
non-standard metric. The domain D of the existence of this metric is studied
here for a nontrivial though still non-numerical four-parametric "benchmark"
matrix model.
