We give upper and lower bounds for the ratio of the volume of metric ball to
the area of the metric sphere in Finsler-Hadamard manifolds with pinched
S-curvature. We apply these estimates to find the limit at the infinity for
this ratio. Derived estimates are the generalization of the well-known result
in Riemannian geometry. We also estimate the volume growth entropy for the
balls in such manifolds.
