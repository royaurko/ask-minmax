The Kerr-Schild pencil of metrics $g_{ab}+\La l_al_b$ is investigated in the
generic case when it maps an arbitrary vacuum space-time with metric $g_{ab}$
to a vacuum space-time. The theorem is proved that this generic case, with the
field $l$ shearing, does not contain the shear-free subclass as a smooth limit.
It is shown that one of the K\'ota-Perj\'es metrics is a solution in the
shearing class.
