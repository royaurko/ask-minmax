Integrable hypercomplex structures with Hermitian and Norden metrics on Lie
groups of dimension 4 are considered. The corresponding five types of invariant
hypercomplex structures with hyper-Hermitian metric, studied by M.L. Barberis,
are constructed here. The different cases regarding the signature of the basic
pseudo-Riemannian metric are considered.
