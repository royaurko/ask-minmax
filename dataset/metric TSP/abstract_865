The classical uniformization theorem states that any simply connected Riemann
surface is conformally equivalent to the disk, the plane, or the sphere, each
equipped with a standard conformal structure. We give a similar uniformization
for Ahlfors 2-regular, linearly locally connected metric planes; instead of
conformal equivalence, we are concerned with quasisymmetric equivalence.
