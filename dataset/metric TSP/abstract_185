In this paper we study a class of Finsler metrics defined by a Riemannian
metric and an 1-form. We classify those of projectively flat in dimension
$n\geq3$ by a special class of deformations. The results show that the
projective flatness of such kind of Finsler metrics always arises from that of
some Riemannian metric.
