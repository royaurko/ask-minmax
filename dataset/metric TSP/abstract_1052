We use the Einstein and Papapetrou energy-momentum complexes to calculate the
energy and momentum densities of Weyl metric as well as Curzon metric. We show
that these two different definitions of energy-momentum complexes do not
provide the same energy density for Weyl metric, although they give the same
momentum density. We show that, in the case of Curzon metric, these two
definitions give the same energy only when $R \to \infty$. Furthermore, we
compare these results with those obtained using Landau and Lifshitz, Bergmann
and M{\o}ller.
