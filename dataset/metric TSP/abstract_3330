Recent empirical observations of three-dimensional bird flocks and human
crowds have challenged the long-prevailing assumption that a metric interaction
distance rules swarming behaviors. In some cases, individual agents are found
to be engaged in local information exchanges with a fixed number of neighbors,
i.e. a topological interaction. However, complex system dynamics based on pure
metric or pure topological distances both face physical inconsistencies in low
and high density situations. Here, we propose a hybrid metric-topological
interaction distance overcoming these issues and enabling a real-life
implementation in artificial robotic swarms. We use network- and
graph-theoretic approaches combined with a dynamical model of locally
interacting self-propelled particles to study the consensus reaching pro- cess
for a swarm ruled by this hybrid interaction distance. Specifically, we
establish exactly the probability of reaching consensus in the absence of
noise. In addition, simulations of swarms of self-propelled particles are
carried out to assess the influence of the hybrid distance and noise.
