We calculate the finite vacuum energy density of the scalar and
electromagnetic fields inside a Casimir apparatus made up of two conducting
parallel plates in a general weak gravitational field. The metric of the weak
gravitational field has a small deviation from flat spacetime inside the
apparatus and we find it by expanding the metric in terms of small parameters
of the weak background. We show that the found metric can be transformed via a
gauge transformation to the Fermi metric. We solve the Klein-Gordon equation
exactly and find mode frequencies in Fermi spacetime. Using the fact that the
electromagnetic field can be represented by two scalar fields in the Fermi
spacetime, we find general formulas for the energy density and mode frequencies
of the electromagnetic field. Some well-known weak backgrounds are examined and
consistency of the results with the literature is shown.
