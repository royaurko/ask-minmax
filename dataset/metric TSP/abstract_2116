We study pure radiation spacetimes of algebraic types O and N with a possible
cosmological constant. In particular, we present explicit transformations which
put these metrics, that were recently re-derived by Edgar, Vickers and Machado
Ramos, into a general Ozsvath-Robinson-Rozga form. By putting all such metrics
into the unified coordinate system we confirm that their derivation based on
the GIF formalism is correct. We identify only few trivial differences.
