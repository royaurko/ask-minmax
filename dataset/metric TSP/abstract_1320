We discuss the question, whether the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m RN) metric can be
glued to another solutions of Einstein-Maxwell equations in such a way that (i)
the singularity at r=0 typical of the RN metric is removed (ii), matching is
smooth. Such a construction could be viewed as a classical model of an
elementary particle balanced by its own forces without support by an external
agent. One choice is the Minkowski interior that goes back to the old Vilenkin
and Fomin's idea who claimed that in this case the bare delta-like stresses at
the horizon vanish if the RN metric is extremal. However, the relevant entity
here is the integral of these stresses over the proper distance which is
infinite in the extremal case. As a result of the competition of these two
factors, the Lanczos tensor does not vanish and the extremal RN cannot be glued
to the Minkowski metric smoothly, so the elementary-particle model as a ball
empty inside fails. We examine the alternative possibility for the extremal RN
metric - gluing to the Bertotti-Robinson (BR) metric. For a surface placed
outside the horizon there always exist bare stresses but their amplitude goes
to zero as the radius of the shell approaches that of the horizon. This limit
realizes the Wheeler idea of "mass without mass" and "charge without charge".
We generalize the model to the extremal Kerr-Newman metric glued to the
rotating analog of the BR metric.
