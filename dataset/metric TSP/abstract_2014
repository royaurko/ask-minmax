It is known that the Stone-Cech compactification of a metrizable space X is
approximated by the collection of Smirnov compactifications of X for all
compatible metrics on X. If we confine ourselves to locally compact separable
metrizable spaces, the corresponding statement holds for Higson
compactifications. We investigate the smallest cardinality of a set D of
compatible metrics on X such that the Stone-Cech compactification of X is
approximated by Smirnov or Higson compactifications for all metrics in D. We
prove that it is either the dominating number or 1 for a locally compact
separable metrizable space.
