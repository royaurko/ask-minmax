We derive a radiating regular rotating black hole solution, radiating
Kerr-like regular black hole solution. We achieve this by starting from the
Hayward regular black hole solution via a complex transformation suggested by
Newman-Janis. The radiating Kerr metric, the Kerr-like regular black hole and
the standard Kerr metric are regained in the appropriate limits. The structure
of the horizon-like surfaces are also determined.
