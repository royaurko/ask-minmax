In this paper, we embed metric space endowed with a convex combination
operation, named convex combination space, into a Banach space and the
embedding preserves the structures of metric and convex combination. For random
element taking values in this kind of space, applications of embedding are also
established. On the one hand, some nice properties of expectation such as
representation of expected value through continuous affine mappings, the
linearity of expectation will be given. On the other hand, the notion of
conditional expectation will be also introduced and discussed. Thanks to
embedding theorem, we establish some basic properties of conditional
expectation, Jensen's inequality, convergences of martingales and ergodic
theorem.
