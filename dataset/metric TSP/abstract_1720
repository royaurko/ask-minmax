We introduce a new class of countably infinite random geometric graphs, whose
vertices are points in a metric space, and vertices are adjacent independently
with probability p if the metric distance between the vertices is below a given
threshold. If the vertex set is a countable dense set in R^n equipped with the
metric derived from the L_{\infty}-norm, then it is shown that with probability
1 such infinite random geometric graphs have a unique isomorphism type. The
isomorphism type, which we call GR_n, is characterized by a geometric analogue
of the existentially closed adjacency property, and we give a deterministic
construction of GR_n. In contrast, we show that infinite random geometric
graphs in R^2 with the Euclidean metric are not necessarily isomorphic.
