We give a description of the completion of the manifold of all smooth
Riemannian metrics on a fixed smooth, closed, finite-dimensional, orientable
manifold with respect to a natural metric called the $L^2$ metric. The primary
motivation for studying this problem comes from Teichmueller theory, where
similar considerations lead to a completion of the well-known Weil-Petersson
metric. We give an application of the main theorem to the completions of
Teichmueller space with respect to a class of metrics that generalize the
Weil-Petersson metric.
