We start from a hyperbolic DN hydrodynamic type system of dimension $n$ which
possesses Riemann invariants and we settle the necessary conditions on the
conservation laws in the reciprocal transformation so that, after such a
transformation of the independent variables, one of the metrics associated to
the initial system be flat. We prove the following statement: let $n\ge 3$ in
the case of reciprocal transformations of a single independent variable or
$n\ge 5$ in the case of transformations of both the independent variable; then
the reciprocal metric may be flat only if the conservation laws in the
transformation are linear combinations of the canonical densities of
conservation laws, {\it i.e} the Casimirs, the momentum and the Hamiltonian
densities associated to the Hamiltonian operator for the initial metric. Then,
we restrict ourselves to the case in which the initial metric is either flat or
of constant curvature and we classify the reciprocal transformations of one or
both the independent variables so that the reciprocal metric is flat. Such
characterization has an interesting geometric interpretation: the hypersurfaces
of two diagonalizable DN systems of dimension $n\ge 5$ are Lie equivalent if
and only if the corresponding local hamiltonian structures are related by a
canonical reciprocal transformation.
