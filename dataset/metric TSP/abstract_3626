Using the Post-Minkowskian formalism and considering rotation as a
perturbation, we compute an approximate interior solution for a stationary
perfect fluid with constant density and axial symmetry. A suitable change of
coordinates allows this metric to be matched to the exterior metric to a
particle with a pole-dipole-quadrupole structure, relating the parameters of
both.
