An interleaver is a critical component for the channel coding
  performance of turbo codes. Algebraic constructions are
  important because they admit analytical designs and
  simple, practical hardware implementation. The spread factor of an
  interleaver is a common measure for turbo coding
  applications. Maximum-spread interleavers are interleavers whose
  spread factors achieve the upper bound. An infinite sequence of
  quadratic permutation polynomials over integer rings that generate
  maximum-spread interleavers is presented. New properties of
  permutation polynomial interleavers are investigated from an
  algebraic-geometric perspective resulting in a new non-linearity metric
  for interleavers. A new interleaver metric that is a function of both
  the non-linearity metric and the spread factor is proposed.
  It is numerically demonstrated that the spread factor has a
  diminishing importance with the block length. A table of good
  interleavers for a variety of interleaver lengths according to the
  new metric is listed. Extensive computer simulation results with impressive
  frame error rates confirm the efficacy of the new metric. Further,
  when tail-biting constituent codes are used, the resulting turbo
  codes are quasi-cyclic.
