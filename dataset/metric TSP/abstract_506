We consider a notion of balanced metrics for triples (X,L,E) which depend on
a parameter \alpha, where X is smooth complex manifold with an ample line
bundle L and E is a holomorphic vector bundle over X. For generic choice of
\alpha, we prove that the limit of a convergent sequence of balanced metrics
leads to a Hermitian-Einstein metric on E and a constant scalar curvature
K\"ahler metric in c_1(L). For special values of \alpha, limits of balanced
metrics are solutions of a system of coupled equations relating a
Hermitian-Einstein metric on E and a K\"ahler metric in c_1(L). For this, we
compute the top two terms of the density of states expansion of the Bergman
kernel of E \otimes L^k.
