We investigate in detail two physical properties of the metric f(R) theory
developed by Sobouti (2007). We first look for the possibility of producing
gravitational waves that travel at the speed of light. We then check the
possibility of producing extra bending in the lenses produced by the theory. We
do this by using standard weak field approximations to the gravitational field
equations that appear in Sobouti's theory. We show in this article that the
metric theory of gravitation proposed by Sobouti (2007) predicts the existence
of gravitational waves travelling at the speed of light in vacuum. In fact,
this is proved in general terms for all metric theories of gravity which can be
expressed as powers of Ricci's scalar. We also show that an extra additional
lensing as compared to the one predicted by standard general relativity is
produced. These two points are generally considered to be of crucial importance
in the development of relativistic theories of gravity that could provide an
alternative description to the dark matter paradigm.
