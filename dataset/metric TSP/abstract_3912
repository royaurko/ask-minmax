We study inverse scattering for $\Delta_g+V$ on $(X,g)$ a conformally compact
manifold with metric $g,$ with variable sectional curvature $-\alf^2(y)$ at the
boundary and $V\in C^\infty(X)$ not vanishing at the boundary. We prove that
the scattering matrix at a fixed energies $(\lambda_1,$ $\lambda_2)$ in a
suitable subset of $\mc$, determines $\alf,$ and the Taylor series of both the
potential and the metric at the boundary.
