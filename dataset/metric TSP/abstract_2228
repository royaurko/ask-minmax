The $i$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a
surface can be considered as a functional on the space of all Riemannian
metrics of unit volume on this surface. Surprisingly only few examples of
extremal metrics for these functionals are known. In the present paper a new
countable family of extremal metrics on the torus is provided.
