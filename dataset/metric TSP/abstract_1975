A hyperK\"ahler potential is a function rho that is a K\"ahler potential for
each complex structure compatible with the hyperK\"ahler structure. Nilpotent
orbits in a complex simple Lie algebra are known to carry hyperK\"ahler metrics
admitting such potentials. In this paper, we explicitly calculate the
hyperK\"ahler potential when the orbit is of cohomogeneity two. In some cases,
we find that this structure lies in a one-parameter family of hyperK\"ahler
metrics with K\"ahler potentials, generalising the Eguchi-Hanson metrics in
dimension four.
