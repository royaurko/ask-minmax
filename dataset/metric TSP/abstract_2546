We explore differences between scalar field, and scalar density solutions by
using Robertson-Walker (RW) metric, and also a non-relativistic Hamiltonian is
derived for a scalar density field in the post-Newtonian approximation. The
results are compared with those of scalar field. The expanding universe in RW
metric, and post-Newtonian solution of Klein-Gordon equation are separately
discussed.
