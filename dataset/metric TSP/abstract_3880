In the framework of the Weyl-Dirac version of Wesson's Induced Matter Theory,
spherically symmetric entities filled with an electrically charged substance
are obtained in the empty 4D space-time, the brane. The substance,
characterized by mass and charge density as well by pressure, is induced by the
5D bulk. The entity is separated from the surrounding vacuum by a boundary
surface, where the metric satisfy the Schwarzschild conditions. Outside one has
the Reissner-Nordstroem metric with M=Q. These entities may be regarded as
classical (non-quantum) fundamental particles serving as constituents of quarks
and leptons.
