Uniform fields are one of the simplest and most pedagogically useful examples
in introductory courses on electrostatics or Newtonian gravity. In general
relativity there have been several proposals as to what constitutes a uniform
field. In this article we examine two metrics that can be considered the
general relativistic version of the infinite plane with finite mass per unit
area. The first metric is the 4D version of the 5D "brane" world models which
are the starting point for many current research papers. The second case is the
cosmological domain wall metric. We examine to what extent these different
metrics match or deviate from our Newtonian intuition about the gravitational
field of an infinite plane. These solutions provide the beginning student in
general relativity both computational practice and conceptual insight into
Einstein's field equations. In addition they do this by introducing the student
to material that is at the forefront of current research.
