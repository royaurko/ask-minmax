Recently, Taneja studied two one parameter generalizations of J-divergence,
Jensen-Shannon divergence and Arithmetic-Geometric divergence. These two
generalizations in particular contain measures like: Hellinger discrimination,
symmetric chi-square divergence, and triangular discrimination. These measures
are well known in the literature of Statistics and Information theory. In this
paper our aim is to prove metric space properties for square root of these two
symmetric generalized divergence measures.
