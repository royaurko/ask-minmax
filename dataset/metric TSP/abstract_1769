In this paper, the geometric meaning of (alpha,beta)-norms is made clear. On
this basis, we introduce a new class of Finsler metrics called general
(alpha,beta)-metrics, which are defined by a Riemannian metric and an 1-form.
These metrics not only generalize original (alpha,beta)-metrics naturally, but
also include some metrics structured by R. Bryant.
  The notion of general (alpha,beta)-metrics is one of the original ideas
belongs to the first contributor(another one is beta-deformations intruduced in the
paper "Deformations and Hilbert's Fourth Problem"). We believe that the
researches on general (alpha,beta)-metrics will enrich Finsler geometry and the
approaches offer references for further study. But it seems that the classical
methods suitable for (alpha,beta)-metrics may not be suitable for them, the
idea used in this paper, which is closely related to beta-deformations, is
non-classical. Any communication or suggestion is welcome.
