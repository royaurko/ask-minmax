We apply the counterterm subtraction technique to calculate the action and
other quantities for the Kerr--AdS black hole in five dimensions using two
boundary metrics; the Einstein universe and rotating Einstein universe with
arbitrary angular velocity. In both cases, the resulting thermodynamic
quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We point out that the
reason for the violation of the first law in previous calculations is that the
rotating Einstein universe, used as a boundary metric, was rotating with an
angular velocity that depends on the black hole rotation parameter. Using a new
coordinate system with a boundary metric that has an arbitrary angular
velocity, one can show that the resulting physical quantities satisfy the first
law.
