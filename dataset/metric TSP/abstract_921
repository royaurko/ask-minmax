In this paper, we show that the existence of Sasakian-Einstein metrics is
closely related to the properness of corresponding energy functionals. Under
the condition that admitting no nontrivial Hamiltonian holomorphic vector
field, we prove that the existence of Sasakian-Einstein metric implies a
Moser-Trudinger type inequality. At the end of this paper, we also obtain a
Miyaoka-Yau type inequality in Sasakian geometry.
