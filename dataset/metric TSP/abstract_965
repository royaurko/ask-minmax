We look at group actions on metric spaces, particularly at group actions on
geodesic hyperbolic spaces. We classify the types of automorphisms on these
spaces and prove several results about the density of the hyperbolic limit set
of the group in the whole limit set of the group. In the case of graphs, our
theorems hold also when the graphs are not hyperbolic.
