In this work, we propose a novel no-reference (NR) video quality metric that
evaluates the impact of frame freezing due to either packet loss or late
arrival. Our metric uses a trained neural network acting on features that are
chosen to capture the impact of frame freezing on the perceived quality. The
considered features include the number of freezes, freeze duration statistics,
inter-freeze distance statistics, frame difference before and after the freeze,
normal frame difference, and the ratio of them. We use the neural network to
find the mapping between features and subjective test scores. We optimize the
network structure and the feature selection through a cross validation
procedure, using training samples extracted from both VQEG and LIVE video
databases. The resulting feature set and network structure yields accurate
quality prediction for both the training data containing 54 test videos and a
separate testing dataset including 14 videos, with Pearson Correlation
Coefficients greater than 0.9 and 0.8 for the training set and the testing set,
respectively. Our proposed metric has low complexity and could be utilized in a
system with realtime processing constraint.
