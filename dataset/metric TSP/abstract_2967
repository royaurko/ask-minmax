Some aspects of the fields of charge two SU(3) monopoles with minimal
symmetry breaking are discussed. A certain class of solutions look like SU(2)
monopoles embedded in SU(3) with a transition region or ``cloud'' surrounding
the monopoles. For large cloud size the relative moduli space metric splits as
a direct product AH\times R^4 where AH is the Atiyah-Hitchin metric for SU(2)
monopoles and R^4 has the flat metric. Thus the cloud is parametrised by R^4
which corresponds to its radius and SO(3) orientation. We solve for the
long-range fields in this region, and examine the energy density and rotational
moments of inertia. The moduli space metric for these monopoles, given by
Dancer, is also expressed in a more explicit form.
