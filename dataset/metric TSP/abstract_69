We classify all Kahler metrics in an open subset of $C^2$ whose real
geodesics are circles. All such metrics are equivalent (via complex projective
transformations) to Fubini metrics (i.e. to Fubini-Study metric on $CP^2$
restricted to an affine chart, to the complex hyperbolic metric in the unit
ball model or to the Euclidean metric).
