This article studies the smoothness of conformal mappings between two
Riemannian manifolds whose metric tensors have limited regularity. We show that
any bi-Lipschitz conformal mapping between two manifolds with $C^r$ metric
tensors ($r > 1$) is a $C^{r+1}$ conformal diffeomorphism. This result is due
to Iwaniec \cite{Iwaniec_thesis}, but we give a new proof of this fact. The
proof is based on $n$-harmonic coordinates, a generalization of the standard
harmonic coordinates that is particularly suited to studying conformal
mappings. We establish the existence of a $p$-harmonic coordinate system for $1
< p < \infty$ on any Riemannian manifold.
