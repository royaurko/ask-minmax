Given a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ we introduce a certain
quantity associated to a tuple of conjugacy classes in the universal cover of
the group ${\hbox{\it Ham}} (M,\omega)$ by means of the Hofer metric on
${\hbox{\it Ham}} (M,\omega)$. We use pseudo-holomorphic curves involved in the
definition of the multiplicative structure on the Floer cohomology of a
symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ to estimate this quantity in terms of actions
of some periodic orbits of related Hamiltonian flows. As a corollary we get a
new way to obtain Agnihotri-Belkale-Woodward inequalities for eigenvalues of
products of unitary matrices. As another corollary we get a new proof of the
geodesic property (with respect to the Hofer metric) of Hamiltonian flows
generated by certain autonomous Hamiltonians. Our main technical tool is K-area
defined for Hamiltonian fibrations over a surface with boundary in the spirit
of L.Polterovich's work on Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$.
