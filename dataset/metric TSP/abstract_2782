We characterize the Dirac structures that are parallel with respect to
Gualtieri's canonical connection of a generalized Riemannian metric. On the
other hand, we discuss Dirac structures that are images of generalized tangent
structures. These structures turn out to be Dirac structures that, if seen as
Lie algebroids, have a symplectic structure. Particularly, if compatibility
with a generalized Riemannian metric is required, the symplectic structure is
of the Kaehler type.
