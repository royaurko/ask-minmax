Addressing a question of Gromov, we give a rate in Pansu's theorem about the
convergence in Gromov-Hausdorff metric of a finitely generated nilpotent group
equipped with a left-invariant word metric scaled by a factor 1/n towards its
asymptotic cone. We show that due to the possible presence of abnormal
geodesics in the asymptotic cone, this rate cannot be better than n^{1/2} for
general non-abelian nilpotent groups. As a corollary we also get an error term
of the form vol(B(n))=cn^d + O(n^{d-2/(3r)}) for the volume of Cayley balls of
a nilpotent group with nilpotency class r. We also state a number of related
conjectural statements.
