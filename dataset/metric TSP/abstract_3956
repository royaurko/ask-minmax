In Plebanski's self-dual formulation general relativity becomes SO(3) BF
theory supplemented with the so-called simplicity (or metricity) constraints
for the B-field. The main dynamical equation of the theory states that the
curvature of the B-compatible SO(3) connection is self-dual, with the notion of
self-duality being defined by the B-field. We describe a theory obtained by
dropping the metricity constraints, keeping only the requirement that the
curvature of the B-compatible connection is self-dual. It turns out that the
theory one obtains is to a very large degree fixed by the Bianchi identities.
Moreover, it is still a gravity theory, with just two propagating degrees of
freedom as in GR.
