We introduce a notion of "gradient at a given scale" of functions defined on
a metric measure space. We then use it to define Sobolev inequalities at large
scale and we prove their invariance under large-scale equivalence (maps that
generalize the quasi-isometries). We prove that for a Riemmanian manifold
satisfying a local Poincare inequality, our notion of Sobolev inequalities at
large scale is equivalent to its classical version. These notions provide a
natural and efficient point of view to study the relations between the large
time on-diagonal behavior of random walks and the isoperimetry of the space.
Specializing our main result to locally compact groups, we obtain that the
L^p-isoperimetric profile, for every p \in [1,\infty] is invariant under
quasi-isometry between amenable unimodular compactly generated locally compact
groups. A qualitative application of this new approach is a very general
characterization of the existence of a spectral gap on a quasi-transitive
measure space X, providing a natural point of view to understand this
phenomenon.
