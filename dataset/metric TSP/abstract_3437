On a Riemannian or a semi-Riemannian manifold, the metric determines
invariants like the Levi-Civita connection and the Riemann curvature. If the
metric becomes degenerate (as in singular semi-Riemannian geometry), these
constructions no longer work, because they are based on the inverse of the
metric, and on related operations like the contraction between covariant
indices. In this article we develop the geometry of singular semi-Riemannian
manifolds. First, we introduce an invariant and canonical contraction between
covariant indices, applicable even for degenerate metrics. This contraction
applies to a special type of tensor fields, which are radical-annihilator in
the contracted indices. Then, we use this contraction and the Koszul form to
define the covariant derivative for radical-annihilator indices of covariant
tensor fields, on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds named
radical-stationary. We use this covariant derivative to construct the Riemann
curvature, and show that on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds,
named semi-regular, the Riemann curvature is smooth. We apply these results to
construct a version of Einstein's tensor whose density of weight 2 remains
smooth even in the presence of semi-regular singularities. We can thus write a
densitized version of Einstein's equation, which is smooth, and which is
equivalent to the standard Einstein equation if the metric is non-degenerate.
