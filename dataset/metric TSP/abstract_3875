We generalize Llarull's scalar curvature comparison to Riemannian manifolds
admitting metric connections with parallel and alternating torsion and having a
nonnegative curvature operator on 2-vectors. As a byproduct, we show that Euler
number and signature of such manifolds are determined by their global holonomy
representation. Our result holds in particular for all quotients of compact Lie
groups of equal rank, equipped with a normal homogeneous metric.
  We also correct a mistake in the treatment of odd-dimensional spaces in
arXiv:math/0010199 and arXiv:0705.0500
