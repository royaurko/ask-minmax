We construct an example of a real plane analytic singular metric,
degenerating only at the origin, such that any gradient trajectory
(respectively to this singular metric) of some well chosen function spirals
around the origin. The inversion mapping carries this example into an example
of a gradient spiraling dynamics at infinity.
