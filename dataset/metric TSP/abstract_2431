In compositional data, an observation is a vector with non-negative
components which sum to a constant, typically 1. Data of this type arise in
many areas, such as geology, archaeology, biology, economics and political
science among others. The goal of this paper is to extend the taxicab metric
and a newly suggested metric for compositional data by employing a power
transformation. Both metrics are to be used in the k-nearest neighbours
algorithm regardless of the presence of zeros. Examples with real data are
exhibited.
