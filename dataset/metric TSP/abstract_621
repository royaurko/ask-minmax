A metric representing a slowly rotating object with quadrupole moment is
obtained using a perturbation method to include rotation into the weak limit of
the Erez-Rosen metric. This metric is intended to tackle relativistic
astrometry and gravitational lensing problems in which a quadrupole moment has
to be taken into account.
