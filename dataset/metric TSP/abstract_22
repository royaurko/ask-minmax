We prove explicit approximation hardness results for the Graphic TSP on cubic
and subcubic graphs as well as the new inapproximability bounds for the
corresponding instances of the (1,2)-TSP. The proof technique uses new modular
constructions of simulating gadgets for the restricted cubic and subcubic
instances. The modular constructions used in the paper could be also of
independent interest.
