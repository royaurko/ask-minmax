Given a complete edge-weighted graph G, we present a polynomial time
algorithm to compute a degree-four-bounded spanning Eulerian subgraph of 2G
that has at most 1.5 times the weight of an optimal TSP solution of G. Based on
this algorithm and a novel use of orientations in graphs, we obtain a (3 beta/4
+ 3 beta^2/4)-approximation algorithm for TSP with beta-relaxed triangle
inequality (beta-TSP), where beta >= 1. A graph G is an instance of beta-TSP,
if it is a complete graph with non-negative edge weights that are restricted as
follows. For each triple of vertices u,v,w in V(G), c({u,v}) <= beta (c({u,w})
+ c({w,v})).
