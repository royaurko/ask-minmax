We study the linear metric perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m
solution for the case of axial perturbation modes. We find that the well-known
perturbative analysis fails for the case of dipole $(l=1)$ perturbations,
although valid for higher multipoles. We define new radial functions, with
which the perturbation formalism is generalized to all multipole orders,
including the dipole. We then complete the solution by constructing the
perturbed metric and Maxwell tensors.
