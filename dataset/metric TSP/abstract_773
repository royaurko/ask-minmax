The notion of a (metric) modular on an arbitrary set and the corresponding
modular space, more general than a metric space, were introduced and studied
recently by the contributor [V. V. Chistyakov, Metric modulars and their
application, Dokl. Math. 73(1) (2006) 32-35, and Modular metric spaces, I:
Basic concepts, Nonlinear Anal. 72(1) (2010) 1-14]. In this paper we establish
a fixed point theorem for contractive maps in modular spaces. It is related to
contracting rather ``generalized average velocities'' than metric distances,
and the successive approximations of fixed points converge to the fixed points
in a weaker sense as compared to the metric convergence.
