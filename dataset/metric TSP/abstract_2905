Considering the emission of gravitational waves within the framework of Loop
Quantum Gravity, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of a scalar field in a
spherically symmetric black hole, described in the semiclassical limit by an
effective metric called self-dual metric. We compute the frequencies using a
sixth order WKB method and compare them with numerical solutions of the
Regge-Wheeler equation.
