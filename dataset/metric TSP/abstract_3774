We study eta-Einstein geometry as a class of distinguished Riemannian metrics
on contact metric manifolds. In particular, we use a previous solution of the
Calabi problem for Sasakian geometry to prove the existence of eta-Einstein
structures on many different compact manifolds, including exotic spheres. We
also relate these results to the existence of Einstein-Weyl structures.
