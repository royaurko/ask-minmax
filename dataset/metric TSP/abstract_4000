Nurowski [arXiv:1003.1503] has recently suggested a link between the
observation of Dark Energy in cosmology and the projective equivalence of
certain Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metrics. Specifically, he
points out that two FLRW metrics with the same unparameterized geodesics have
their energy densities differing by a constant. From this he queries whether
the existence of dark energy is meaningful. We point out that physical
observables in cosmology are not projectively invariant and we relate the
projective symmetry uncovered by Nurowski to some previous work on projective
equivalence in cosmology.
