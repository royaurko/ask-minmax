In the present work we shall show that nonlinear contractive conditions on
TVS-cone metric spaces can be reduced to nonlinear contractive conditions on
usual metric spaces. Our results extend the results of Du (2010) [W.S. Du, A
note on cone metric fixed point theory and its equivalence, Nonlinear Anal. 72
(2010), 2259-2261] and results of Abdeljawad and Rezapour [T. Abdeljawad, Sh.
Rezapour, Some fixed point results in TVS-cone metric spaces, Fixed Point
Theory (to appear 2012)].
