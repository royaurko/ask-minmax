In this paper, we construct a new class of Finsler manifolds called
generalized isotropic Berwald manifolds which is an extension of the class of
isotropic Berwald manifolds. We prove that every generalized isotropic Berwald
manifold is a generalized Douglas-Weyl manifold. On a compact generalized
isotropic Berwald manifold, we show that the notions of stretch and Landsberg
curvatures are equivalent. Then we prove that on these manifolds, a Finsler
metric is R-quadratic if and only if it is a stretch metric with vanishing E
-curvature. Finally, we determine the flag curvature of generalized isotropic
Berwald manifold with scalar flag curvature.
