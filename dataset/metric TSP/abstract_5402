We study a modification of the Plebanski action, which generically
corresponds to a bi-metric theory of gravity, and identify a subclass which is
equivalent to the Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt class of scalar-tensor theories.
In this manner, scalar-tensor theories are displayed as constrained BF
theories. We find that in this subclass, there is no need to impose reality of
the Urbantke metrics, as also the theory with real bivectors is a scalar-tensor
theory with a real Lorentzian metric. Furthermore, while under the former
reality conditions instabilities can arise from a wrong sign of the scalar mode
kinetic term, we show that such problems do not appear if the bivectors are
required to be real. Finally, we discuss how matter can be coupled to these
theories. The phenomenology of scalar field dark matter arises naturally within
this framework.
