We consider the motion of light on different spacetime manifolds by
calculating the deflection angle, lensing properties and by probing into the
possibility of bound states. The metrics in which we examine the light motion
include, among other, a general relativistic Dark Matter metric, a dirty Black
Hole and a Worm Hole metric, the last two inspired by non-commutative geometry.
The lensing in a Holographic Screen metric is discussed in detail. We study
also the bending of light around naked singularities like, e.g., the
Janis-Newman-Winicour metric and include other cases. A generic property of
light behaviour in these exotic metrics is pointed out. For the standard metric
like the Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter cases we improve the
accuracy of the lensing results for the weak and strong regime.
