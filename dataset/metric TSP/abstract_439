We construct a metrical framed structure on the tensor bundle of a Riemannian
manifold equipped with a Cheeger-Gromoll type metric and by restricting this
structure to the tensor sphere bundle, we obtain an almost metrical paracontact
structure on the tensor sphere bundle. Moreover, we show that the tensor sphere
bundles endowed with the induced metric are never space forms.
