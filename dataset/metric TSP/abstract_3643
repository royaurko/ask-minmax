We use the canonical quantization of spherically symetric dust universes, and
calculate the expectation value of the quantized metric, $<\Psi|\hat{g}|\Psi>$.
Though the classical solutions are singular, and the wave functions have no
zero support on singular geometries, the expectation values are everywhere
regular. For a quasi-classical (coherent) state, the metric expectation value
describes a universe (or star) that collapses to a minimum radius, the Planck
radius, and re-expands again.
