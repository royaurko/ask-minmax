Were investigated anisotropic metric of higher dimensional space-time with
only cosmological term and scalar field. Showed, that presence of scalar field
is equivalent to anisotropic metric in the multy dimensional space-time and
proposed idea of dimensions generation by scalar field. Were solved Einstein's
equations for higher dimensional space-time of Kazner's type and derived
expressions for density of energy for scalar field, which generate additional
dimensions, and proposed the procedure of renormalization of the metric.
