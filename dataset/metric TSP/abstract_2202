We study the existence and properties of metrics maximising the first Laplace
eigenvalue among conformal metrics of unit volume on Riemannian surfaces. We
describe a general approach to this problem and its higher eigenvalue versions
via the direct method of calculus of variations. The principal results include
the general regularity properties of $\lambda_k$-extremal metrics and the
existence of a partially regular $\lambda_1$-maximiser.
