In this study a rotationally and translationally invariant metric in Finsler
space is investigated. We choose to rewrite the metric in Riemanian space by
increasing the dimension of space-time and introducing additional coordinates
such that for specific values of these coordinates, the geodesics of the four
dimensional Finslerian space-time and six dimensional Riemanian space-time are
identical. Cosmological solutions described by this metric give rise to an
equation of state corresponding to a space dominated by domain walls and an
internal space dominated by strings.
