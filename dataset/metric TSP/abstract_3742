It is proved that the family of Ahlfors extremal mappings of a multiply
connected region in the plane onto the unit disc can be expressed as a rational
combination of two fixed Ahlfors mappings in much the same way that the family
of Riemann mappings associated to a simply connected region can be expressed in
terms of a single such map. The formulas reveal that this family of mappings
extends to the double as a real analytic function of both variables. In
particular, the infinitesimal Caratheodory metric will be expressed in
strikingly simple terms. Similar results are proved for the Green's function,
the Poisson kernel, and the Bergman kernel.
