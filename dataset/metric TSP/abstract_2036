We introduce the notion of asymptotic cohomology based on the bounded
cohomology and define cohomological asymptotic dimension $\as_{\Z} X$ of metric
spaces. We show that it agrees with the asymptotic dimension $\as X$ when the
later is finite. Then we use this fact to construct an example of a metric
space $X$ of bounded geometry with finite asymptotic dimension for which
$\as(X\times\R)=\as X$. In particular, it follows for this example that the
coarse asymptotic dimension defined by means of Roe's coarse cohomology is
strictly less than its asymptotic dimension.
