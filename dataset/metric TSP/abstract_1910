We start from the pure Einstein-Hilbert action in Metric Affine Gravity, with
the orthonormal metric. We get an effective Levi-Civita Dilaton gravity theory
in which the Dilaton field is related to the scaling of the gravitational
coupling. When the Weyl symmetry is broken the resulting Einstein-Hilbert term
is equivalent to the Levi-Civita one, using the projective invariance of the
model, the non-metricity and torsion may be removed, so that we get a theory
perfectly equivalent to general relativity. This may explain why low energy
gravity is described by a Riemannian connection.
