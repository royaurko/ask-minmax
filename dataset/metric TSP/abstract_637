For every closed subset $X$ of a stratifiable [resp. metrizable] space $Y$ we
construct a positive linear extension operator $T:R^{X\times X}\to R^{Y\times
Y}$ preserving constant functions, bounded functions, continuous functions,
pseudometrics, metrics, [resp. dominating metrics, and admissible metrics].
This operator is continuous with respect to each of the three topologies:
point-wise convergence, uniform, and compact-open.
  An equivariant analog of the above statement is proved as well.
