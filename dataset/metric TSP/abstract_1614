We show that the non flat factor of the Godel metric belongs to a one
parameter family of 2+1 dimensional geometries that also includes the anti-de
Sitter metric. The elements of this family allow a generalization a la
Kaluza-Klein of the usual 3+1 dimensional Godel metric. Their lightcones can be
viewed as deformations of the anti-de Sitter ones, involving tilting and
squashing. This provides a simple geometric picture of the causal structure of
these space-times, anti-de Sitter geometry appearing as the boundary between
causally safe and causally pathological spaces. Furthermore, we construct a
global algebraic isometric embedding of these metrics in 4+3 or 3+4 dimensional
flat spaces, thereby illustrating in another way the occurrence of the closed
timelike curves.
