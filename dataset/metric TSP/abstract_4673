We study a particular class of open manifolds. In the category of Riemannian
manifolds these are complete manifolds with cylindrical ends. We give a natural
setting for the conformal geometry on such manifolds including an appropriate
notion of the cylindrical Yamabe constant/invariant. This leads to a
corresponding version of the Yamabe problem on cylindrical manifolds. We
affirmatively solve this Yamabe problem: we prove the existence of minimizing
metrics and analyze their singularities near infinity. These singularities turn
out to be of very particular type: either almost conical or almost cusp
singularities. We describe the supremum case, i.e. when the cylindrical Yamabe
constant is equal to the Yamabe invariant of the sphere. We prove that in this
case such a cylindrical manifold coincides conformally with the standard sphere
punctured at a finite number of points. In the course of studying the supremum
case, we establish a Positive Mass Theorem for specific asymptotically flat
manifolds with two almost conical singularities. As a by-product, we revisit
known results on surgery and the Yamabe invariant. Key words: manifolds with
cylindrical ends, Yamabe constant/invariant, Yamabe problem, conical metric
singularities, cusp metric singularities, Positive Mass Theorem, surgery and
Yamabe invariant.
