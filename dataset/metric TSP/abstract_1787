We give a short and simple polynomial estimate of the norm of weighted dyadic
shift on metric space with geometric doubling, which is linear in the norm of
the weight. Combined with the existence of special probability space of dyadic
lattices built in A. Reznikov, A. Volberg, "Random "dyadic" lattice in
geometrically doubling metric space and $A_2$ conjecture", arXiv:1103.5246, and
with decomposition of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators to dyadic shifts from
Hyt\"onen's "The sharp weighted bound for general Calder\'on-Zygmund
operators", arXiv:1007.4330 (and later T. Hyt\"onen, C. P\'erez, S. Treil, A.
Volberg, "A sharp estimated of weighted dyadic shifts that gives the proof of
$A_2$ conjecture", arXiv 1010.0755), we will be able to have a linear (in the
norm of weight) estimate of an arbitrary Calder\'on-Zygmund operator on a
metric space with geometric doubling. This will be published separately.
