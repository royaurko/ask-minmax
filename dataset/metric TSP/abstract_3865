In this paper, we consider Poincar\'e inequalities for non euclidean metrics
on $\mathbb{R}^d$. These inequalities enable us to derive precise dimension
free concentration inequalities for product measures. This technique is
appropriate for a large scope of concentration rate: between exponential and
gaussian and beyond. We give different equivalent functional forms of these
Poincar\'e type inequalities in terms of transportation-cost inequalities and
infimum convolution inequalities. Workable sufficient conditions are given and
a comparison is made with generalized Beckner-Latala-Oleszkiewicz inequalities.
