Families of linear connections are constructed on almost contact manifolds
with Norden metric. An analogous connection to the symmetric Yano connection is
obtained on a normal almost contact manifold with Norden metric and closed
structural 1-form. The curvature properties of this connection are studied on
two basic classes of normal almost contact manifolds with Norden metric.
