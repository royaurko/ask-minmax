In the s = 1/2 antiferromagnetic spin chain material TiPO4 the formation of a
spin gap takes place in a two step process with two characteristic
temperatures, T*=111 K and TSP=74 K. We observe an unusual lattice dynamics
over a large temperature regime as well as evidence for an orbital instability
preceding the spin-Peierls transition. We relate different intrachain exchange
interactions of the high temperature compared to the spin-Peierls phase to a
modification of the orbital ordering pattern. In particular, our observation of
a high energy excitation of mixed electronic and lattice origin suggests an
exotic dimerization process different from other spin-Peierls materials.
