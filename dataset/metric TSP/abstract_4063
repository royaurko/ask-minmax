In the paper we pursue the analysis from the section 5 of the Talagrand's
paper "Sample boundedness of stochastic processes under increment conditions."
Ann. Probab. 18, No. 1, 1-49. In particular we give the proof of some Sobolev
Inequality and then apply it to obtain if and only if condition for all
processes with bounded icrements to have bounded samples. The processes are
defined on a compact, concave subspaces of $\R^n$ with a metric
$d(s,t)=\eta(||s-t||)$, where $\eta$ is concave and $||.||$ is a norm on
$\R^n$.
