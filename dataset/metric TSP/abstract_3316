We study the ghost-free bimetric theory of Hassan and Rosen, with parameters
$\beta_i$ such that a flat Minkowski solution exists for both metrics. We show
that, expanding around this solution and eliminating one of the two metrics
with its own equation of motion, the remaining metric is governed by the
Einstein-Hilbert action plus a non-local term proportional to
$W_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} (\Box-m^2)^{-1}W^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, where
$W_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ is the Weyl tensor. The result is valid to quadratic
order in the metric perturbation and to all orders in the derivative expansion.
This example shows, in a simple setting, how such non-local extensions of GR
can emerge from an underlying consistent theory, at the purely classical level.
