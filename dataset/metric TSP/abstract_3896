We consider a large black hole in asymptotically AdS spacetime of arbitrary
dimension with a Minkowski boundary. By performing an appropriate slicing as we
approach the boundary, we obtain via holographic renormalization a gauge theory
fluid obeying Bjorken hydrodynamics in the limit of large longitudinal proper
time. The metric we obtain reproduces to leading order the metric recently
found as a direct solution of the Einstein equations in five dimensions. Our
results are also in agreement with recent exact results in three dimensions.
