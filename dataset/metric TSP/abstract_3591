We show that static metrics solving vacuum Einstein equations (possibly with
a cosmological constant) are one-sided analytic at non-degenerate Killing
horizons. We further prove analyticity in a two-sided neighborhood of
"bifurcate horizons".
  It is a pleasure to dedicate this work to Prof. Staruszkiewicz, on the
occasion of his 65th birthday.
