We study the solutions of the Dirac equation in the background of the Nutku
helicoid metric. This metric has curvature singularities, which necessitates
imposing a boundary to exclude this point. We use the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer non
local spectral boundary conditions for both the four and the five dimensional
manifolds.
