The main objective of the present work is to study contraction semigroups
generated by Laplace operators on metric graphs, which are not necessarily
self-adjoint. We prove criteria for such semigroups to be continuity and
positivity preserving. Also we provide a characterization of generators of
Feller semigroups on metric graphs.
