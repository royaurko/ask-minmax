We investigate T-duality of a closed string moving in a weakly curved
background of the second order. A previously discussed weakly curved background
consisted of a flat metric and a linearly coordinate dependent Kalb-Ramond
field with an infinitesimal strength. The background here considered differs
from the above in a coordinate dependent metric of a second order.
Consequently, the corresponding Ricci tensor is nonzero. As this background
does not posses the global shift symmetry the generalized Buscher T-dualization
procedure is not applicable to it. We redefine it and make it applicable to
backgrounds without the global symmetry.
