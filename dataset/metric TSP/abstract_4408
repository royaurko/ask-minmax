We study the explicit embeddings of static black holes. We obtain two new
minimal embeddings of the Schwarzchild-de Sitter metric which smoothly cover
both horizons of this metric. The lines of time for these embeddings are more
complicated than hyperbolas. Also we shortly discuss the possibility of using
non-hyperbolic embeddings for calculation of the black hole Hawking temperature
in the Deser and Levin approach.
