The linearized Kerr metric is considered and put in some Gauss coordinates
which are further {\em intrinsic} ones. The linear and angular 4-momenta of
this metric are calculated in these coordinates and the resulting value is just
zero. Thus, the global vanishing previously found for the Schwarzschild metric
remains linearly stable under slow rotational perturbations of this metric.
