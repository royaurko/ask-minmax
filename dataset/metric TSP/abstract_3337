A regular F-manifold is an F-manifold (with Euler field) (M, \circ, e, E),
such that the endomorphism {\mathcal U}(X) := E \circ X of TM is regular at any
p\in M. We prove that the germ ((M,p), \circ, e, E) is uniquely determined (up
to isomorphism) by the conjugacy class of {\mathcal U}_{p} : T_{p}M \rightarrow
T_{p}M. We obtain that any regular F-manifold admits a preferred system of
local coordinates and we find conditions, in these coordinates, for a metric to
be Frobenius. We study the Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries of regular
F-manifolds. We show that any regular F-manifold is locally isomorphic to the
parameter space of a Malgrange universal connection. We prove an initial
condition theorem for Frobenius metrics on regular F-manifolds.
