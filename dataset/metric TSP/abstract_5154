We give the correct interpretation of the new metric, found lately by the
contributor. This metric results as an exact solution of the Einstein field
equations, without the cosmological constant. The new feature is the
introduction, from the beginning, of two rotations attributed to the Universe.
As a result also an expanding, and indeed in accelerating rate, Universe is
obtained. Thus dark energy is not necessary at all. We explore some properties
of this Universe in the present paper. In particular, all old properties of the
Universe concerning the Hubble law remain in a modified way, implying
anisotropy. Besides, we explore the validity of the Ryle-Clarke effect, which
is verified, and we find the correct age of the Universe. Finally, the
resulting shape of the Universe is examined, and it is found to be
hypertoroidal.
