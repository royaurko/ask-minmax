In this paper we prove rigidity results on critical metrics for quadratic
curvature functionals, involving the Ricci and the scalar curvature, on the
space of Riemannian metrics with unit volume. It is well-known that Einstein
metrics are always critical points. The purpose of this article is to show
that, under some curvature conditions, a partial converse is true. In
particular, for a class of quadratic curvature functionals, we prove that every
critical metric with non-negative sectional curvature must be Einstein.
