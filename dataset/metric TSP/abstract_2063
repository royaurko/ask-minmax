We discuss the correspondence between the DGP brane cosmology and 5D
Ricci-flat cosmology by letting their metrics equal each other. By this
correspondence, a specific geometrical property of the arbitrary integral
constant I in DGP metric is given and it is related to the curvature of 5D
bulk. At the same time, the relation of arbitrary functions $\mu$ and $\nu$ in
a class of Ricci-flat solutions is obtained from DGP brane metric.
