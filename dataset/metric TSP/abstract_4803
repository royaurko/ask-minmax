The structure of a social network contains information useful for predicting
its evolution. Nodes that are "close" in some sense are more likely to become
linked in the future than more distant nodes. We show that structural
information can also help predict node activity. We use proximity to capture
the degree to which two nodes are "close" to each other in the network. In
addition to standard proximity metrics used in the link prediction task, such
as neighborhood overlap, we introduce new metrics that model different types of
interactions that can occur between network nodes. We argue that the "closer"
nodes are in a social network, the more similar will be their activity. We
study this claim using data about URL recommendation on social media sites Digg
and Twitter. We show that structural proximity of two users in the follower
graph is related to similarity of their activity, i.e., how many URLs they both
recommend. We also show that given friends' activity, knowing their proximity
to the user can help better predict which URLs the user will recommend. We
compare the performance of different proximity metrics on the activity
prediction task and find that some metrics lead to substantial performance
improvements.
