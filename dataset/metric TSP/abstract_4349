We define $(\alpha_n)$ -regular sets in uniformly perfect metric spaces. This
definition is quasisymmetrically invariant and the construction resembles
generalized dyadic cubes in metric spaces. For these sets we then determine the
necessary and sufficient conditions to be fat (or thin). In addition we discuss
restrictions of doubling measures to these sets, and in particular give a
sufficient condition to retain at least some of the restricted measures
doubling on the set. Our main result generalizes and extends analogous results
that were previously known to hold in the real-line.
