We show that superreflexivity can be characterized in terms of bilipschitz
embeddability of word hyperbolic groups. We compare characterizations of
superreflexivity in terms of diamond graphs and binary trees. We show that
there exist sequences of series-parallel graphs of increasing topological
complexity which admit uniformly bilipschitz embeddings into a Hilbert space,
and thus do not characterize superreflexivity.
