In this paper, we study some modified linear restriction estimates of the
dynamics generated by Schroedinger operator on metric cone $M$, where the
metric cone $M$ is of the form $M=(0,\infty)_r\times\Sigma$ with the cross
section $\Sigma$ being a compact $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold
$(\Sigma,h)$ and the equipped metric is $g=\mathrm{d}r^2+r^2h$. Assuming the
initial data possesses additional regularity in angular variable
$\theta\in\Sigma$, we show some linear restriction estimates for the solutions.
As applications, we obtain global-in-time Strichartz estimates for radial
initial data and show small initial data scattering theory for the
mass-critical nonlinear Schroedinger equation on two-dimensional metric cones.
