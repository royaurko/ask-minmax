Let M be an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold and TM its tangent bundle. The
conformal and fiber preserving vector fields on TM have well-known physical
interpretations and have been studied by physicists and geometricians. Here we
define a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian lift metric on TM, which is in some
senses more general than other lift metrics previously defined on TM, and seems
to complete these works. Next we study the lift conformal vector fields on its
tangent bundle with this metric and prove among the others that, every complete
lift conformal vector field on TM is homothetic, and moreover, every horizontal
or vertical lift conformal vector field on TM is a Killing vector.
