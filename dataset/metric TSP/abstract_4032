We establish new results concerning projectors on max-plus spaces, as well as
separating half-spaces, and derive an explicit formula for the distance in
Hilbert's projective metric between a point and a half-space over the max-plus
semiring, as well as explicit descriptions of the set of minimizers. As a
consequence, we obtain a cyclic projection type algorithm to solve systems of
max-plus linear inequalities.
