In this paper, we find the energy-momentum distribution of stationary
axisymmetric spacetimes in the context of teleparallel theory by using
M$\ddot{o}$ller prescription. The metric under consideration is the
generalization of the Weyl metrics called the Lewis-Papapetrou metric. The
class of stationary axisymmetric solutions of the Einstein field equations has
been studied by Galtsov to include the gravitational effect of an {\it
external} source. Such spacetimes are also astrophysically important as they
describe the exterior of a body in equilibrium. The energy density turns out to
be non-vanishing and well-defined and the momentum becomes constant except
along $\theta$-direction. It is interesting to mention that the results reduce
to the already available results for the Weyl metrics when we take $\omega=0$.
