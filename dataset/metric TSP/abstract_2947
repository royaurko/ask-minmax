The metric by Carmeli accurately produces the Tully-Fisher type relation in
spiral galaxies, a relation showing the fourth power of the rotation speed
proportional to the mass of the galaxy. And therefore it is claimed that it is
also no longer necessary to invoke dark matter to explain the anomalous
dynamics in the arms of spiral galaxies. An analysis is presented here showing
Carmeli?s 5 dimensional space-time-velocity metric can also indeed describe the
rotation curves of spiral galaxies based on the properties of the metric alone.
