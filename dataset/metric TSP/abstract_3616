In this paper we discuss a new method which can be used to obtain arbitrarily
accurate analytical expressions for the deflection angle of light propagating
in a given metric. Our method works by mapping the integral into a rapidly
convergent series and provides extremely accurate approximations already to
first order. We have derived a general first order formula for a generic
spherically symmetric static metric tensor and we have tested it in four
different cases.
