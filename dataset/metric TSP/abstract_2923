The physical and geometrical meaning of the four parameters of Lewis metric
for the Lewis class are investigated. Matching this spacetime to a completely
anisotropic, rigidly rotating, fluid cylinder, we obtain from the junction
conditions that the four parameters are related to the vorticity of the source.
Furthermore it is shown that one of the parameters must vanish if one wishes to
reduce the Lewis class to a locally static spacetime. Using the Cartan scalars
it is shown that the Lewis class does not include globally Minkowski as special
class, and that it is not locally equivalent to the Levi-Civita metric. Also it
is shown that, in contrast with the Weyl class, the parameter responsible for
the vorticity appears explicitly in the expression for the Cartan scalars.
Finally, to enhance our understanding of the Lewis class, we analyse the van
Stockum metric.
