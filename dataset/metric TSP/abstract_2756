Let (X,D) be a klt pair. Assuming either K_X+D big or -(K_X+D) ample, and
that the coefficients of D are greater than 1/2, we show that the
K\"ahler-Einstein metric attached to (X,D) -whenever it exists- has cone
singularities along D on the log-smooth locus of the pair intersected with the
ample locus of K_X+D (in the negatively curved case).
