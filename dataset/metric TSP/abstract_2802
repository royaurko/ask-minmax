This article investigates higher dimensional vacuum solutions of the Einstein
equations. Generalizations of the definitions of spherical and axial symmetry
to higher dimensions are discussed before analyzing specific solutions bearing
one of these symmetries. The effective motions of the Tangherlini metric are
calculated and its Kruskal continuation is derived. Also the Myers-Perry metric
is analyzed with respect to its causal and horizontal structure.
