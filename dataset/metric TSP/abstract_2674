Using the Einstein gravitation theory (EGT) we calculate the Schwarzschild
metric that is defined in the surrounding vacuum of a spherically symmetric
mass distribution, not in rotation. The field equations of the EGT with this
metric were applied to analyze the time dilation and the Doppler Effect of the
light in order to test the validity of the EGT. This article was written to
graduate and postgraduate students of Physics.
