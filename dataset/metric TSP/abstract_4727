As is well-known, Kerr-Schild metrics linearize the Einstein tensor. We shall
see here that they also simplify the Gauss-Bonnet tensor, which turns out to be
only quadratic in the arbitrary Kerr-Schild function f when the seed metric is
maximally symmetric. This property allows us to give a simple analytical
expression for its trace, when the seed metric is a five dimensional maximally
symmetric spacetime in spheroidal coordinates with arbitrary parameters a and
b. We also write in a (fairly) simple form the full Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
tensor (with a cosmological term) when the seed metric is flat and the
oblateness parameters are equal, a=b. Armed with these results we give in a
compact form the solution of the trace of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet field
equations with a cosmological term and a different than b. We then examine
whether this solution for the trace does solve the remaining field equations.
We find that it does not in general, unless the Gauss-Bonnet coupling is such
that the field equations have a unique maximally symmetric solution.
