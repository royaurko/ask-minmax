We analyze the existence or non-existence of Einstein metrics on 4-manifolds
with non-trivial fundamental group and the relation with the differential
structure considered. We conclude that for admissible pairs $(n,m)$ in a large
region of the integer lattice, the manifold $n\mathbb C \mathbb P^2#m
\bar{\mathbb C \mathbb P^2}$ admits infinitely many non-equivalent free actions
of finite cyclic groups and there are no Einstein metrics which are group
invariant. The main tools are Seiberg-Witten Theory, cyclic branched coverings
of complex surfaces and symplectic surgeries.
