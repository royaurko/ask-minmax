We consider quasifuchsian manifolds with "particles", i.e., cone
singularities of fixed angle less than $\pi$ going from one connected component
of the boundary at infinity to the other. Each connected component of the
boundary at infinity is then endowed with a conformal structure marked by the
endpoints of the particles. We prove that this defines a homeomorphism from the
space of quasifuchsian metrics with $n$ particles (of fixed angle) and the
product of two copies of the Teichm\"uller space of a surface with $n$ marked
points. This is analoguous to the Bers theorem in the non-singular case.
  Quasifuchsian manifolds with particles also have a convex core. Its boundary
has a hyperbolic induced metric, with cone singularities at the intersection
with the particles, and is pleated along a measured geodesic lamination. We
prove that any two hyperbolic metrics with cone singularities (of prescribed
angle) can be obtained, and also that any two measured bending laminations,
satisfying some obviously necessary conditions, can be obtained, as in [BO] in
the non-singular case.
