We give a general procedure for gluing together possibly noncompact manifolds
of constant scalar curvature which satisfy an extra nondegeneracy hypothesis.
Our aim is to provide a simple paradigm for making `analytic' connected sums.
In particular, we can easily construct complete metrics of constant positive
scalar curvature on the complement of certain configurations of an even number
of points on the sphere, which is a special case of Schoen's \cite{S1}
well-known, difficult construction. Applications of this construction produces
metrics with prescribed asymptotics. In particular, we produce metrics with
cylindrical ends, the simplest type of asymptotic behaviour. Solutions on the
complement of an infinite number of points are also constructed by an iteration
of our construction.
