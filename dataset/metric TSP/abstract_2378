We provide an approach to implementing the shallow atmosphere approximation
in three dimensional finite element discretisations for dynamical cores. The
approach makes use of the fact that the shallow atmosphere approximation metric
can be obtained by writing equations on a three-dimensional manifold embedded
in $\mathbb{R}^4$ with a restriction of the Euclidean metric. We show that
finite element discretisations constructed this way are equivalent to the use
of a modified three dimensional mesh for the construction of metric terms. We
demonstrate our approach via a convergence test for a prototypical elliptic
problem.
