We study the Husain-Kuchar model by introducing a new action principle
similar to the self-dual action used in the Ashtekar variables approach to
Quantum Gravity. This new action has several interesting features; among them,
the presence of a scalar time variable that allows the definition of geometric
observables without adding new degrees of freedom, the appearance of a natural
non-degenerate four-metric and the possibility of coupling ordinary matter.
