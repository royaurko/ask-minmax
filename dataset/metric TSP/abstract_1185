We study property A defined by G. Yu and the operator norm localization
property defined by X. Chen, R. Tessera, X. Wang, and G. Yu. These are coarse
geometric properties for metric spaces which have applications to operator
K-theory. It is proved that the two properties are equivalent for discrete
metric spaces with bounded geometry.
