We give a generalization of the Penrose transform on Hermitian manifolds with
metrics locally conformally equivalent to Bochner-K\"ahler metrics. We also
give an explicit formula for the inverse transform. This paper is a
generalization of "The Twistor correspondence of the Dolbeault complex over
$\C^n$" (dg-ga/9501004) and intended to supersede it.
