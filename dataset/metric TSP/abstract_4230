In a recent paper we have established the form of the metric-torsional
conformal gravitational field equations, and in the present paper we study
their vacuum configurations; we will consider a specific situation that will
enable us to look for the torsionless limit: two types of special exact
solutions are found eventually. A discussion on general remarks will follow.
