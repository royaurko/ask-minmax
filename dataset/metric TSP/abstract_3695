We study D-branes of N=2 supersymmetric sigma models. Supersymmetric
nonlinear sigma models with 2-dimensional target space have D0,D1,D2-branes,
which are realized as A-,B-type supersymmetric boundary conditions on the
worldsheet. When we embed the models in the string theory, the Kahler potential
is restricted and leads to a 2-dim black hole metric with a dilaton background.
The D-branes in this model are susy cycles and consistent with the analysis of
conjugacy classes. The generalized metrics with U(n) isometry is proposed and
dynamics on them are realized by linear sigma models. We investigate D-branes
of the linear sigma models and compare the results with those in the nonlinear
sigma models.
