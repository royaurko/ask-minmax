From Doppler tracking data and data on circular motion of astronomical
objects we obtain a metric of the Pioneer Anomaly. The metric resolves the
issue of manifest absence of anomaly acceleration in orbits of the outer
planets and extra-Pluto objects of the Solar system. However, it turns out that
the energy-momentum tensor of matter, which generates such a gravitational
field in GR, violates energy dominance conditions. At the same time the
equation of state derived from the energy-momentum tensor is that of dark
energy with $w=-1/3$. So the model proposed must be carefully studied by
"Grand-Fit" investigations.
