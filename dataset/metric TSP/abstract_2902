We extend the Faltings modular heights of abelian varieties to general
arithmetic varieties and show direct relations with the Kahler-Einstein
geometry, the Minimal Model Program, heights of Bost and Zhang, and give some
applications. Along the way, we propose arithmetic Yau-Tian-Donaldson
conjecture, an equivalence of a purely arithmetic property of variety and its
metrical property, and partially confirm it.
