The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous optimization
problems. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of metaheuristics that have been
applied to TSP. The Crossover and mutation operators are two important elements
of GA. There are many TSP solver crossover operators. In this paper, we state
implementation of some recent TSP solver crossovers at first and then we use
each of them in GA to solve some Symmetric TSP (STSP) instances and finally
compare their effects on speed and accuracy of presented GA.
