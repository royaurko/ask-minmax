As is well known, a metric on a manifold determines a unique symmetric
connection for which the metric is parallel: the Levi-Civita connection. In
this paper we investigate the inverse problem: to what extent is the metric of
a Riemannian manifold determined by its Levi-Civita connection? It is shown
that for a generic Levi-Civita connection of a metric $h$ there exists a set of
positive semi-definite tensor fields $h_{a}$ such that the parallel metrics are
the positive-definite linear combinations of the $h_{a}$. Moreover, the set of
all parallel metrics may be constructed by a soley algebraic procedure.
