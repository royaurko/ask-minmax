A scalar theory of gravity with a preferred reference frame is presented. It
is insisted on the dynamics, which involves a (non-trivial) extension of
Newton's second law, and on the new version (v2) with isotropic space metric.
We display the energy conservation equation obtained with v2. Then the
principles of the asymptotic post-Newtonian approximation are discussed in some
detail. The results of its application to the motion of a small extended body
in a weakly-gravitating system are given and discussed: the weak equivalence
principle was violated in v1, due to its anisotropic space metric (as the
standard Schwarzschild metric), but is valid with v2.
