We prove that in a continuous $\aleph_0$-stable theory every type-definable
group is definable. The two main ingredients in the proof are:
\begin{enumerate} \item Results concerning Morley ranks (i.e., Cantor-Bendixson
ranks) from \cite{BenYaacov:TopometricSpacesAndPerturbations}, allowing us to
prove the theorem in case the metric is invariant under the group action; and
\item Results concerning the existence of translation-invariant definable
metrics on type-definable groups and the extension of partial definable metrics
to total ones. \end{enumerate}
