We generalise a theorem of Engman and Abreu--Freitas on the first invariant
eigenvalue of non-negatively curved $S^{1}$-invariant metrics on
$\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ to general toric K\"ahler metrics with non-negative scalar
curvature. In particular, a simple upper bound of the first non-zero invariant
eigenvalue for such metrics on complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^{n}$ is
exhibited. We derive an analogous bound in the case when the metric is extremal
and a detailed study is made of the accuracy of the bound in the case of
Calabi's extremal metrics on $\mathbb{C}P^{2}\sharp -\mathbb{C}P^{2}$.
