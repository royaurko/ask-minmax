In the bottom-up approach of emergent gravity we attempt to find out
symplectic gauge fields emerging from Euclidean Schwarzschild metric which is a
Ricci flat manifold but non-Kahler. The Euclidean Schwarzschild solution is
studied extensively as a electromagnetism defined on the symplectic space (M,
{\omega}). A detailed geometrical engineering with the emergent metric help us
set up the Seiberg Witten map between commutative and non- commutative gauge
fields and further paves the path for the evaluation of the topological
invariants in terms of gauge theory quantities.
