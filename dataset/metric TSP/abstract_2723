In this paper, a comprehensive study of contact and Sasakian structures on
the indicatrix bundle of Finslerian warped product manifolds is reconstructed.
In addition, the Kahler structure on the tangent bundle of these manifolds is
studied for some different metrics. Throughout the paper, the contact structure
of indicatrix bundle in warped product Finsler manifolds is presented. It is
shown that indicatrix bundle cannot be a Sasakian manifold.
