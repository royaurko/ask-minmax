We prove an inequality that generalizes the Fan-Taussky-Todd discrete analog
of the Wirtinger inequality. It is equivalent to an estimate on the spectral
gap of a weighted discrete Laplacian on the circle. The proof uses a geometric
construction related to the discrete isoperimetric problem on the surface of a
cone.
  In higher dimensions, the mixed volumes theory leads to similar results,
which allows us to associate a discrete Laplace operator to every geodesic
triangulation of the sphere and, by analogy, to every triangulated spherical
cone-metric. For a cone-metric with positive singular curvatures, we conjecture
an estimate on the spectral gap similar to the Lichnerowicz-Obata theorem.
