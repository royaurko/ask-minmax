In this paper, we study the set of homogeneous geodesics of a leftinvariant
Finsler metric on Lie groups. We first give a simple criterion that
characterizes geodesic vectors. As an application, we study some geometric
properties of bi-invariant Finsler metrics on Lie groups. In particular a
necessary and sufficient condition that left-invariant Randers metrics are of
Berwald type is given. Finally a correspondence of homogeneous geodesics to
critical points of restricted Finsler metrics is given. Then results concerning
the existence homogeneous geodesics are obtained.
