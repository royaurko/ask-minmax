We introduce a simple and very fast algorithm that computes Weil-Petersson
metrics on moduli spaces of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds. Also, by using
Donaldson's quantization link between the infinite and finite dimensional G.I.T
quotients that describe moduli spaces of varieties, we define a natural
sequence of Kaehler metrics. We prove that the sequence converges to the
Weil-Petersson metric. We also develop an algorithm that numerically
approximates such metrics, and hence the Weil-Petersson metric itself. Explicit
examples are provided on a family of Calabi-Yau Quintic hypersurfaces in CP^4.
The scope of our second algorithm is much broader; the same techniques can be
used to approximate metrics on null spaces of Dirac operators coupled to
Hermite Yang-Mills connections.
