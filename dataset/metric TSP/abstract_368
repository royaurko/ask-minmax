We analyse symmetry breaking in general gauge theories paying particular
attention to the underlying geometry of the theory. In this context we find two
natural metrics upon the vacuum manifold: a Euclidean metric associated with
the scalar sector, and another generally inequivalent metric associated with
the gauge sector. Physically, the interplay between these metrics gives rise to
many of the non-perturbative features of symmetry breaking.
