We derive sufficient conditions for a family $(X^n,\rho_n,P_n)$ of metric
probability spaces to have the measure concentration property. Specifically, if
the sequence $\{P_n\}$ of probability measures satisfies a strong mixing
condition (which we call $\eta$-mixing) and the sequence of metrics
$\{\rho_n\}$ is what we call $\Psi$-dominated, we show that $(X^n,\rho_n,P_n)$
is a normal Levy family. We establish these properties for some metric
probability spaces, including the possibly novel $X=[0,1]$, $\rho_n=\ell_1$
case.
