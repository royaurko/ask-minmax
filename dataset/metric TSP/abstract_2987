In this paper, which is an elaboration of our results in hep-th/0504225, we
construct new Einstein-Sasaki spaces L^{p,q,r_1,...,r_{n-1}} in all odd
dimensions D=2n+1\ge 5. They arise by taking certain BPS limits of the
Euclideanised Kerr-de Sitter metrics. This yields local Einstein-Sasaki metrics
of cohomogeneity n, with toric U(1)^{n+1} principal orbits, and n real
non-trivial parameters. By studying the structure of the degenerate orbits we
show that for appropriate choices of the parameters, characterised by the (n+1)
coprime integers (p,q,r_1,...,r_{n-1}), the local metrics extend smoothly onto
complete and non-singular compact Einstein-Sasaki manifolds
L^{p,q,r_1,...,r_{n-1}}. We also construct new complete and non-singular
compact Einstein spaces \Lambda^{p,q,r_1,...,r_n} in D=2n+1 that are not
Sasakian, by choosing parameters appropriately in the Euclideanised Kerr-de
Sitter metrics when no BPS limit is taken.
