We report a numerical evolution of axisymmetric Brill waves. The numerical
algorithm has new features, including (i) a method for keeping the metric
regular on the axis and (ii) the use of coordinates that bring spatial infinity
to the edge of the computational grid. The dependence of the evolved metric on
both the amplitude and shape of the initial data is found.
