In this article, we study the superradiance of charged scalar fields on the
sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom metric, a mechanism by which such fields can
extract energy from a static spherically symmetric charged black hole. A
geometrical way of measuring the amount of energy extracted is proposed. Then
we investigate the question numerically. The toy-model and the numerical
methods used in our simulations are presented and the problem of long time
measurement of the outgoing energy flux is discussed. We provide a numerical
example of a field exhibiting a behaviour analogous to the Penrose process: an
incoming wave packet which splits, as it approaches the black hole, into an
incoming part with negative energy and an outgoing part with more energy than
the initial incoming one. We also show another type of superradiant solution
for which the energy extraction is more important. Hyperradiant behaviour is
not observed, which is an indication that the Reissner-Nordstrom metric is
linearly stable in the sub-extremal case.
