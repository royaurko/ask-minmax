Via a straightforward integration of the Einstein equations with cosmological
constant, all static circularly symmetric perfect fluid 2+1 solutions are
derived. The structural functions of the metric depend on the energy density,
which remains in general arbitrary. Spacetimes for fluids fulfilling linear and
polytropic state equations are explicitly derived; they describe, among others,
stiff matter, monatomic and diatomic ideal gases, nonrelativistic degenerate
fermions, incoherent and pure radiation. As a by--product, we demonstrate the
uniqueness of the constant energy density perfect fluid within the studied
class of metrics. A full similarity of the perfect fluid solutions with
constant energy density of the 2+1 and 3+1 gravities is established.
