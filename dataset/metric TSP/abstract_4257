We overview the properties of non-infinitesimal deformations of G2-structures
on seven-manifolds, and in particular, focus on deformations that lie in the
seven-dimensional representation of G2 and are thus defined by a vector. We
then consider deformations from G2-structures with the torsion class having
one-dimensional and seven-dimensional components (so-called conformally nearly
parallel G2-manifolds) to G2-structures with just a one-dimensional torsion
component (nearly parallel G2-manifolds). We find that deformations between
such structures exist if and only if the metric is a particular warped product
metric.
