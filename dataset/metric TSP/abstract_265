The sigma model approach to the closed bosonic string on the affine-metric
manifold is considered. The two-loop metric counterterms for the nonlinear
two-dimensional sigma model with affine-metric target manifold are calculated.
The correlation of the metric and affine connection is considered as the result
of the ultraviolet finiteness (or beta-function vanishing) condition for the
nonlinear sigma model. The examples of the nonflat nonRiemannian manifolds
resulting in the trivial metric beta-function are suggested.
