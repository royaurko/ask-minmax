The motion of a particle is studied in a random space-time. It is assumed
that the velocity is small enough for the non-relativistic approximation to be
valid. The randomness of the metric induces a diffusion in coordinate space.
Hence it is shown that the evolution of the probability density is given by
Schroedinger equation.
