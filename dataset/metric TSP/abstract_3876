As seen in the works of Calabi, Cheng-Yau and Loftin, affine sphere equations
have a close relationship with Kaehler-Einstein metrics. The main purpose of
this note is to show that an equation analogous to those of hyperbolic affine
spheres arises naturally from Kaehler-Einstein metrics on Einstein toric
surfaces. The case for the remaining toric surfaces with Kaehler-Ricci solitons
will also be discussed.
