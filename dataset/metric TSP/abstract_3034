Given a function $f\colon X\to Y$ of metric spaces, its {\it asymptotic
dimension} $\asdim(f)$ is the supremum of $\asdim(A)$ such that $A\subset X$
and $\asdim(f(A))=0$. Our main result is \begin{Thm} \label{ThmAInAbstract}
$\asdim(X)\leq \asdim(f)+\asdim(Y)$ for any large scale uniform function
$f\colon X\to Y$. \end{Thm}
  \ref{ThmAInAbstract} generalizes a result of Bell and Dranishnikov in which
$f$ is Lipschitz and $X$ is geodesic. We provide analogs of
\ref{ThmAInAbstract} for Assouad-Nagata dimension $\dim_{AN}$ and asymptotic
Assouad-Nagata dimension $\ANasdim$. In case of linearly controlled asymptotic
dimension $\Lasdim$ we provide counterexamples to three questions in a list of
problems of Dranishnikov.
  As an application of analogs of \ref{ThmAInAbstract} we prove \begin{Thm}
\label{ThmBInAbstract} If $1\to K\to G\to H\to 1$ is an exact sequence of
groups and $G$ is finitely generated, then $$\ANasdim (G,d_G)\leq \ANasdim
(K,d_G|K)+\ANasdim (H,d_H)$$ for any word metrics metrics $d_G$ on $G$ and
$d_H$ on $H$. \end{Thm}
  \ref{ThmBInAbstract} extends a result of Bell and Dranishnikov for asymptotic
dimension.
