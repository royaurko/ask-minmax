In this paper we study the problem of prescribing a fourth order conformal
invariant (the Paneitz curvature) on the $n$-sphere, with $n\geq 5$. Using
tools from the theory of critical points at infinity, we provide some
topological conditions on the level sets of a given positive function under
which we prove the existene of a metric, conformally equivalent to the standard
metric, with prescribed Paneitz curvature.
