We study the triangle inequalities for angles (with different definitions)
and present inequalities concerning the entries of correlation matrices through
the positivity of $3\times 3$ matrices. We extend our discussions to the
inequalities concerning the triangle triplets with metric-preserving and
subadditive functions.
