We present a new approach for matching regular surfaces in a Riemannian
setting. We use a Sobolev type metric on deformation vector fields which form
the tangent bundle to the space of surfaces. In this article we compare our
approach with the diffeomorphic matching framework. In the latter approach a
deformation is prescribed on the ambient space, which then drags along an
embedded surface. In contrast our metric is defined directly on the deformation
vector field and can therefore be called an inner metric. We also show how to
discretize the corresponding geodesic equation and compute the gradient of the
cost functional using finite elements.
