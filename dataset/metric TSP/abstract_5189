We formulate and discuss two conjectures concerning recursive formulae for
Branson's $Q$-curvatures. The proposed formulae describe all $Q$-curvatures on
manifolds of all even dimensions in terms of respective lower order
$Q$-curvatures and lower order GJMS-operators. They are universal in the
dimension of the underlying space. The recursive formulae are generated by an
algorithm which rests on the theory of residue families. We attempt to resolve
the algorithm by formulating a conjectural description of the coefficients in
the recursive formulae in terms of interpolation polynomials associated to
compositions of natural numbers. We prove that the conjectures cover $Q_4$ and
$Q_6$ for general metrics, and $Q_8$ for conformally flat metrics. The result
for $Q_8$ is proved here for the first time. Moreover, we display explicit
(conjectural) formulae for $Q$-curvatures of order up to 16, and test high
order cases for round spheres and Einstein metrics.
