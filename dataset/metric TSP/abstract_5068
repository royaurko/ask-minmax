We present a new class of solutions in odd dimensions to Einstein's equations
containing either a positive or negative cosmological constant. These solutions
resemble the even-dimensional Eguchi-Hanson-(A)dS metrics, with the added
feature of having Lorentzian signatures. They are asymptotic to
(A)dS$_{d+1}/Z_p$. In the AdS case their energy is negative relative to that of
pure AdS. We present perturbative evidence in 5 dimensions that such metrics
are the states of lowest energy in their asymptotic class, and present a
conjecture that this is generally true for all such metrics. In the dS case
these solutions have a cosmological horizon. We show that their mass at future
infinity is less than that of pure dS.
