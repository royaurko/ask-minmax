Aim of this paper is to discuss convergence of pointed metric measure spaces
in absence of any compactness condition. We propose various definitions, show
that all of them are equivalent and that for doubling spaces these are also
equivalent to the well known measured-Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. Then we
show that the curvature conditions $CD(K,\infty)$ and $RCD(K,\infty)$ are
stable under this notion of convergence and that the heat flow passes to the
limit as well, both in the Wasserstein and in the $L^2$-framework. We also
prove the variational convergence of Cheeger energies in the naturally adapted
$\Gamma$-Mosco sense and the convergence of the spectra of the Laplacian in the
case of spaces either uniformly bounded or satisfying the $RCD(K,\infty)$
condition with $K>0$. When applied to Riemannian manifolds, our results allow
for sequences with diverging dimensions.
