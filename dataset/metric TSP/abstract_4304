For Gamma a finite, connected metric graph, we consider the space of
configurations of n points in Gamma with a restraint parameter r dictating the
minimum distance allowed between each pair of points. These restricted
configuration spaces come up naturally in topological robotics. In this paper,
we study the homotopy, homeomorphism, and isotopy types of these spaces over
the space of parameters r and provide a polynomial upper bound (in the number
of edges of Gamma) for the number of isotopy types.
