The relation between the SL(2,R)/SO(2)- and the SL(2,C)-chiral model that
naturally arise within the metric respectively the Ashtekar formulation of two
Killing field reduced Einstein gravity is revealed. Both chiral models turn out
to be completely equivalent even though the transition from the coset- to the
SL(2,C)-model is accompanied by a disappearance of the non-ultralocal terms in
the Poisson brackets.
