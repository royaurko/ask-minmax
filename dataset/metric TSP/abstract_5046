We give a Petrov classification for five-dimensional metrics. We classify
Ricci-flat metrics that are static, have an SO(3) isometry group and have
Petrov type 22. We use this classification to look for the metric of a black
hole on a cylinder, i.e. a black hole with asymptotic geometry four-dimensional
Minkowski space times a circle. Although a black string wrapped around the
circle and the five-dimensional black hole are both algebraically special, it
turns out that the black hole on a cylinder is not.
