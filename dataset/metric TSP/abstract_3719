We suggest a construction that, given a trajectorial diffeomorphism between
two Hamiltonian systems, produces integrals of them.
 As the main example we treat geodesic equivalence of metrics.
 We show that the existence of a non-trivially geodesically equivalent metric
leads to Liouville integrability, and present explicit formulae for integrals.
