We develop here a new approach for the relativistic modeling of the photons
moving into a quasi-Minkowskian space-time, where the metric is generated by an
arbitrary n-body distribution within an isolated Solar System. Our model is
built on the prescriptions of the theory of General Relativity and leaves the
choices of the metric, as well as that of the motion of the observer,
arbitrary. Adopting a quasi-Minkowskian expression of the metric accurate to
order (v/c)^2, a thorough numerical test campaign is conducted to verify
correctness and reliability of the model equations. The test results show that
the model behaves according to predictions. Specifically, comparisons to true
(simulated) data demonstrate that stellar distances are reconstructed up to the
specified level of accuracy. Although the (v/c)^2 approximation is not always
sufficient for its application to future astrometric experiments, which require
modeling to (v/c)^3, this work serves also as a natural test-ground for the
higher order model, whose formulation is now close to completion, and will be
presented in a forthcoming paper.
