We provide an affirmative answer to a question posed by Tod \cite{Tod:1995b},
and construct all four-dimensional Kahler metrics with vanishing scalar
curvature which are invariant under the conformal action of Bianchi V group.
The construction is based on the combination of twistor theory and the
isomonodromic problem with two double poles. The resulting metrics are
non-diagonal in the left-invariant basis and are explicitly given in terms of
Bessel functions and their integrals. We also make a connection with the LeBrun
ansatz, and characterise the associated solutions of the SU(\infty) Toda
equation by the existence a non-abelian two-dimensional group of point
symmetries.
