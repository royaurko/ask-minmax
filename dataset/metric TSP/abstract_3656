A low-energy background field solution describing D-membrane configurations
is constructed which is distinguished by the appearance of a Hermitian metric
on the internal space. This metric is composed of a number of independent
harmonic functions on the transverse space. Thus this construction generalizes
the usual harmonic superposition rule. The BPS bound of these solutions is
shown to be saturated indicating that they are supersymmetric. By means of
T-duality, we construct more solutions of the IIA and IIB theories.
