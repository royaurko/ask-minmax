A theorem proved by Hrushovski for graphs and extended by Solecki and Vershik
(independently from each other) to metric spaces leads to a stronger version of
ultrahomogeneity of the infinite random graph $R$, the universal Urysohn metric
space $\Ur$, and other related objects. We show how the result can be used to
average out uniform and coarse embeddings of $\Ur$ (and its various
counterparts) into normed spaces. Sometimes this leads to new embeddings of the
same kind that are metric transforms and besides extend to affine
representations of various isometry groups. As an application of this
technique, we show that $\Ur$ admits neither a uniform nor a coarse embedding
into a uniformly convex Banach space.
