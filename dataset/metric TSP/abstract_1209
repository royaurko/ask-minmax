We formulate the recently proposed ghost-free theory of multiple interacting
vielbeins in terms of their corresponding metrics. This is achieved by
reintroducing all local Lorentz invariances broken by the multivielbein
interaction potential which, in turn, allows us to explicitly separate the
gauge degrees of freedom in the vielbeins from the components of the metrics by
an appropriate gauge choice. We argue that the gauge choice does not spoil the
no-ghost proof of the multivielbein theory, hence the multimetric theory is
ghost-free. We further show the on-shell equivalence of the metric and vielbein
descriptions, first in general and thereafter in two illustrative examples.
