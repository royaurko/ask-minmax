In Einstein's general relativity, with its nonlinear field equations, the
discoveries and analyzes of various specific explicit solutions made a great
impact on understanding many of the unforeseen features of the theory. Some
solutions found fundamental applications in astrophysics, cosmology and, more
recently, in the developments inspired by string theory. In this short article
we survey the invariant characterization and classification of the solutions
and describe the properties and role of the most relevant classes: Minkowski,
(anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, spherical Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstroem
metrics, stationary axisymmetric solutions, radiative metrics describing plane
and cylindrical waves, radiative fields of uniformly accelerated sources and
Robinson-Trautman solutions. Metrics representing regions of spacetimes filled
with matter are also discussed and cosmological models are very briefly
mentioned. Some parts of the text are based on a detailed survey which appeared
in gr-qc/0004016 (see Ref. 2).
