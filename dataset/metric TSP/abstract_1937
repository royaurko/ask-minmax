A conformally flat accelerated charge metric is found in an arbitrary
dimension $D$. It is a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-null fluid with a
cosmological constant in $D \ge 4$ dimensions. When the acceleration is zero
our solution reduces to the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson metric. We show that
the charge loses its energy, for all dimensions, due to the acceleration.
