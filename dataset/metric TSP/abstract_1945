We study symmetric teleparallel (STP) gravity model, in which only spacetime
non-metricity is nonzero. First we obtain STP equivalent Einstein-Hilbert
Lagrangian and give an approach for a generic solution in terms of only metric
tensor. Then we obtain a spherically symmetric static solution to the
Einstein's equation in STP space-time and discuss the singularities. Finally,
we study a model given by a Lagrangian 4-form quadratic in non-metricity. Thus,
we seek Schwarzschild-type solutions because of its observational success and
obtain some sets of solutions. Finally, we discuss physical relevance of the
solutions.
