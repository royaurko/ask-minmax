We study the classification of smooth toroidal compactifications of
nonuniform ball quotients in the sense of Kodaira and Enriques. Moreover,
several results concerning the Riemannian and complex algebraic geometry of
these spaces are given. In particular we show that there are compact complex
surfaces which admit Riemannian metrics of nonpositive curvature, but which do
not admit K\"ahler metrics of nonpositive curvature. An infinite class of such
examples arise as smooth toroidal compactifications of ball quotients.
