Let N_0 = C^2/H be an isolated quotient singularity with H in U (2) a finite
subgroup. We show that for any Q-Gorenstein smoothings of N_0 a nearby fiber
admits ALE Ricci-flat Kahler metrics in any Kahler class. Moreover, we
generalize Kronheimer's results on hyperkahler 4-manifolds, by giving an
explicit classification of the ALE Ricci-flat Kahler surfaces.
  We construct ALF Ricci-flat Kahler metrics on the above non-simply connected
manifolds. These provide new examples of ALF Ricci-flat Kahler 4-manifolds,
with cubic volume growth and cyclic fundamental group at infinity.
