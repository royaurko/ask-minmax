We show that normalized currents of integration along the common zeros of
random $m$-tuples of sections of powers of $m$ singular Hermitian big line
bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold distribute asymptotically to the wedge
product of the curvature currents of the metrics. If the Hermitian metrics are
H\"older with singularities we also estimate the speed of convergence.
