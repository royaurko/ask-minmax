We prove that every finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold M with p > 0 cusps
admits a canonical, complete, piecewise Euclidean CAT(0) metric, with a
canonical projection to a CAT(0) spine K. Moreover, (a) the universal cover of
M endowed with the CAT(0) metric is a union of Euclidean half-spaces, glued
together by identifying Euclidean polygons in their bounding planes by pairwise
isometry (b)each cusp of M in the CAT(0) metric is a non-singular metric
product of a (Euclidean) cusp torus and a half-line (c) all metric
singularities are concentrated on the 1-skeleton of K, with cone angles a
multiple of pi (d) there is a canonical deformation of the hyperbolic metric
with limit the CAT(0) piecewise Euclidean metric. The proof uses Ford domains;
the construction is essentially the polar-dual of the Epstein-Penner canonical
decomposition, and generalizes to higher dimension.
