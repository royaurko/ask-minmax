We show improved approximation guarantees for the traveling salesman problem
on cubic graphs, and cubic bipartite graphs. For cubic bipartite graphs with n
nodes, we improve on recent results of Karp and Ravi (2014) by giving a simple
"local improvement" algorithm that finds a tour of length at most 5/4 n - 2.
For 2-connected cubic graphs, we show that the techniques of Moemke and
Svensson (2011) can be combined with the techniques of Correa, Larre and Soto
(2012), to obtain a tour of length at most (4/3-1/8754)n.
