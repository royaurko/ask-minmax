If we consider the spacetime manifold as product of a constant curvature
2-sphere (hypersphere) and a 2-space, then solution of the Einstein equation
requires that the latter must also be of constant curvature. There exist only
two solutions for classical matter distribution which are given by the Nariai
(anti) metric describing an Einstein space and the Bertotti - Robinson (anti)
metric describing a uniform electric field. These two solutions are
transformable into each other by letting the timelike convergence density
change sign. The hyperspherical solution is anti of the spherical one and the
vice -versa. For non classical matter, we however find a new solution, which is
electrograv dual to the flat space, and describes a cloud of string dust of
uniform energy density. We also discuss some interesting features of the
particle motion in the Bertotti - Robinson metric.
