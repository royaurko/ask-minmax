We show how in the presence of RR two-form field strength the conditions for
preserving supersymmetry on six- and seven-dimensional manifolds lead to
certain generalizations of monopole equations. For six dimensions the string
frame metric is Kaehler with the complex structure that descends from the
octonions if in addition we assume F^{(1,1)}=0. The susy generator is a gauge
covariantly constant spinor. For seven dimensions the string frame metric is
conformal to a G_2 metric if in addition we assume the field strength to obey a
selfduality constraint. Solutions to these equations lift to geometries of G_2
and Spin(7) holonomy respectively.
