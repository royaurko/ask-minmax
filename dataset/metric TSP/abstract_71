It is proved that the Gromov-Hausdorff metric on the space of compact metric
spaces considered up to an isometry is strictly intrinsic, i.e., the
corresponding metric space is geodesic. In other words, each two points of this
space (each two compact metric spaces) can be connected by a geodesic. For
finite metric spaces a geodesic is constructed explicitly.
