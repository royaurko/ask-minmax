We introduce a class of metrics on gauge theoretic moduli spaces. These
metrics are made out of the universal matrix that appears in the universal
connection construction of M. S. Narasimhan and S. Ramanan. As an example we
construct metrics on the c_{2}=1 SU(2) moduli space of instantons on R^4 for
various universal matrices.
