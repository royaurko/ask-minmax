Optimized reviewer assignment can effectively utilize limited intellectual
resources and significantly assure review quality in various scenarios such as
paper selection in conference or journal, proposal selection in funding
agencies and so on. However, little research on reviewer assignment of software
peer review has been found. In this study, an optimization approach is proposed
based on students' preference matrix and the model of asymmetric traveling
salesman problem (ATSP). Due to the most critical role of rule matrix in this
approach, we conduct a questionnaire to obtain students' preference matrices
and convert them to rule matrices. With the help of software ILOG CPLEX, the
approach is accomplished by controlling the exit criterion of ATSP model. The
comparative study shows that the assignment strategies with both reviewers'
preference matrix and contributors' preference matrix get better performance than
the random assignment. Especially, it is found that the performance is just a
little better than that of random assignment when the reviewers' and contributors'
preference matrices are merged. In other words, the majority of students have a
strong wish of harmonious development even though high-level students are not
willing to do that.
