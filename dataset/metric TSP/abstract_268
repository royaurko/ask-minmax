We consider a fairly general class of natural non standard metric products
and classify those amongst them, which yield a product of certain type (for
instance an inner metric space) for all possible choices of factors of this
type (inner metric spaces). We further prove the additivity of the Minkowski
rank for a large class of metric products.
