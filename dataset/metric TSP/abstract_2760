Warped embeddings from a lower dimensional Einstein manifold into a higher
dimensional one are analyzed. Explicit solutions for the embedding metrics are
obtained for all cases of codimension 1 embeddings and some of the codimension
n>1 cases. Some of the interesting features of the embedding metrics are
pointed out and potential applications of the embeddings are discussed.
