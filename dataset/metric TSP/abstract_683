In this paper, we study the boundary behavior of the negatively curved
K\"ahler-Einstein metric attached to a log canonical pair $(X,D)$ such that
$K_X+D$ is ample. In the case where $X$ is smooth and $D$ has simple normal
crossings support (but possibly negative coefficients), we provide a very
precise estimate on the potential of the KE metric near the boundary $D$. In
the more general singular case ($D$ being assumed effective though), we show
that the KE metric has mixed cone and cusp singularities near $D$ on the snc
locus of the pair. As a corollary, we derive the behavior in codimension one of
the KE metric of a stable variety.
