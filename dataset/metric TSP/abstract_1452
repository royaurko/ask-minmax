The flag curvature of a Finsler metric is called a Riemannian quantity
because it is an extension of sectional curvature in Riemannian geometry. In
Finsler geometry, there are several non-Riemannian quantities such as the
(mean) Cartan torsion, the (mean) Landsberg curvature and the S-curvature,
which all vanish for Riemannian metrics. It is important to understand the
geometric meanings of these quantities. In this paper, we study Finsler metrics
of scalar curvature (i.e., the flag curvature is a scalar function on the slit
tangent bundle) and partially determine the flag curvature when certain
non-Riemannian quantities are isotropic. Using the obtained formula for the
flag curvature, we classify locally projectively flat Randers metrics with
isotropic S-curvature.
