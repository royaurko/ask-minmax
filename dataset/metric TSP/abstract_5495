A set of vertices $S$ resolves a graph $G$ if every vertex is uniquely
determined by its vector of distances to the vertices in $S$. The metric
dimension of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set of $G$.
  Let $\{G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n\}$ be a finite collection of graphs and each
$G_i$ has a fixed vertex $v_{0_i}$ or a fixed edge $e_{0_i}$ called a terminal
vertex or edge, respectively. The vertex-amalgamation of $G_1, G_2, \ldots,
G_n$, denoted by $Vertex-Amal\{G_i;v_{0_i}\}$, is formed by taking all the
$G_i$'s and identifying their terminal vertices. Similarly, the
edge-amalgamation of $G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n$, denoted by
$Edge-Amal\{G_i;e_{0_i}\}$, is formed by taking all the $G_i$'s and identifying
their terminal edges.
  Here we study the metric dimensions of vertex-amalgamation and
edge-amalgamation for finite collection of regular graphs: complete graphs and
prisms.
