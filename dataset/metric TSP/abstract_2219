We present here the field equations describing a non-stationary spherically
symmetric n-dimensional charged black hole with varying mass m(v) and/or
electric charge q(v), described by a generic charged Vaidya metric with
cosmological constant Lambda in double null coordinates. This formulation of
the metric has been shown to be particularly useful for perturbative studies
and it was used in some recent works. Here we also discuss some issues related
to the apparent and event horizons of the black hole.
