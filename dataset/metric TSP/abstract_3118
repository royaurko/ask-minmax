In this paper, we explore the properties of gravitational lensing by black
holes in the Randall-Sundrum II braneworld. We use numerical techniques to
calculate lensing observables using the Tidal Reissner-Nordstrom (TRN) and
Garriga-Tanaka metrics to examine supermassive black holes and primordial black
holes. We introduce a new way tp parameterize tidal charge in the TRN metric
which results in a large increase in image magnifications for braneworld
primordial black holes compared to their 4 dimensional analogues. Finally, we
offer a mathematical analysis that allows us to analyze the validity of the
logarithmic approximation of the bending angle for any static, spherically
symmetric metric. We apply this to the TRN metric and show that it is valid for
any amount of tidal charge.
