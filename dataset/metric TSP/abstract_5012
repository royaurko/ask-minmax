The problem of deriving a shock-wave geometry with cosmological constant by
boosting a Schwarzschild-de Sitter (or anti-de Sitter) black hole is
re-examined. Unlike previous work in the literature, we deal with the exact
Schwarzschild-de Sitter (or anti-de Sitter) metric. By virtue of peculiar
cancellations in this exact calculation, where the metric does not depend
linearly on the mass parameter, we find a singularity of distributional nature
on a null hypersurface, which corresponds to a shock-wave geometry derived in a
fully non-perturbative way. The result agrees with previous calculations, where
the metric had been linearized in the mass parameter.
