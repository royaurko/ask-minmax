We study singular Hermitian metrics on vector bundles. Our first result is
showing coherence of the higher rank analogue of multiplier ideals when metrics
are defined by global sections. Related to this result, we construct an example
of a singular Hermitian metric defined by global sections whose standard
approximation is not Nakano-semipositive. Our second result is a theorem saying
that existence of some type of metrics implies splitting of a short exact
sequence. As a result, we can determine all negatively curved singular
Hermitian metrics on certain rank 2 bundles on elliptic curves.
