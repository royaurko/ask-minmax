We consider a wide class of two-dimensional metrics having one Killing
vector. The method is proposed for the construction of maximally extended
surfaces with the given Riemannian metric which is the analog of the conformal
block method for two-dimensional Lorentzian signature metrics. The
Schwarzschild solution is considered as an example.
