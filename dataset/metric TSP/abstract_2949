The stability of general relativistic thin disks is investigated under a
general first order perturbation of the energy momentum tensor. In particular,
we consider temporal, radial and azimuthal "test matter" perturbations of the
quantities involved on the plane $z=0$. We study the thin disks generated by
applying the "displace, cut and reflect" method, usually known as the image
method, to the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates and to the
Chazy-Curzon metric and the Zipoy-Voorhees metric ($\gamma$-metric) in Weyl
coordinates. In the case of the isotropic Schwarzschild thin disk, where a
radial pressure is present to support the gravitational attraction, the disk is
stable and the perturbation favors the formation of rings. Also, we found the
expected result that the thin disk models generated by the Chazy-Curzon and
Zipoy-Voorhees metric with only azimuthal pressure are not stable under a
general first order perturbation
