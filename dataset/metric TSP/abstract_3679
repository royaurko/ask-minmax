We investigate the low-energy dynamics of the BPS solitons of the
noncommutative CP^1 model in 2+1 dimensions using the moduli space metric of
the BPS solitons. We show that the dynamics of a single soliton coincides with
that in the commutative model. We find that the singularity in the two-soliton
moduli space, which exists in the commutative CP^1 model, disappears in the
noncommutative model.We also show that the two-soliton metric has the smooth
commutative limit.
