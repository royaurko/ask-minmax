Based on the hidden conformal symmetry, some contributors have proposed a Harrison
metric for the Schwarzschild black hole. We give a procedure which can generate
a family of Harrison metrics starting from a general set of SL(2, R) vector
fields. By analogy with the subtracted geometry of the Kerr black hole, we find
a new Harrison metric for the Schwarzschild case. Its conformal generators are
also investigated using the Killing equations in the near-horizon limit.
