We investigate the convergence rate in the Lyapunov theorem when the third
absolute moments exist. By means of convex analysis we obtain the sharp
estimate for the distance in the mean metric between a probability distribution
and its zero bias transformation. This bound allows to derive new estimates of
the convergence rate in terms of Kolmogorov's metric as well as the metrics
$\zeta_r$ (r=1,2,3) introduced by Zolotarev. The estimate for $\zeta_3$ is
optimal. Moreover, we show that the constant in the classical Berry-Esseen
theorem can be taken as 0.4785. In addition, the non-i.i.d. analogue of this
theorem with the constant 0.5606 is provided.
