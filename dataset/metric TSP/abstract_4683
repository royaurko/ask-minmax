We prove that polarised manifolds that admit a constant scalar curvature
K\"ahler (cscK) metric satisfy a condition we call slope semistability. That
is, we define the slope $\mu$ for a projective manifold and for each of its
subschemes, and show that if $X$ is cscK then $\mu(Z)\le\mu(X)$ for all
subschemes $Z$.
  This gives many examples of manifolds with K\"ahler classes which do not
admit cscK metrics, such as del Pezzo surfaces and projective bundles. If
$\PP(E)\to B$ is a projective bundle which admits a cscK metric in a rational
K\"ahler class with sufficiently small fibres, then $E$ is a slope semistable
bundle (and $B$ is a slope semistable polarised manifold). The same is true for
\emph{all} rational K\"ahler classes if the base $B$ is a curve.
  We also show that the slope inequality holds automatically for smooth curves,
canonically polarised and Calabi Yau manifolds, and manifolds with $c_1(X)<0$
and $L$ close to the canonical polarisation.
