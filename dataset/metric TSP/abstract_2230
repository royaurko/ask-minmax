We relate the global log canonical threshold of a variety with torus action
to the global log canonical threshold of its quotient. We apply this to certain
Fano varieties and use Tian's criterion to prove the existence of
Kahler-Einstein metrics on them. In particular, we obtain simple examples of
Fano threefolds being Kahler-Einstein but admitting deformations without
Kahler-Einstein metric.
