We present a tensorial relative of the familiar affine connection and argue
that it should be regarded as the gravitational field tensor. Remarkably, the
Lagrangian density expressed in terms of this tensor has a simple form, which
depends only on the metric and its first derivatives and, moreover, is a true
scalar quantity. The geodesic equation, moreover, shows that our tensor plays a
role that is strongly reminiscent of the gravitational field in Newtonian
mechanics and this, together with other evidence, which we present, leads us to
identify it as the gravitational field tensor. We calculate the gravitational
field tensor for the Schwarzschild metric. We suggest some of the advantages to
be gained from applying our tensor to the study of gravitational waves.
