Using the random complexes of Linial and Meshulam, we exhibit a large family
of simplicial complexes for which, whenever affinely embedded into Euclidean
space, the filling areas of simplicial cycles is greatly distorted. This
phenomenon can be regarded as a higher order analogue of the metric distortion
of embeddings of random graphs.
