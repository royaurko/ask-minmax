We study the constant curvature solutions of the minimal massive gravity
(MMGR). After introducing a condition on the physical and the fiducial metrics
as well as the Stuckelberg scalars which truncates the action to the
Einstein-Hilbert one in the presence of an effective cosmological constant we
focus on the solutions of the constraint equations written for the constant
curvature physical metrics. We discuss two distinct formal solution methods for
these constraint equations then present an explicit class of solutions for the
Stuckelberg scalars and the fiducial metrics giving rise to constant curvature
solutions of MMGR.
