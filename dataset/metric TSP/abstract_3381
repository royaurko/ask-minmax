To define a free string by the Nambu-Goto action, all we need is the notion
of area, and mathematically the area can be defined directly in the absence of
a metric. Motivated by the possibility that string theory admits backgrounds
where the notion of length is not well defined but a definition of area is
given, we study space-time geometries based on the generalization of metric to
area metric. In analogy with Riemannian geometry, we define the analogues of
connections, curvatures and Einstein tensor. We propose a formulation
generalizing Einstein's theory that will be useful if at a certain stage or a
certain scale the metric is ill-defined and the space-time is better
characterized by the notion of area. Static spherical solutions are found for
the generalized Einstein equation in vacuum, including the Schwarzschild
solution as a special case.
