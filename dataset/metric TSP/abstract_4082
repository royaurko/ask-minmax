We study fermions coupled to Yang-Mills matrix models from the point of view
of emergent gravity. The matrix model Dirac operator provides an appropriate
coupling for fermions to the effective gravitational metric for general branes
with nontrivial embedding, albeit with a non-standard spin connection. This
generalizes previous results for 4-dimensional matrix models. Integrating out
the fermions in a nontrivial geometrical background induces indeed the
Einstein-Hilbert action of the effective metric, as well as additional terms
which couple the Poisson tensor to the Riemann tensor, and a dilaton-like term.
