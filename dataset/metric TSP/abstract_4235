New representation of the exact Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations at the
Mathisson-Pirani condition in the Kerr metric which does not contain the
third-order derivatives of the coordinates of a spinning particle is obtained.
For this purpose the integrals of energy and angular momentum of the spinning
particle as well as a differential relationship following from the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations are used. The form of these equations is
adapted for their computer integration with the aim of further investigations
of the influence of the spin-curvature interaction on the particle's behavior
in the gravitational field without restrictions on its velocity and spin
orientation.
