We consider a general analysis and a specific ansatz for the study of
non-supersymmetric solutions in arbitrary dimensions and various metric
signatures. In all cases, we find that the conditions on the solutions can be
written in terms of quadratic forms involving the gauge coupling of the theory
and constants of integration associated with the scalar fields. Depending on
the signature of the metric, our analysis should provide a general framework
for finding non-extremal black holes, instantons, branes and S-branes.
