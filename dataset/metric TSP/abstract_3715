In this note, we look at estimates for the scalar curvature k of a Riemannian
manifold M which are related to spin^c Dirac operators: We show that one may
not enlarge a Kaehler metric with positive Ricci curvature without making k
smaller somewhere on M. We also give explicit upper bounds for min(k) for
arbitrary Riemannian metrics on certain submanifolds of complex projective
space. In certain cases, these estimates are sharp: we give examples where
equality is obtained.
