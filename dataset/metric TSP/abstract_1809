We consider the problem of reconstructing a signal from noisy measurements in
linear mixing systems. The reconstruction performance is usually quantified by
standard error metrics such as squared error, whereas we consider any additive
error metric. Under the assumption that relaxed belief propagation (BP) can
compute the posterior in the large system limit, we propose a simple, fast, and
highly general algorithm that reconstructs the signal by minimizing the
user-defined error metric. For two example metrics, we provide performance
analysis and convincing numerical results. Finally, our algorithm can be
adjusted to minimize the $\ell_\infty$ error, which is not additive.
Interestingly, $\ell_{\infty}$ minimization only requires to apply a Wiener
filter to the output of relaxed BP.
