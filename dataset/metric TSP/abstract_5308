Let T(\gamma) be the total space of the canonical line bundle \gamma over
CP^1 and r an integer which is greater than one and coprime to six. We prove
that L_r^3\times T(\gamma) admits an infinite sequence of metrics of
nonnegative sectional curvature with pairwise non-homeomorphic souls, where
L_r^3 is the standard 3-dimensional lens space with fundamental group
isomorphic to Z/r. We classify the total spaces of S^1-fibre bundles over
S^2\times S^2 with fundamental group isomorphic to Z/r up to diffeomorphism and
use these results to give examples of manifolds N which admit two complete
metrics of nonnegative sectional curvature with souls S and S' of codimension
two such that S and S' are diffeomorphic whereas the pairs (N,S) and (N,S') are
not diffeomorphic. This solves a problem posed by I. Belegradek, S. Kwasik and
R. Schultz.
