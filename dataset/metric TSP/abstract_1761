In this paper we initiate a classification of local metrics admitting the
principal Killing--Yano tensor with a skew-symmetric torsion. It is
demonstrated that in such spacetimes rank-2 Killing tensors occur naturally and
mutually commute. We reduce the classification problem to that of solving a set
of partial differential equations, and we present some solutions to these PDEs.
In even dimensions, three types of local metrics are obtained: one of them
naturally generalizes the torsionless case while the others occur only when the
torsion is present. In odd dimensions, we obtain more varieties of local
metrics. The explicit metrics constructed in this paper are not the most
general possible admitting the required symmetry, nevertheless, it is
demonstrated that they cover a wide variety of solutions of various
supergravities, such as the Kerr-Sen black holes of (un-)gauged abelian
heterotic supergravity, the Chong-Cvetic-L\"u-Pope black hole solution of
five-dimensional minimal supergravity, or the K\"ahler with torsion manifolds.
The relation between generalized Killing--Yano tensors and various torsion
Killing spinors is also discussed.
