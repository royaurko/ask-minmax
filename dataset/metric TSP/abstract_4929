The problem of construction of a general ihomogeneous solution of
$D$-dimensional Einstein equations in the vicinity of a cosmological
singularity is considered. It is shown that near the singularity a local
behavior of metric functions is described by a billiard on a space of a
constant negative curvature. The billiard is shown to have a finite volume and
consequently to be a mixing one. Dynamics of inhomogeneities of metric is
studied and it is shown that its statistical properties admit a complete
description. An invariant measure describing statistics of inhomogeneities is
obtained and a role of a minimally-coupled scalar field in dynamics of the
inhomogeneities is also considered.
