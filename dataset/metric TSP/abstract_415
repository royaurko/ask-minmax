In this paper we study submanifolds of an almost complex manifold with Norden
metric which are non-degenerate with respect to the one Norden metric and
lightlike with respect to the other Norden metric on the manifold. Relations
between the induced geometric objects of some of these submanifolds are given.
Examples of the considered submanifolds are constructed.
