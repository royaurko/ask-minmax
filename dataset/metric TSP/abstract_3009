For any 3-manifold M and any nonnegative integer g, we give here examples of
metrics on M each of which has a sequence of embedded minimal surfaces of genus
g and without Morse index bounds. On any spherical space form S^3/Gamma we
construct such a metric with positive scalar curvature. More generally we
construct such a metric with Scal>0 (and such surfaces) on any 3-manifold which
carries a metric with Scal>0. In all but one of these examples the Hausdorff
limit will be a singular minimal lamination. The singularities being in each
case exactly two points lying on a closed leaf (the leaf is a strictly stable
sphere).
