This paper studies polar sets of anisotropic Gaussian random fields, i.e.
sets which a Gaussian random field does not hit almost surely. The main
assumptions are that the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are bounded from
below and that the canonical metric associated with the Gaussian random field
is dominated by an anisotropic metric. We deduce an upper bound for the hitting
probabilities and conclude that sets with small Hausdorff dimension are polar.
Moreover, the results allow for a translation of the Gaussian random field by a
random field, that is independent of the Gaussian random field and whose sample
functions are of bounded H\"older norm.
