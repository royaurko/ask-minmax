We show that the existence of the Newtonian limit cannot work as a selection
rule for choosing the correct gravity theory fromm the set of all L=f(R) ones.
To this end we prove that stability of the ground state solution in arbitrary
purely metric f(R) gravity implies the existence of the Newtonian limit of the
theory. And the stability is assumed to be the fundamental viability criterion
of any gravity theory. The Newtonian limit is either strict in the mathematical
sense if the ground state is flat spacetime or approximate and valid on length
scales smaller than the cosmological one if the ground state is de Sitter or
AdS space. Hence regarding the Newtonian limit a metric f(R) gravity does not
differ from GR with arbitrary Lambda. This is exceptional to Lagrangians solely
depending on R and/or Ricci tensor. An independent selection rule is necessary.
