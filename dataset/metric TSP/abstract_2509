It is shown that there are infinitely many compact orientable smooth
4-manifolds which do not admit Einstein metrics, but nevertheless satisfy the
strict Hitchin-Thorpe inequality 2 chi > 3 |tau|. The examples in question
arise as non-minimal complex algebraic surfaces of general type, and the method
of proof stems from Seiberg-Witten theory.
