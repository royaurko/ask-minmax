We discuss the near singularity region of the linear mass Vaidya metric for
massless particles with non-zero angular momentum. In particular we look at
massless geodesics with non-zero angular momentum near the vanishing point of a
special subclass of linear mass Vaidya metrics. We also investigate this same
structure in the numerical solutions for the scattering of massless scalars
from the singularity. Finally we make some comments on the possibility of using
this metric as a semi-classical model for the end-point of black hole
evaporation.
