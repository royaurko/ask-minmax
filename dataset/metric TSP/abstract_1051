Using Einstein and Papapetrou energy-momentum complexes, we explicitly
calculate the energy and momentum distribution associated with spacetime
homogeneous G$\ddot{o}$del-type metrics. We obtain that the two definitions of
energy-momentum complexes do not provide the same result for these type of
metrics. However, it is shown that the results obtained are reduced to the
energy-momentum densities of G$\ddot{o}$del metric already available in the
literature
