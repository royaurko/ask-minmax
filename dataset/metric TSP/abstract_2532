Geometric structure of spherically-symmetric space-time in metric-affine
gauge theory of gravity is studied. Restrictions on curvature tensor and
Bianchi identities are obtained. By using certain simple gravitational
Lagrangian the solution of gravitational equations for vacuum
spherically-symmetric gravitational field is obtained.
