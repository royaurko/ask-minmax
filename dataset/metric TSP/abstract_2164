The present paper considers two infinite families of cone-manifolds endowed
with spherical metric. The singular strata is either the torus knot ${\rm
t}(2n+1, 2)$ or the torus link ${\rm t}(2n, 2)$. Domains of existence for a
spherical metric are found in terms of cone angles and volume formul{\ae} are
presented.
