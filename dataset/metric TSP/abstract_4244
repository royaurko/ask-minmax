We discuss the possibility of geometrizing interactions by exploiting the
"principle of solidarity" between space-time and the physical phenomena
occurring in it (formulated by the Italian matematician B. Finzi in 1955). This
is accomplished by means of a deformation of the Minkowski metric, implemented
by assuming that the metric coefficients depend on the energy of the process
considered. Such a formalism ("Deformed Special Relativity") allows one, among
the others, to deal with the breakdown of Lorentz invariance and to recover it
in a generalized sense.
