We investigate the size and large intersection properties of
$$E_{t}=\{x\in\R^d \:|\: \|x-k-x_{i}\|<{r_{i}}^t\text{for infinitely
many}(i,k)\in I^{\mu,\alpha}\times\Z^d\},$$ where $d\in\N$, $t\geq 1$, $I$ is a
denumerable set, $(x_{i},r_{i})_{i\in I}$ is a family in $[0,1]^d\times
(0,\infty)$ and $I^{\mu,\alpha}$ denotes the set of all $i\in I$ such that the
$\mu$-mass of the ball with center $x_{i}$ and radius $r_{i}$ behaves as
${r_{i}}^\alpha$ for a given Borel measure $\mu$ and a given $\alpha>0$. We
establish that the set $E_{t}$ belongs to the class $\grint^h(\R^d)$ of sets
with large intersection with respect to a certain gauge function $h$, provided
that $(x_{i},r_{i})_{i\in I}$ is a heterogeneous ubiquitous system with respect
to $\mu$. In particular, $E_{t}$ has infinite Hausdorff $g$-measure for every
gauge function $g$ that increases faster than $h$ in a neighborhood of zero. We
also give several applications to metric number theory.
