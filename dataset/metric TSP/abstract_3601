We study the static black hole solutions of generalized two-dimensional
dilaton-gravity theories generated by pointlike mass sources, in the hypothesis
that the matter is conformally coupled. We also discuss the motion of test
particles. Due to conformal coupling, these follow the geodesics of a metric
obtained by rescaling the canonical metric with the dilaton.
