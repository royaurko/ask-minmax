The construction of deletion codes for the Levenshtein metric is reduced to
the construction of codes over the integers for the Manhattan metric by run
length coding. The latter codes are constructed by expurgation of translates of
lattices. These lattices, in turn, are obtained from Construction~A applied to
binary codes and $\Z_4-$codes. A lower bound on the size of our codes for the
Manhattan distance are obtained through generalized theta series of the
corresponding lattices.
