We consider polyhedral approximations of strictly convex compacta in finite
dimensional Euclidean spaces (such compacta are also uniformly convex). We
obtain the best possible estimates for errors of considered approximations in
the Hausdorff metric. We also obtain new estimates of an approximate algorithm
for finding the convex hulls.
