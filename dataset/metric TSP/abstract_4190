We classify manifolds of small dimension that admit both, a Riemannian metric
of non-negative scalar curvature, and a -- a priori different -- metric for
which all wedge products of harmonic forms are harmonic. For manifolds whose
first Betti numbers are sufficiently large, this classification extends to
higher dimensions.
