We describe an axisymmetric general relativistic code for rotational core
collapse. The code evolves the coupled system of metric and fluid equations
using the ADM 3+1 formalism and a conformally flat metric approximation of the
Einstein equations. The relativistic hydrodynamics equations are formulated as
a first-order flux-conservative hyperbolic system and are integrated using
high-resolution shock-capturing schemes based on Riemann solvers. We assess the
quality of the conformally flat metric approximation for relativistic core
collapse and present a comprehensive set of tests which the code successfully
passed. The tests include relativistic shock tubes, the preservation of the
rotation profile and of the equilibrium of rapidly and differentially rotating
neutron stars (approximated as rotating polytropes), spherical relativistic
core collapse, and the conservation of rest-mass and angular momentum in
dynamic spacetimes. The application of the code to relativistic rotational core
collapse, with emphasis on the gravitational waveform signature, is presented
in an accompanying paper.
