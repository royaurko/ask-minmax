This paper proves the local well posedness of differential equations in
metric spaces under assumptions that allow to comprise several different
applications. We consider below a system of balance laws with a dissipative non
local source, the Hille-Yosida Theorem, a generalization of a recent result on
nonlinear operator splitting, an extension of Trotter formula for linear
semigroups and the heat equation.
