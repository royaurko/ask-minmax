These notes, based on work with Herbi Dreiner and Howie Haber, discuss how to
do practical calculations of cross sections and decay rates using two-component
fermion notation, as appropriate for supersymmetry and other
beyond-the-Standard-Model theories. Included are a list of two-component
fermion Feynman rules for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and some
example calculations.
