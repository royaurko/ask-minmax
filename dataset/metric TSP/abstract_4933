We construct two possible metrics for abelian Higgs vortices with ends on
black holes. We show how the detail of the vortex fields smooths out the nodal
singularities which exist in the idealized metrics. A corollary is that
apparently topologically stable strings might be able to split by black hole
pair production. We estimate the rate per unit length by reference to related
Ernst and C-metric instantons, concluding that it is completely negligible for
GUT-scale strings. The estimated rate for macroscopic superstrings is much
higher, although still extremely small, unless there is an early phase of
strong coupling.
