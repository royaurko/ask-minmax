Let S be a surface with genus g and n boundary components and let d(S) =
3g-3+n denote the number of curves in any pants decomposition of S. We employ
metric properties of the graph of pants decompositions CP(S) prove that the
Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space Teich(S) is Gromov-hyperbolic if and
only if d(S) <= 2. When d(S) >= 3 the Weil-Petersson metric has higher rank in
the sense of Gromov (it admits a quasi-isometric embedding of R^k, k >= 2);
when d(S) <= 2 we combine the hyperbolicity of the complex of curves and the
relative hyperbolicity of CP(S) prove Gromov-hyperbolicity.
  We prove moreover that Teich(S) admits no geodesically complete
Gromov-hyperbolic metric of finite covolume when d(S) >= 3, and that no
complete Riemannian metric of pinched negative curvature exists on Moduli space
M(S) when d(S) >= 2.
