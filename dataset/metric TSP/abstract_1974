We obtain explicitly all solutions of the SU(infinity) Toda field equation
with the property that the associated Einstein-Weyl space admits a 2-sphere of
divergence-free shear-free geodesic congruences. The solutions depend on an
arbitrary holomorphic function and give rise to new hyperKahler and selfdual
Einstein metrics with one dimensional isometry group. These metrics each admit
a compatible hypercomplex structure with respect to which the symmetries are
triholomorphic.
