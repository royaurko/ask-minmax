We investigate the existence of multiple bound states of prescribed mass for
the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a noncompact metric graph. The main
feature is that the nonlinearity is localized only in a compact part of the
graph. Our main result states that for every integer k, the equation possesses
at least k solutions of prescribed mass, provided that the mass is large
enough. These solutions arise as constrained critical points of the NLS energy
functional. Estimates for the energy of the solutions are also established.
