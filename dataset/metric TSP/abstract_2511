We investigate CMC-surfaces with periodic metric in a dressing orbit of the
cylinder. It is shown, that such surfaces are always of finite type. Using the
periodicity conditions for the extended frame of a CMC-surface, we develop an
alternative approach to the classification of CMC-tori given by Pinkall and
Sterling.
