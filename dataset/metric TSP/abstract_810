A classic theorem of Euclidean geometry asserts that any noncollinear set of
$n$ points in the plane determines at least $n$ distinct lines. Chen and
Chv\'atal conjectured that this holds for an arbitrary finite metric space,
with a certain natural definition of lines in a metric space.
  We prove that in any metric space with $n$ points, either there is a line
containing all the points or there are at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lines. This
is the first polynomial lower bound on the number of lines in general finite
metric spaces. In the more general setting of pseudometric betweenness, we
prove a corresponding bound of $\Omega(n^{2/5})$ lines. When the metric space
is induced by a connected graph, we prove that either there is a line
containing all the points or there are $\Omega(n^{4/7})$ lines, improving the
previous $\Omega(n^{2/7})$ bound. We also prove that the number of lines in an
$n$-point metric space is at least $n / 5w$, where $w$ is the number of
different distances in the space, and we give an $\Omega(n^{4/3})$ lower bound
on the number of lines in metric spaces induced by graphs with constant
diameter, as well as spaces where all the positive distances are from \{1, 2,
3\}.
