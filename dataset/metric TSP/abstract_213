We investigate a relations of almost isometric embedding and almost isometry
between metric spaces and prove that with respect to these relations:
  (1) There is a countable universal metric space.
  (2) There may exist fewer than continuum separable metric spaces on aleph_1
so that every separable metric space is almost isometrically embedded into one
of them when the continuum hypothesis fails.
  (3) There is no collection of fewer than continuum metric spaces of
cardinality aleph_2 so that every ultra-metric space of cardinality aleph_2 is
almost isometrically embedded into one of them if aleph_2<2^{aleph_0}.
  We also prove that various spaces X satisfy that if a space X is almost
isometric to X than Y is isometric to X.
