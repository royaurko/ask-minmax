We study the Riemann curvature tensor of (\kappa,\mu,\nu)-contact metric
manifolds, which we prove to be completely determined in dimension 3, and we
observe how it is affected by D_a-homothetic deformations. This prompts the
definition and study of generalized (\kappa,\mu,\nu)-space forms and of the
necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be conformally flat.
