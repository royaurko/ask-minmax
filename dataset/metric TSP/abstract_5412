Let (X,d,p) be a pointed metric space. A pretangent space to X at p is a
metric space consisting of some equivalence classes of convergent to p
sequences (x_n), x_n \in X, whose degree of convergence is comparable with a
given scaling sequence (r_n), r_n\downarrow 0. We say that (r_n) is normal if
there is (x_n) such that |d(x_n,p)-r_n|=o(r_n) for n\to\infty. Let
Omega_{p}^{X}(n) be the set of pretangent spaces to X at p with normal scaling
sequences. We prove that the spaces from Omega_{p}^{X}(n) are uniformly bounded
if and only if {d(x,p:x\in X}is a so-called completely strongly porous set.
