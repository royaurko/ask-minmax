In this paper we have build the modified Hamiltonian formalism for geometric
objects like the Jacobi fields and metric tensors. In this approach Jacobi
fields and metric tensors are mapped among manifold. As an application, we have
mapped a general n-dimensional Riemannian manifold to a n-dimensional maximally
symmetric spacetime.
