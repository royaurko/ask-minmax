Codes over various metrics such as Rosenbloom-Tsfasman (RT), Lee, etc. have
been considered. Recently, codes over poset metrics have been studied. Poset
metric is a great generalization of many metrics especially the well-known ones
such as the RT and the Hamming metrics. Poset metric can be realized on the
channels with localized error occurrences. It has been shown that MacWilliams
identities are not admissible for codes over poset metrics in general [Kim and
Oh, 2005]. Lately, to overcome this problem some further studies on MacWilliams
identities over poset metrics has been presented. In this paper, we introduce
new poset level weight enumerators of linear codes over Frobenius commutative
rings. We derive MacWilliams-type identities for each of the given enumerators
which generalize in great deal the previous results discussed in the
literature. Most of the weight enumerators in the literature such as Hamming,
Rosenbloom-Tsfasman and complete m-spotty weight enumerators follow as
corollaries to these identities especially.
