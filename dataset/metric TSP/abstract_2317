We show that the spectrum of a Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$,
$n\ge 3$, with a periodic smooth Riemannian metric, whose conformal multiple
has a product structure with one Euclidean direction, and with a periodic
electric potential in $L^{n/2}_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, is purely
absolutely continuous. Previously known results in the case of a general metric
are obtained in [12], see also [8], under the assumption that the metric, as
well as the potential, are reflection symmetric.
