We consider a natural non-negative two-form G on quasifuchsian space that
extends the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space. We describe completely
the positive definite locus of G, showing that it is a positive definite metric
off the fuchsian diagonal of quasifuchsian space and is only zero on the
"pure-bending'' tangent vectors to the fuchsian diagonal . We show that G is
equal to the pullback of the pressure metric from dynamics. We use the
properties of G to prove that at any critical point of the Hausdorff dimension
function on quasifuchsian space the Hessian of the Hausdorff dimension function
must be positive definite on at least a half-dimensional subspace of the
tangent space. In particular this implies that Hausdorff dimension has no local
maxima on quasifuchsian space.
