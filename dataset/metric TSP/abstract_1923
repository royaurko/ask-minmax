The classical theory of gravity is formulated as a gauge theory on a frame
bundle with spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by the existence of Dirac
fermionic fields. The pseudo-Riemannian metric (tetrad field) is the
corresponding Higgs field. We consider two variants of this theory. In the
first variant, gravity is represented by the pseudo-Riemannian metric as in
general relativity theory; in the second variant, it is represented by the
effective metric as in the Logunov relativistic theory of gravity. The
configuration space, Dirac operator, and Lagrangians are constructed for both
variants.
