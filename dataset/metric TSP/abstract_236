We show that the visual angle metric and the triangular ratio metric are
comparable in convex domains. We also find the extremal points for the visual
angle metric in the half space and in the ball by use of a construction based
on hyperbolic geometry. Furthermore, we study distortion properties of
quasiconformal maps with respect to the triangular ratio metric and the visual
angle metric.
