The gauge threshold corrections for globally consistent Z2 x Z2' orientifolds
with rigid intersecting D6-branes are computed. The one-loop corrections to the
holomorphic gauge kinetic function are extracted and the Kaehler metrics for
the charged chiral multiplets are determined up to two constants.
