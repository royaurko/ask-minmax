The notion of Poisson manifold with compatible pseudo-metric was introduced
by the contributor in [1]. In this paper, we introduce a new class of Lie algebras
which we call a pseudo-Rieamannian Lie algebras. The two notions are strongly
related: we prove that a linear Poisson structure on the dual of a Lie algebra
has a compatible pseudo-metric if and only if the Lie algebra is a
pseudo-Riemannian Lie algebra, and that the Lie algebra obtained by linearizing
at a point a Poisson manifold with compatible pseudo-metric is a
pseudo-Riemannian Lie algebra. Furthermore, we give some properties of the
symplectic leaves of such manifolds, and we prove that every Poisson manifold
with compatible metric (every Riemann-Lie algebra) is unimodular. As a final,
we classify all pseudo-Riemannian Lie algebras of dimension 2 and 3.
