We construct new examples of normal (metric) currents using inverse systems
of cube complexes. For any $N\ge 2$ we provide examples of $N$-dimensional
normal currents whose associated vector fields are simple, and whose supports
are purely $2$-unrectifiable and have Nagata dimension $N$. We show that in
$l^\infty$ normal currents can be realized as limits in the flat distance of
currents associated to cube complexes.
