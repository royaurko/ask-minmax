In math.DG/0312243 we developed a general classification scheme for metric
Lie algebras, i.e. for finite-dimensional Lie algebras equipped with a
non-degenerate invariant inner product. Here we determine all nilpotent Lie
algebras l with dim l'=2 which are used in this scheme. Furthermore, we
classify all nilpotent metric Lie algebras of dimension at most 10.
