We show that within the class of left-invariant naturally reductive metrics
$\mathcal{M}_{\operatorname{Nat}}(G)$ on a compact simple Lie group $G$, every
metric is spectrally isolated. We also observe that any collection of
isospectral compact symmetric spaces is finite; this follows from a somewhat
stronger statement involving only a finite part of the spectrum.
