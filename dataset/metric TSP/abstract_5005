We study the present, flat isotropic universe in 1/R-modified gravity. We use
the Palatini (metric-affine) variational principle and the Einstein
(metric-compatible connected) conformal frame. We show that the energy density
scaling deviates from the usual scaling for nonrelativistic matter, and the
largest deviation occurs in the present epoch. We find that the current
deceleration parameter derived from the apparent matter density parameter is
consistent with observations. There is also a small overlap between the
predicted and observed values for the redshift derivative of the deceleration
parameter. The predicted redshift of the deceleration-to-acceleration
transition agrees with that in the \Lambda-CDM model but it is larger than the
value estimated from SNIa observations.
