Field theories invariant to conformal transformations are a very important
class of models. Besides their theoretical significance due to their large
symmetry group, they are important also from the practical point of view. For
instance the kinematic part of the Standard Model Lagrangian also shows
conformal invariance. In the usual approach, a field theory is called
conformally invariant whenever its field equations or its action is invariant
to the conformal transformations of the spacetime metric tensor along with
corresponding transformation of the field quantities. For this, an action of
the conformal transformations on the fields needs to be specified a priori, and
conformal invariance only makes sense along with this group action. In this
paper we introduce a simple new method of generating field theories in terms of
their Lagrangian, without a priori specifying the action of the conformal group
on the fields. The interesting aspect of this method is that it does not to
refer to a spacetime metric tensor a priori, and therefore becomes particularly
useful when searching for theories where the spacetime metric tensor is an
emergent quantity, not a fundamental field.
