We prove a Harnack inequality for a class of two-weight degenerate elliptic
operators. The metric distance is induced by continuous Grushin-type vector
fields. It is not know whether there exist cutoffs fitting the metric balls.
This obstacle is bypassed by means of a covering argument that allows the use
of rectangles in the Moser iteration.
