We construct explicit models of multi-field inflation in which the primordial
metric fluctuations do not necessarily obey Gaussian statistics. These models
are realizations of mechanisms in which non-Gaussianity is first generated by a
light scalar field and then transferred into curvature fluctuations. The
probability distribution functions of the metric perturbation at the end of
inflation are computed. This provides a guideline for designing strategies to
search for non-Gaussian signals in future CMB and large scale structure
surveys.
