Citation count is a quantifiable measure to indicate the number of times an
article is cited by other articles. It is believed that if an article is cited
often then it must be an important or influential article; however, there is no
guarantee that the most cited articles are good in quality. In this paper, the
contributor suggests argumentation count, a new metric for citation analysis. The
proposed metric, argumentation count is a triplet of quantities for each
concept of an article that helps in providing a quantifiable measure about the
usefulness of an article.
