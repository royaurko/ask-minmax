A manifestly gauge-invariant theory of gravitational fluctuations of
brane-world scenarios is discussed. Without resorting to any specific gauge
choice, a general method is presented in order to disentangle the fluctuations
of the brane energy-momentum from the fluctuations of the metric. As an
application of the formalism, the localization of metric fluctuations on scalar
branes breaking spontaneously five-dimensional Poincar\'e invariance is
addressed. Only assuming that the four-dimensional Planck mass is finite and
that the geometry is regular, it is demonstrated that the vector and scalar
fluctuations of the metric are not localized on the brane.
