In this article we verify an orbifold version of a conjecture of Nimershiem
from 1998. Namely, for every flat $n$-manifold $M$, we show that the set of
similarity classes of flat metrics on $M$ which occur as a cusp cross-section
of a hyperbolic $(n+1)$-orbifold is dense in the space of similarity classes of
flat metrics on $M$. The set used for density is precisely the set of those
classes which arise in arithmetic orbifolds.
