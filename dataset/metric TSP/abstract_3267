Let $G$ be a connected graph. A vertex $w$ {\em strongly resolves} a pair $u,
v$ of vertices of $G$ if there exists some shortest $u-w$ path containing $v$
or some shortest $v-w$ path containing $u$. A set $W$ of vertices is a {\em
strong resolving set} for $G$ if every pair of vertices of $G$ is strongly
resolved by some vertex of $W$. The smallest cardinality of a strong resolving
set for $G$ is called the {\em strong metric dimension} of $G$. It is known
that the problem of computing the strong metric dimension of a graph is
NP-hard. In this paper we obtain closed formulae for the strong metric
dimension of several families of Cartesian product graphs and direct product
graphs.
