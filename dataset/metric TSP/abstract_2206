We study inhomogeneous semilinear parabolic equations with source term f
independent of time u_{t}={\Delta}u+u^{p}+f(x) on a metric measure space,
subject to the conditions that f(x)\geq 0 and u(0,x)=\phi(x)\geq 0. By
establishing Harnack-type inequalities in time t and some powerful estimates,
we give sufficient conditions for non-existence, local existence, and global
existence of weak solutions. This paper generalizes previous results on
Euclidean spaces to general metric measure spaces.
