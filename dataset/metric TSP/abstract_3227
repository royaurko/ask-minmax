We formulate a necessary and sufficient condition for an admissible metric to
be extremal for the Fuglede p-modulus of a system of measures. When p=2, this
characterization generalizes Beurling's criterion, a sufficient condition for
an admissible metric to be extremal for the extremal length of a planar curve
family. In addition, we prove that every non-negative Borel function in R^n
with positive and finite p-norm is extremal for the p-modulus of some curve
family.
