Symplectic forms taming complex structures on compact manifolds are strictly
related to Hermitian metrics having the fundamental form $\partial \bar
\partial $-closed, i.e. to strong K\"ahler with torsion (${\rm SKT}$) metrics.
It is still an open problem to exhibit a compact example of a complex manifold
having a tamed symplectic structure but non-admitting K\"ahler structures. We
show some negative results for the existence of symplectic forms taming complex
structures on compact quotients of Lie groups by discrete subgroups. In
particular, we prove that if $M$ is a nilmanifold (not a torus) endowed with an
invariant complex structure $J$, then $(M, J)$ does not admit any symplectic
form taming $J$. Moreover, we show that if a nilmanifold $M$ endowed with an
invariant complex structure $J$ admits an ${\rm SKT}$ metric, then $M$ is at
most 2-step. As a consequence we classify 8-dimensional nilmanifolds endowed
with an invariant complex structure admitting an SKT metric.
