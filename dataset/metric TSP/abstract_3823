We study the Bers isomorphism between the Teichm\"uller space of the
parabolic cyclic group and the universal Teichm\"uller curve. We prove that
this is a group isomorphism and its derivative map gives a remarkable relation
between Fourier coefficients of cusp forms and Fourier coefficients of vector
fields on the unit circle. We generalize the Takhtajan-Zograf metric to the
Teichm\"uller space of the parabolic cyclic group, and prove that up to a
constant, it coincides with the pull back of the Velling-Kirillov metric
defined on the universal Teichm\"uller curve via the Bers isomorphism.
