We prove a version of Yau's Schwarz Lemma for general almost-complex
manifolds equipped with Hermitian metrics. This requires an extension to this
setting of the Laplacian comparison theorem. As an application we show that the
product of two almost-complex manifolds does not admit any complete Hermitian
metric with bisectional curvature bounded between two negative constants that
satisfies some additional mild assumptions.
