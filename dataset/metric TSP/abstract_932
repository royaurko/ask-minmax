We prove that the metric completion of a canonical Ricci-flat Kahler metric
on the nonsingular part of a projective Calabi-Yau variety $X$ with ordinary
double point singularities, is a compact metric length space homeomorphic to
the projective variety $X$ itself. As an application, we prove a conjecture of
Candelas and de la Ossa for conifold flops and transitions.
