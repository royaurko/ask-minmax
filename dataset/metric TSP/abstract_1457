We study countable sums of two dimensional modules for the continuous complex
functions on a compact metric space and show that it is possible to construct a
spectral triple which gives the original metric back. This spectral triple will
be finitely summable for any positive parameter. We also construct a sum of two
dimensional modules which reflects some aspects of the topological dimensions
of the compact metric space, but this will only give the metric back
approximately. We make an explicit computation of the last module for the unit
interval. The metric is recovered exactly, the Dixmier trace induces a multiple
of the Lebesgue integral and the number N(K) of eigenvalues bounded by K
behaves, such that N(K)/K is bounded, but without limit for K growing.
