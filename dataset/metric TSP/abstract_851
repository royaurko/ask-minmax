We consider Fano manifolds M that admit a collection of finite automorphism
groups G_1, ..., G_k, such that the quotients M/G_i are smooth Fano manifolds
possessing a Kaehler-Einstein metric. Under some numerical and smoothness
assumptions on the ramification divisors, we prove that M admits a
Kaehler-Einstein metric too.
