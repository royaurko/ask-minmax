Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we investigate the geometric
properties of the equilibrium manifold for diverse thermodynamic systems.
Starting from Legendre invariant metrics of the phase manifold, we derive
thermodynamic metrics for the equilibrium manifold whose curvature becomes
singular at those points where phase transitions of first and second order
occur. We conclude that the thermodynamic curvature of the equilibrium
manifold, as defined in geometrothermodynamics, can be used as a measure of
thermodynamic interaction in diverse systems with two and three thermodynamic
degrees of freedom.
