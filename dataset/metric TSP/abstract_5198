Following a suggestion made by J.-P. Demailly, for each $k\ge 1$, we endow,
by an induction process, the $k$-th (anti)tautological line bundle $\mathcal
O_{X_k}(1)$ of an arbitrary complex directed manifold $(X,V)$ with a natural
smooth hermitian metric. Then, we compute recursively the Chern curvature form
for this metric, and we show that it depends (asymptotically -- in a sense to
be specified later) only on the curvature of $V$ and on the structure of the
fibration $X_k\to X$. When $X$ is a surface and $V=T_X$, we give explicit
formulae to write down the above curvature as a product of matrices. As an
application, we obtain a new proof of the existence of global invariant jet
differentials vanishing on an ample divisor, for $X$ a minimal surface of
general type whose Chern classes satisfy certain inequalities, without using a
strong vanishing theorem of Bogomolov.
