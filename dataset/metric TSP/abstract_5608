Massive gravity is a theory which has a tremendous amount of freedom to
describe different cosmologies; but at the same time the various solutions one
encounters must fulfill some rather nontrivial constraints. Most of the freedom
comes not from the Lagrangian, which contains only a small number of free
parameters (typically 3 depending on counting conventions), but from the fact
that one is in principle free to choose the background reference metric almost
arbitrarily --- which effectively introduces a non-denumerable infinity of free
parameters. In the current paper we stress that although changing the reference
metric would lead to a different cosmological model, this does not mean that
the dynamics of the universe can be entirely divorced from its matter content.
That is, while the choice of reference metric certainly influences the
evolution of the physically observable foreground metric, the effect of matter
cannot be neglected. Nevertheless, the relation between matter and geometry can
be significantly changed in some specific models; effectively since the
graviton would be able to curve the spacetime by itself, without the need of
matter. Thus, even the set of vacuum solutions for massive gravity can have
significant structure. On the other hand, in some cases the effect of the
reference metric could be so strong that no conceivable material content would
be able to drastically affect the cosmological evolution.
