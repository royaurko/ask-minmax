We present a new explanation for the very wide absorption features in quasar
spectra. In our model, a very wide absorption feature will originate, when the
line of sight crosses a bubble wall tangentially. We demonstrate this on the
quasar pair (2138-4427), (2139-4434). Both show two very wide absorption lines
in their spectra at the same redshift. The bubble wall model can explain these
observations in low density Friedmann-Lemaitre models with spherical metric. It
contradicts models with euclidian or hyperbolic metric.
