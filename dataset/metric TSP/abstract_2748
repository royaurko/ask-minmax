In this paper, I will show how to use beta-deformations to deal with dual
flatness of Randers metrics. beta-deformations is a new method in
Riemann-Finsler geometry, it is introduced by the contributor(see arxiv:1209.0845).
Later on I will provide more applications of the new kind of deformations in
Finsler geometry.
