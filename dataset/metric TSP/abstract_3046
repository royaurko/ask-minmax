4-dim intrinsic (material) Riemannian metric $G$ of the material 4-D
space-time continuum $P$ is utilized as the characteristic of the aging
processes developing in the material. Manifested through variation of basic
material characteristics such as density, moduli of elasticity, yield stress,
strength, and toughness., the aging process is modeled as the evolution of the
metric $G$ (most importantly of its time component $G_{00}$) of the material
space-time $P$ embedded into 4-D Newtonian space-time with Euclidean
metric.\par
 The evolutional equation for metric $G$ is derived by the classical
variational approach. Construction of a Lagrangian for an aging elastic media
and the derivation of a system of coupled elastostatic and aging equations
constitute the central part of the work. The external and internal balance laws
associated with symmetries of material and physical space-time geometries are
briefly reviewed from a new viewpoint presented in the paper. Examples of the
stress relaxation and creep of a homogeneous rod, cold drawing, and chemical
degradation in a tubing are discussed.
