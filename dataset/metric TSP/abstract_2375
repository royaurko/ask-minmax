In this paper we calculate the energy distribution E(r) associated with a
static spherically symmetric non-singular phantom black hole metric in
Einstein's prescription in general relativity. As required for Einstein
energy-momentum complex, we perform calculations in quasi-Cartesian
coordinates. We also calculate momentum components and get zero values as
expected from the geometry of the metric.
