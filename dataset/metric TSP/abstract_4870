Electrical communication between cardiomyocytes can be perturbed during
arrhythmia, but these perturbations are not captured by conventional
electrocardiographic metrics. We developed a theoretical framework to quantify
electrical communication using information theory metrics in 2-dimensional cell
lattice models of cardiac excitation propagation. The time series generated by
each cell was coarse-grained to 1 when excited or 0 when resting. The Shannon
entropy for each cell was calculated from the time series during four
clinically important heart rhythms: normal heartbeat, anatomical reentry,
spiral reentry, and multiple reentry. We also used mutual information to
perform spatial profiling of communication during these cardiac arrhythmias. We
found that information sharing between cells was spatially heterogeneous. In
addition, cardiac arrhythmia significantly impacted information sharing within
the heart. Entropy localized the path of the drifting core of spiral reentry,
which could be an optimal target of therapeutic ablation. We conclude that
information theory metrics can quantitatively assess electrical communication
among cardiomyocytes. The traditional concept of the heart as a functional
syncytium sharing electrical information cannot predict altered entropy and
information sharing during complex arrhythmia. Information theory metrics may
find clinical application in the identification of rhythm-specific treatments
which are currently unmet by traditional electrocardiographic techniques.
