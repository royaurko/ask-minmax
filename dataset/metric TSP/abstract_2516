We study the geodesics of the singularity free metric considered in the
preceding Paper I and show that they are complete. This once again demonstrates
the absence of singularity. The geodesic completeness is established in general
without reference to any particular matter distribution. The metric is globally
hyperbolic and causally stable. The question of inapplicability of the powerful
singularity theorems in this case is discussed.
