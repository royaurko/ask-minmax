A deformed Schwarzschild solution in noncommutative gauge theory of
gravitation is obtained. The gauge potentials (tetrad fields) are determined up
to the second order in the noncommutativity parameters $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$. A
deformed real metric is defined and its components are obtained. The
noncommutativity correction to the red shift test of General Relativity is
calculated and it is concluded that the correction is too small to have
observable effects. Implications of such a deformed Schwarzschild metric are
also mentioned.
