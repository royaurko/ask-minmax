We study compatible toric Sasaki metrics with constant scalar curvature on
co-oriented compact toric contact manifolds of Reeb type of dimension at least
5. These metrics come in rays of transversal homothety due to the possible
rescaling of the Reeb vector fields. We prove that there exist Reeb vector
fields for which the transversal Futaki invariant (restricted to the Lie
algebra of the torus) vanishes. Using existence result of [25], we show that a
co-oriented compact toric contact 5-manifold whose moment cone has 4 facets
admits a finite number of rays of transversal homothetic compatible toric
Sasaki metrics with constant scalar curvature. We point out a family of
well-known toric contact structures on $S^2\times S^3$ admitting two non
isometric and non transversally homothetic compatible toric Sasaki metrics with
constant scalar curvature.
