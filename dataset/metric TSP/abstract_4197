We prove an asymptotic analog of the classical Hurewicz theorem on mappings
which lower dimension. This theorem allows us to find sharp upper bound
estimates for the asymptotic dimension of groups acting on finite dimensional
metric spaces and allows us to prove a useful extension theorem for asymptotic
dimension. As applications we find upper bound estimates for the asymptotic
dimension of nilpoltent and polycyclic groups in terms of their Hirsch length.
We are also able to improve the known upper bounds on the asymptotic dimension
of fundamental groups of complexes of groups, amalgamated free products and the
hyperbolization of metric spaces possessing the Higson property.
