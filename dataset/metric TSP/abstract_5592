We construct linear network codes utilizing algebraic curves over finite
fields and certain associated Riemann-Roch spaces and present methods to obtain
their parameters.
  In particular we treat the Hermitian curve and the curves associated with the
Suzuki and Ree groups all having the maximal number of points for curves of
their respective genera.
  Linear network coding transmits information in terms of a basis of a vector
space and the information is received as a basis of a possibly altered vector
space. Ralf Koetter and Frank R. Kschischang
%\cite{DBLP:journals/tit/KoetterK08} introduced a metric on the set of vector
spaces and showed that a minimal distance decoder for this metric achieves
correct decoding if the dimension of the intersection of the transmitted and
received vector space is sufficiently large.
  The vector spaces in our construction have minimal distance bounded from
below in the above metric making them suitable for linear network coding.
