A derivation of the spectral determinant of the Schr\"odinger operator on a
metric graph is presented where the local matching conditions at the vertices
are of the general form classified according to the scheme of Kostrykin and
Schrader. To formulate the spectral determinant we first derive the spectral
zeta function of the Schr\"odinger operator using an appropriate secular
equation. The result obtained for the spectral determinant is along the lines
of the recent conjecture.
