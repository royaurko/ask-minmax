We generalize the observable diameter and the separation distance for metric
measure spaces to those for pyramids, and prove some limit formulas for these
invariants for a convergent sequence of pyramids. We obtain various
applications of our limit formulas as follows. We have a criterion of the phase
transition property for a sequence of metric measure spaces or pyramids, and
find some examples of symmetric spaces of noncompact type with the phase
transition property. We also give a simple proof of a theorem by Funano-Shioya
on the limit of an $N$-L\'evy family.
