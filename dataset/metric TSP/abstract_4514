This proceeding is based on a talk prepared for the XIII Marcell Grossmann
meeting. We summarise some results of work in progress in collaboration with
Giovanni Amelino-Camelia about momentum dependent (Rainbow) metrics in a
Relative Locality framework and we show that this formalism is equivalent to
the Hamiltonian formalization of Relative Locality obtained in arXiv:1102.4637.
