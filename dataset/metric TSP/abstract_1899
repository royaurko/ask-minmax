The metric describing a given finite sector of a four-dimensional
asymptotically anti-de Sitter wormhole can be transformed into the metric of
the time constant sections of a Tangherlini black hole in a five-dimensional
anti-de Sitter spacetime when one allows light cones to tip over on the
hypersurfaces according to the conservation laws of an one-kink. The resulting
kinked metric can be maximally extended, giving then rise to an instantonic
structure on the euclidean continuation of both the Tangherlini time and the
radial coordinate. In the semiclassical regime, this kink is related to the
existence of closed timelike curves.
