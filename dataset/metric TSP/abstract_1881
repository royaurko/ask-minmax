The sensitivity of all-sky searches for gravitational-wave pulsars is
primarily limited by the finite availability of computing resources.
Semicoherent searches are a widely-used method of maximizing sensitivity to
gravitational-wave pulsars at fixed computing cost: the data from a
gravitational-wave detector are partitioned into a number of segments, each
segment is coherently analyzed, and the analysis results from each segment are
summed together. The generation of template banks for the coherent analysis of
each segment, and for the summation, requires knowledge of the metrics
associated with the coherent and semicoherent parameter spaces respectively. We
present a useful approximation to the semicoherent parameter-space metric,
analogous to that presented in Wette and Prix [Phys. Rev. D 88, 123005 (2013)]
for the coherent metric. The new semicoherent metric is compared to previous
work in Pletsch [Phys. Rev. D 82, 042002 (2010)], and Brady and Creighton
[Phys. Rev. D 61, 082001 (2000)]. We find that semicoherent all-sky searches
require orders of magnitude more templates than previously predicted.
