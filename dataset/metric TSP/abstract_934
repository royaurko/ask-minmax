This paper has two purposes. First it partially extends the result in the
contributor's previous work concerning the asymptotic expansion of the Tian-Yau
metrics, by considering a slightly larger class of quasi-projective manifolds.
This text is also intended to provide a quick introductory reference to the
study of Ricci-flat metrics on open manifolds.
