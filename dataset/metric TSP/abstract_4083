We derive a new acoustic black hole metric from the Abelian Higgs model. In
the non-relativistic limit, while the Abelian Higgs model becomes the
Ginzburg-Landau model, the metric reduces to an ordinary Unruh type. We
investigate the possibility of using (type I and II) superconductors as the
acoustic black holes. We propose to realize experimental acoustic black holes
by using spiral vortices solutions from the Navier-stokes equation in the
non-relativistic classical fluids.
