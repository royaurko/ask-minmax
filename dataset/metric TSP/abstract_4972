A quantum-field model of the conformally flat space is formulated using a
standard field-theoretical technique, a probability interpretation and a way to
establish the classical limit. The starting point is the following: after
conformal transformation of the Einstein -- Hilbert action, the conformal
factor represents a scalar field with the negative kinetical term and the
self-interaction inspired by the cosmological constant. (It has been found that
quanta of such action have a negative value as a sequence of the negative
energy.) The metric energy-momentum tensor of this scalar field is proportional
to the Einstein tensor for the initial metric. Therefore, a vacuum state of the
field is treated as a classical space. In such vacuum the zero mode is a scale
factor of the flat Friedmann Universe. It is shown that conformal factor may be
viewed as a an inflaton field, and its small non-homogeneities represent gauge
invariant scalar metric perturbations.
