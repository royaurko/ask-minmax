We discuss the notion of \emph{uniform canonical bases}, both in an abstract
manner and specifically for the theory of atomless $L_p$ lattices. We also
discuss the connection between the definability of the set of uniform canonical
bases and the existence of the theory of beautiful pairs (i.e., with the finite
cover property), and prove in particular that the set of uniform canonical
bases is definable in algebraically closed metric valued fields.
