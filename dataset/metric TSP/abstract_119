An extra large metric is a spherical cone metric with all cone angles greater
than 2 pi and every closed geodesic longer than 2pi. We show that every
two-dimensional extra large metric can be triangulated with vertices at cone
points only. The argument implies the same result for Euclidean and hyperbolic
cone metrics, and can be modified to show a similar result for
higher-dimensional extra-large metrics. The extra-large hypothesis is
necessary.
