Explicit expressions for the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad for the quasi-Kerr
metric are given. These provide a very clear and simple example of the
quasi-Kinnersley tetrad, and may be useful in the future development of a
`quasi-Teukolsky' scheme for the analysis of perturbation equations in
spacetimes which are Petrov type I but in some sense close to type D.
