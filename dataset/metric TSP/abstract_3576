We examine the gravitational collapse of an infinite cylindrical distribution
of time like dust. In order to simplify the calculation we make an assumption
that the axial and azimuthal metric functions are equal. It is shown that the
resulting solution describes homogeneous collapse. We show that the interior
metric can be matched to a time dependent exterior. We also discuss the nature
of the singularity in the matter region and show that it is covered.
