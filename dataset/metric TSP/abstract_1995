We classify those curvature-homogeneous Einstein four-manifolds, of all
metric signatures, which have a complex-diagonalizable curvature operator. They
all turn out to be locally homogeneous. More precisely, any such manifold must
be either locally symmetric or locally isometric to a suitable Lie group with a
left-invariant metric. To show this we explicitly determine the possible
local-isometry types of manifolds that have the properties named above, but are
not locally symmetric.
