We study the temperature of extended objects in string theory. Rotating
D-branes in warped Calabi-Yau throats have induced metrics with thermal
horizons and Hawking temperatures a la Unruh effect. We solve the equations of
motion for slow rotating probe branes and derive their induced metrics in the
UV/IR solutions of warped conifold throats. Our analysis shows that horizons
and temperatures of expected features form on the world volume of the rotating
probe brane in terms of conserved charges in the UV solutions of the conifold
throat. In certain limits, we find world volume horizons and temperatures of
the form similar to those of rotating probes in the AdS throat.
