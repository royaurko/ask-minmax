This article is about a measurement analysis based approach to help software
practitioners in managing the additional level complexities and variabilities
in software product line applications. The architecture of the proposed
approach i.e. ZAC is designed and implemented to perform preprocessesed source
code analysis, calculate traditional and product line metrics and visualize
results in two and three dimensional diagrams. Experiments using real time data
sets are performed which concluded with the results that the ZAC can be very
helpful for the software practitioners in understanding the overall structure
and complexity of product line applications. Moreover the obtained results
prove strong positive correlation between calculated traditional and product
line measures.
