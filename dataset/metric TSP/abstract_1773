We construct a class of closed timelike curves (CTCs) using a compactified
extra dimension $u$. A nonzero metric element $g_{tu}(u)$ enables particles to
travel backwards in global time $t$. The compactified dimension guarantees that
the geodesic curve closes in $u$. The effective 2D ($t$ and $u$) nature of the
metric ensures that spacetime is flat, therein satisfying all the classical
stability conditions as expressed by the energy conditions. Finally,
stationarity of the metric guarantees that a particle's energy is conserved.
The pathologies that plague many hypothesized metrics admitting CTCs, e.g. an
infinite cylinder of matter, a negative energy-distribution, particle
acceleration/blue-shifting along the CTC, do not occur within our metric class.
