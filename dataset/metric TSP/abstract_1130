We study the validity of a partition property known as weak indivisibility
for the integer and the rational Urysohn metric spaces. We also compare weak
indivisiblity to another partition property, called age-indivisibility, and
provide an example of a countable ultrahomogeneous metric space which may be
age-indivisible but not weakly indivisible.
