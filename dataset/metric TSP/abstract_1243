In this paper, we study locally projectively flat Finsler metrics with
constant flag curvature ${\bf K}$. We prove those are totally determined by
their behaviors at the origin by solving some nonlinear PDEs. The
classifications when ${\bf K}=0$, ${\bf K}=-1$ and ${\bf K} =1$ are given
respectively in an algebraic way. Further, we construct a new projectively flat
Finsler metric with flag curvature ${\bf K}=1$ determined by a Minkowskian norm
with double square roots at the origin. As an application of our main theorems,
we give the classification of locally projectively flat spherical symmetric
Finsler metrics much easier than before. ----Comments are welcome.
