A Smarandache multi-space is a union of $n$ spaces $A_1,A_2,..., A_n$ with
some additional conditions holding. Combining Smarandache multi-spaces with
classical metric spaces, the conception of multi-metric space is introduced.
Some characteristics of a multi-metric space are obtained and Banach's
fixed-point theorem is generalized in this paper.
