We study approximately differentiable functions on metric measure spaces
admitting a Cheeger differentiable structure. The main result is a Whitney-type
characterization of approximately differentiable functions in this setting. As
an application, we prove a Stepanov-type theorem and consider approximate
differentiability of Sobolev, BV and maximal functions.
