The first part I talk about the motivation for Lu Qi-Keng conjecture and the
results about the presence or absence of zeroes of the Bergman kernel function
of a bounded domain in ${\bf{C^n}}$. The second part I summarize the main
results on Hua domains, such as the explicit Bergman kernel function,
comparison theorem for the invariant metrics, explicit complete
Einstein-K\"ahler metrics, the equivalence between the Einstein-K\"ahler metric
and the Bergman metric etc.
