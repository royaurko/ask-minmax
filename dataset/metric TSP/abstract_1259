We study properties of Sobolev-type metrics on the space of immersed plane
curves. We show that the geodesic equation for Sobolev-type metrics with
constant coefficients of order 2 and higher is globally well-posed for smooth
initial data as well as initial data in certain Sobolev spaces. Thus the space
of closed plane curves equipped with such a metric is geodesically complete. We
find lower bounds for the geodesic distance in terms of curvature and its
derivatives.
