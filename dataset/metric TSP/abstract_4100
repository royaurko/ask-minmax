In this paper, we study a kernel smoothing approach for denoising a tensor
field. Particularly, both simulation studies and theoretical analysis are
conducted to understand the effects of the noise structure and the structure of
the tensor field on the performance of different smoothers arising from using
different metrics, viz., Euclidean, log-Euclidean and affine invariant metrics.
We also study the Rician noise model and compare two regression estimators of
diffusion tensors based on raw diffusion weighted imaging data at each voxel.
