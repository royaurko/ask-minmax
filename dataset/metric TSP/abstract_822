A reference frame consists of: a reference space, a time scale and a spatial
metric. The geometric structure induced by these objects in spacetime is
developed. The existence of a class of spatial metrics that are rigid, have
free mobility and can be derived as a slight deformation of the radar metric,
is shown.
