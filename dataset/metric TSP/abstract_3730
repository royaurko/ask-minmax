A Sasakian structure on a manifold is called {\it positive} if its basic
first Chern class can be represented by a positive (1,1)-form with respect to
its transverse holomorphic CR-structure. We prove a theorem that says that
every positive Sasakian structure can be deformed to a Sasakian structure whose
metric has positive Ricci curvature. This allows us by example to give a
completely independent proof of a result of Sha and Yang [SY] that for every
positive integer k the k-fold connected sum of $S^2\times S^3$ admits metrics
of positive Ricci curvature.
