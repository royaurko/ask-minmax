In this paper we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the Kobayashi
metric on a convex domain to be Gromov hyperbolic. In particular we show that
for convex domains with $C^\infty$ boundary being of finite type in the sense
of D'Angelo is equivalent to the Gromov hyperbolicity of the Kobayashi metric.
We also show that bounded domains which are locally convexifiable and have
finite type in the sense of D'Angelo have Gromov hyperbolic Kobayashi metric.
The proofs use ideas from the theory of the Hilbert metric.
