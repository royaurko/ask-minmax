In this paper we prove that the space of flat metrics (nonpositively curved
Euclidean cone metrics) on a closed, oriented surface is marked length
spectrally rigid. In other words, two flat metrics assigning the same lengths
to all closed curves differ by an isometry isotopic to the identity. The novel
proof suggests a stronger rigidity result for flat metrics.
