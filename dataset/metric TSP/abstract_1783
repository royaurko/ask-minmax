Given an effectively parameterized family $f:X\to S$ of canonically polarized
manifolds, the K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on the fibers induce a hermitian
metric on the relative canonical bundle $K_{X/S}$. We use a global elliptic
equation to show that this metric is strictly positive everywhere and give
estimates.
  The direct images $R^{n-p}f_*\Omega^p_{X/S}(K_{X/S}^{\otimes m})$, $m > 0$,
carry induced natural hermitian metrics. We prove an explicit formula for the
curvature tensor of these direct images with estimates, which implies
Nakano-positivity for $p=n$.
  The Kodaira-Spencer map induces morphisms $S^p\mathcal T_S \to R^p
f_*\Lambda^p T_{X/S}$. For a suitable value of $p$ (and $\dim S=1$) a natural
hermitian metric on $T_S$ of negative curvature is induced. A differential
geometric proof for hyperbolicity properties of the moduli space follows.
