We study the existence and cardinality of normal geodesics of different
causal types on H(eisenberg)-type quaternion group equipped with the
sub-Lorentzian metric. We present explicit formulas for geodesics and describe
reachable sets by geodesics of different causal character. We compare results
with the sub-Riemannian quaternion group and with the sub-Lorentzian Heisenberg
group, showing that there are similarities and distinctions. We show that the
geodesics on H-type quaternion groups with the sub-Lorentzian metric satisfy
the equations describing the motion of a relativistic particle in a constant
homogeneous electromagnetic field.
