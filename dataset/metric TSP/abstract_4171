This paper extends the theory of turbulence of Hjorth to certain classes of
equivalence relations that cannot be induced by Polish actions. It applies this
theory to analyze the quasi-isometry relation and finite Gromov-Hausdorff
distance relation in the space of isometry classes of pointed proper metric
spaces, called the Gromov space.
