The aim of this article is to present a topological tool for the study of
additive basis in additive number theory. It will be proposal a metric for the
set of all additive basis, in which it will be possible to study properties of
some additive bases studying basis near the chosen basis. This metric allow,
for example, detect some additive basis in which we can add some integers in it
without change its order.
