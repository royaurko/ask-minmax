The moduli space describing the low-energy dynamics of BPS multi-monopoles
for several charge configurations is presented. We first prove the conjectured
form of the moduli space of $n-1$ distinct monopoles in a spontaneously broken
SU(n) gauge theory. We further propose the solution where one of the charge
components has two units, hence asymptotically corresponds to embeddings of two
monopoles of one charge type and the rest different. The latter hyperk\"ahler
metrics possess features of the two-monopole Atiyah-Hitchin metric. We also
conjecture classes of solutions to multi-monopole moduli spaces with arbitrary
charge and no more than two units in each component, which models the gluing
together of Atiyah-Hitchin metrics. Our approach here uses the generalized
Legendre transform technique to find the new hyperk\"ahler manifolds and
rederive previously conjectured ones.
