It is believed that the basic component of the central engine of quasars,
micro-quasars, and energetic Gamma Ray Bursts are the rotating or the Kerr
Black Holes (BH)[1]. But by using a generic property[2-4] of the metric
components of a stationary axisymmertic rotating metric in its standard form},
namely, g_phi \phi = sin^2 theta g_theta theta, where phi is the azimuth angle
and theta is the polar angle measured from the axis of symmetry, we have found
the unexpected and surprising result that (i) in order to have a mass of a Kerr
BH m ge 0, it is necessary that its rotation parameter a=0 and if one insists
for an a ge 0, one must have m le 0! Thus if the suspected Black Hole
candidates with m >0 are really rotating they cannot be BHs at all which is in
agreement with some detailed analysis of recent observations[5-8]. However, if
it is assumed that such objects are strictly non-rotating, they could be
non-rotating Schwarzschild BHs (a=0) with m ge 0 if we ignore the physical
difficulties associated with the existence of such objects. This result calls
for new theoretical efforts to understand a vast range of astrophysical
phenomenon. If one derives the Kerr Metric in a straightforward manner by using
the Backlund transformation, it is seen that a=m sin phi. This relationship
confirms that a=m=0 for Kerr BHs.
