This letter deals with an analysis of the space-time static metric that
corresponds to a quintessential state equation with constant characteristic
parameter. Following a procedure parallel to as it is used in the case of de
Sitter space, we have tried to generalize the metric components that correspond
to the quintessential case to also embrace black-hole terms and shown that this
is not possible. We argue therefore that, in the absence of a cosmological
constant, black holes seem to be prevented in a cosmological space-time which
is asymptotically accelerating when the acceleration is driven by a
quintessence-like field.
