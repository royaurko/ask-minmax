It is a well-known fact that on a bounded spectral interval the Dirac
spectrum can be described locally by a non-decreasing sequence of continuous
functions of the Riemannian metric. In the present article we extend this
result to a global version. We think of the spectrum of a Dirac operator as a
function from the integers to the reals and endow the space of all spectra with
an arsinh-uniform metric. We prove that the spectrum of the Dirac operator
depends continuously on the Riemannian metric. As a corollary, we obtain the
existence of a non-decreasing family of functions on the space of all
Riemannian metrics, which represents the entire Dirac spectrum at any metric.
We also show that in general these functions do not descend to the space of
Riemannian metrics modulo spin diffeomorphisms due to spectral flow.
