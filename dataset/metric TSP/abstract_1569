Extensive numerical integration results lead us to conjecture that the silver
mean, that is, s = \sqrt{2}-1 = .414214 plays a fundamental role in certain
geometries (those given by monotone metrics) imposable on the 15-dimensional
convex set of two-qubit systems. For example, we hypothesize that the volume of
separable two-qubit states, as measured in terms of (four times) the minimal
monotone or Bures metric is s/3, and 10s in terms of (four times) the Kubo-Mori
monotone metric. Also, we conjecture, in terms of (four times) the Bures
metric, that that part of the 14-dimensional boundary of separable states
consisting generically of rank-four 4 x 4 density matrices has volume
(``hyperarea'') 55s/39 and that part composed of rank-three density matrices,
43s/39, so the total boundary hyperarea would be 98s/39. While the Bures
probability of separability (0.07334) dominates that (0.050339) based on the
Wigner-Yanase metric (and all other monotone metrics) for rank-four states, the
Wigner-Yanase (0.18228) strongly dominates the Bures (0.03982) for the
rank-three states.
