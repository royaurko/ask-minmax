A maximally reduced system of equations corresponding to the twisting type N
Einstein metrics is given. When the cosmological constant $\lambda\to 0$ they
reduce to the standard equations for the vacuum twisting type N's. All the
metrics which are conformally equivalent to the twisting type N metrics and
which admit 3-dimensional conformal group of symmetries are presented. In the
Feferman class of metrics an example is given of a twisting type N metric which
satisfies Bach's equations but is not Einstein.
