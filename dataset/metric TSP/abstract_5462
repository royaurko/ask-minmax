Open Source Software (OSS) Projects are gaining popularity worldwide. Studies
by many researchers show that the important key success factor is modularity of
the source code. This paper presents the revised Modularity Index which is a
software metrics to measure the modularity level of a javabased OSS Projects.
To show its effectiveness in analyzing OSS Project, the Modularity Index and
its supporting software metrics are then used to analyze the evolution of
Freemind mind mapping OSS Project. The analysis using Modularity Index and its
supporting metrics shows the strength and weaknesses of the Freemind OSS
Projects.
