In this note we study the structure of Lipschitz-free Banach spaces. We show
that every Lipschitz-free Banach space over an infinite metric space contains a
complemented copy of $\ell_1$. This result has many consequences for the
structure of Lipschitz-free Banach spaces. Moreover, we give an example of a
countable compact metric space $K$ such that $F(K)$ is not isomorphic to a
subspace of $L_1$ and we show that whenever $M$ is a subset of $R^n$, then
$F(M)$ is weakly sequentially complete; in particular, $c_0$ does not embed
into $F(M)$.
