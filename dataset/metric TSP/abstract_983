In this work we provide a way to introduce a probability measure on the space
of minimal fillings of finite additive metric spaces as well as an algorithm
for its computation. The values of probability, got from the analytical
solution, coincide with the computer simulation for the computed cases. Also
the built technique makes possible to find the asymptotic of the ratio for
families of graph structures.
