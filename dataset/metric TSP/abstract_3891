We develop a new model of a spinning particle in Brans-Dicke spacetime using
a metric-compatible connection with torsion. The particle's spin vector is
shown to be Fermi-parallel (by the Levi-Civita connection) along its worldline
(an autoparallel of the metric-compatible connection) when neglecting
spin-curvature coupling.
