We introduce the \emph{metric spectrum}, which measures the exponential rate
of approximation to an isolated invariant set of points starting in its stable
set, and relate it to the Lyapunov spectrum. We determine the metric spectrum
of each Morse component of the finest Morse decomposition of a linear induced
flow on a generalized flag manifold.
