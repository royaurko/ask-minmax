A canonical hyperkaehler metric on the total space $T^*M$ of a cotangent
bundle to a complex manifold $M$ has been constructed recently by the contributor
(see alg-geom/9710026). This paper presents the results of alg-geom/9710026 in
a streamlined and simplified form. The only new result is an explicit formula
obtained for the case when $M$ is an Hermitian symmetric space.
