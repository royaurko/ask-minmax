Texts exhibit considerable stylistic variation. This paper reports an
experiment where a corpus of documents (N= 75 000) is analyzed using various
simple stylistic metrics. A subset (n = 1000) of the corpus has been previously
assessed to be relevant for answering given information retrieval queries. The
experiment shows that this subset differs significantly from the rest of the
corpus in terms of the stylistic metrics studied.
