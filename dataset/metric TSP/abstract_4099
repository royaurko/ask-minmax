Considering the Teichm\"uller space of a surface equipped with Thurston's
Lipschitz metric, we study geodesic segments whose endpoints have bounded
combinatorics. We show that these geodesics are cobounded, and that the
closest-point projection to these geodesics is strongly contracting.
Consequently, these geodesics are stable. Our main tool is to show that one can
get a good estimate for the Lipschitz distance by considering the length ratio
of finitely many curves.
