We partially confirm an old conjecture of Donaldson that if there exists a
cscK metrics in a given K\"ahler class, then there is no degenerated geodesic
ray which is tamed by a bounded ambient geometry unless it parallels to a
holomorphic line consists of cscK metrics only. We also prove that for simple
test configuration where the central fibre has a cscK metric, the K energy
functionals in the nearby fibre must also have a uniform lower bound in its
underlying K\"ahler class.
