We demonstrate how one should transform correctly quasi-isotropic coordinates
to Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates in order to compare the metric around a rotating
star that has been constructed numerically in the former coordinates with an
axially symmetric stationary metric that is given through an analytical form in
the latter coordinates. Since a stationary metric associated with an isolated
object that is built numerically partly refers to a non-vacuum solution
(interior of the star) the transformation of its coordinates to Weyl-Papapetrou
coordinates, which are usually used to describe vacuum axisymmetric and
stationary solutions of Einstein equations, is not straightforward in the
non-vacuum region. If this point is \textit{not} taken into consideration, one
may end up to erroneous conclusions about how well a specific analytical metric
matches the metric around the star, due to fallacious coordinate
transformations.
