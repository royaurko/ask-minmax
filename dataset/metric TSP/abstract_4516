We consider (locally) energy finite coordinates associated with a strongly
local regular Dirichlet form on a metric measure space. We give coordinate
formulas for substitutes of tangent spaces, for gradient and divergence
operators and for the infinitesimal generator. As examples we discuss Euclidean
spaces, Riemannian local charts, domains on the Heisenberg group and the
measurable Riemannian geometry on the Sierpinski gasket.
