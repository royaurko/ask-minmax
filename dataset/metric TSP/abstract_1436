We construct infinitely many seven-dimensional Einstein metrics of weak
holonomy G_2. These metrics are defined on principal SO(3) bundles over
four-dimensional Bianchi IX orbifolds with the Tod-Hitchin metrics. The
Tod-Hitchin metric has an orbifold singularity parameterized by an integer, and
is shown to be similar near the singularity to the Taub-NUT de Sitter metric
with a special charge. We show, however, that the seven-dimensional metrics on
the total space are actually smooth. The geodesics on the weak G_2 manifolds
are discussed. It is shown that the geodesic equation is equivalent to the
Hamiltonian equation of an interacting rigid body system. We also discuss
M-theory on the product space of AdS_4 and the seven-dimensional manifolds, and
the dual gauge theories in three-dimensions.
