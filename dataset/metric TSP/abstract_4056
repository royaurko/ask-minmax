This paper presents a new metric and studies slowly rotating Gauss-Bonnet
black holes with one nonvanishing angular momentum in five dimensional anti-de
Sitter spaces. Taking the angular momentum parameter $a$ up to second order,
the slowly rotating black hole solutions are obtained by working directly in
the action. In addition, it also finds that this method is applicable in higher
order Lovelock gravity.
