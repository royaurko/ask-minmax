In this paper we prove the metric approximation property for variable
exponent Lebesgue spaces, study the concept of nuclearity on such spaces and
apply it to trace formulae such as the Grothendieck-Lidskii formula. We apply
the obtained results to derive criteria for nuclearity and trace formulae for
periodic operators on R^n.
