It is shown that a Banach space admits an equivalent norm whose modulus of
uniform convexity has power-type p if and only if it is Markov p-convex.
Counterexamples are constructed to natural questions related to isomorphic
uniform convexity of metric spaces, showing in particular that tree metrics
fail to have the dichotomy property.
