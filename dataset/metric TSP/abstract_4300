Given a metric space $(X,d)$, the wobbling group of $X$ is the group of
bijections $g:X\rightarrow X$ satisfying $\sup\limits_{x\in X}
d(g(x),x)<\infty$. We study algebraic and analytic properties of $W(X)$ in
relation with the metric space structure of $X$, such as amenability of the
action of the lamplighter group $ \bigoplus_{X} \mathbf Z/2\mathbf Z \rtimes
W(X)$ on $\bigoplus_{X} \mathbf Z/2\mathbf Z$ and property (T).
