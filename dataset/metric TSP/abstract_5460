We show for a given metric space $(X,d)$ of asymptotic dimension $n$ that
there exists a coarsely and topologically equivalent hyperbolic metric $d'$ of
the form $d' = f \circ d$ such that $(X,d')$ is of asymptotic Assouad-Nagata
dimension $n$. As a corollary we construct examples of spaces realising strict
inequality in the logarithmic law for AN-asdim of a Cartesian product. One of
them may be viewed as a counterexample to a specific kind of a Morita-type
theorem for AN-asdim.
