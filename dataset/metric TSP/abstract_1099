In this paper we study a Riemanian metric on the tangent bundle $T(M)$ of a
Riemannian manifold $M$ which generalizes the Cheeger Gromoll metric and a
compatible almost complex structure which together with the metric confers to
$T(M)$ a structure of locally conformal almost K\"ahlerian manifold. We found
conditions under which $T(M)$ is almost K\"ahlerian, locally conformal
K\"ahlerian or K\"ahlerian or when $T(M)$ has constant sectional curvature or
constant scalar curvature.
