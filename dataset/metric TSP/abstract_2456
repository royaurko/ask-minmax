A homogeneous two-dimensional metric including the degrees of freedom of
Teichm\"uller deformation is developed. The Teichm\"uller deformation is
incorporated by affine stretching of complex structure. According to Yamada's
investigation by pinching parameter, concrete formulation for a higher genus
Riemann surface can be realized. We will have a homogeneous standard metric
including the dynamical degrees of freedom as Teichm\"uller deformation in a
leading order of the pinching parameter, which would be treated as homogeneous
anisotropic metric for a double torus universe, which satisfy momentum
constraints.
