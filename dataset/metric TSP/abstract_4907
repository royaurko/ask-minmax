The Schwarzchild solution insertion in an expanding universe, the so-called
"Swiss cheese model," is shown to possess a very unphysical property.
Specifically, in this model some trajectories are discontinuous functions of
their initial conditions. An alternate metric is proposed as a remedy. It goes
smoothly between the Schwarzchild exterior solution and the Friedmann-Lemaitre,
expanding universe metric. It is further shown that the effects of the
expansion on planetary motions in the solar system are too small to be
currently observed for this alternate metric.
