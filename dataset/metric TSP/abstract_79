We study the Lipschitz metric on Teichmuller space (defined by Thurston) and
compare it with the Teichmuller metric. We show that in the thin part of
Teichmuller space the Lipschitz metric is approximated up to bounded additive
distortion by the sup metric on a product of lower-dimensional spaces (similar
to the Teichmuller metric as shown by Minsky), and in the thick part, the two
metrics are comparable within additive error. However, these metrics are not
comparable in general; we construct a sequence of pairs of points in
Teichmuller space whose distances approach zero in the Lipschitz metric while
they approach infinity in the Teichmuller metric.
