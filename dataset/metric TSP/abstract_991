We give a positive answer to the question of Shkarin (\cite{Sk}) whether
there exists a metrically universal abelian separable group equipped with
invariant metric.
  Our construction also gives an example of a group structure on the Urysohn
universal space that is substantially different from the previously known
examples.
  Under some cardinal arithmetic assumptions, our results generalize to higher
cardinalities.
