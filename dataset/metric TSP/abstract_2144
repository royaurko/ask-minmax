In this note, we propose an approach to the study of the analogue for
unipotent harmonic bundles of Schmid's Nilpotent Orbit Theorem. Using this
approach, we construct harmonic metrics on unipotent bundles over quasi-compact
K\"ahler manifolds with carefully controlled asymptotics near the compactifying
divisor; such a metric is unique up to some isometry. Such an asymptotic
behavior is canonical in some sense.
