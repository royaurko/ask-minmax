Let U be a universal covering of a connected nonsingular projective variety X
with large and residually finite fundamental group. We construct metrics on U
and provide another version of the uniformization theorem, namely: if the
fundamental group of X is, in addition, nonamenable then U is a bounded Stein
domain. The Appendix contains a proof of the Shafarevich conjecture provided
the fundamental group is residually finite.
