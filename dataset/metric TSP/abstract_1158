The paper develops the Finsler-like geometry on the 1-jet space for the jet
conformal Minkowski (JCM) metric, which naturally extends the Minkowski metric
in the Chernov-Pavlov framework. To this aim there are determined the nonlinear
connection, distinguished (d-) Cartan linear connection, d-torsions and
d-curvatures. The field geometrical gravitational and electromagnetic d-models
based on the JCM metric are discussed.
