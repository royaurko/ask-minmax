Metric variation of higher order theory of gravity requires to fix the Ricci
scalar in addition to the metric tensor at the boundary. Fixing Ricci scalar at
the boundary implies that the classical solutions are fixed once and forever to
the de-Sitter or anti de-Sitter solutions. Here, we justify such requirement
from the standpoint of Noether Symmetry.
