We prove a Gauss-Bonnet theorem for (finite coverings of) moduli spaces of
Riemann surfaces endowed with the McMullen metric. The proof uses properties of
an exhaustion of moduli spaces by compact submanifolds with corners and the
Gauss-Bonnet formula of Allendoerfer and Weil for Riemannian polyhedra.
