Spherical localisation is a technique whose history goes back to M.Gromov and
V.Milman. It's counterpart, the Euclidean localisation is extensively studied
and has been put to great use in various branches of mathematics. The purpose
of this paper is to quickly introduce spherical localisation, as well as
demonstrate some of its applications in convex and metric geometry.
