A large number of metrics have been proposed for the quality of object
oriented software. Many of these metrics have not been properly validated due
to poor methods of validation and non acceptance of metrics on scientific
grounds. In the literature, two types of validations namely internal
(theoretical) and external (empirical) are recommended. In this study, the
contributors have used both theoretical as well as empirical validation for
validating already proposed set of metrics for the five quality factors. These
metrics were proposed by Kumar and Soni.
