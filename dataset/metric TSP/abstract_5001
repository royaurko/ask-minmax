It is shown that the general belief that the frequency and the absolute value
of the velocity of periodic signals sent by a standard emitter do not change on
the world line of the emitter needs to be revised and new conditions for the
existence of a calibrted standard emitter should be taken into account. The
notions of a standard clock and of a calibrated standard clock are introduced
in a space with affine connections and metrics. The variation of the velocity
and of the frequency of a standard clock could be compared with the constant
velocity and the constant frequency of a calibrated standard clock along the
world line of the observer. This calibrated standard clock is transported by
meand of a generalized Fermi-Walker transport along the same world line of the
observer. Some remarks about the synchronization of standard clocks in spaces
with affine connections and metrics are given. PACS numbers: 95.30.Sf;
