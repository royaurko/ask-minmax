Consider a compact K\"ahler manifold X with a simple normal crossing divisor
D, and define Poincar\'e type metrics on X\D as K\"ahler metrics on X\D with
cusp singularities along D. We prove that the existence of a constant scalar
curvature (resp. an extremal) Poincar\'e type K\"ahler metric on X\D implies
the existence of a constant scalar curvature (resp. an extremal) K\"ahler
metric, possibly of Poincar\'e type, on every component of D. We also show that
when the divisor is smooth, the constant scalar curvature/extremal metric on
X\D is asymptotically a product near the divisor.
