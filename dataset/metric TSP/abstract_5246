This paper is devoted to the analysis of metric measure spaces satisfying
locally the curvature-dimension condition CD(K,N) introduced by the second
contributor and also studied by Lott & Villani. We prove that the local version of
CD(K,N) is equivalent to a global condition CD*(K,N), slightly weaker than the
(usual, global) curvature-dimension condition. This so-called reduced
curvature-dimension condition CD*(K,N) has the local-to-global property. We
also prove the tensorization property for CD*(K,N). As an application we
conclude that the fundamental group of a metric measure space (M,d,m) is finite
whenever it satisfies locally the curvature-dimension condition CD(K,N) with
positive K and finite N.
