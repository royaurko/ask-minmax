The metric of arbitrary dimensional Schwarzschild black hole in the
background of Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe is presented in the cosmic
coordinates system. In particular, the arbitrary dimensional Schwarzschild-de
Sitter metric is rewritten in the Schwarzschild coordinates system and basing
on which the even more generalized higher dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter
metric with another extra dimensions is found. The generalized solution shows
that the cosmological constant may roots in the extra dimensions of space.
