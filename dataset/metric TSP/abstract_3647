Reconsidering the harmonic space description of the self-dual Einstein
equations, we streamline the proof that all self-dual pure gravitational fields
allow a local description in terms of an unconstrained analytic prepotential in
harmonic space. Our formulation yields a simple recipe for constructing
self-dual metrics starting from any explicit choice of such prepotential; and
we illustrate the procedure by producing a metric related to the Taub-NUT
solution from the simplest monomial choice of prepotential.
