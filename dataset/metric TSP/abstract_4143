We consider harmonic functions of polynomial growth of some order $d$ on
Cayley graphs of groups of polynomial volume growth of order $D$ w.r.t. the
word metric and prove the optimal estimate for the dimension of the space of
such harmonic functions. More precisely, the dimension of this space of
harmonic functions is at most of order $d^{D-1}$. As in the already known
Riemannian case, this estimate is polynomial in the growth degree. More
generally, our techniques also apply to graphs roughly isometric to Cayley
graphs of groups of polynomial volume growth.
