We consider an alloy type potential on an infinite metric graph. We assume a
covering condition on the single site potentials. For random Schr\"odingers
operator associated with the alloy type potential restricted to finite volume
subgraphs we prove a Wegner estimate which reproduces the modulus of continuity
of the single site distribution measure. The Wegner constant is independent of
the energy.
