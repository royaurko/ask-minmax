A topological space is nonseparably connected if it is connected but all of
its connected separable subspaces are singletons. We show that each connected
sequential topological space X is the image of a nonseparably connected
complete metric space Eco(X) under a monotone quotient map. The metric d of the
space Eco(X) is economical in the sense that for each infinite subspace A of X
the cardinality of the set {d(a,b):a,b in A} does not exceed the density of A.
The construction of the space Eco(X) determines a functor Eco from the category
Top of topological spaces and their continuous maps into the category Metr of
metric spaces and their non-expanding maps.
