Let $M^4$ be a PL-manifold of nonnegative curvature that is homeomorphic to a
product of two spheres, $S^2 \times S^2$. We prove that $M$ is a direct metric
product of two spheres endowed with some polyhedral metrics. In other words,
$M$ is a direct metric product of the surfaces of two convex polyhedra in
$\mathbb{R}^3$.
  The background for the question is the following. The classical H.Hopf's
hypothesis states: for any Riemannian metric on $S^2 \times S^2$ of nonnegative
sectional curvature the curvature cannot be strictly positive at all points.
There is no quick answer to this question: it is known that a Riemannian metric
on $S^2 \times S^2$ of nonnegative sectional curvature need not be a product
metric. However, M.Gromov has pointed out that the condition of nonnegative
curvature in the PL-case appears to be stronger than nonnegative sectional
curvature of Riemannian manifolds and analogous to some condition on the
curvature operator. So the motivation for the question addressed in this text
is to settle the PL-version of the Hopf's hypothesis.
