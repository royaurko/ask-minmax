In 1996, Shi generalized the epsilon-regularity theorem of Schoen and
Uhlenbeck to energy-minimizing harmonic maps from a domain equipped with a
bounded measurable Riemannian metric. In the present work we prove a
compactness result for such energy-minimizing maps. As an application, we
combine our result with Shi's theorem to give an improved bound on the
Hausdorff dimension of the singular set, assuming that the map has bounded
energy at all scales. This last assumption can be removed when the target
manifold is simply-connected.
