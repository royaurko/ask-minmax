For a nonconstant holomorphic map between projective Riemann surfaces with
conformal metrics, we consider invariant Schwarzian derivatives and projective
Schwarzian derivatives of general virtual order. We show that these two
quantities are related by the "Schwarzian derivative" of the metrics of the
surfaces (at least for the case of virtual orders 2 and 3). As an application,
we give univalence criteria for a meromorphic function on the unit disk in
terms of the projective Schwarzian derivative of virtual order 3.
