In this paper, the exact vacuum solution of a general plane symmetric
spacetime is investigated in metric f(R) gravity with the assumption of
constant Ricci scalar. For this solution, we have studied the generalized
Landau-Lifshitz energy-momentum complex in this theory to determine the energy
distribution expressions for some specific f(R) models. Also, we show that
these models satisfy the constant curvature condition.
