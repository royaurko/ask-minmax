In this report, we study within the context of general relativity with one
extra dimension compactified either on a circle or an orbifold, how radion
fluctuations interact with metric fluctuations in the three non-compact
directions. The background is non-singular and can either describe an extra
dimension on its way to stabilization, or immediately before and after a series
of non-singular bounces. We find that the metric fluctuations transfer
undisturbed through the bounces or through the transients of the
pre-stabilization epoch. Our background is obtained by considering the effects
of a gas of massless string modes in the context of a consistent 'massless
background' (or low energy effective theory) limit of string theory. We discuss
applications to various approaches to early universe cosmology, including the
ekpyrotic/cyclic universe scenario and string gas cosmology.
