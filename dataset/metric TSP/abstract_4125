This is a condensed form of the contributor's essay, which can be found at
[arXiv:1105.2883]. We prove that the entropic measure constructed by von
Renesse-Sturm over Wasserstein space on the unit interval (probability measures
on the unit interval equipped with the 2-Wasserstein metric) does not admit
generalized Ricci lower bounds in the sense of Lott-Villani-Sturm. We discuss
why this is surprising, considering various heuristic arguments.
