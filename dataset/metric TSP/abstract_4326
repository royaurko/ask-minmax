We construct an action for double field theory using a metric connection that
is compatible with both the generalised metric and the O_{D,D} structure. The
connection is simultaneously torsionful and flat. Using this connection one may
construct a proper covariant derivative for double field theory. We then write
the doubled action in terms of the generalised torsion of this connection. This
action then exactly reproduces that required for doubled field theory and
gauged supergravity.
