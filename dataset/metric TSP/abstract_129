Kirk and Shahzad have recently given fixed point theorems concerning local
radial contractions and metric transforms. In this article, we replace the
metric transforms by metric-preserving functions. This in turn gives several
extensions of the main results given by Kirk and Shahzad. Several examples are
given. The fixed point sets of metric transforms and metric-preserving
functions are also investigated.
