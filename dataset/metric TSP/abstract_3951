Higher-dimensional Thompson's groups nV are finitely presented groups
described by Brin which generalize dyadic self-maps of the unit interval to
dyadic self-maps of n-dimensional unit cubes. We describe some of the metric
properties of higher-dimensional Thompson's groups. We give descriptions of
elements based upon tree-pair diagrams and give upper and lower bounds for word
length in terms of the size of the diagrams. Though these upper and lower
bounds are somewhat separated, we show that there are elements realizing the
lower bounds and that the fraction of elements which are close to the upper
bound converges to 1, showing that the bounds are optimal and that the upper
bound is generically achieved.
