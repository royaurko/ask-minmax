It is known that cyclic configurations of a planar polygonal linkage are
critical points of the signed area function. In the paper, we announce an
explicit formula of the Morse index for the signed area of a cyclic
configuration. It depends not only on the combinatorics of a cyclic
configuration, but also includes some metric characterization.
