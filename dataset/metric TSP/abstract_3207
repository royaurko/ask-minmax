We study the action of the elements of the mapping class group of a surface
of finite type on the Teichm\"uller space of that surface equipped with
Thurston's asymmetric metric. We classify such actions as elliptic, parabolic,
hyperbolic and pseudo-hyperbolic, depending on whether the translation distance
of such an element is zero or positive and whether the value of this
translation distance is attained or not, and we relate these four types to
Thurston's classification of mapping classes. The study is parallel to the one
made by Bers in the setting of Teichm\"uller space equipped with
Teichm\"uller's metric, and to the one made by Daskalopoulos and Wentworth in
the setting of Teichm\"uller space equipped with the Weil-Petersson metric.
