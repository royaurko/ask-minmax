A simple modification to Einstein's theory of gravity in terms of a
non-Riemannian connection is examined. A new tensor-variational approach yields
field equations that possess a covariance similar to the gauge covariance of
electromagnetism. These equations are shown to possess solutions analogous to
those found in the Einstein-Maxwell system. In particular one finds
gravi-electric and gravi-magnetic charges contributing to a spherically
symmetric static Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric. Such Weyl ``charges'' provide a
source for the non-Riemannian torsion and metric gradient fields instead of the
electromagnetic field. The theory suggests that matter may be endowed with
gravitational charges that couple to gravity in a manner analogous to
electromagnetic couplings in an electromagnetic field. The nature of
gravitational coupling to spinor matter in this theory is also investigated and
a solution exhibiting a plane-symmetric gravitational metric wave coupled via
non-Riemannian waves to a propagating spinor field is presented.
