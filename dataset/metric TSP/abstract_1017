On a manifold with an almost contact metric structure
$(\varphi,\vec\xi,\eta,g,X,D)$ the notions of the interior and the
$N$-prolonged connections are introduced. Using the $N$-prolonged connection, a
new almost contact metric structure is defined on the distribution $D$. The
properties of this structure are studied.
