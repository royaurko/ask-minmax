As a manifestation of large distance effect Grumiller modified Schwarzschild
metric with an extraneous term reminiscent of Rindler acceleration. Such a term
has the potential to explain the observed flat rotation curves in general
relativity. The same idea has been extended herein to the larger arena of
$f\left( R\right) $ theory. With particular emphasis on weak energy conditions
(WECs) for a fluid we present various classes of $f\left( R\right) $ theories
admitting a Rindler-type acceleration in the metric.
