We consider the question of whether a given solvable Lie group admits a
left-invariant metric of strictly negative Ricci curvature. We give necessary
and sufficient conditions of the existence of such a metric for the Lie groups
the nilradical of whose Lie algebra is either abelian or Heisenberg or standard
filiform, and discuss some open questions.
