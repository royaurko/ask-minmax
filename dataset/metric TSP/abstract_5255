Magnitude is a real-valued invariant of metric spaces, analogous to the Euler
characteristic of topological spaces and the cardinality of sets. The
definition of magnitude is a special case of a general categorical definition
that clarifies the analogies between various cardinality-like invariants in
mathematics. Although this motivation is a world away from geometric measure,
magnitude, when applied to subsets of R^n, turns out to be intimately related
to invariants such as volume, surface area, perimeter and dimension. We
describe several aspects of this relationship, providing evidence for a
conjecture (first stated in arXiv:0908.1582) that magnitude subsumes all the
most important invariants of classical integral geometry.
