Double field theory was developed by theoretical physicists as a way to
encompass $T$-duality. In this paper, we express the basic notions of the
theory in differential-geometric invariant terms, in the framework of
para-Kaehler manifolds. We define metric algebroids, which are vector bundles
with a bracket of cross sections that has the same metric compatibility
property as a Courant bracket. We show that a double field gives rise to two
canonical connections, whose scalar curvatures can be integrated to obtain
actions. Finally, in analogy with Dirac structures, we define and study
para-Dirac structures on double manifolds.
