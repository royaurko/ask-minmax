In his pioneering work on injective metric spaces Isbell attempted a
characterization of cellular complexes admitting the structure of an injective
metric space, following his discovery that finite metric spaces have injective
envelopes naturally admitting a polyhedral structure. Considerable advances in
the understanding, classification and applications of injective envelopes have
been made by Dress, Huber, Sturmfels and collaborators (producing, among other
results, many specific examples of injective polyhedra), and most recently by
Lang, yet a combination theory explaining how to glue injective polyhedra
together to produce large families of injective spaces is still unavailable. In
this paper we apply the duality theory of cubings -- simply connected
non-positively curved cubical complexes -- to provide a more principled and
accessible proof of a result of Mai and Tang on the injective metrizability of
collapsible simplicial complexes. Our viewpoint allows an easy extension of
their result to: Main Theorem. Any pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit of
locally-finite piecewise-$\ell^\infty$ cubings is injective. In addition to
providing earlier work on two-dimensional complexes with a proper context, our
result expands on the natural link between the methods of geometric group
theory and the study of general metric spaces exposed by Lang, shedding some
light on the role of non-positive curvature in the combination theory of
injective metric spaces.
