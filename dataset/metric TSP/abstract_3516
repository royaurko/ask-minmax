Superspace parametrized by gauge potentials instead of metric
three-geometries is discussed in the context of the Ashtekar variables. Among
other things, an "internal clock" for the full theory can be identified.
Gauge-fixing conditions which lead to the natural geometrical separation of
physical from gauge modes are derived with the use of the metric in
connection-superspace. A perturbation scheme about an unconventional background
which is inaccessible to conventional variables is presented. The resultant
expansion retains much of the simplicity of Ashtekar's formulation of General
Relativity.
