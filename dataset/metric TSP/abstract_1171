We discuss the emergence of scalar gravitational waves in metric-affine
f(R)-gravity. Such a component allows to discriminate between metric and
metric-affine theories The intrinsic meaning of this result is that the
geodesic structure of the theory can be discriminated. We extend the formalism
of cross correlation analysis, including the additional polarization mode, and
calculate the detectable energy density of the spectrum for cosmological relic
gravitons. The possible detection of the signal is discussed against
sensitivities of VIRGO, LIGO and LISA interferometers.
