We present some remarkable properties of the symmetry group for gravitational
plane waves. Our main observation is that metrics with plane wave symmetry
satisfy every system of generally covariant vacuum field equations except the
Einstein equations. The proof uses the homothety admitted by metrics with plane
wave symmetry and the scaling behavior of generally covariant field equations.
We also discuss a mini-superspace description of spacetimes with plane wave
symmetry.
