We study the approach to gravity in which our curved spacetime is considered
as a surface in a flat ambient space of higher dimension (the embedding
theory). The dynamical variable in this theory is not a metric but an embedding
function. The Euler-Lagrange equations for this theory (Regge-Teitelboim
equations) are more general than the Einstein equations, and admit "extra
solutions" which do not correspond to any Einsteinian metric. The
Regge-Teitelboim equations can be explicitly analyzed for the solutions with
high symmetry. We show that symmetric embeddings of a static spherically
symmetric asymptotically flat metrics in a 6-dimensional ambient space do not
admit extra solutions of the vacuum Regge-Teitelboim equations. Therefore in
the embedding theory the solutions with such properties correspond to the
exterior Schwarzchild metric.
