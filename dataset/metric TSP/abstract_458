Let $\bfH^n_\K$ denote the boundary of a symmetric space of rank one and of
non compact type and let $d_\fH$ be the Kor\'anyi metric defined in its
boundary. We prove that if $d$ is a metric on $\bH^n_\K$ such that all
Heisenberg similarities are $d-$M\"obius maps, then under a continuity
condition $d$ is a constant multiple of a power of $d_\fH$.
