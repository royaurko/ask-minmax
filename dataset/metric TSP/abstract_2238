In this article we find the general, exact solution for the gravitational
field equations for diagonal, vacuum, separable metrics. These are metrics each
of whose terms can be separated into functions of each space-time variable
separately. Other than this, the functions are completely arbitrary; no
symmetries are assumed; no limitations are placed on the coordinates. There are
16 functions, which with specific selection of coordinates reduce to 12. Since
there are 10 field equations, two functions in the solution are completely
arbitrary. The field equations are solved exactly. The solution for each
function is presented analytically, with a total of three parameters and ten
constants in addition to the two arbitrary functions.
