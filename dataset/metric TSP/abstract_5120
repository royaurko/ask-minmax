Let X --> B be a holomorphic submersion between compact Kahler manifolds of
any dimension, whose fibres and base have no non-zero holomorphic vector fields
and whose fibres all admit constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics. This
article gives a sufficient topological condition for the existence of a
constant scalar curvature Kahler metric on the total space X. The condition
involves the CM-line bundle--a certain natural line bundle on B--which is
proved to be nef. Knowing this, the condition is then implied by c_1(B)<0. This
provides infinitely many Kahler manifolds of constant scalar curvature in every
dimension, each with Kahler class arbitrarily far from the canonical class.
