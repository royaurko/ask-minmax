We investigate L-sectional curvature of S-manifolds with respect to the
Rieman- nian connection and to certain semi-symmetric metric and non-metric
connections naturally related with the structure, obtaining conditions for them
to be constant and giving examples of S-manifolds in such conditions. Moreover,
we calculate the scalar curvature in all the cases.
