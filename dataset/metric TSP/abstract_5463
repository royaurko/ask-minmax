For locally compact groups, we define an analogue to Yu's property A that he
defined for discrete metric spaces. We show that our property A for locally
compact groups agrees with Roe's notion of property A for proper metric spaces,
defined in \cite{R05}. We prove that many of the results that are known to hold
in the discrete setting, hold also in the locally compact setting. In
particular, we show that property A is equivalent to amenability at infinity
(see \cite{HR00} for the discrete case), and that a locally compact group with
property A embeds uniformly into a Hilbert space (see \cite{Yu00} for the
discrete case). We also prove that the Baum-Connes assembly map with
coefficients is split-injective, for every locally compact group that embeds
uniformly into a Hilbert space. This extends results by Skandalis, Tu and Yu
\cite{STY02}, and by Chabert, Echterhoff and Oyono-Oyono \cite{CEO04}.
