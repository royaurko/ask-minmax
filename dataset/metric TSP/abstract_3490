Using Penrose diagrams the causal structure of the static spherically
symmetric vacuum solution to conformal (Weyl) gravity is investigated. A
striking aspect of the solution is an unexpected physical singularity at $r=0$
caused by a linear term in the metric. We explain how to calculate the
deflection of light in coordinates where the metric is manifestly conformal to
flat i.e. in coordinates where light moves in straight lines.
