We introduce and develop the theory of metric sheaves. A metric sheaf $\A$ is
defined on a topological space $X$ such that each fiber is a metric model. We
describe the construction of the generic model as the quotient space of the
sheaf through an appropriate filter. Semantics in this model is completely
controlled and understood by the forcing rules in the sheaf.
