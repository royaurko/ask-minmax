A coarse embedding of a metric space X into a metric space Y is a map f:
X-->Y satisfying for every x, y in X:
  \phi_1(d(x,y)) \leq d(f(x),f(y)) \leq \phi_2(d(x,y))
 where \phi_1 and \phi_2 are nondecreasing functions on [0,\infty) with values
in [0,\infty), with the condition that \phi_1(t) tends to \infty as t tends to
\infty. We show that \ell_p does not coarsely embed in a Hilbert space for
2<p<\infty.
