Our main goal in this paper is to construct the first explicit fundamental
domain of the Picard modular group acting on the complex hyperbolic space ${\bf
CH}^{2}$. The complex hyperbolic space is a Hermitian symmetric space, its
bounded realization is the unit ball in ${\bf C}^2$ equipped with the Bergman
metric. The Picard modular group is a discontinuous holomorphic automorphism
subgroup of $SU(2,1)$ with Gaussian integer entries. This fundamental domain
has finite volume, one cusp, explicitly given boundary surfaces and an
interesting symmetry.
