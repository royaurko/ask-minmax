The conjecture of D.Blair says that there are no nonflat Riemannian metrics
of nonpositive curvature compatible with a contact structure. We prove this
conjecture for a certain class of contact structures on closed 3-dimensional
manifolds and construct a local counterexample. We also prove that a hyperbolic
metric on $\mathbb{R}^3$ cannot be compatible with any contact structure.
