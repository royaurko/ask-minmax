Several contributors have pointed out the connection between Barbilian's metric
introduced in 1934 and the recent study of Apollonian metrics. We provide
examples of various distances that can be obtained by Barbilian's metrization
procedure and we discuss the relation between this metrization procedure and
important Riemannian and generalized Lagrangian metrics. Then we prove an
extension of Barbilian's metrization procedure.
