We obtain two in a sense dual to each other results: First, that the capacity
dimension of every compact, locally self-similar metric space coincides with
the topological dimension, and second, that the asymptotic dimension of a
metric space, which is asymptotically similar to its compact subspace coincides
with the topological dimension of the subspace. As an application of the first
result, we prove the Gromov conjecture that the asymptotic dimension of every
hyperbolic group G equals the topological dimension of its boundary at infinity
plus 1, asdim G=dim(dG)+1. As an application of the second result, we construct
Pontryagin surfaces for the asymptotic dimension, in particular, those are
first examples of metric spaces X, Y with asdim(X x Y)<asdim X+asdim Y. Other
applications are also given.
