For some centrally symmetric convex bodies $K\subset \mathbb R^n$, we study
the energy integral $$ \sup \int_{K} \int_{K} \|x - y\|_r^{p}\, d\mu(x)
d\mu(y), $$ where the supremum runs over all finite signed Borel measures $\mu$
on $K$ of total mass one. In the case where $K = B_q^n$, the unit ball of
$\ell_q^n$ (for $1 < q \leq 2$) or an ellipsoid, we obtain the exact value or
the correct asymptotical behavior of the supremum of these integrals. We apply
these results to a classical embedding problem in metric geometry. We consider
in $\mathbb R^n$ the Euclidean distance $d_2$. For $0 < \alpha < 1$, we
estimate the minimum $R$ for which the snowflaked metric space $(K,
d_2^{\alpha})$ may be isometrically embedded on the surface of a Hilbert sphere
of radius $R$.
