We study solutions to the static vacuum Einstein equations on exterior
domains with prescribed metric and mean curvature on the inner boundary. It is
proved that for any such boundary data near the standard round boundary data in
Euclidean space, there exists a unique AF solution to the static vacuum
equations realizing the boundary data, which is close to the standard flat
solution.
