In our previous paper, it was shown that BLG model based on a Lorentzian
metric 3-algebra gives Dp-brane action whose worldvolume is compactified on
torus T^d (d=p-2). Here the 3-algebra was a generalized one with d+1 pairs of
Lorentzian metric generators and expressed in terms of a loop algebra with
central extensions. In this paper, we derive the precise relation between the
coupling constant of the super Yang-Mills, the moduli of T^d and some R-R flux
with VEV's of ghost fields associated with Lorentzian metric generators. In
particular, for d=1, we derive the Yang-Mills action with theta term and show
that SL(2,Z) Montonen-Olive duality is realized as the rotation of two VEV's.
Furthermore, some moduli parameters such as NS-NS 2-form flux are identified as
the deformation parameters of the 3-algebras. By combining them, we recover
most of the moduli parameters which are required by U-duality symmetry.
