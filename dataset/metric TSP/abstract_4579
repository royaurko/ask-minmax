Klartag recently gave a beautiful alternative proof of the isoperimetric
inequalities of Levy-Gromov, Bakry-Ledoux and E. Milman on weighted Riemannian
manifolds. Klartag's approach is based on needle decompositions associated with
1-Lipschitz functions, inspired by convex geometry and optimal transport
theory. Cavalletti and Mondino subsequently generalized Klartag's technique to
essentially non-branching metric measure spaces satisfying the
curvature-dimension condition, in particular including reversible (absolutely
homogeneous) Finsler manifolds. In this paper, we construct needle
decompositions of non-reversible (only positively homogeneous) Finsler
manifolds, and show an isoperimetric inequality under bounded reversibility
constants. A discussion on the curvature-dimension condition CD(K,N) (in the
sense of Lott-Sturm-Villani) for N=0 is also included, it would be of
independent interest.
