This is the last article in a series of three initiated by the second contributor.
We elaborate on the concepts and theorems constructed in the previous articles.
In particular, we prove that the GH and the GGH uniformities previously
introduced on the moduli space of isometry classes of globally hyperbolic
spacetimes are different, but the Cauchy sequences which give rise to
well-defined limit spaces coincide. We then examine properties of the strong
metric introduced earlier on each spacetime, and answer some questions
concerning causality of limit spaces. Progress is made towards a general
definition of causality, and it is proven that the GGH limit of a Cauchy
sequence of $\mathcal{C}^{\pm}_{\alpha}$, path metric Lorentz spaces is again a
$\mathcal{C}^{\pm}_{\alpha}$, path metric Lorentz space. Finally, we give a
necessary and sufficient condition, similar to the one of Gromov for the
Riemannian case, for a class of Lorentz spaces to be precompact.
