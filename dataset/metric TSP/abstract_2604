We study the stable norm on the first homology of a closed, non-orientable
surface equipped with a Riemannian metric. We prove that in every conformal
class there exists a metric whose stable norm is polyhedral. Furthermore the
stable norm is never strictly convex if the first Betti number of the surface
is greater than two.
