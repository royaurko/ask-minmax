We propose a metric which can be used to compute the amount of heritable
variation enabled by a given dynamical system. A distribution of selection
pressures is used such that each pressure selects a particular fixed point via
competitive exclusion in order to determine the corresponding distribution of
potential fixed points in the population dynamics. This metric accurately
detects the number of species present in artificially prepared test systems,
and furthermore can correctly determine the number of heritable sets in
clustered transition matrix models in which there are no clearly defined
genomes. Finally, we apply our metric to the GARD model and show that it
accurately reproduces prior measurements of the model's heritability.
