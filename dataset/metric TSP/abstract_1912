I consider the COBE data coarse-grained field that characterize the now
observable universe for a model of warm inflation which takes into account the
thermal coupled fluctuations of the scalar field with the thermal bath. The
power spectrum for both, matter and metric fluctuations are analyzed. I find
that the amplitude for the fluctuations of the metric when the horizon entry,
should be very small for the expected values of temperature.
