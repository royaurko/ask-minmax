This paper presents estimates for the distribution of the exit time from
balls and short time asymptotics for measure metric Dirichlet spaces. The
estimates cover the classical Gaussian case, the sub-diffusive case which can
be observed on particular fractals and further less regular cases as well. The
proof is based on a new chaining argument and it is free of volume growth
assumptions.
