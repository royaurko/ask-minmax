This is the third and last in our series of papers concerning rough solutions
of the Einstein vacuum equations expressed relative to wave coordinates. In
this paper we prove an important result concerning Ricci defects of
microlocalized solutions, stated and used in the proof of the crucial
Asymptotics Theorem in our second paper "The causal structure of the
microlocalized rough Einstein metrics"
