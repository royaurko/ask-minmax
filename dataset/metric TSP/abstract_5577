Hartle's slow rotation formalism is developed in the presence of a
cosmological constant. We find the generalisation of the Hartle-Thorne vacuum
metric, the Hartle-Thorne-(anti)-de Sitter metric, and find that it is always
asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter. Next we consider Wahlquist's rotating perfect
fluid interior solution in Hartle's formalism and discuss its matching to the
Hartle-Thorne-(anti)-de Sitter metric. It is known that the Wahlquist solution
cannot be matched to an asymptotically flat region and therefore does not
provide a model of an isolated rotating body in this context. However, in the
presence of a cosmological term, we find that it can be matched to an
asymptotic (anti)-de Sitter space and we are able to interpret the Wahlquist
solution as a model of an isolated rotating body, to second order in the
angular velocity.
