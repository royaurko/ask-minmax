Starting from a knowledge of certain identities in the Lagrangian
description, the diffeomorphism transformations of metric and connection are
obtained for both the second order (metric) and the first order (Palatini)
formulations of gravity. The transformation laws of the connection and the
metric are derived independently in the Palatini formulation in contrast to the
metric formulation where the gauge variation of the connection is deduced from
the gauge variation of the metric.
