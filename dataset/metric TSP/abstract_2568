In its most general form, the recognition problem in Riemannian geometry
asks for the identification of an unknown Riemannian manifold via measurements
of metric invariants on the manifold. We introduce a new infinite sequence of
invariants, the first term of which is the usual diameter, and illustrate the
role of these global shape invariants in a number of recognition problems.
