The aim of this paper is to construct infinitely many families of Einstein
metrics on the connected sums of arbitrary number of copies of $S^2\times S^3$.
We realize these 5-manifolds as total spaces of Seifert bundles over Del Pezzo
orbifolds. A K\"ahler--Einstein metric on the Del Pezzo orbifold is then lifted
to an Einstein metric using the Kobayashi--Boyer--Galicki method.
