We study the behavior of metric perturbations in a recently proposed model of
phantom dark energy with tachyonic instability at long wavelengths. We find
that metric perturbations exponentially grow in time, starting from very small
values determined by vacuum fluctuations, and may become sizeable at late
times. This property may be of interest for phenomenology.
