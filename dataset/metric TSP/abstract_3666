We show that the moduli space of supersymmetric black holes that arise in the
five-dimensional N=2 supergravity theory with any number of vector multiplets
is a weak HKT manifold. The moduli metric is expressed in terms of a HKT
potential which is determined by the associated very special geometry of the
supergravity theory. As an example, we give explicitly the black hole moduli
metric for the STU model.
