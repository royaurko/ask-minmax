In the average action approach to the quantization of gravity the fundamental
requirement of "background independence" is met by actually introducing a
background metric but leaving it completely arbitrary. The associated Wilsonian
renormalization group defines a coarse graining flow on a theory space of
functionals which, besides the dynamical metric, depend explicitly on the
background metric. All solutions to the truncated flow equations known to date
have a trivial background field dependence only, namely via the classical gauge
fixing term. In this paper we analyze a number of conceptual issues related to
the bimetric character of the gravitational average action and explore a first
nontrivial bimetric truncation in the simplified setting of conformally reduced
gravity. Possible implications for the Asymptotic Safety program and the
cosmological constant problem are discussed in detail.
