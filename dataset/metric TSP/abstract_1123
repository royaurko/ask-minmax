An $n$-dimensional Hartogs domain $D_F$ with strongly pseudoconvex boundary
can be equipped with a natural Kaehler metric $g_F$. This paper contains two
results. In the first one we prove that if $g_F$ is an extremal Kaehler metric
then $(D_F, g_F)$ is holomorphically isometric to an open subset of the
$n$-dimensional complex hyperbolic space. In the second one we prove the same
assertion under the assumption that there exists a real holomorphic vector
field $X$ on $D_F$ such that $(g_F, X)$ is a Kaehler-Ricci soliton.
