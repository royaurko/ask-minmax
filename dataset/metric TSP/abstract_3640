We study dilatonic domain walls specific to superstring theory.
  Along with the matter fields and metric the dilaton also changes its value in
the wall background. We found supersymmetric (extreme) solutions which in
general interpolate between isolated superstring vacua with non-equal value of
the matter potential; they correspond to the static, planar domain walls with
{\it flat} metric in the string (sigma model) frame.
  We point out similarities between the space-time of dilatonic walls and that
of charged dilatonic black holes. We also comment on non-extreme solutions
corresponding to expanding bubbles.
