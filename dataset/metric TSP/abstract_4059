We show improved local energy decay for the wave equation on asymptotically
Euclidean manifolds in odd dimensions in the short range case. The precise
decay rate depends on the decay of the metric towards the Euclidean metric. We
also give estimates of powers of the resolvent of the wave propagator between
weighted spaces.
