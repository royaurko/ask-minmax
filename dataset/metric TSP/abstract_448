Riemannian metrics on the unit ball of the quaternions, which are naturally
associated with the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We study the metric
arising from the Hardy space in detail. We show that, in contrast to the
one-complex variable case, no Riemannian metric is invariant under regular
self-maps of the quaternionic ball.
