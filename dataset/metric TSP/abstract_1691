Geodesics on the infinite dimensional symmetric space $\hcal$ of K\"ahler
metrics in a fixed K\"ahler class on a projective K\"ahler manifold X are
solutions of a homogeneous complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation in $X \times A$,
where $A \subset \C$ is an annulus. They are analogues of 1PS (one-parameter
subgroups) on symmetric spaces $G_{\C}/G$. Donaldson, Arezzo-Tian and
Phong-Sturm raised the question whether Monge-Amp\`ere geodesics can be
approximated by 1PS geodesics in the symmetric spaces of Bergman metrics.
Phong-Sturm proved weak C^0 convergence of Bergman to Monge-Amp\`ere geodesics
on a general \kahler manifold. In this article we prove convergence in $C^2(A
\times X)$ in the case of toric K\"ahler metrics, extending our earlier result
on $\CP^1$.
