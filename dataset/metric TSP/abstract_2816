This paper provides uniform bounds on the asymptotic regularity for
iterations associated to a finite family of nonexpansive mappings. We obtain
our quantitative results in the setting of $(r,\delta)$-convex spaces, a class
of geodesic spaces which generalizes metric spaces with a convex geodesic
bicombing.
