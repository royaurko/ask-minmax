This paper is concerned with strong Li-Yorke chaos induced by
A-coupled-expansion for time-varying (i.e., nonautonomous) discrete systems in
metric spaces. Some criteria of chaos in the strong sense of Li-Yorke are
established via strict coupled-expansions for irreducible transition matrices
in bounded and closed subsets of complete metric spaces and in compact subsets
of metric spaces, respectively, where their conditions are weaker than those in
the existing literature. One example is provided for illustration.
