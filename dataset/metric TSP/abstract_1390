In this paper, we study the \texttt{Ehlers' transformation} (sometimes called
gravitational duality rotation) for \texttt{reciprocal} static metrics. First
we introduce the concept of reciprocal metric. We prove a theorem which shows
how we can construct a certain new static solution of Einstein field equations
using a seed metric. Later we investigate the family of stationary spacetimes
of such reciprocal metrics. The key here is a theorem from Ehlers', which
relates any static vacuum solution to a unique stationary metric. The
stationary metric has a magnetic charge. The spacetime represents Newman
-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) solutions. Since any stationary spacetime can be
decomposed into a $1+3$ time-space decomposition, Einstein field equations for
any stationary spacetime can be written in the form of Maxwell's equations for
gravitoelectromagnetic fields. Further we show that this set of equations is
invariant under reciprocal transformations. An additional point is that the NUT
charge changes the sign. As an instructive example, by starting from the
reciprocal Schwarzschild as a spherically symmetric solution and reciprocal
Morgan-Morgan disk model as seed metrics we find their corresponding stationary
space-times. Starting from any static seed metric, performing the reciprocal
transformation and by applying an additional Ehlers' transforation we obtain a
family of NUT spaces with negative NUT factor (reciprocal NUT factors).
