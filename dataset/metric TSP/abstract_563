The Gauss-Bonnet Theorem is studied for edge metrics as a renormalized index
theorem. These metrics include the Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Renormalization is used to make sense of the curvature integral
and the dimensions of the $L^2$-cohomology spaces as well as to carry out the
heat equation proof of the index theorem. For conformally compact metrics even
mod $x^m$, the finite time supertrace of the heat kernel on conformally compact
manifolds is shown to renormalize independently of the choice of special
boundary defining function.
