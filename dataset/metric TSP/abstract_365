The static Kottler metric is the Schwarzschild vacuum metric extended to
include a cosmological constant. Angular momentum is added to the Kottler
metric by using Newman and Janis' complexifying algorithm. The new metric is
the Lambda generalization of the Kerr spacetime. It is stationary, axially
symmetric, Petrov type II, and has Kerr-Schild form.
