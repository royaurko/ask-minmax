A simple geometric procedure is proposed for constructing Wick symbols on
cotangent bundles to Riemannian manifolds. The main ingredient of the
construction is a method of endowing the cotangent bundle with a formal
K\"ahler structure. The formality means that the metric is lifted from the
Riemannian manifold $Q$ to its phase space $T^\ast Q$ in the form of formal
power series in momenta with the coefficients being tensor fields on the base.
The corresponding K\"ahler two-form on the total space of $T^\ast Q$ coincides
with the canonical symplectic form, while the canonical projection of the
K\"ahler metric on the base manifold reproduces the original metric. Some
examples are considered, including constant curvature space and nonlinear sigma
models, illustrating the general construction.
