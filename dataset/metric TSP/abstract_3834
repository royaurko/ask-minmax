The aim of this article is to present the category of bounded Frechet
manifolds in respect to which we will review the geometry of Frechet manifolds
with a stronger accent on its metric aspect. An inverse function theorem in the
sense of Nash and Moser in this category is proved, and some applications to
Riemannian geometry are given.
