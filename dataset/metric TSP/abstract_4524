In this paper, we deal with sweeping processes on (possibly
infinite-dimensional) Riemannian Hilbert manifolds. We extend the useful
notions (proximal normal cone, prox-regularity) already defined in the setting
of a Hilbert space to the framework of such manifolds. Especially we introduce
the concept of local prox-regularity of a closed subset in accordance with the
geometrical features of the ambient manifold and we check that this regularity
implies a property of hypomonotonicity for the proximal normal cone. Moreover
we show that the metric projection onto a locally prox-regular set is
single-valued in its neighborhood. Then under some assumptions, we prove the
well-posedness of perturbed sweeping processes by locally prox-regular sets.
