We describe the automorphism groups and the abstract commensurators of
Houghton's groups. Then we give sharp estimates for the word metric of these
groups and deduce that the commensurators embed into the corresponding
quasi-isometry groups. As a further consequence, we obtain that the Houghton
group on two rays is at least quadratically distorted in those with three or
more rays.
