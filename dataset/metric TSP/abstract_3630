We proposes an alternative model of duality symmetry, based on the previously
obtained divergence theory, including an scalar field, an internal vector and a
metric signature. At some small scale an effective scalar field equation has
appeared whose potential acts like a Higgs one, where the metric signature
plays the role of an order parameter. Non-vanishing Vacuum condensation of this
Higgs field occurs once a signature change from Euclidean to Lorentzian is
formed. The mass scale of Higgs field excitations around this vacuum may
contribute, in the Lorentzian sector, to the cosmological constant, in
agreement with observations.
