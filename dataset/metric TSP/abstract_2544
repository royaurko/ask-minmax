We raise, and provide an (unsatisfactory) answer to, the title's question:
why, unlike all other fields, does the gravitational "metric" variable not have
zero vacuum? After formulating, without begging it, we exhibit additions to the
conventional action that express existence of the inverse through a field
equation.
