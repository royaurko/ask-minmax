We study biinvariant word metrics on groups. We provide an efficient
algorithm for computing the biinvariant word norm on a finitely generated free
group and we construct an isometric embedding of a locally compact tree into
the biinvariant Cayley graph of a nonabelian free group. We investigate the
geometry of cyclic subgroups. We observe that in many classes of groups cyclic
subgroups are either bounded or detected by homogeneous quasimorphisms. We call
this property the bq-dichotomy and we prove it for many classes of groups of
geometric origin.
