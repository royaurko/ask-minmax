Recently, a modified theory of gravity was presented, which consists of the
superposition of the metric Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with an $f(\cal R)$
term constructed \`{a} la Palatini. The theory possesses extremely interesting
features such as predicting the existence of a long-range scalar field, that
explains the late-time cosmic acceleration and passes the local tests, even in
the presence of a light scalar field. In this brief report, we consider the
possibility that wormholes are supported by this hybrid metric-Palatini
gravitational theory. We present here the general conditions for wormhole
solutions according to the null energy conditions at the throat and find
specific examples. In the first solution, we specify the redshift function, the
scalar field and choose the potential that simplifies the modified Klein-Gordon
equation. This solution is not asymptotically flat and needs to be matched to a
vacuum solution. In the second example, by adequately specifying the metric
functions and choosing the scalar field, we find an asymptotically flat
spacetime.
