General equations of the unified geometric field theory, based on the curved
and torsional space-time, are presented. They contain only geometrical
parameters of the metric-affine space G4 and describe distribution and motion
of the matter, which represents curvature and torsion of the space-time.
Equations describing spherically symmetric non-stationary and stationary fields
are derived for various cases: for metrics with singularities and without them,
for gravitational field in vacuum and for the massless fluid with spin.
Equations describing uniform isotropic field are derived for the closed and
open isotropic models of universe for the gravitational field in vacuum and for
the massless fluid with spin; some of these equations and their solutions
coincide with the respective equations and their solutions in general
relativity for the space filled with the dust-like matter.
