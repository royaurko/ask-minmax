Let $E\rightarrow M$ be a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact Kaehler
manifold $(M, \omega)$ and let $E=E_1\oplus... \oplus E_m\rightarrow M$ be its
decomposition into irreducible factors. Suppose that each $E_j$ admits a
$\omega$-balanced metric in Donaldson-Wang terminology. In this paper we prove
that $E$ admits a unique $\omega$-balanced metric if and only if
$\frac{r_j}{N_j}=\frac{r_k}{N_k}$ for all $j, k=1, ..., m$, where $r_j$ denotes
the rank of $E_j$ and $N_j=\dim H^0(M, E_j)$. We apply our result to the case
of homogeneous vector bundles over a rational homogeneous variety $(M, \omega)$
and we show the existence and rigidity of balanced Kaehler embedding from $(M,
\omega)$ into Grassmannians.
