Artificial black holes (called also acoustic or optical black holes) are the
black holes for the linear wave equation describing the wave propagation in a
moving medium. They attracted a considerable interest of physicists who study
them to better understand the black holes in general relativity. We consider
the case of stationary axisymmetric metrics and we show that the Kerr black
hole is not stable under perturbations in the class of all axisymmetric
metrics. We describe families of axisymmetric metrics having black holes that
are the perturbations of the Kerr black hole. We also show that the ergosphere
can be determined by boundary measurements and we prove the uniform boundness
of the solution in the exterior of the black hole when the event horizon
coincides with the ergosphere.
