In this paper, we determine the necessary conditions for a non-horizontal
submanifold of sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group $H^n$ to be of minimal
(spherical) Hausdorff measure. We give the first variation of the (spherical)
Hausdorff measure for a non-horizontal submanifold, and find that the
minimality implies the tensor equation $H + L = 0$, where $H$ is analogous to
the mean curvature and $L$ is a mean Lie bracket. The theorem is stated in the
more general setting of a stratified Lie group with a constant metric factor.
