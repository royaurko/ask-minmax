We give a geometric derivation of SLE($\kappa,\rho$) in terms of conformally
invariant random growing subsets of polygons. We relate the parameters $\rho_j$
to the exterior angles of the polygons. We also show that SLE($\kappa,\rho$)
can be generated by a metric Brownian motion, where metric and Brownian motion
are coupled and the metric ist the pull-back metric of the Euclidean metric of
an evolving polygon.
