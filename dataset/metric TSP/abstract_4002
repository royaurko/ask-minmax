We find sufficient conditions for the absence of harmonic $L^2$ spinors on
spin manifolds constructed as cone bundles over a compact K\"ahler base. These
conditions are fulfilled for certain perturbations of the Euclidean metric, and
also for the generalized Taub-NUT metrics of Iwai-Katayama, thus proving a
conjecture of Vi\csinescu and the second contributor.
