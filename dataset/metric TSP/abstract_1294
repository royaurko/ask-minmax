We present a general model of interacting metric fields with the sum of
Fierz-Pauli actions as its free limit.. These theories are energetically
stable, i.e. their Hamiltonian is bounded from below and the multi-Minkowski
metric configuration is the unique ground state.
  The model can be constructed even with the restriction of maximum two
derivatives Lagrangian terms. The coupling can be made with an arbitrary number
of metric fields on each vertex. The model is not based on some specific
interaction structure that put extra constraints for the ghost degrees of
freedom and thus avoids superluminal shock waves and causality problems
subjected to these constraints. The dominant energy condition is maintained
with respect to all metric fields for all field configurations.
