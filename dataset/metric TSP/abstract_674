A general approach is presented for quantizing a metric nonlinear system on a
manifold of constant curvature. It makes use of a curvature dependent procedure
which relies on determining Noether symmetries from the metric. The curvature
of the space functions as a constant parameter. For a specific metric which
defines the manifold, Lie differentiation of the metric gives these symmetries.
A metric is used such that the resulting Schrodinger equation can be solved in
terms of hypergeometric functions. This permits the investigation of both the
energy spectrum and wave functions exactly for this system.
