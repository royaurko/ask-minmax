We show that the real-valued function $S_\alpha$ on the moduli space
$\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ of pointed rational curves, defined as the critical value
of the Liouville action functional on a hyperbolic 2-sphere with $n\geq 3$
conical singularities of arbitrary orders $\alpha=\{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n\}$,
generates accessory parameters of the associated Fuchsian differential equation
as their common antiderivative. We introduce a family of Kaehler metrics on
$\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ parameterized by the set of orders $\alpha$, explictly
relate accessory parameters to these metrics, and prove that the functions
$S_\alpha$ are their Kaehler potentials.
