This paper is based on a talk presented by the first contributor at the Short
Program on Riemannian Geometry that took place at the Centre de Recherche
Math\'ematiques, Universit\'e de Montr\'eal, during the period June 28-July 16,
2004. It is a report on our joint work with J\'anos Koll\'ar concerning the
existence of an abundance of Einstein metrics on odd dimensional spheres,
including exotic spheres.
