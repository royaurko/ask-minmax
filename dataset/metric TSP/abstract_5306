We study a class of higher dimensional warped Einstein spacetimes with one
extra dimension. These were originally identified by Brinkmann as those
Einstein spacetimes that can be mapped conformally on other Einstein
spacetimes, and have subsequently appeared in various contexts to describe,
e.g., different braneworld models or warped black strings. After clarifying the
relation between the general Brinkmann metric and other more specific
coordinate systems, we analyze the algebraic type of the Weyl tensor of the
solutions. In particular, we describe the relation between Weyl aligned null
directions (WANDs) of the lower dimensional Einstein slices and of the full
spacetime, which in some cases can be algebraically more special. Possible
spacetime singularities introduced by the warp factor are determined via a
study of scalar curvature invariants and of Weyl components measured by
geodetic observers. Finally, we illustrate how Brinkmann's metric can be
employed to generate new solutions by presenting the metric of spinning and
accelerating black strings in five dimensional anti-de Sitter space.
