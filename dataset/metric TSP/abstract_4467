I describe a simple modification which can be applied to any citation
count-based index (e.g. Hirsch's h-index) quantifying a researcher's
publication output. The key idea behind the proposed approach is that the merit
for the citations of a paper should be distributed amongst its contributors
according to their relative contributions. In addition to producing inherently
fairer metrics I show that the proposed modification has the potential to
partially normalize for the unfair effects of honorary contributorship and thus
discourage this practice.
