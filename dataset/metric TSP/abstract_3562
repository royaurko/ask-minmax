In this paper, we investigate the nature of the singularity in the
spherically symmetrical, shear-free, gravitational collapse of a star with heat
flux using a separable metric [cqg1]. For any non-singular, regular, radial
density profile for a star described by this metric, eq. (2.1), the singularity
of the gravitational collapse is not naked locally. Our results here
unequivocally support the Strong Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis.
