We study a remarkable class of paracontact metric manifolds which have no
contact metric counterpart: the paracontact metric $(-1,\widetilde\mu)$-spaces
which are not paraSasakian (i.e. have $\widetilde h\neq0$). We present explicit
examples with $\widetilde h$ of every possible constant rank and some with
non-constant rank, which were not known to exist until recently.
