We show that existing decay results for scalar fields on the Schwarzschild
metric are sufficient to obtain a conformal scattering theory. Then we
re-interpret this as an analytic scattering theory defined in terms of wave
operators, with an explicit comparison dynamics associated with the principal
null geodesic congruences. We argue that in the case of the Kerr metric, some
crucial estimates are still missing in the litterature, without which a
scattering theory for the wave equation is not accessible.
