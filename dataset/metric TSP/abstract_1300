In this paper, we study the collapsing behaviour of negative
K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics along degenerations of canonical polarized
manifolds. We prove that for a toroidal degeneration of canonical polarized
manifolds with the total space $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial, the K\"{a}hler-Einstein
metrics on fibers collapse to a lower dimensional complete Riemannian manifold
in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff sense by suitably choosing the base points.
Furthermore, the most collapsed limit is a real affine K\"{a}hler manifold.
