We present an X-ray diffuse scattering study of the pretransitional
structural fluctuations of the magneto-elastic transition in alpha'-NaV2O5.
This transition is characterized by the appearance below Tsp~35K of satellite
reflections at the reduced wave vector (1/2,1/2,1/4). A large regime of
structural fluctuations is measured up to 90 K. These fluctuations are three
dimensional between Tsp and ~50K and quasi-one dimensional above ~60K. At 40 K
the anisotropy ratio is found to be (xib :xia :xic)= (3.8 : 1.8 : 1), which
reveals the importance of transverse interactions in the stabilization of the
low temperature phase. We discuss our results within the framework of recent
theories dealing with the simultaneous occurrence of a charge ordering, a spin
gap and a lattice distortion in this intriguing compound.
