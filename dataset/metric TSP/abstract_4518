In this paper we try to prepare a framework for field quantization. To this
end, we aim to replace the field of scalars R by self-adjoint elements of a
commutative
  C-algebra, and reach an appropriate generalization of geometrical concepts on
manifolds. First, we put forward the concept of operator-valued tensors and
extend semi-Riemannian metrics to operator valued metrics. Then, in this new
geometry, some essential concepts of Riemannian geometry such as curvature ten-
sor, Levi-Civita connection, Hodge star operator, exterior derivative,
divergence,... will be considered.
