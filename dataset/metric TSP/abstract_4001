We study a modification of the Plebanski action for general relativity, which
leads to a modified theory of gravity with eight degrees of freedom. We show
how the action can be recasted as a bi-metric theory of gravity, and expanding
around a bi-flat background we identify the six extra degrees of freedom with a
second, massive graviton and a scalar mode.
