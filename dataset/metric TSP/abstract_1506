Many biometric template protection algorithms have been proposed mainly in
two approaches: biometric feature transformation and biometric cryptosystem.
Security evaluation of the proposed algorithms are often conducted in various
inconsistent manner. Thus, it is strongly demanded to establish the common
evaluation metrics for easier comparison among many algorithms. Simoens et al.
and Nagar et al. proposed good metrics covering nearly all aspect of
requirements expected for biometric template protection algorithms. One
drawback of the two papers is that they are biased to experimental evaluation
of security of biometric template protection algorithms. Therefore, it was
still difficult mainly for algorithms in biometric cryptosystem to prove their
security according to the proposed metrics. This paper will give a formal
definitions for security metrics proposed by Simoens et al. and Nagar et al. so
that it can be used for the evaluation of both of the two approaches. Further,
this paper will discuss the relations among several notions of security
metrics.
