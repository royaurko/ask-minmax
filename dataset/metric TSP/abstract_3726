We construct several natural connections and Dirac type operators on a
general metric contact manifold which are more sensitive to the geometric
background. In the special case of CR manifolds these connections are also
compatible with the CR structure and include among them the Webster connection.
We also describe several Weitzenbock type formulae. Our method is based on work
of P. Gauduchon applied to two almost complex manifolds naturally associated to
a given metric contact manifold.
