We consider a variable speed random walk on Zd with power law edge
conductances. We show that the heat kernel of the random walk satisfies a
two-sided Gaussian bound in terms of an intrinsic metric, which is not
equivalent to the Euclidean metric. In the meanwhile, we obtain an interesting
example that two independent random walks on some of these weighted lattices
will collide infinite many times while they are transient.
