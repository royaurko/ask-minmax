We study relations between the variational Sobolev 1-capacity and versions of
variational BV-capacity in a complete metric space equipped with a doubling
measure and supporting a weak $(1,1)$-Poincar\'e inequality. We prove the
equality of 1-modulus and 1-capacity, extending the known results for $1 < p <
\infty$ to also cover the more geometric case $p = 1$. Then we give alternative
definitions for variational BV-capacities and obtain equivalence results
between them. Finally we study relations between total 1-capacity and versions
of BV-capacity.
