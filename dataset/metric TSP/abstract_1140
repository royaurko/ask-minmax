We prove the semi-Riemannian bumpy metric theorem using equivariant
variational genericity. The theorem states that, on a given compact manifold
$M$, the set of semi-Riemannian metrics that admit only nondegenerate closed
geodesics is generic relatively to the $C^k$-topology, $k=2,...,\infty$, in the
set of metrics of a given index on $M$. A higher order genericity Riemannian
result of Klingenberg and Takens is extended to semi-Riemannian geometry.
