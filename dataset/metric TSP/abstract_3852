We develop a mathematically well-defined path integral formalism for general
symplectic manifolds. We argue that in order to make a path integral
quantization covariant under general coordinate transformations on the phase
space and involve a genuine functional measure that is both finite and
countably additive, the phase space manifold should be equipped with a
Riemannian structure (metric). A suitable method to calculate the metric is
also proposed.
