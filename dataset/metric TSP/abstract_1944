A time varying space-time metric is shown to be a source of electromagnetic
radiation. The post-Newtonian approximation is used as a realistic model of the
connection between the space-time metric and a time varying gravitational
potential. Large temporal variations in the metric from the coalescence of
colliding black holes and neutron stars are shown to be possible progenitors of
gamma ray burst and millisecond pulsars.
