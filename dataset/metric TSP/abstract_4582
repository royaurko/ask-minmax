Here we investigate some geometric properties of the contactomorphism group
$\mathcal{D}_\theta(M)$ of a compact contact manifold with the $L^2$ metric on
the stream functions. Viewing this group as a generalization to the
$\mathcal{D}(S^1)$, the diffeomorphism group of the circle, we show that its
sectional curvature is always non-negative and that the the Riemannian
exponential map is not locally $C^1$. Lastly, we show that the quantomorphism
group is a totally geodesic submanifold of $\mathcal{D}_\theta(M)$ and talk
about its Riemannian submersion onto the symplectomorphism group of the
Boothby-Wang quotient of $M$.
