Cubic interactions of higher-spin gauge fields in (A)dS are studied in the
metric-like approach. Making use of the traceless and transverse constraints
together with the ambient-space formalism, all consistent parity-invariant
cubic vertices are obtained for d>3 in closed form pointing out the key role of
their flat-space counterparts.
