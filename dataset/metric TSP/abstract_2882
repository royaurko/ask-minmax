In this paper, we prove some general convergence theorems for the Picard
iteration in cone metric spaces over a solid vector space. As an application,
we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the Weierstrass iterative method
for computing all zeros of a polynomial simultaneously. These results improve
and generalize existing ones in the literature.
