In this paper Knockout Refinement Algorithm (KRA) is proposed to refine
original clusters obtained by applying SOM and K-Means clustering algorithms.
KRA Algorithm is based on Contingency Table concepts. Metrics are computed for
the Original and Refined Clusters. Quality of Original and Refined Clusters are
compared in terms of metrics. The proposed algorithm (KRA) is tested in the
educational domain and results show that it generates better quality clusters
in terms of improved metric values.
