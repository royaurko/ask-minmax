We derive the Kerr solution in a pedagogically transparent way, using
physical symmetry and gauge arguments to reduce the candidate metric to just
two unknowns. The resulting field equations are then easy to obtain, and solve.
Separately, we transform the Kerr metric to Schwarzschild frame to exhibit its
limits in that familiar setting.
