I construct exact solutions for general nonextremal rotating, charged
Kaluza-Klein black holes with a cosmological constant and with arbitrary
angular momenta in all higher dimensions. I then investigate their
thermodynamics and find their generalizations with the NUT charges. The metrics
are given in both Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and a form very similar to the
famous Kerr-Schild ansatz, which highlights its potential application to
include multiple electric charges into solutions yet to be found in gauged
supergravity. It is also observed that the metric ansatz in $D = 4$ dimensions
is similar to those previously suggested by Yilmaz and later by Bekenstein.
