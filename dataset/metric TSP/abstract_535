Exact non-static spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations
for a null fluid source with pressure $P$ and density $\rho$ related by $P =
k\rho^a$ are given. The $a=1$ metrics are asymptotically flat for $1/2<k\le 1$
and cosmological for $0<k<1/2$. The $k=1$ metric is the known charged Vaidya
solution. In general the metrics have multiple apparent horizons. In the long
time limit, the asymptotically flat metrics are hairy black hole solutions that
`fall between' the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom metrics.
