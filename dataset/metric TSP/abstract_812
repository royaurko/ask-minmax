Let M be a compact complex surface which admits a Kaehler metric whose scalar
curvature has integral zero; and suppose the fundamental group of M does not
contain an Abelian subgroup of finite index. Then if M is blown up at
sufficiently many points, the resulting surface M' admits scalar-flat Kaehler
metrics.
