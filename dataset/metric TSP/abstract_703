The Kerr-AdS metric in dimension D has cohomogeneity [D/2]; the metric
components depend on the radial coordinate r and [D/2] latitude variables \mu_i
that are subject to the constraint \sum_i \mu_i^2=1. We find a coordinate
reparameterisation in which the \mu_i variables are replaced by [D/2]-1
unconstrained coordinates y_\alpha, and having the remarkable property that the
Kerr-AdS metric becomes diagonal in the coordinate differentials dy_\alpha. The
coordinates r and y_\alpha now appear in a very symmetrical way in the metric,
leading to an immediate generalisation in which we can introduce [D/2]-1 NUT
parameters. We find that (D-5)/2 are non-trivial in odd dimensions, whilst
(D-2)/2 are non-trivial in even dimensions. This gives the most general
Kerr-NUT-AdS metric in $D$ dimensions. We find that in all dimensions D\ge4
there exist discrete symmetries that involve inverting a rotation parameter
through the AdS radius. These symmetries imply that Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics with
over-rotating parameters are equivalent to under-rotating metrics. We also
consider the BPS limit of the Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics, and thereby obtain, in odd
dimensions and after Euclideanisation, new families of Einstein-Sasaki metrics.
