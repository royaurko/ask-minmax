It is shown that the free motion of massive particles moving in static
spacetimes are given by the geodesics of an energy-dependent Riemannian metric
on the spatial sections analogous to Jacobi's metric in classical dynamics. In
the massless limit Jacobi's metric coincides with the energy independent Fermat
or optical metric. For stationary metrics, it is known that the motion of
massless particles is given by the geodesics of an energy independent
Finslerian metric of Randers type. The motion of massive particles is governed
by neither a Riemannian nor a Finslerian metric. The properies of the Jacobi
metric for massive particles moving outside the horizon of a Schwarschild black
hole are described. By constrast with the massless case, the Gaussian curvature
of the equatorial sections is not always negative.
