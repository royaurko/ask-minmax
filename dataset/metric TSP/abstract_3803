There are many theorems in the differential geometry literature of the
following sort.
  Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold with some conditions on various
curvatures, diameters, volumes, etc. Then M is homotopy equivalent to a finite
CW complex, or M is the interior of a compact, topological manifold with
boundary.
  At first glance it seems unlikely that such theorems have anything to say
about smooth manifolds homeomorphic to R^4. However, there is a common theme to
all the proofs which forbids the existence of such metrics on most (and
possibly all) exotic R^4's.
