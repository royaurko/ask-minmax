A metric space is indivisible if for any partition of it into finitely many
pieces one piece contains an isometric copy of the whole space. Continuing our
investigation of indivisible metric spaces, we show that a countable
ultrametric space embeds isometrically into an indivisible ultrametric metric
space if and only if it does not contain a strictly increasing sequence of
balls.
