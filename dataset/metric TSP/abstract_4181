The existence of intrinsic spin of matter requires the metric-affine
formulation of gravity, in which the affine connection is not constrained to be
symmetric and its antisymmetric part (torsion tensor) is a dynamical variable.
We show that the cyclic identity for the curvature tensor in the metric-affine
formulation forbids fermions represented by Dirac spinors to form point or
string configurations. Consequently, fermionic strings contradict the
gravitational field equations in the presence of spin. Superstring theory is
therefore incorrect.
