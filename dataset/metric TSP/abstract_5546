The construction of a generic parametrization to describe the spacetime
geometry around astrophysical black hole candidates is an important step to
test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. In the last few years, the
Johannsen-Psaltis metric has been the most common framework to study possible
deviations from the Kerr solution with present and near future observations.
Recently, Cardoso, Pani and Rico have proposed a more general parametrization.
The aim of the present paper is to study this new metric in a specific context,
namely the thermal spectrum of geometrically thin and optically thick accretion
disks. The most relevant finding is that the spacetime geometry around objects
that look like very fast-rotating Kerr black holes may still have large
deviations from the Kerr solution. This was not the case with the
Johannsen-Psaltis metric, which means the latter was missing an important class
of non-Kerr spacetimes.
