We offer an example of the second order Kawaguchi metric function the
extremal flow of which generalizes the flat space-time model of the
semi-classical spinning particle to the framework of the pseudo-Riemannian
space-time. The general shape of the variational Euler-Poisson equation of the
fourth order in the (pseudo-)Riemannian space is being developed too.
