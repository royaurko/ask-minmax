The metric outside an isolated object made up of ordinary matter is bound to
be the classical Schwarzschild vacuum solution of General Relativity.
Nevertheless, some solutions are known (e.g. Morris-Thorne wormholes) that do
not match Schwarzschild asymptotically. On a phenomenological point of view,
gravitational lensing in metrics falling as $1/r^q$ has recently attracted
great interest. In this work, we explore the conditions on the source matter
for constructing static spherically symmetric metrics exhibiting an arbitrary
power-law as Newtonian limit. For such space-times we also derive the
expressions of gravitational redshift and force on probe masses, which,
together with light deflection, can be used in astrophysical searches of
non-Schwarzschild objects made up of exotic matter. Interestingly, we prove
that even a minimally coupled scalar field with a power-law potential can
support non-Schwarzschild metrics with arbitrary asymptotic behaviour.
