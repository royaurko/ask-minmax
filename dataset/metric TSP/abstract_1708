Geometrization of dynamics consists of representing trajectories by geodesics
on a configuration space with a suitably defined metric. Previously, efforts
were made to show that the analysis of dynamical stability can also be carried
out within geometrical frameworks, by measuring the broadening rate of a bundle
of geodesics. Two known formalisms are via Jacobi and Eisenhart metrics. We
find that this geometrical analysis measures the actual stability when the
length of any geodesic is proportional to the corresponding time interval. We
prove that the Jacobi metric is not always an appropriate parametrization by
showing that it predicts chaotic behavior for a system of harmonic oscillators.
Furthermore, we show, by explicit calculation, that the correspondence between
dynamical- and geometrical-spread is ill-defined for the Jacobi metric. We find
that the Eisenhart dynamics corresponds to the actual tangent dynamics and is
therefore an appropriate geometrization scheme.
