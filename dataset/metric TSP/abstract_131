We consider a "convolution mm-Laplacian" operator on metric-measure spaces
and study its spectral properties. The definition is based on averaging over
small metric balls. For sufficiently nice metric-measure spaces we prove
stability of convolution Laplacian's spectrum with respect to metric-measure
perturbations and obtain Weyl-type estimates on the number of eigenvalues.
