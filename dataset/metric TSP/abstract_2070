We apply Nadel's method of multiplier ideal sheaves to show that every
complex del Pezzo surface of degree at most six whose automorphism group acts
without fixed points has a K\"ahler-Einstein metric. In particular, all del
Pezzo surfaces of degree $4,5$, or $6$ and certain special del Pezzo surfaces
of lower degree are shown to have a K\"ahler-Einstein metric. This result is
not new, but the proofs given in the present paper are less involved than
earlier ones by Siu, Tian and Tian-Yau.
