We suggest two metrics for assessing the quality of atomistic configurations
of disordered materials, both of which are based on quantifying the
orientational distribution of neighbours around each atom in the configuration.
The first metric is that of geometric invariance: i.e., the extent to which the
neighbour arrangements are as similar as possible for different atoms, allowing
for variations in frame of reference. The second metric concerns the degree of
local symmetry. We propose that for a set of configurations with equivalent
pair correlations, ranking highly those configurations with low geometric
invariance but with high local symmetry selects for structural simplicity in a
way that does not rely on formal group theoretical language (and hence
long-range periodic order). We show that these metrics rank a range of SiO2 and
a-Si configurations in an intuitive manner, and are also significantly more
sensitive to unphysical features of those configurations in a way that metrics
based on pair correlations are not. We also report that implementation of the
metrics within a reverse Monte Carlo algorithm gives rise to an energy
landscape that is too coarse (at least in this initial implementation) for
amorphous structure "solution".
