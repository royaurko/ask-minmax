In this paper, we prove that the Banach contraction principle proved by S. G.
Matthews in 1994 on 0--complete partial metric spaces can be extended to
cyclical mappings. However, the generalized contraction principle proved by D.
Ili\'{c}, V. Pavlovi\'{c} and V. Rako\u{c}evi\'{c} in "Some new extensions of
Banach's contraction principle to partial metric spaces, Appl. Math. Lett. 24
(2011), 1326--1330" on complete partial metric spaces can not be extended to
cyclical mappings. Some examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of
our results. Moreover, we generalize some of the results obtained by W. A.
Kirk, P. S. Srinivasan and P. Veeramani in "Fixed points for mappings
satisfying cyclical contractive conditions, Fixed Point Theory 4 (1)
(2003),79--89". Finally, an Edelstein's type theorem is also extended in case
one of the sets in the cyclic decomposition is 0-compact.
