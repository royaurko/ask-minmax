Quantum field theory distinguishes between the bare variables -- which we
introduce in the Lagrangian -- and the renormalized variables which incorporate
the effects of interactions. This suggests that the renormalized, physical,
metric tensor of spacetime (and all the geometrical quantities derived from it)
will also be different from the bare, classical, metric tensor in terms of
which the bare gravitational Lagrangian is expressed. We provide a physical
ansatz to relate the renormalized metric tensor to the bare metric tensor such
that the spacetime acquires a zero-point-length $\ell _{0}$ of the order of the
Planck length $L_{P}$. This prescription leads to several remarkable
consequences. In particular, the Euclidean volume $V_D(\ell,\ell _{0})$ in a
$D$-dimensional spacetime of a region of size $\ell $ scales as $V_D(\ell,
\ell_{0}) \propto \ell _{0}^{D-2} \ell^2$ when $\ell \sim \ell _{0}$, while it
reduces to the standard result $V_D(\ell,\ell _{0}) \propto \ell^D$ at large
scales ($\ell \gg \ell _{0}$). The appropriately defined effective dimension,
$D_{\rm eff} $, decreases continuously from $D_{\rm eff}=D$ (at $\ell \gg \ell
_{0}$) to $D_{\rm eff}=2$ (at $\ell \sim \ell _{0}$). This suggests that the
physical spacetime becomes essentially 2-dimensional near Planck scale.
