We present a systematic study of static solutions of the vacuum Einstein
equations with negative cosmological constant which asymptotically approach the
generalized Kottler (``Schwarzschild--anti-de Sitter'') solution, within
(mainly) a conformal framework. We show connectedness of conformal infinity for
appropriately regular such space-times. We give an explicit expression for the
Hamiltonian mass of the (not necessarily static) metrics within the class
considered; in the static case we show that they have a finite and well defined
Hawking mass. We prove inequalities relating the mass and the horizon area of
the (static) metrics considered to those of appropriate reference generalized
Kottler metrics. Those inequalities yield an inequality which is opposite to
the conjectured generalized Penrose inequality. They can thus be used to prove
a uniqueness theorem for the generalized Kottler black holes if the generalized
Penrose inequality can be established.
