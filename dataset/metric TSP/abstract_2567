We construct an explicit map that transforms static, generalized sine-Gordon
metrics to black hole type metrics. This, in particular, provides for a further
description of the Cadoni correspondence (which extends the
Gegenberg-Kunstatter correspondence) of soliton solutions and extremal black
hole solutions in 2D dilaton gravity.
