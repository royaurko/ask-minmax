We present three large classes of examples of conformal structures for which
the equations for the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric to be Ricci-flat are
linear PDEs, which we solve explicitly. These explicit solutions enable us to
discuss the holonomy of the corresponding ambient metrics. Our examples include
conformal pp-waves and, more importantly, conformal structures that are defined
by generic rank 2 and 3 distributions in respective dimensions 5 and 6. The
corresponding explicit Fefferman-Graham ambient metrics provide a large class
of metrics with holonomy equal to the exceptional non-compact Lie group
$\mathbf{G}_2$ as well as ambient metrics with holonomy contained in
$\mathbf{Spin}(4,3)$.
