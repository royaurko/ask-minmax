A solution to the gravitational field equations based on a non-symmetric
metric tensor is examined. Unlike Einstein's interpretation of
electromagnetism, or Moffat's generalized gravity, it is shown that the
non-symmetric part of the metric tensor is the potential of the spin field.
This is in agreement with string theory and provides a natural coupling between
gravitation and strings.
