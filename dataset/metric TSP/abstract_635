We consider manifolds endowed with metric contact pairs for which the two
characteristic foliations are orthogonal. We give some properties of the
curvature tensor and in particular a formula for the Ricci curvature in the
direction of the sum of the two Reeb vector fields. This shows that metrics
associated to normal contact pairs cannot be flat. Therefore flat non-K\"ahler
Vaisman manifolds do not exist. Furthermore we give a local classification of
metric contact pair manifolds whose curvature vanishes on the vertical
subbundle. As a corollary we have that flat associated metrics can only exist
if the leaves of the characteristic foliations are at most three-dimensional.
