We consider a class of black holes for which the area of the two-dimensional
spatial cross-section has a minimum on the horizon with respect to a
quasiglobal (Krusckal-like) coordinate. If the horizon is regular, one can
generate a tubelike counterpart of such a metric and smoothly glue it to a
black hole region. The resulting composite space-time is globally regular, so
all potential singuilarities under the horizon of the original metrics are
removed. Such a space-time represents a black hole without an apparent horizon.
It is essential that the matter should be non-vacuum in the outer region but
vacuumlike in the inner one. As an example we consider the noninteracting
mixture of vacuum fluid and matter with a linear equation of state and scalar
phantom fields. This approach is extended to distorted metrics, with the
requirement of spherical symmetry relaxed.
