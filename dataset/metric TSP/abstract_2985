We consider a complex Hermitian manifold of complex dimensions four with a
Hermitian metric and a Chern connection. It is shown that the action that
determines the dynamics of the metric is unique, provided that the linearized
Einstein action coupled to an antisymmetric tensor is obtained, in the limit
when the imaginary coordinates vanish. The unique action is of the Chern-Simons
type when expressed in terms of the K\"{a}hler form. The antisymmetric tensor
field has gauge transformations coming from diffeomorphism invariance in the
complex directions. The equations of motion must be supplemented by boundary
conditions imposed on the Hermitian metric to give, in the limit of vanishing
imaginary coordinates, the low-energy effective action for a curved metric
coupled to an antisymmetric tensor.
