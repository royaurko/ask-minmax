We propose a variable metric extension of the forward--backward-forward
algorithm for finding a zero of the sum of a maximally monotone operator and a
Lipschitzian monotone operator in Hilbert spaces. In turn, this framework
provides a variable metric splitting algorithm for solving monotone inclusions
involving sums of composite operators. Several splitting algorithms recently
proposed in the literature are recovered as special cases.
