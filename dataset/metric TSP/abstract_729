In this paper, we prove results concerning the large scale geometry of
connected, simply connected nonabelian nilpotent Lie groups equipped with left
invariant Riemannian metrics. Precisely, we prove that there do not exist
quasi-isometric embeddings of such a nilpotent Lie group into either a CAT(0)
metric space or an Alexandrov metric space with curvature bounded below. The
main technical aspect of this work is the proof of a limited metric
differentiability of Lipschitz maps between connected graded nilpotent Lie
groups equipped with left invariant Carnot-Caratheodory metrics and complete
metric spaces.
