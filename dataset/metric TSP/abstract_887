We give an easy proof of Sch\"utzenberger's Theorem stating that
non-commutative formal power series are rational if and only if they are
recognisable. A byproduct of this proof is a natural metric on a subgroup of
invertible rational non-commutative power series. We describe a few features of
this metric group.
