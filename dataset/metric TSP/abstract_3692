We present a countably infinite number of new explicit co-homogeneity one
Sasaki-Einstein metrics on S^2 x S^3, in both the quasi-regular and irregular
classes. These give rise to new solutions of type IIB supergravity which are
expected to be dual to N=1 superconformal field theories in four-dimensions
with compact or non-compact R-symmetry and rational or irrational central
charges, respectively.
