In this paper, we extend Su-Zhang's Cheeger-Mueller type theorem for
symmetric bilinear torsions to manifolds with boundary in the case that the
Riemannian metric and the non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form are of product
structure near the boundary. Our result also extends Bruening-Ma's
Cheeger-Mueller type theorem for Ray-Singer metric on manifolds with boundary
to symmetric bilinear torsions in product case. We also compare it with the
Ray-Singer analytic torsion on manifolds with boundary.
