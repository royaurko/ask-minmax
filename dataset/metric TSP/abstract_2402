This paper deals with the theoretical modeling of anisotropic compact stars
in the framework of $f(T)$ theory of gravity, where $T$ is torsion scalar. To
this end, we have used the exact solutions of Krori and Barua metric to a
static spherically symmetric metric. The unknown constants involved in the
Krori and Barua metric have been specified by using the masses and radii of
compact stars 4$U$1820-30, Her X-1, SAX J 1808-3658. The physical properties of
these stars have been analyzed in the framework of $f(T)$ theory. In this
setting, we have checked the anisotropic behavior, regularity conditions,
stability and surface redshift of the compact stars.
