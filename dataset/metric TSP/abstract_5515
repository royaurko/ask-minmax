By using a solution ansatz we partially decouple the metric and the
Stuckelberg sectors of the minimal massive gravity (MMGR). In this scheme for a
diagonal physical metric we find the general solutions for the scalars of the
theory and the particular fiducial (background) metric which leads to these
solutions. Then we adopt this general formalism to construct the derivation of
new Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies of the theory in the
presence of a so-called effective ideal fluid which arises from our solution
ansatz as a modifying, non-physical source for the Einstein and the
corresponding Friedmann equations.
