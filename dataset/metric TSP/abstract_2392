We study Laplace eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ on K\"ahler manifolds as functionals
on the space of K\"ahler metrics with cohomologous K\"ahler forms. We introduce
a natural notion of a $\lambda_k$-extremal K\"ahler metric and obtain necessary
and sufficient conditions for it. A particular attention is paid to the
$\lambda_1$-extremal properties of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics of positive scalar
curvature on manifolds with non-trivial holomorphic vector fields.
