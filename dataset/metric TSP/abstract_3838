Ultrametric concepts are applied to the Bernoulli map, showing the
adequateness of the non-Archimedean metrics to describe in a simple and direct
way the chaotic properties of this map. Lyapunov exponent and Kolmogorov
entropy appear to find a simpler explanation. A p-adic time emerges as a
natural consequence of the ultrametric properties of the map.
