We construct left invariant quaternionic contact (qc) structures on Lie
groups with zero and non-zero torsion and with non-vanishing quaternionic
contact conformal curvature tensor, thus showing the existence of non-flat
quaternionic contact manifolds. We prove that the product of the real line with
a seven dimensional manifold, equipped with a certain qc structure, has a
quaternionic Kaehler metric as well as a metric with holonomy contained in
Spin(7). As a consequence we determine explicit quaternionic Kaehler metrics
and Spin(7)-holonomy metrics which seem to be new. Moreover, we give explicit
non-compact eight dimensional almost quaternion hermitian manifolds with either
a closed fundamental four form or fundamental two forms defining a differential
ideal that are not quaternionic Kaehler.
