We bring together those systems of hydrodynamical type that can be written as
geodesic equations on diffeomorphism groups or on extensions of diffeomorphism
groups with right invariant $L^2$ or $H^1$ metrics. We present their formal
derivation starting from Euler's equation, the first order equation satisfied
by the right logarithmic derivative of a geodesic in Lie groups with right
invariant metrics.
