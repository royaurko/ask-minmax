A partially alternative derivation of the expression for the time dilation
effect in a uniform static gravitational field is obtained by means of a
thought experiment in which rates of clocks at rest at different heights are
compared using as reference a clock bound to a free falling reference system
(FFRS). Derivations along these lines have already been proposed, but generally
introducing some shortcut in order to make the presentation elementary. The
treatment is here exact: the clocks whose rates one wishes to compare are let
to describe their world lines (Rindler's hyperbolae) with respect to the FFRS,
and the result is obtained by comparing their lengths in space-time. The
exercise may nonetheless prove pedagogically instructive insofar as it shows
that the some results of General Relativity (GR) can be obtained in terms of
physical and geometrical reasoning without having recourse to the general
formalism. The corresponding GR metric is derived, to the purpose of making a
comparison with solutions of Einstein field equation and with other metrics.
For this reasons this paper also compels to deal with a few subtle points
inherent in the very foundations of GR.
