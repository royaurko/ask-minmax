Einstein's theory of general relativity is written in terms of the variables
obtained from a conformal--traceless decomposition of the spatial metric and
extrinsic curvature. The determinant of the conformal metric is not restricted,
so the action functional and equations of motion are invariant under conformal
transformations. With this approach the conformal--traceless variables remain
free of density weights. The conformal invariance of the equations of motion
can be broken by imposing an evolution equation for the determinant of the
conformal metric g. Two conditions are considered, one in which g is constant
in time and one in which g is constant along the unit normal to the spacelike
hypersurfaces. This approach is used to write the
Baumgarte--Shapiro--Shibata--Nakamura system of evolution equations in
conformally invariant form. The presentation includes a discussion of the
conformal thin sandwich construction of gravitational initial data, and the
conformal flatness condition as an approximation to the evolution equations.
