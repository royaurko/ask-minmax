We study reparametrization invariant Sobolev metrics on spaces of regular
curves. We discuss their completeness properties and the resulting usability
for applications in shape analysis. In particular, we will argue, that the
development of efficient numerical methods for higher order Sobolev type
metrics is an extremely desirable goal.
