Singular Finsler metrics, such as Kropina metrics and $m$-Kropina metrics,
have a lot of applications in the real world. In this paper, we consider a
special class of singular Finsler metrics: $m$-Kropina metrics which are
defined by a Riemannian metric and a 1-form on a manifold. We show that an
$m$-Kropina metric ($m\ne -1$) of scalar flag curvature must be locally
Minkowskian in dimension $n\ge 3$. For $m=-1$, we respectively characterize
Kropina metrics which are of scalar flag curvature and locally projectively
flat in dimension $n\ge 3$ by some equations, and obtain some principles and
approaches of constructing non-trivial examples of Kropina metrics of scalar
flag curvature.
