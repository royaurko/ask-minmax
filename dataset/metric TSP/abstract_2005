We consider a family of manifolds with a class of degenerating warped product
metrics $g_\epsilon=\rho(\epsilon,t)^{2a}dt^2 +\rho(\epsilon,t)^{2b}ds_M^2$,
with $M$ compact, $\rho$ homogeneous degree one, $a \le -1$ and $b > 0$. We
study the Laplace operator acting on $L^{2}$ differential $p$-forms and give
sharp accumulation rates for eigenvalues near the bottom of the essential
spectrum of the limit manifold with metric $g_{0}$.
