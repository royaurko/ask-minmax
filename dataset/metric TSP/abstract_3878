The quarkonium states in a quark-gluon plasma is examined with the heavy
quark potential implied by the holographic principle. Both the vanila
AdS-Schwarzschild metric and the one with an infrared cutoff are considered.
The dissociation temperature is calculated by solving the Schr\"o dinger
equation of the potential model. In the case of the AdS-Schwarzschild metric
with a IR cutoff, the dissociation temperatures for $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$
with the U-ansatz of the potential are found to agree with the lattice results
within a factor of two.
