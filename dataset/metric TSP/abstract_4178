A metric of Birkhoffian form is employed to model a hybrid astrophysical
compact object consisting of a preon gas core, a mantle of electrically charged
hot quark-gluon plasma, and an outer envelope of charged hadronic matter which
is matched to an exterior Reissner-Nordstr\"om vacuum. The piecewise-continuous
metric and the pressure and density functions consist of polynomials that are
everywhere well-behaved. Boundary conditions at each interface yield estimates
for physical parameters applicable to each layer, and to the star as a whole.
