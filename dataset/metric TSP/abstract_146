In the present paper, the flag curvature of invariant Randers metrics on
homogeneous spaces and Lie groups is studied. We first give an explicit formula
for the flag curvature of invariant Randers metrics arising from invariant
Riemannian metrics on homogeneous spaces and, in special case, Lie groups. We
then study Randers metrics of constant positive flag curvature and complete
underlying Riemannian metric on Lie groups. Finally we give some properties of
those Lie groups which admit a left invariant non-Riemannian Randers metric of
Berwald type arising from a left invariant Riemannian metric and a left
invariant vector field.
