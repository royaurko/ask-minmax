The metric-affine gravity provides a useful framework for analyzing
gravitational dynamics since it treats metric tensor and affine connection as
fundamentally independent variables. In this work, we show that, a
metric-affine gravity theory composed of the invariants formed from
non-metricity, torsion and curvature tensors can be decomposed into a theory of
scalar, vector and tensor fields. These fields are natural candidates for the
ones needed by various cosmological and other phenomena. Indeed, we show that
the model accommodates TeVeS gravity (relativistic modified gravity theory),
vector inflation, and aether-like models. Detailed analyses of these and other
phenomena can lead to a standard metric-affine gravity model encoding scalars,
vectors and tensors.
