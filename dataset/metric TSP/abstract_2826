In this article, we consider the space of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g loops on a Polish
space $S$. The loop space can be equipped with a ``Skorokhod'' metric.
Moreover, it is Polish under this metric. Our main result is to prove that the
Borel-$\sigma$-field on the space of loops is generated by a class of loop
functionals: the multi-occupation field. This result generalizes the result in
the discrete case, see \cite{loop}.
