The method of non-Riemannian volume-forms (metric-independent covariant
integration measure densities on the spacetime manifold) is applied to
construct a unified model of dynamical dark energy plus dark matter as a dust
fluid resulting from a hidden Noether symmetry of the pertinent scalar field
Lagrangian. Canonical Hamiltonian treatment and Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of
the latter model are briefly discussed.
