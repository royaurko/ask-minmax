Recent SN1a data have probed deeper into space than ever before. Plotted as
distance vs. recession speed, a disturbing non-linearity is found which has led
to speculations about "dark energy" which somehow acts like anti-gravity. This
study finds a full explanation in relativity theory. The metric of space
shrinks, in the presence of a gravitational potential, V, by exp(V/c^2). Early
in the big bang, when the SN1a's sent their signals, V was larger than now. By
fitting the data to a relativistic model, we probe the metric of the early big
bang. V, due to all mass in the big bang, is a billion times larger than that
provided by earth gravity alone. The big bang is modeled as a sphere of
constant density, of radius R_0 = cT. The metrics of time and distance shrink,
each by alpha = exp(V/c^2, and this study finds the data fitted by 1/alpha =
1.55. Earlier, 1/alpha was much larger. As with the deflection of starlight and
the Shapiro time delay, gravity affects space like an index of refraction,
n=1/alpha^2. The Hubble concept remains valid, but with geometric distance
instead of optical distance. A 2-parameter fit to 3 sets of data finds
T=16.24x10^9 years and total mass in our big bang is now M=6.03x10^52 kg (all
in our metric). Because n, now 2.41, shrinks with time, all standards of M, L,
and T (including atomic standards) are changing by a few parts per billion per
decade and should be referenced to a time definite.
