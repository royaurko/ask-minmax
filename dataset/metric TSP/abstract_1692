Spacetime is considered to be everywhere Minkowski except at the location
where a signal wave of energy interacts with the gravitational field. The
conformal metric f[k(x-vt)]Nuv is suitably chosen to represent this
interaction, where f[k(x-vt)]is a generalized wave or signal function.
Parametrized and Taylor expanded at zero, the spacetime metric is transformed
into a Haar wavelet having parameter width tau. Applying the Haar metric to the
time component of General Relativistic wave equation reduces it from a second
ordered covariant differential equation to a first ordered partial differential
equation that allows the Einstein Tensor to be easily be expressed in the
familiar Poisson form for gravitation. By comparison with the matter density of
this equation, to the Haar-Einstein result, shows that the wavelength of a
graviton becomes the fundamental source for gravitational attraction. Since the
signal wave is unidirectional, it strongly supports Machs assumption that
inertia arises from all the matter in the universe. Furthermore, because the
Haar metric is conformal, the signal metric is solved for exactly.
