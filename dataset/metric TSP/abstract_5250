We study the structure of a metric $n$-Lie algebra $\mathcal {G}$ over the
complex field $\mathbb C$. Let $\mathcal {G}= \mathcal S\oplus {\mathcal R}$ be
the Levi decomposition, where $\mathcal R$ is the radical of $\mathcal {G}$ and
$\mathcal S$ is a strong semisimple subalgebra of $\mathcal {G}$. Denote by
$m(\mathcal {G})$ the number of all minimal ideals of an indecomposable metric
$n$-Lie algebra and $\mathcal R^\bot$ the orthogonal complement of $R$. We
obtain the following results. As $\mathcal S$-modules, $\mathcal R^{\bot}$ is
isomorphic to the dual module of $\mathcal {G} / \mathcal R.$ The dimension of
the vector space spanned by all nondegenerate invariant symmetric bilinear
forms on $\mathcal {G}$ equals that of the vector space of certain linear
transformations on $\mathcal {G}$; this dimension is greater than or equal to
$m(\mathcal {G}) + 1$. The centralizer of $\mathcal R$ in $\mathcal G$ equals
the sum of all minimal ideals; it is the direct sum of $\mathcal R^\bot$ and
the center of $\mathcal {G}$. The sufficient and necessary condition for
$\mathcal {G}$ having no strong semisimple ideals is that $\mathcal R^\bot
\subseteq \mathcal R$.
