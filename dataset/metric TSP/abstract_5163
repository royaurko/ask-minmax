An iterative method for recovering the bulk information in asymptotically AdS
spacetimes is presented. We consider zero energy spacelike geodesics and their
relation to the entanglement entropy in three dimensions to determine the
metric in certain symmetric cases. A number of comparisons are made with an
alternative extraction method presented in arXiv:hep-th/0609202, and the two
methods are then combined to allow metric recovery in the most general type of
static, spherically symmetric setups. We conclude by extracting the mass and
density profiles for a toy model example of a gas of radiation in
(2+1)-dimensional AdS.
