In this paper we consider strata of flat metrics coming from quadratic
differentials (semi-translation structures) on surfaces of finite type. We
provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of simple closed curves
to be spectrally rigid over a stratum with enough complexity, extending a
result of Duchin-Leininger-Rafi. Specifically, for any stratum with more zeroes
than the genus, the length spectrum of a set of simple closed curves determines
the flat metric in the stratum if and only if the set is dense in the
projective measured foliation space. We also prove that flat metrics in any
stratum are locally determined by the length spectrum of a finite set of closed
curves.
