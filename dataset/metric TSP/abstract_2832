Let $M$ be a compact manifold and $\text{Diff}^1_m(M)$ be the set of $C^1$
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of $M$. We prove that there is a residual
subset $\mathcal {R}\subset \text{Diff}^1_m(M)$ such that each $f\in
\mathcal{R}$ is a continuity point of the map $g\to h_m(g)$ from
$\text{Diff}^1_m(M)$ to $\mathbb{R}$, where $h_m(g)$ is the metric entropy of
$g$ with respect to volume measure $m$.
