In order to characterize molecular structures we introduce configurational
fingerprint vectors which are counterparts of quantities used experimentally to
identify structures. The Euclidean distance between the configurational
fingerprint vectors satisfies the properties of a metric and can therefore
safely be used to measure dissimilarities between configurations in the high
dimensional configuration space. We show that these metrics correlate well with
the RMSD between two configurations if this RMSD is obtained from a global
minimization over all translations, rotations and permutations of atomic
indices. We introduce a Monte Carlo approach to obtain this global minimum of
the RMSD between configurations.
