An (n,d) permutation array (PA) is a set of permutations of length n with the
property that the distance (under some metric) between any two permutations in
the array is at least d. They became popular recently for communication over
power lines. Motivated by an application to flash memories, in this paper the
metric used is the Chebyshev metric. A number of different constructions are
given as well as bounds on the size of such PA.
