In this paper we define a new convergence called "asymptotically conic
convergence" in which a smooth family of Riemannian metrics on a fixed compact
manifold degenerate to a metric with isolated conic singularity. Our results
are: convergence of the spectrum of the geometric Laplacians and uniform
convergence of the corresponding heat kernels and existence of a full
asymptotic expansion with uniform convergence for all time. Techniques include:
the resolution of a conic singularity using a new "resolution blowup" and
microlocal analysis using pseudodifferential operator calculi on manifolds with
corners constructed by various (standard and non-standard) blowups.
