Let $X_0$ be a complete hyperbolic surface of infinite type that has a
geodesic pants decomposition with cuff lengths bounded above. The length
spectrum Teichm\"uller space $T_{ls}(X_0)$ consists of homotopy classes of
hyperbolic metrics on $X_0$ such that the ratios of the corresponding simple
closed geodesic for the hyperbolic metric on $X_0$ and for the other hyperbolic
metric are bounded from the below away from 0 and from the above away from
$\infty$ (cf. \cite{ALPS}). This paper studies earthquakes in the length
spectrum Teichm\"uller space $T_{ls}(X_0)$. We find a necessary condition and
several sufficient conditions on earthquake measure $\mu$ such that the
corresponding earthquake $E^{\mu}$ describes the hyperbolic metric on $X_0$
which is in the length spectrum Teichm\"uller space. Moreover, we give examples
of earthquake paths $t\mapsto E^{t\mu}$, for $t\geq 0$, such that $E^{t\mu}\in
T_{ls}(X_0)$ for $0\leq t<t_0$, $E^{t_0\mu}\notin T_{ls}(X_0)$ and $E^{t\mu}\in
T_{ls}(X_0)$ for $t>t_0$.
