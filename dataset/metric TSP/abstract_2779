In this paper, we study the coarse embedding into Banach space. We proved
that under certain conditions, the property of embedding into Banach space can
be preserved under taking the union the metric spaces. For a group $G$ strongly
relative hyperbolic to a subgroup $H$, we proved that if $H$ admits a coarse
embedding into a uniformly convex Banach space, so is $B(n)=\{g\in
G|\abs{g}_{S\cup\mathscr{H}}\leq n\}$.
