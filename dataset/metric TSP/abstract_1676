In Finsler geometry the complete lift vector fields have distinguished
geometric significance. For example a vector field on a Finsler manifold is
said to be conformal if its complete lift is conformal in usual sense. In this
work we define a new Riemannian or Pseudo-Riemannian metric on TM derived from
a Finsler metric on the base manifold M. This metric is in some senses more
general than the other lift metrics defined previously on TM and then we study
the complete lift vector fields on TM. More precisely we prove; Let (M,g) be a
Finsler manifold, TM its tangent bundle and G a Riemannian metric on TM derived
from g. Then every complete lift conformal vector field is homothetic.
