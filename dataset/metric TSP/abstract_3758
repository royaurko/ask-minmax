After work of W. P. Thurston, C. Bavard and \'E. Ghys constructed particular
hyperbolic polyhedra from spaces of deformations of Euclidean polygons. We
present this construction as a straightforward consequence of the theory of
mixed-volumes. The gluing of these polyhedra can be isometrically embedded into
complex hyperbolic cone-manifolds constructed by Thurston from spaces of
deformations of Euclidean polyhedra. It is then possible to deduce the metric
structure of the spaces of polygons embedded in complex hyperbolic orbifolds
discovered by P. Deligne and G. D. Mostow.
