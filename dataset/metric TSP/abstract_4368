Let $(M,g)$ be an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold and $T^{*}M$ be its
cotangent bundle equipped with a Riemannian metric of Cheeger Gromoll type
which rescale the horizontal part by a nonzero differentiable function. The
main purpose of the present paper is to discuss curvature properties of
$T^{*}M$ and construct almost paracomplex Norden structures on $T^{*}M$. We
investigate conditions for these structures to be para-K\"ahler
(paraholomorphic) and quasi-K\"ahler. Also, some properties of almost
paracomplex Norden structures in context of almost product Riemannian manifolds
are presented.
