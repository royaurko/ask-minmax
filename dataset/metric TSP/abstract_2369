In this paper we will analyse the inner product for gauge theories in de
Sitter spacetime. This will be done by analysing an Euclidean version of the de
Sitter metric. Thus, the de Sitter metric will be related to the metric on a
four-sphere. Then scalar spherical harmonics and vector spherical harmonics on
a four-sphere will be analysed. An inner product for the gauge fields will be
constructed using these modes. Finally, a two point function will be
constructed, for gauge fields on de Sitter spacetime.
