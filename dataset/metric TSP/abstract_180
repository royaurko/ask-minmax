We are interested in studying doubling metric spaces with the property that
at some of the points the metric tangent is unique. In such a setting,
Finsler-Carnot-Caratheodory geometries and Carnot groups appear as models for
the tangents. The results are based on an analogue for metric spaces of
Preiss's phenomenon: tangents of tangents are tangents.
