We establish Talagrand's $T_1$ and $T_2$ inequalities for the law of the
solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian
motion with Hurst parameter $H>1/2$. We use the $L^2$ metric and the uniform
metric on the path space of continuous functions on $[0,T]$. These results are
applied to study small-time and large-time asymptotics for the solutions of
such equations by means of a Hoeffding-type inequality.
