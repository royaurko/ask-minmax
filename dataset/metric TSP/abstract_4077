In this paper we investigate a complex symmetric generalization of general
relativity and in particular we investigate its linearized field equations. We
begin by reviewing some basic definitions and structures in Moffat's symmetric
complex metric field theory of gravity. We then move on to derive the
linearized retarded complex field equations. In addition to this we also derive
a linearization of Moffat's field equations based on the more rigorous Fermi
coordinate approach. In conclusion it is shown that the linearized symmetric
complex field equations leads to a complex form of gravitomagnetism. We also
briefly review the gravitational wave equation from the source less linearized
symmetric complex field equations and discuss some open problems.
