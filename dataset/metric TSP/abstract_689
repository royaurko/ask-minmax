We prove that there are asymptotically anti-de Sitter Einstein metrics with
prescribed conformal infinity. More precisely we show that, given any suitably
small perturbation $\hat g$ of the conformal metric of the $(n+1)$-dimensional
anti-de Sitter space at timelike infinity, which is given by the canonical
Lorentzian metric on the $n$-dimensional cylinder, there is a Lorentzian
Einstein metric on $(-T,T)\times \mathbb{B}^n$ whose conformal geometry is
given by $\hat g$. This is a Lorentzian counterpart of the Graham-Lee theorem
in Riemannian geometry and is motivated by the holographic prescription problem
in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory.
