The nexus between the gravitational field and the space-time metric was an
essential element in Einstein's development of General Relativity and led him
to his discovery of the field equations for the gravitational field/metric. I
will argue here that the metric is in fact an inessential element of this
theory and can be dispensed with entirely. Its sole function in the theory was
to describe the space-time measurements made by ideal clocks and rods. However,
the behavior of model clocks and measuring rods can be derived directly from
the field equations of General Relativity using the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann
(EIH) approiximation procedure. Therefore one does not need to introduce these
ideal clocks and rods and hence has no need of a metric.
