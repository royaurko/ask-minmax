We show that rough isometries between metric spaces X, Y can be lifted to the
spaces of real valued 1-Lipschitz functions over X and Y with supremum metric
and apply this to their scaling limits. For the inverse, we show how rough
isometries between X and Y can be reconstructed from structurally enriched
rough isometries between their Lipschitz function spaces.
