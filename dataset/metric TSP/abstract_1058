We discuss theoretical formalisms concerning with experimental verification
of General Relativity (GR). Non-metric generalizations of GR are considered and
a system of postulates is formulated for metric-affine and Finsler
gravitational theories. We consider local observer reference frames to be a
proper tool for comparing predictions of alternative theories with each other
and with the observational data. Integral formula for geodesic deviation due to
the deformation of connection is obtained. This formula can be applied for
calculations of such effects as the bending of light and time-delay in presence
of non-metrical effects.
