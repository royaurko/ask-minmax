Using the quasi-Maxwell form of the vacuum Einstein equations and demanding
the presence of a cylindrically symmetric radial gravomagnetic field, we find
the solution to the Einstein equations which represents the gravity field of a
line gravomagnetic monopole. We show that this is the generalization of the
Levi-Civita's cylindrically symmetric static spacetime, in the same way that
the NUT metric is the empty space generalization of the Schwarzschild metric.
  Some of the features of this metric as well as its relation to other metrics
are discussed.
