General Relativity's Kerr metric is famous for its many symmetries which are
responsible for the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation governing the
geodesic motion and of the Teukolsky equation for wave dynamics. We show that
there is a unique stationary and axisymmetric Newtonian gravitational potential
that has exactly the same dual property of separable point-particle and wave
motion equations. This `Kerr metric analogue' of Newtonian gravity is none
other than Euler's 18th century problem of two-fixed gravitating centers.
