The global holomorphic \alpha-invariant introduced by Tian is closely related
with the study in the existence of Kahler-Einstein metric. We apply the result
of Tian, Lu and Zelditch on polarized Kahler metrics to approximate
plurisubharmonic functions and compute the \alpha-invariant of toric Fano
manifolds.
