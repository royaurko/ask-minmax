We investigate harmonic forms of geometrically formal metrics, which are
defined as those having the exterior product of any two harmonic forms still
harmonic. We prove that a formal Sasakian metric can exist only on a real
cohomology sphere and that holomorphic forms of a formal K\"ahler metric are
parallel w.r.t. the Levi-Civita connection. In the general Riemannian case a
formal metric with maximal second Betti number is shown to be flat. Finally we
prove that a six-dimensional manifold with $b_1 \neq 1, b_2 \geqslant 2$ and
not having the cohomology algebra of $\mathbb{T}^3 \times S^3$ carries a
symplectic structure as soon as it admits a formal metric.
