We study geodesics of Hofer's metric on the space of Lagrangian submanifolds
in arbitrary symplectic manifolds from the variational point of view. We give a
characterization of length-critical paths with respect to this metric. As a
result, we prove that if two Lagrangian submanifolds are disjoint then we
cannot join them by length-minimizing geodesics.
