A manifold with fibered cusp metrics $X$ can be considered as a geometrical
generalization of locally symmetric spaces of $\mathbb{Q}$-rank one at
infinity. We prove a Hodge-type theorem for this class of Riemannian manifolds,
i.e. we find harmonic representatives of the de Rham cohomology $H^p(X)$.
Similar to the situation of locally symmetric spaces, these representatives are
computed by special values or residues of generalized eigenforms of the
Hodge-Laplace-Operator on $\Omega^p(X)$.
