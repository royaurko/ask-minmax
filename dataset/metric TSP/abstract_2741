We study the convergence behavior of the general inverse $\sigma_k$-flow on
K\"{a}hler manifolds with initial metrics satisfying the Calabi Ansatz. The
limiting metrics can be either smooth or singular. In the latter case,
interesting conic singularities along negatively self-intersected sub-varieties
are formed as a result of partial blow-up.
