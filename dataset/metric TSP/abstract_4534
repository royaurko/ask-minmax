We establish $L^2$ extension theorems for $\bar \partial$-closed
$(0,q)$-forms with values in a holomorphic line bundle with smooth Hermitian
metric, from a smooth hypersurface on a Stein manifold. Our result extends (and
gives a new, perhaps more classical, proof of) a theorem of Berndtsson on
compact K\"ahler manifolds, which itself is a sharpening of the theorem of
Koziarz. The proof makes use of the Kohn solution, which is the solution of an
(interior) elliptic problem, to handle the well-known regularity issues. As
such, our methods require the line bundle to be equipped with a smooth metric.
