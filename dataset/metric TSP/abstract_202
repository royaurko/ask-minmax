The contributor reviews his results on locally compact homogeneous spaces with
inner metric, in particular, homogeneous manifolds with inner metric. The
latter are isometric to homogeneous (sub-)Finslerian manifolds; under some
additional conditions they are isometric to homogeneous (sub)-Riemannian
manifolds. The class $\Omega$ of all locally compact homogeneous spaces with
inner metric is supplied with some metric $d_{BGH}$ such that 1)
$(\Omega,d_{BGH})$ is a complete metric space; 2) a sequences in
$(\Omega,d_{BGH})$ is converging if and only if it is converging in
Gromov-Hausdorff sense; 3) the subclasses $\mathfrak{M}$ of homogeneous
manifolds with inner metric and $\mathfrak{LG}$ of connected Lie groups with
left-invariant Finslerian metric are everywhere dense in $(\Omega,d_{BGH}).$ It
is given a metric characterization of Carnot groups with left-invariant
sub-Finslerian metric. At the end are described homogeneous manifolds such that
any invariant inner metric on any of them is Finslerian.
