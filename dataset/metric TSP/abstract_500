Chidamber and Kemerer first defined a cohesion measure for object-oriented
software - the Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM) metric. This paper presents a
pedagogic evaluation and discussion about the LCOM metric using field data from
three industrial systems. System 1 has 34 classes, System 2 has 383 classes and
System 3 has 1055 classes. The main objectives of the study were to determine
if the LCOM metric was appropriate in the measurement of class cohesion and the
determination of properly and improperly designed classes in the studied
systems. Chidamber and Kemerer's suite of metric was used as metric tool.
Descriptive statistics was used to analyze results. The result of the study
showed that in System 1, 78.8% (26 classes) were cohesive; System 2 54% (207
classes) were cohesive; System 3 30% (317 classes) were cohesive. We suggest
that the LCOM metric measures class cohesiveness and was appropriate in the
determination of properly and improperly designed classes in the studied
system.
