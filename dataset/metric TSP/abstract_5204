We generalize recent work to construct a map from the conformal Navier Stokes
equations with holographically determined transport coefficients, in d
spacetime dimensions, to the set of asymptotically locally AdS_{d+1} long
wavelength solutions of Einstein's equations with a negative cosmological
constant, for all d>2. We find simple explicit expressions for the stress
tensor (slightly generalizing the recent result by Haack and Yarom
(arXiv:0806.4602)), the full dual bulk metric and an entropy current of this
strongly coupled conformal fluid, to second order in the derivative expansion,
for arbitrary d>2. We also rewrite the well known exact solutions for rotating
black holes in AdS_{d+1} space in a manifestly fluid dynamical form,
generalizing earlier work in d=4. To second order in the derivative expansion,
this metric agrees with our general construction of the metric dual to fluid
flows.
