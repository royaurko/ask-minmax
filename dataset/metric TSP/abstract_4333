We investigate the dependence of thermodynamic properties of black holes on
the choice of statistical ensemble for a particular class of
Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet black holes with cosmological constant. We use
partial Legendre transformations in the thermodynamic limit in order to compare
the results in different ensembles, and show that the phase transition
structure depend on the choice of thermodynamic potential. This result implies
that thermodynamic metrics which are partially Legendre invariant cannot be
employed to describe black hole thermodynamics, and partly explains why a
particular thermodynamic metric has been used so far in the framework of black
hole geometrothermodynamics.
