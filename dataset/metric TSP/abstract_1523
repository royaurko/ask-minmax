Two Kaehler metrics on one complex manifold are said to be c-projectively
equivalent if their J-planar curves, i.e., curves defined by the property that
their acceleration is complex proportional to their velocity, coincide. The
degree of mobility of a Kaehler metric is the dimension of the space of metrics
that are c-projectively equivalent to it. We give the list of all possible
values of the degree of mobility of simply connected 2n-dimensional Riemannian
Kaehler manifolds. We also describe all such values under the additional
assumption that the metric is Einstein. As an application, we describe all
possible dimensions of the space of essential c-projective vector fields of
Kaehler and Kaehler-Einstein Riemannian metrics. We also show that two
c-projectively equivalent Kaehler Einstein metrics (of arbitrary signature) on
a closed manifold have constant holomorphic curvature or are affinely
equivalent.
