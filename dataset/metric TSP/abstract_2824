Let $I$ be a segment in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb E^d$.
Let $P$ and $P+I$ be parallelohedra in $\mathbb E^d$, where "+" denotes the
Minkowski sum. We prove that Voronoi's Conjecture holds for $P+I$, i.e. $P+I$
is a Voronoi parallelohedron for some Euclidean metric in $\mathbb E^d$, if
Voronoi's Conjecture holds for $P$.
