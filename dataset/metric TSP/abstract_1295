We investigate the coupling between a Galileon scalar field and massive
gravity through composite metrics. We derive the full set of equations of
motion for a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background, and study linear
perturbations around it. Generally, the nonminimal coupling with the composite
metric will excite all 6 degrees of freedom of the spatial metric
perturbations, one of which may correspond to the Boulware-Deser ghost.
