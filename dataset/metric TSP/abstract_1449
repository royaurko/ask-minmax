We extend Velling's approach and prove that the second variation of the
spherical areas of a family of domains defines a Hermitian metric on the
universal Teichmuller curve, whose pull back to Diff+(S^1)/S^1 coincides with
the Kirillov metric. We show that the vertical integration of the square of the
symplectic form of Velling-Kirillov metric on the universal Teichmuller curve
is the symplectic form that defines the Weil-Petersson metric on the universal
Teichmuller space. Restricted to a finite dimensional Teichmuller space, the
vertical integration of the corresponding form on the Teichmuller curve is also
the symplectic form that defines the Weil-Petersson metric on the Teichmuller
space.
