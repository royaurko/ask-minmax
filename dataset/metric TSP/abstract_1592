High precision astrometry, space missions and certain tests of General
Relativity, require the knowledge of the metric tensor of the solar system, or
more generally, of a gravitational system of N extended bodies. Presently, the
metric of arbitrarily shaped, rotating, oscillating and arbitrarily moving N
bodies of finite extension is only known for the case of slowly moving bodies
in the post-Newtonian approximation, while the post-Minkowskian metric for
arbitrarily moving celestial objects is known only for pointlike bodies with
mass-monopoles and spin-dipoles. As one more step towards the aim of a global
metric for a system of N arbitrarily shaped and arbitrarily moving massive
bodies in post-Minkowskian approximation, two central issues are on the scope
of our investigation:
  (i) We first consider one extended body with full multipole structure in
uniform motion in some suitably chosen global reference system. For this
problem a co-moving inertial system of coordinates can be introduced where the
metric, outside the body, admits an expansion in terms of Damour-Iyer moments.
A Poincare transformation then yields the corresponding metric tensor in the
global system in post-Minkowskian approximation.
  (ii) It will be argued why the global metric, exact to post-Minkowskian
order, can be obtained by means of an instantaneous Poincare transformation for
the case of pointlike mass-monopoles and spin-dipoles in arbitrary motion.
