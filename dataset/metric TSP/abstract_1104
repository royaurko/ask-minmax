The family hyperbolic metric for the plumbing variety $\{zw=t\}$ and the non
holomorphic Eisenstein series $E(\zeta;2)$ are combined to provide an explicit
expansion for the hyperbolic metrics for degenerating families of Riemann
surfaces. Applications include an asymptotic expansion for the Weil-Petersson
metric and a local form of symplectic reduction.
