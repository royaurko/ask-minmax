The goal of this paper is twofold: we study metric measure spaces $(X,d,m)$
with variable lower bounds for the Ricci curvature and we study pathwise
coupling of Brownian motions. Given any lower semicontinuous function $k:X\to
\mathbb R$ we introduce the curvature-dimension condition $CD(k,\infty)$ which
canonically extends the curvature-dimension condition $CD(K,\infty)$ of
Lott-Sturm-Villani for constant $K\in \mathbb R$. For infinitesimally
Hilbertian spaces we prove i) its equivalence to an evolution-variation
inequality $EVI_k$ which in turn extends the $EVI_K$-inequality of
Ambrosio-Gigli-Savar\'e; ii) its stability under convergence and its
local-to-global property.
  For metric measure spaces with uniform lower curvature bounds $K$ we prove
that for each pair of initial distributions $\mu_1,\mu_2$ on $X$ there exists a
coupling $B_t=(B_t^1,B_t^2)$, $t\ge0$, of two Brownian motions on $X$ with the
given initial distributions such that a.s. for all $s,t\ge0$
  $$d(B^1_{s+t},B^2_{s+t})\le e^{-K t/2}\cdot d(B_s^1,B_s^2).$$
