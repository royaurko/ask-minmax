We review the structure of local Lagrangians and field equations for free
bosonic and fermionic gauge fields of mixed symmetry in flat space. These are
first presented in a constrained setting extending the metric formulation of
linearized gravity, and then the ($\gamma$-)trace constraints on fields and
gauge parameters are eliminated via the introduction of auxiliary fields. We
also display the emergence of Weyl-like symmetries in particular classes of
models in low space-time dimensions.
