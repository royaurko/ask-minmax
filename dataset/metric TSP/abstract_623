We show that Gordon metric belongs to a larger class of geometries, which are
responsible to describe the paths of accelerated bodies in moving dielectrics
as geodesics in a metric $\hat q_{\mu\nu}$ different from the background one.
This map depends only on the background metric and on the motion of the bodies
under consideration. As a consequence, this method describes a more general
property that concerns the elimination of any kind of force acting on bodies by
a suitable change of the substratum metric.
