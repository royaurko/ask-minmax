For each sequence X of finite-dimensional Banach spaces there exists a
sequence H of finite connected nweighted graphs with maximum degree 3 such that
the following conditions on a Banach space Y are equivalent: (1) Y admits
uniformly isomorphic embeddings of elements of the sequence X. (2) Y admits
uniformly bilipschitz embeddings of elements of the sequence H.
