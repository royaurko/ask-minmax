We quantise complex, infinite-dimensional projective space CP(H). We apply
the result to quantise a complex, finite-dimensional, classical phase space C
whose symplectic volume is infinite, by holomorphically embedding it into
CP(H). The embedding is univocally determined by requiring it to be an isometry
between the Bergman metric on C and the Fubini-Study metric on CP(H). Then the
Hilbert-space bundle over C is the pullback, by the embedding, of the
Hilbert-space bundle over CP(H).
