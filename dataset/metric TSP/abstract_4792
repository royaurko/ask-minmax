A long-standing open problem in systolic geometry asks whether a Riemannian
metric on the real projective space whose volume equals that of the canonical
metric, but is not isometric to it, must necessarily carry a periodic geodesic
of length smaller than \pi. A contact-geometric reformulation of systolic
geometry and the use of canonical perturbation theory allow us to solve a
parametric version of this problem. Namely, we show that if g_s is a smooth
volume-preserving deformation of the canonical metric and at s=0 the
deformation is not tangent to all orders to trivial deformations (i.e., to
deformations of the form \phi_s^* g_0 for some isotopy \phi_s), then the length
of the shortest periodic geodesic of the metric g_s attains \pi as a strict
local maximum at s=0. This result still holds for complex and quaternionic
projective spaces as well as for the Cayley plane. Moreover, the same
techniques can be applied to show that Zoll Finsler manifolds are the unique
smooth critical points of the systolic volume.
