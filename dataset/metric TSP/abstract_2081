We study the growth of perturbations in an expanding Bianchi type-I metric
that evolves according to an energy density that includes dust and a
cosmological constant. Assuming an epoch where the cosmological constant is
subdominant, we find that, for a reasonably large set of initial conditions,
the metric fluctuations grow fast enough to make the metric inhomogeneous
before the cosmological constant becomes the dominant form of energy. We have
examined values for the cosmological constant that are in the interval $10^{10}
{GeV}$ to $10^{16} {GeV}$.
