A solution of Hilberts fourth problem lead to integral equation of the type
generalized cosine transform. The present paper considers the solution that
integral equation by integral geometry methods and propose an inversion formula
for reconstruction of Crofton measures from projective smooth Finsler metrics
in R3.
