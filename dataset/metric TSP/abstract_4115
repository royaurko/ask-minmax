Let $X$ be a metric space and let $\mu$ be a probability measure on it.
Consider a Lipschitz map $T: X \rightarrow \Rn$, with Lipschitz constant $\leq
1$. Then one can ask whether the image $TX$ can have large projections on many
directions. For a large class of spaces $X$, we show that there are directions
$\phi \in \nsphere$ on which the projection of the image $TX$ is small on the
average, with bounds depending on the dimension $n$ and the eigenvalues of the
Laplacian on $X$.
