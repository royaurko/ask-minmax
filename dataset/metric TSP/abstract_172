A construction of Kaehler-Einstein metrics using Galois coverings, studied by
Arezzo-Ghigi-Pirola, is generalized to orbifolds. By applying it to certain
orbifold covers of P^n which are trivial set theoretically, one obtains new
Einstein metrics on odd-dimensional spheres. The method also gives
Kaehler-Einstein metrics on degree 2 Del Pezzo surfaces with A_1 or
A_2-singularities.
