A Hamming compatible metric is an integer-valued metric on the words of a
finite alphabet which agrees with the usual Hamming distance for words of equal
length. We define a new Hamming compatible metric, compute the cardinality of a
sphere with respect to this metric, and show this metric is minimal in the
class of all "well-behaved" Hamming compatible metrics.
