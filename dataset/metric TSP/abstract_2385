In this work we show how to decompose a linear code relatively to any given
poset metric. We prove that the complexity of syndrome decoding is determined
by a maximal (primary) such decomposition and then show that a refinement of a
partial order leads to a refinement of the primary decomposition. Using this
and considering already known results about hierarchical posets, we can
establish upper and lower bounds for the complexity of syndrome decoding
relatively to a poset metric.
