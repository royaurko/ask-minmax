For smooth metric measure spaces $(M, g, e^{-f} dvol)$ we prove a
Liuoville-type theorem when the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor is nonnegative. This
generalizes a result of Yau, which is recovered in the case $f$ is constant.
This result follows from a gradient estimate for f-harmonic functions on smooth
metric measure spaces with Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor bounded from below.
