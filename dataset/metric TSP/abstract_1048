A family of black-hole solutions in the model with 1-component perfect fluid
is obtained. The metric of any solution contains (n -1) Ricci-flat "internal
space" metrics and for certain equations of state coincides with the metric of
black brane (or black hole) solution in the model with antisymmetric form.
Certain examples (e.g. imitating M2 and M5 black branes) are considered. The
post-Newtonian parameters beta and gamma corresponding to the 4-dimensional
section of the metric are calculated.
