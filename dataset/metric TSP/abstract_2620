The full relativity of the concepts of motion and rest, which is
characteristic of the Einsteinian general relativity (GR), does not allow the
generation of physical gravitational waves (GW's). -- The undulatory nature of
a metric tensor is not an invariant property, but depends on the coordinate
frame. -- An undulation of a metric tensor is propagated with a speed that can
have any value between zero and infinite.
