We give a set of local geometric conditions on a spacetime metric which are
necessary and sufficient for it to be a null electrovacuum, that is, the metric
is part of a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a null
electromagnetic field. These conditions are restrictions on a null congruence
canonically constructed from the spacetime metric, and can involve up to five
derivatives of the metric. The null electrovacuum conditions are counterparts
of the Rainich conditions, which geometrically characterize non-null
electrovacua. Given a spacetime satisfying the conditions for a null
electrovacuum, a straightforward procedure builds the null electromagnetic
field from the metric. Null electrovacuum geometry is illustrated using some
pure radiation spacetimes taken from the literature.
