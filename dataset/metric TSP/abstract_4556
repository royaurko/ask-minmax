We give the characterization of metric measure spaces that satisfy some
synthetic lower Riemannian Ricci curvature bounds (so called $RCD^*(K,N)$
spaces) with \emph{non-empty} one dimensional regular sets. In particular, we
prove that the class of Ricci limit spaces with $Ric \ge K$ and Hausdorff
dimension less than or equal to $N$ and the class of $RCD^*(K,N)$ spaces
coincide for $N < 2$ (They can be either complete intervals or circles). We
will also prove a Bishop-Gromov type inequality (that previously was only known
in Ricci limit spaces) which is also of independent interest.
