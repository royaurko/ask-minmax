Metric-affine geometry provides a non-trivial extension of the general
relativity where the metric and connection are treated as the two independent
fundamental quantities in constructing the space-time (with non-vanishing
torsion and non-metricity). In this paper we study the generic form of action
in this formalism, and then construct the Weyl-invariant version of this
theory. It is shown that in Weitzenbock space, the obtained Weyl-invariant
action can cover the conformally invariant teleparallel action. Finally the
related field equations are obtained in the general case.
