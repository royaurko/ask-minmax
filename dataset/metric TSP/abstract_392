We provide examples of non-locally compact geodesic Ptolemy metric spaces
which are not uniquely geodesic. On the other hand, we show that locally
compact, geodesic Ptolemy metric spaces are uniquely geodesic. Moreover, we
prove that a metric space is CAT(0) if and only if it is Busemann convex and
Ptolemy.
