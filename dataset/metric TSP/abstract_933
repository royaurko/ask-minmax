We consider Hilbert and Funk geometries on a strongly convex domain in the
Euclidean space. We show that, with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the
domain, Hilbert (resp. Funk) metric has the bounded (resp. constant negative)
weighted Ricci curvature. As one of corollaries, these metric measure spaces
satisfy the curvature-dimension condition in the sense of Lott, Sturm and
Villani.
