A Riemann-Lie algebra is a Lie algebra $\cal G$ such that its dual ${\cal
G}^*$ carries a Riemannian metric compatible (in the sense introduced by th
contributor in C. R. Acad. Paris, t. 333, S\'erie I, (2001) 763-768) with the
canonical linear Poisson sructure of ${\cal G}^*$. The notion of Riemann-Lie
algebra has its origins in the study, by the contributor, of Riemann-Poisson
manifolds (see Preprint math.DG/0206102 to appear in Differential Geometry and
its Applications).
  In this paper, we show that, for a Lie group $G$, its Lie algebra $\cal G$
carries a structure of Riemann-Lie algebra iff $G$ carries a flat
left-invariant Riemannian metric. We use this characterization to construct a
huge number of Riemann-Poisson Lie groups (a Riemann-Poisson Lie group is a
Poisson Lie group endowed with a left-invariant Riemannian metric compatible
with the Poisson structure).
