We prove a strong nonstructure theorem for a class of metric structures with
an unstable formula. As a consequence, we show that weak categoricity (that is,
categoricity up to isomorphisms and not isometries) implies several versions of
stability. This is the first step in the direction of the investigation of weak
categoricity of metric classes.
