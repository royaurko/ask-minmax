In the present work we consider an almost complex manifold with Norden metric
(i.e. a metric with respect to which the almost complex structure is an
antiisometry). On such a manifold we study a linear connection preserving the
almost complex structure and the metric and having a totally skew-symmetric
torsion tensor. We consider the case when the manifold admits a connection with
parallel totally skew-symmetric torsion and the case when such connection has a
Kaehler curvature tensor. We get necessary and sufficient conditions for an
isotropic Kaehler manifold with Norden metric.
