We prove that the normal metric contact pairs with orthogonal characteristic
foliations, which are either Bochner flat or locally conformally flat, are
locally isometric to the Hopf manifolds. As a corollary we obtain the
classification of locally conformally flat and Bochner-flat non-K\"ahler
Vaisman manifolds.
