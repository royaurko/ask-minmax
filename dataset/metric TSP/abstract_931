We prove a Rademacher-type theorem for Lipschitz mappings from a subset of a
Carnot group to a Banach homogeneous group, equipped with a suitably weakened
Radon-Nikodym property. We provide a metric area formula that applies to these
mappings and more generally to all almost everywhere metrically differentiable
Lipschitz mappings defined on a Carnot group.
