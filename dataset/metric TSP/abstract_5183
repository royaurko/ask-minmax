We provide the most general embedding of a purely tensional 2-brane in a 3+1
dimensional bulk described by the AdS C-metric. The AdS C-metric has been first
considered as bulk metric by Emparan, Horowitz and Myers (hep-th/9911043 and
hep-th/9912135), who have found metrics describing a brane localized black
hole. In those papers, one of the parameters of the bulk C-metric was
fine-tuned to the brane tension. We relax this fine tuning and we find two new
classes of solutions, the first describing a time dependent, rotationally
symmetric metric, the second describing accelerated black holes on the brane.
This is the first exact solution on the brane describing two objects in
interaction. We discuss the qualitative CFT interpretation of these solutions.
