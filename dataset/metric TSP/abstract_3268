A characterization of the Kerr-NUT-(A)de Sitter metric among four dimensional
\Lambda-vacuum spacetimes admitting a Killing vector is obtained in terms of
the proportionality of the self-dual Weyl tensor and a natural self-dual double
two-form constructed from the Killing vector. This result recovers and extends
a previous characterization of the Kerr and Kerr-NUT metrics. The method of
proof is based on (i) the presence of a second Killing vector field which is
built in terms of geometric information arising from the previous Killing
vector exclusively, and (ii) the existence of an interesting underlying
geometric structure involving a Riemannian submersion of a conformally related
metric, both of which may be of independent interest.
