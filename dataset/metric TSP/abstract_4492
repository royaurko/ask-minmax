The purpose of this note is to generalize the celebrated Ran and Reurings
fixed point theorem to the setting of a space with a binary relation that is
only transitive (and not necessarily a partial order) and a relation-complete
metric. The arguments presented here are simple and straightforward. It is also
shown that extensions by Rakotch and Hu-Kirk of Edelstein's generalization of
the Banach contraction principle to local contractions on chainable complete
metric spaces derive from the theorem of Ran-Reurings.
