An approximate solution to Einstein's equations representing two
widely-separated non-rotating black holes in a circular orbit is constructed by
matching a post-Newtonian metric to two perturbed Schwarzschild metrics. The
spacetime metric is presented in a single coordinate system valid up to the
apparent horizons of the black holes. This metric could be useful in numerical
simulations of binary black holes. Initial data extracted from this metric have
the advantages of being linked to the early inspiral phase of the binary
system, and of not containing spurious gravitational waves.
