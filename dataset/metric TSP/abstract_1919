The nonconformal scalar field is considered in N-dimensional space-time with
metric which includes, in particular, the cases of nonhomogeneous spaces and
anisotropic spaces of Bianchi type-I. The modified Hamiltonian is constructed.
Under the diagonalization of it the energy of quasiparticles is equal to the
oscillator frequency of the wave equation. The density of particles created by
nonstationary metric is investigated. It is shown that the densities of
conformal and nonconformal particles created in Friedmann radiative-dominant
Universe coincide.
