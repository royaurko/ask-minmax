For emergent gravity metrics, presence of dark energy modifies the Hawking
temperature. We show that for the spherically symmetric Reissner-Nordstrom (RN)
background metric, the emergent metric can be mapped into a Robinson-Trautman
blackhole. Allowed values of the dark energy density follow from rather general
conditions. For some allowed value of the dark energy density this blackhole
can have zero Hawking temperature i.e. the blackhole does not radiate. For a
Kerr background along $\theta=0$, the emergent blackhole metric satisfies
Einstein's equations for large $r$ and always radiates. Our analysis is done in
the context of emergent gravity metrics having $k-$essence scalar fields $\phi$
with a Born-Infeld type lagrangian. In both cases the scalar field
$\phi(r,t)=\phi_{1}(r)+\phi_{2}(t)$ also satisfies the emergent gravity
equations of motion for $r\rightarrow\infty$ and $\theta=0$.
