It is argued that string theory predicts unified field theory rather than
general relativity coupled to matter fields. In unified field theory all the
objects are geometrical, for strings the Kalb-Ramond matter field is identical
to the asymmetric part of the metric except that the fields contribute to
different sides of the field equations. The dilaton is related to the object of
non-metricity.
