In this paper, we study Clifford-Wolf translations of homogeneous Randers
metrics on spheres. It turns out that we can present a complete description of
all the Clifford-Wolf translations of all the homogeneous Randers metrics on
spheres. The most important point of this paper is that a new phenomena
surfaces. Namely, we find that there are some CW-homogeneous Randers spaces
which are essentially not symmetric. This is a great difference compared to
Riemannian geometry, where any CW-homogeneous Riemannian manifold must be
locally symmetric.
