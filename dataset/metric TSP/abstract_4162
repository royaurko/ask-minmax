A contractive condition is addressed for extended 2-cyclic self-mappings on
the union of a finite number of subsets of a metric space which are allowed to
have a finite number of successive images in the same subsets of its domain. It
is proven that if the space is uniformly convex and the subsets are non-empty,
closed and convex then all the iterations converge to a unique closed limiting
finite sequence which contains the best proximity points of adjacent subsets
and reduce to a unique fixed point if all such subsets intersect.
