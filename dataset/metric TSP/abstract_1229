Stochastic contraction analysis is a recently developed tool for studying the
global stability properties of nonlinear stochastic systems, based on a
differential analysis of convergence in an appropriate metric. To date,
stochastic contraction results and sharp associated performance bounds have
been established only in the specialized context of state-independent metrics,
which restricts their applicability. This paper extends stochastic contraction
analysis to the case of general time- and state-dependent Riemannian metrics,
in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings, thus extending its
applicability to a significantly wider range of nonlinear stochastic dynamics.
