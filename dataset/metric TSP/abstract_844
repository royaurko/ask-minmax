We consider the question of simultaneous extension of (pseudo)metrics defined
on nonempty closed subsets of a compact metrizable space. The main result is a
counterpart of the result due to K\"unzi and Shapiro for the case of extension
operators of partial continuous functions and includes, as a special case,
Banakh's theorem on linear regular operators extending (pseudo)metrics.
