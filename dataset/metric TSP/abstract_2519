The canonical formalism for expanding metrics scenarios is presented.
Non-unitary time evolution implied by expanding geometry is described as a
trajectory over unitarily inequivalent representations at different times of
the canonical commutation relations. Thermal properties of inflating Universe
are also discussed.
