The derivation of the Demianski-Newman solution within the framework of the
Ernst complex formalism is considered. We show that this solution naturally
arises as a two-soliton specialization of the axisymmetric multi-soliton
electrovacuum metric, and we work out the full set of the corresponding
metrical fields and electromagnetic potentials. Some limits and physical
properties of the DN space-time are briefly discussed.
