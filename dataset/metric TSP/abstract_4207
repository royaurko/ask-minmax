There were problems encountered in extending the K-slicing of the
Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) spacetimes [1, 2] to the extreme
case, when charge equals mass (in gravitational units). The earlier procedure
is here modified so as to allow us to obtain a K-slicing of the region outside
the horizon of the extreme metric by spacelike hypersurfaces. We checked this
new procedure by applying it to the Schwarzschild and usual RN metrics and
recovering the previous foliation with an improved accuracy. We have also
checked the asymptotic behaviour of the K-slicing for large K by extrapolation.
