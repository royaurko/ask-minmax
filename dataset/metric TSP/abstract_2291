Solutions for cylindrically symmetric spacetimes in f(R) gravity are studied.
As a first approach, R=constant is assumed. A solution was found such that it
is equivalent to a result given by Azadi et al. for R=0 and a metric was found
for R=constant different from zero. Comparison with the case of general
relativity with cosmological constant is made and the metric constants are
given in terms of \Lambda. Overlap with arXiv:0810.4673 [gr-qc] by A. Azadi, D.
