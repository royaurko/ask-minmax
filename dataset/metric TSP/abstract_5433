This paper is a complete study of three-dimensional paracontact metric
$(\tilde{\kappa},\tilde{\mu},\tilde{\nu})$-manifolds. Three dimensional
paracontact metric manifolds whose Reeb vector field $\xi $ is harmonic are
characterized. We focus on some curvature properties by considering the class
of paracontact metric $(\tilde{\kappa},\tilde{\mu},\tilde{\nu})$-manifolds
under a condition which is given at Definition 3.1. In Theorem 3.9, it is shown
that this condition is meaningless in dimension higher than three and hence we
study three dimensional case. We study properties of such manifolds according
to the cases $\tilde{\kappa}>-1,$ $\tilde{\kappa}=-1, \tilde{\kappa}<-1$ and
construct new examples of such manifolds for each case.
