In \cite{BK02}, M. Bonk and B. Kleiner proved a rigidity theorem for
expanding quasi-M\"obius group actions on Ahlfors $n$-regular metric spaces
with topological dimension $n$. This led naturally to a rigidity result for
quasi-convex geometric actions on $\CAT(-1)$-spaces that can be seen as a
metric analog to the "entropy rigidity" theorems of U. Hamenst\"adt and M.
Bourdon. Building on the ideas developed in \cite{BK02}, we establish a
rigidity theorem for certain expanding quasi-M\"obius group actions on spaces
with different metric and topological dimensions. This is motivated by a
corresponding entropy rigidity result in the coarse geometric setting.
