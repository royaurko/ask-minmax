For the AdS/CFT duality, considerations of plane wave metric which is
obtained as Penrose limit of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ proved to be quite useful and
interesting. In this work, we obtain Penrose limit metrics for Lifshitz,
Schrodinger, hyperscaling violating Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating
Schrodinger geometries. These geometries usually contain singularities for
certain range of parameters and we discuss how these singularities appear in
the Penrose limit metric. For some cases, there are non-singular metrics
possible for certain parameter values and the metric can be extended beyond the
coordinate singularity, as discussed in many previous works. Corresponding
Penrose limit metrics also display similar features. For the hyperscaling
violating Schrodinger metric, we obtain metric extension for some cases.
