This paper considers the problem of representative selection: choosing a
subset of data points from a dataset that best represents its overall set of
elements. This subset needs to inherently reflect the type of information
contained in the entire set, while minimizing redundancy. For such purposes,
clustering may seem like a natural approach. However, existing clustering
methods are not ideally suited for representative selection, especially when
dealing with non-metric data, where only a pairwise similarity measure exists.
In this paper we propose $\delta$-medoids, a novel approach that can be viewed
as an extension to the $k$-medoids algorithm and is specifically suited for
sample representative selection from non-metric data. We empirically validate
$\delta$-medoids in two domains, namely music analysis and motion analysis. We
also show some theoretical bounds on the performance of $\delta$-medoids and
the hardness of representative selection in general.
