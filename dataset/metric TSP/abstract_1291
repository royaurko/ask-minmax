The Holder setting of the metric subregularity property of set-valued
mappings between general metric or Banach/Asplund spaces is investigated in the
framework of the theory of error bounds for extended real-valued functions of
two variables. A classification scheme for the general Holder metric
subregularity criteria is presented. The criteria are formulated in terms of
several kinds of primal and subdifferential slopes.
