We prove a conjecture by A. Pnueli and strengthen it showing a sequence of
"counting modalities" none of which is expressible in the temporal logic
generated by the previous modalities, over the real line, or over the positive
reals. Moreover, there is no finite temporal logic that can express all of them
over the real line, so that no finite metric temporal logic is expressively
complete.
