We investigate the geodesics' kinematics and dynamics in the Linet-Tian
metric with Lambda<0 and compare with the results for the Levi-Civita metric,
when Lambda=0. This is used to derive new stability results about the
geodesics' dynamics in static vacuum cylindrically symmetric spacetimes with
respect to the introduction of Lambda<0. In particular, we find that increasing
|Lambda| always increases the minimum and maximum radial distances to the axis
of any spatially confined planar null geodesic. Furthermore, we show that, in
some cases, the inclusion of any Lambda<0 breaks the geodesics' orbit
confinement of the Lambda=0 metric, for both planar and non-planar null
geodesics, which are therefore unstable. Using the full system of geodesics'
equations, we provide numerical examples which illustrate our results.
