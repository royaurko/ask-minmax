We show that it is not possible in the absence of dark matter to construct a
four-dimensional metric that explains galactic observations. In particular, by
working with an effective potential it is shown that a metric which is
constructed to fit flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies leads to the wrong
sign for the bending of light i.e. repulsion instead of attraction. Hence,
without dark matter the motion of particles on galactic scales cannot be
explained in terms of geodesic motion on a four- dimensional metric. This
reveals a new bright side to dark matter: it is indispensable if we wish to
retain the cherished equivalence principle.
