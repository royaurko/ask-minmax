In this paper, we consider half-flat $SU(3)$-structures and the subclasses of
coupled and double structures. In the general case we show that the intrinsic
torsion form $w_1^-$ is constant in each of the two subclasses. We then
consider the problem of finding half-flat structures inducing Einstein metrics
on homogeneous spaces. We give an example of a left invariant half-flat (non
coupled and non double) structure inducing an Einstein metric on $S^3\times
S^3$ and we show there does not exist any left invariant coupled structure
inducing an ${\rm Ad}(S^1)$-invariant Einstein metric on it. Finally, we show
that there are no coupled structures inducing the Einstein metric on Einstein
solvmanifolds and on homogeneous Einstein manifolds of nonpositive sectional
curvature.
