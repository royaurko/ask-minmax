In this Letter we derive acoustic metrics in the (3+1)-dimensional Abelian
Higgs model with higher derivative terms. We have found acoustic metrics that
are conformally related to the Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman metrics. The
universal aspects of area products which depend only on quantized quantifies
such as conserved electric charge and angular momentum are also addressed. We
relate these areas with microscopic entropy of acoustic black holes in BEC
systems. We also have shown there is an equivalence between microscopic
descriptions of axisymmetric acoustic black hole entropy in a BEC system in
four and two dimensions.
