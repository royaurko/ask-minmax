We prove a general criterion for a metric space to have conformal dimension
one. The conditions are stated in terms of the existence of enough local cut
points in the space. We then apply this criterion to the boundaries of
hyperbolic groups and show an interesting relationship between conformal
dimension and some canonical splittings of the group.
