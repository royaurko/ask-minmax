The balance metric is a simple approach to estimate the performance of
bandwidth-limited loop kernels. However, applying the method to in-cache
situations and modern multi-core architectures yields unsatisfactory results.
This paper analyzes the in uence of cache hierarchy design on performance
predictions for bandwidth-limited loop kernels on current mainstream
processors. We present a diagnostic model with improved predictive power,
correcting the limitations of the simple balance metric. The importance of code
execution overhead even in bandwidth-bound situations is emphasized. Finally we
analyze the impact of synchronization overhead on multi-threaded performance
with a special emphasis on the in uence of cache topology.
