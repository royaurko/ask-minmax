In deteriorating job scheduling problems, most of the researchers assume that the actual job processing time is a function of its starting time. In this paper, we propose a new deterioration model in which the actual job processing time is a general function of the normal processing time of jobs already processed and its scheduled position at the same time. We show that some single-machine scheduling problems remain polynomially solvable.
