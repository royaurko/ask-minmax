  This paper deals with the single-machine single-operation job scheduling problem to minimize total weighted (and unweighted) tardiness. A class of heuristic rules that contains both the cost over time (COVERT) rule and the apparent urgency (AU) rule is presented. Computational comparison of 12 rules from this class for the total weighted tardiness problem is presented. In the case of the total tardiness (unweighted) problem, these 12 rules and the modified due date (MDD) and the traffic priority index (TPI) rules, total of 14 rules, are compared. Advantages and disadvantages of the rules with respect to four measures of performance are discussed. References 1. A.P. Vepsalainen, T.E.
