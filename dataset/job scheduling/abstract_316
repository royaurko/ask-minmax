S. Vasupongayya and S.-H. Chiang (USA) Fairness index, standard deviation, coefﬁcient of variation, backﬁll, goal-oriented, job scheduling. Fairness is an important issue for parallel job scheduling policies, but has been ignored in most of previous stud ies. In this paper, we consider two different styles of job fairness: FCFS and EQ. Commonly used summary statis tics are applied to different job measures to evaluate the fairness under a wide range of non-preemptive parallel job scheduling policies, including priority backﬁll policies and goal-oriented scheduling policies. Guided by intuition, we study what fairness measures may be appropriate for char acterizing the fairness considered. The impact of fairness on other scheduling performance is also studied.
