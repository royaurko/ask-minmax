Grid computing is the technology for building Internet-wide computing environment in which distributed and heterogeneous resources are integrated. However, in Grid environment, job scheduling is confronted with a great challenge. This paper focuses on lightweight jobs scheduling in Grid Computing. An Adaptive Fine-grained Job Scheduling (AFJS) algorithm is proposed. Compared with other fine-grained job scheduling algorithms based on grouping, AFJS can outperform them according to the experimental results.
