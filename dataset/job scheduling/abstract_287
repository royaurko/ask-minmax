As with any computer system, the performance of supercomputers depends upon the workloads that serve as their input. Unfortunately, however, there are many important aspects of the supercomputer workloads that have not been modeled, or that have been modeled only incipiently. This paper attacks this problem by considering requested time (and its relation with execution time) and the possibility of job cancellation, two aspects of the supercomputer workload that have not been modeled yet. Moreover, we also improve upon existing models for the arrival instant and partition size.
