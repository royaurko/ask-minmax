Volume 3834 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 36-61 Workload Analysis of a Cluster in a Grid Environment EmmanuelÂ Medernach Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire, CNRS-IN2P3 With Grids, we are able to share computing resources and to provide for scientific communities a global transparent access to local facilities. In such an environment the problems of fair resource sharing and best usage arise. In this paper, the analysis of the LPC cluster usage (Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire, Clermont-Ferrand, France) in the EGEE Grid environment is done, and from the results a model for job arrival is proposed.
