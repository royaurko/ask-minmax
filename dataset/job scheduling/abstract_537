This paper proposes a layered system model to bridge the gap between mobile and grid computing world. The model divides the complexities in mobile grid integration, among different components of different layers of the proposed model. In this model of the system we have an efficient algorithm which addresses the problem of scheduling and disconnection. The model proposes an algorithm to address resource scheduling problem and primarily focus on intermittent disconnections problem of the mobile devices, battery power and economy issues.
