Date: 09 November 2001 Parallel Job Scheduling: A Performance Perspective Shikharesh Majumdar Affiliated with Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University , Eric W. Parsons Affiliated with Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University When first introduced, parallel systems were dedicated systems that were intended to run a single parallel application at a time. Examples of the types of applications for which these systems were used include scientific modelling, such as computational fluid dynamics, and other grand challenge problems [ 44 ]. As the cost of multiprocessor systems continues to decrease and software support becomes increasingly available for parallel application development, a wider range of users are becoming interested in using such systems.
