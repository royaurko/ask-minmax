Cloud computing focuses on delivery of reliable, fault-tolerant and scalable infrastructure for hosting Internet based application services. This paper presents the implementation of an efficient Quality of Service (QoS) based Meta-Scheduler and Backfill strategy based light weight Virtual Machine Scheduler for dispatching jobs. The user centric meta-scheduler deals with selection of proper resources to execute high level jobs. The system centric Virtual Machine (VM) scheduler optimally dispatches the jobs to processors for better resource utilization. We also present our thoughts on scheduling heuristics that can be incorporated at data center level for selecting ideal host for VM creation. The implementation can be further extended at the host level, using Inter VM scheduler for adaptive load balancing in cloud environment.
