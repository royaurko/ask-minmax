Date: 01 February 2002 Evaluation of Job-Scheduling Strategies for Grid Computing Volker Hamscher Affiliated with Computer Engineering Institute, University of Dortmund , Uwe Schwiegelshohn Affiliated with Computer Engineering Institute, University of Dortmund , Achim Streit Affiliated with Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing, University of Paderborn , Ramin Yahyapour Affiliated with Computer Engineering Institute, University of Dortmund In this paper, we discuss typical scheduling structures that occur in computational grids. Scheduling algorithms and selection strategies applicable to these structures are introduced and classified. Simulations were used to evaluate these aspects considering combinations of different Job and Machine Models. Some of the results are presented in this paper and are discussed in qualitative and quantitative way. For hierarchical scheduling, a common scheduling structure, the simulation results confirmed the benefit of Backfill. Unexpected results were achieved as FCFS proves to perform better than Backfill when using a central job-pool.
