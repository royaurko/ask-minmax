PSO is a population-based search algorithm based on the simulation of the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. Particles fly in problem search space to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. In this paper we used a PSO approach for grid job scheduling. The scheduler aims at minimizing makespan and flowtime simultaneously. Experimental studies show that the proposed novel approach is more efficient than the PSO approach reported in the literature.
