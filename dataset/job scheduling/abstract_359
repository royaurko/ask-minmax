Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Solving Job Scheduling Problem on Non-identical Parallel Machines Based on JIT Technique HUANG De-cai,GUO Hai-dong(Coll. of Information Eng., Zhejiang Univ. of Tech., Hangzhou310032,China)   A hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is presented for the problem of minimizing the range of lateness and make-span on parallel non-identical machines, which is a NP-complete. There are two new method presented for the HGA. Firstly, a dynamic fitness function is introduced according to the requirement of the scheduling problem. Secondly, a simple coding method for the HGA is given. This new coding method does not include the ranking information of job list, and it embeds the optimal effective algorithm for solving the corresponding single machine problem, which makes the HGA easy programming and enhances the efficiency of the HGA. Numerical simulations illustrate that the HGA has the properties of fast convergence, and can be used to solve larger size problems. 【Key Words】： job scheduling genetic algorithm JIT 【Fund】： 浙江省自然科学基金资助项目(601076)。~~ 【CateGory Index】： TP18 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 4 Hits 1 ZHAO Xiao-hui1,2,SUN Lin-yan2, LIU Wen-hui1,3,DONG Ya-wen1(1.Mechanical & Electronics School,Xi′an University of Engineering Science & Technology,Xi′an 710048,China)(2.Management school,Xi′an Jiaotong University,Xi′an 710049,China)(3.Mechanical & Electronics School,Northwestern Polytechnic University,Xi′an 710072,China); Improvement Genetic Algorithm for Machine Scheduling Problem Squares Estimator is BLUE [J];Mathematics in Practice and Theory;2007-05 2 ZHOU Hui-ren,ZHENG Pi-e,WANG Hai-long(Institute of Systems Engineering Tianjin University,Tianjin 300072,China); Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm-Based Parallel Machine Scheduling for Minimization of Total Weighted Completion Time [J];Journal of System Simulation;2008-13 3 WU Ling-Zhi,HUANG De-Cai(College of Computer Science and Technology,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou 310032,China); Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm for Fuzzy Due Date for Parallel Machines [J];Computer Systems & Applications;2011-09 4 Hu Yanhai 1, 2 Yan Juanqi2 Ye Feifan1 1.Ningbo University, Ningbo,3152112.Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai,200030; Scheduling for Crossed Flow Shop Based on Modified Genetic Algorithm [J];China Mechanical Engineering;2005-09 【Citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 2 Hits 1 ZHOU Hong\+1, CHEUNG Wai\|man\+2 (1.
