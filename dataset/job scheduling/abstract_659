Pegasus takes an abstract description of a workflow and finds the appropriate data and Grid resources to execute the workflow. Pegasus is being released as part of the GriPhyN Virtual Data Toolkit and has been used in a variety of applications ranging from astronomy, biology, gravitational-wave science, and high-energy physics. A deferred planning mode of Pegasus is also introduced. This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants ITR-0086044(GriPhyN) and EAR-0122464 (SCEC/ITR).
