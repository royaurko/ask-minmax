The Grid consists of a large number of identical processors that are divided into several machines. We consider a Grid scheduling model with two stages. At the first stage, jobs are allocated to a suitable machine while at the second stage, local scheduling is applied to each machine independently. We discuss strategies based on various combinations of allocation strategies and local scheduling algorithms. Finally, we propose and analyze a relatively simple schemenamed adaptive admissible allocation. This includes competitive analysis for different parameters and constraints. We show that the algorithm is beneficial under certain conditions and allows an efficient implementation in real systems. Furthermore, a dynamic and adaptive approach is presented which can cope with different workloads and Grid properties.
