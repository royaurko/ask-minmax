Volume 2221 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 188-205 Date: 19 October 2001 Metrics for Parallel Job Scheduling and Their Convergence Dror G. Feitelson Affiliated with School of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hebrew University The arrival process of jobs submitted to a parallel system is bursty, leading to fluctuations in the load at many time scales. In particular, rare events of extreme load may occur. Such events lead to an increase in the standard deviation of performance metrics, and thus delay the convergence of simulations used to evaluate the scheduling. Different performance metrics have been proposed in an effort to reduce this variability, and indeed display different rates of convergence. However, there is no single metric that outperforms the others under all conditions. Rather, the convergence of different metrics depends on the system being studied.
