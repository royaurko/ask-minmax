The authors present a batch job scheduler for a distributed system which utilises a fuzzy logic algorithm to balance the load on individual processors and maximise the throughput of the overall system. The fuzzy algorithm has been implemented in a production processing environment rather than in simulation only. The power and simplicity of a fuzzy load balancing algorithm incorporated into a batch job scheduler is demonstrated, producing excellent performance and reliable characteristics
