  Job scheduling for a two-machine flowshop where wait time between the first and the second machine is not permitted is studied in this paper. Aldowaisan and Allahverdi (J. Oper. Res. Soc. 53(9) (2002) 1004) considered this problem with minimizing total flowtime as the scheduling criterion and presented some necessary conditions for optimality. In this note their results have been modified for the scheduling criterion of minimizing maximum lateness. Keywords Two-machine ; Flowshop ; No-wait ; Lateness 1. The problem Let , and d i be the setup time, processing time and due date for job i , in machine k in a two machine flowshop with separated setup times. All jobs are assumed to be available at the start. Wait between the completion of a job in the first machine and its start in the second machine is not permitted. The problem of scheduling the jobs in this flowshop with the objective of minimizing total flowtime has been studied by Aldowaisan and Allahverdi [1] . In this note their results are extended to the problem of minimizing maximum lateness. The no-wait scheduling problem has attracted a lot of attention from researchers. Some of the more recent works include Aldowaisan [2] , Krzysztof Giaro [3] , Lin and Cheng [4] , Wang and Cheng [5] , and Allahverdi and Aldowaisan [6] . The problem has been studied with a variety of criteria such as makespan and total flowtime. The survey by Hall and Sriskandarajah [7] provides detailed information about the applications and early research of this problem. 2. Formulation Similarly, for a job in position j , where j =1,…, n , Then, the lateness of job in position j in schedule S is given by, Let . Then, our problem can be stated as, find S that minimizes the L max ( S ) value.
