Efficient scheduling techniques of computing resources are essential for achieving satisfactory performance for users as computer systems and their applications become more complex. In this paper, we survey research on scheduling algorithms, review previous classifications of scheduling problems and present a broader classification scheme. Using a uniform terminology for scheduling strategies and the new classification scheme, previous work on scheduling strategies is reviewed and trends in scheduling research are identified. Finally, a methodology for developing scheduling strategies is presented.
