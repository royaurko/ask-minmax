Date: 29 January 2002 A Simple Linear-Time Approximation Algorithm for Multi-processor Job Scheduling on Four Processors Jingui Huang Affiliated with College of Information Engineering, Central-South University , Jianer Chen Affiliated with College of Information Engineering, Central-South University , Songqiao Chen Affiliated with College of Information Engineering, Central-South University Multiprocessor job scheduling problem has become increasingly interesting, for both theoretical study and practical applications. Theoretical study of the problem has made significant progress recently, which, however, seems not to imply practical algorithms for the problem, yet. Practical algorithms have been developed only for systems with three processors and the techniques seem dificult to extend to systems with more than three processors. This paper offers new observations and introduces new techniques for the multiprocessor job scheduling problem on systems with four processors. A very simple and practical linear time approximation algorithm of ratio bounded by 1.5 is developed for the multi-processor job scheduling problem P4|fix| C max , which significantly improves previous results. Our techniques are also useful for multiprocessor job scheduling problems on systems with more than four processors.
