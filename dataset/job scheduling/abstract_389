These problems typically involve numerous, loosely coupled jobs that both access and generate large data sets. Effective scheduling in such environments is challenging, because of a need to address a variety of metrics and constraints (e.g., resource utilization, response time, global and local allocation policies) while dealing with multiple, potentially independent sources of jobs and a large number of storage, compute, and network resources. We describe a scheduling framework that addresses these problems. Within this framework, data movement operations may be either tightly bound to job scheduling decisions or performed by a decoupled, asynchronous process on the basis of observed data access patterns and load. We develop a family of job scheduling and data movement (replication) algorithms and use simulation studies to evaluate various combinations. Our results suggest that while it is necessary to consider the impact of replication on the scheduling strategy, it is not always necessary to couple data movement and computation scheduling. Instead, these two activities can be addressed separately, thus significantly simplifying the design and implementation of the overall Data Grid system. 1. 2381 The Anatomy of the Grid: Enabling Scalable Virtual Organizations - Foster, Kesselman, et al. - 2001 641 Grid Information Services for Distributed Resource Sharing - Czajkowski, Fitzgerald, et al. - 2001 238 The case for geographical push caching - Gwertzman, Seltzer - 1995 222 The AppLeS parameter sweep template: User-level middleware for the Grid - Casanova, Obertelli, et al. - 2001 165 Decoupling Computation and Data Scheduling in Distributed Data-Intensive Applications - Ranganathan, Foster - 2002 128 Identifying dynamic replication strategies for a high performance data Grid and Grid Computing - Ranganathan, Foster 115 Scheduling and load balancing in parallel and distributed systems - Shirazi, Hurson, et al. - 1995 95 Simulation Studies of Computation and Data Scheduling Algorithms for Data Grids - Ranganathan, Foster 93 Evaluation of Job-Scheduling Strategies for Grid Computing[J - Hamscher, Streit - 2000 75 Server-initiated document dissemination for the WWW - Bestavros, Cunha - 1996 75 RaDaR: A Scalable Architecture for a Global Web Hosting Service.
