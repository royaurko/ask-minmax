Date: 15 June 2005 Dynamic vs. static quantum-based parallel processor allocation Su-Hui Chiang Affiliated with Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin , Mary K. Vernon Affiliated with Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin This paper improves upon previous synthetic workload models and compares the performance of dynamic spatial equipartitioning (EQS) and the semi-static quantum-based FB-PWS processor allocation defined in [23], under synthetic workloads that have not previously been considered. These new workloads include realistic repartitioning overheads and job characteristics that are consistent with system measurement, anticipated trends, and experience. The overall conclusion from the results is that the EQS policy is generally superior to the FB-PWS policy even under realistic repartitioning overheads . We find cases where the EQS system saturates earlier than the FB-PWS system, and vice versa. This leads to the definition of a modified EQS policy, called EQS-PWS, which has performance equal to or better than EQS and FB-PWS for all workloads examined in this paper.
