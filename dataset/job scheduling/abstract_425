In a production system using multi-purpose and flexible machines, reducing setup time is an important task for better shop performance. Numerous cases were reported about successful reduction of setup times by standardization of setup procedures. However, setup times have not been eliminated and remain an important element of real production problems for production systems such as commercial printing, plastics manufacturing, metal processing, etc. It is especially critical when the setup time is sequence dependent. In this situation, shop performance cannot be effectively improved without the aid of an appropriate scheduling procedure. Review of the past studies shows that there has not been a significant amount of research done on the scheduling procedure for a dynamic job shop with sequence dependent setup times. This paper investigates the job shop scheduling problems that are complicated by sequence-dependent setup times. The study classifies and tests scheduling rules by considering whether setup time and/or due date information is employed. These scheduling rules are evaluated in dynamic scheduling environments defined by due date tightness, setup times and cost structure. A simulation model of a nine machine job shop is used for the experiment. A hypothetical, asymmetric, setup time matrix is applied to the nine machines.
