The problem of scheduling n independent jobs on an m -dimensional hypercube system to minimize the finish time is studied. Each job J i , where 1&les; i &les; n , is associated with a dimension d i and a processing time t i , meaning that J i needs a d i -dimensional subcube for t i units of time. When job preemption is allowed, an O ( n 2 log 2 n ) time algorithm which can generate a minimum finish time schedule with at most min{ n -2,2 m -1} preemptions is obtained. When job preemption is not allowed, the problem is NP-complete. It is shown that a simple list scheduling algorithm called LDF can perform asymptotically optimally and has an absolute bound no worse than 2-1/2 m . For the absolute bound, it is also shown that there is a lower bound (1+âˆš6)/2&ap;1.7247 for a class of scheduling algorithms including LDF
