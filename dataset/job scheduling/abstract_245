Summary form only given. Most of current job scheduling systems for supercomputers and clusters provide batch queuing support. With the development of metacomputing and grid computing, users require resources managed by multiple local job schedulers. Advance reservations are becoming essential for job scheduling systems to be utilized within a large-scale computing environment with geographically distributed resources. COSY is a lightweight implementation of such a local job scheduler with support for both queue scheduling and advance reservations. COSY queue scheduling utilizes the FCFS algorithm with backfilling mechanisms and priority management. Advance reservations with COSY can provide effective QoS support for exact start time and latest completion time. Scheduling polices are defined to reject reservations with too short notice time so that there is no start time advantage to making a reservation over submitting to a queue. Further experimental results show that as a larger percentage of reservation requests are involved, a longer mandatory shortest notice time for advance reservations must be applied in order not to sacrifice queue scheduling efficiency.
