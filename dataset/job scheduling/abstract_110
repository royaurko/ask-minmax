  The problem of scheduling multiple jobs on a single machine so that they are completed by a common specified date is addressed in this paper. This type of scheduling set costs depend on whether a job is finished before (earliness) or after (tardiness) the specified due date. The objective is to minimize a summation of earliness and tardiness penalty costs. Minimizing these costs pushes the completion time of each job as close as possible to the due date. The use of differential evolution as the optimization heuristic to solve this problem is investigated in this paper. Computational experiments over multiple (280 in total) public benchmark problems with up to 1000 jobs to be scheduled show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results obtained are of high quality putting new upper bounds to 60% of the benchmark instances.

Introduction equation ( 1 ) ∑ j = 1 n ( α j E j + β j T j ) , where α j ,β j (j=1,…,n) α j , β j ( j = 1 , … , n ) are the earliness and tardiness (nonnegative) penalties, respectively, for job j j and constitute data input to the scheduling problem. The study of earliness and tardiness penalties in scheduling is a relatively new area of research [2]  and  [3] that received considerable attention in the last 15 years due to its compliance with the new principles of just-in-time ( JIT ) inventory management. In JIT approach jobs are to be completed as close as possible to their due dates, neither too early, nor too late. Early jobs result in inventory holding costs, while late jobs result in penalties such as loss of customer goodwill and loss of orders; therefore, the emphasis with JIT technology is that earliness as well as tardiness of jobs should be discouraged.
