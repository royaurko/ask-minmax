Volume 5199 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 1031-1040 Fast Multi-objective Scheduling of Jobs to Constrained Resources Using a Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm Wilfried Jakob Affiliated with Lancaster University Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH, Institute for Applied Computer Science , Alexander Quinte Affiliated with Lancaster University Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH, Institute for Applied Computer Science , Karl-Uwe Stucky Affiliated with Lancaster University Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH, Institute for Applied Computer Science , Wolfgang Süß Affiliated with Lancaster University Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH, Institute for Applied Computer Science The problem tackled here combines three properties of scheduling tasks, each of which makes the basic task more challenging: job scheduling with precedence rules, co-allocation of restricted resources of different performances and costs, and a multi-objective fitness function. As the algorithm must come up with results within a few minutes runtime, EA techniques must be tuned to this limitation. The paper describes how this was achieved and compares the results with a common scheduling algorithm, the Giffler-Thompson procedure.
