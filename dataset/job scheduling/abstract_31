  A stochastic model for decentralized control of job scheduling in distributed processing systems is presented. The basic decisionmaker of this model, replicated at each host, consists of a Stochastic Learning Automaton (SLA). Because of the environment under consideration, various practical enhancements to the basic SLA model are developed. It is shown by simulation that the overall performance of the system improves over the basic SLA model. Comparisons to some known analytical models and other algorithms are also made. These comparisons illustrate that the SLA based system performs much better than the M/M/1 and Fractional Assignment analytical models and is reasonably close to the best analytical bound. The range of effectiveness of the SLA algorithm with respect to several others is noted. What is significant about this work is that we have illustrated that it is possible to design a learning controller that is able to dynamically acquire relevant job scheduling information by a process of trial and error, and use that information to provide good performance. Other advantages of the algorithm are its low execution overhead, its potential reliability because it is decentralized, and its ability to recover gracefully from random events such as surges of new jobs entering the system. It is important to note that almost all other scheduling algorithms are tested only under equilibrium conditions. References 1. A.G. Barto, R.S. Sutton, P.S.
