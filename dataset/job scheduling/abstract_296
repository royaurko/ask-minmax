Job scheduling Algorithm Based on Credit Model in Cluster Environment ZHANG Shu-dong,CAO Yuan-da,LIAO Le-jian(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,School of Information Science and Technology,Beijing Institute of Technology,Beijing 100081,China)   A resource credit model is presented to describe the dynamic and usability of resources.In this model,each resource is credit entity,and the resource using is looked as a resource-use contract signed between resource and user.If the job is accomplished on time in the resource,the resource will acquire a credit award,otherwise it will get a credit punishment.A resource-scheduling algorithm based on this model is presented,which send job to the resource,which has appropriate credit value.It has been realized based on OpenPBS framework.It has also been simulated using GridSim toolkits to proceed a contrastive test with Fifo and Libra.The result shows that it works well. 【Key Words】： resource credit resource scheduling cluster grid 【Fund】： 国家自然科学基金项目(60373057)资助. 【CateGory Index】： TP393.01 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 6 Hits 1 LI Jia,CHEN Zhigang,ZHANG Zhibing,CHEN Rong(School of Information Science and Engineering,Central South University,Changsha 410083); Judge of Scheduling Capability and Algorithm Based on Grid [J];Computer Engineering;2007-14 2 YUAN Lu-Lai ZENG Guo-Sun JIANG Li-Li JIANG Chang-Jun (Department of Computer Science and Technology , Tongji University , Shanghai 201804); Dynamic Level Scheduling Based on Trust Model in Grid Computing [J];Chinese Journal of Computers;2006-07 3 OU Pan (Computer and Information Science College,Southwest University,Chongqing 400715,China); A Grid Resource Scheduling Method Based on Resource Reliability [J];Software Guide;2007-09 4 WEI Yu-Xin+,WU Mu-Qing(Institute of Communication Networks Integrated Technique,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing 100876,China); An Intelligent Grid Intrusion Detection System [J];Journal of Software;2006-11 5 WANG Tian-qing1,XIE Jun2,ZENG Zhou2(1.School of Management,Wuyi University,Jiangmen 529020,China;2.School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering,Jiangsu University,Zhenjiang 212013,China;3.School of Electronic Information and Electric Engineering,Shanghai Jiaotong University,Shanghai 200030,China); Study of grid resource scheduling strategy based on ant colony algorithm [J];Computer Engineering and Design;2007-15 6 JI Yi-mu1,WANG Ru-chuan1,2(1.Department of Computer Science and Technology,Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Nanjing 210003,China;2.State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology,Nanjing University,Nanjing 210093,China); Study on PSO algorithm in solving grid task scheduling [J];Journal on Communications;2007-10 【Co-references】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 YUE Qun-xing,WEI Fa-jie(School of Economics and Management,Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Beijing 100083,China); New Stochastic Optimization Algorithm——Ant System [J];Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics(Social Sciences Edition);2005-04 2 XU Hui FENG Jinwen YE Zhiyuan(Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University, Beijing, 100871); Stateful Security Alert Correlation by Dynamic Bayesian Plan Graph [J];Acta Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis;2006-01 3 ZHANG Shu-dong~1,CAO Yuan-da~2,LIAO Le-jian~1(1.
