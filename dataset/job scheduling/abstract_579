This paper firstly concisely introduces the research background of simulation grid, then combined with authors' ongoing project on simulation grid, the phased research achievements of simulation grid project are introduced in detail, including completed simulation grid prototype named Cosim-Grid 0.1v, parts of solved key technologies and some typical application demonstration systems of simulation grid. It is shown from the primary practice that the simulation grid developed by authors has the following new features: (1) An architecture of service oriented simulation grid, based on HLA (high level architecture), PLM (product lifecycle management) and grid/Web service, is proposed. It overcomes shortcomings of HLA on dynamical share, autonomy, fault tolerant, capability of collaboration and security mechanism. (2) A simulation grid prototype named Cosim-Grid 0.1v has been developed, which has independent copyright and is suitable for simulation application. It consists of simulation grid portal, simulation application oriented service middleware, grid middleware GOS and the simulation grid resources including various encapsulated simulation model services. (3) It extends simulation application pattern and implements new simulation method based on Internet and grid. Finally, the conclusion and some further works are given.
