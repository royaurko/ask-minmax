A new approach for dynamic job scheduling in mesh-connected multiprocessor system, which supports a multi-user environment, is proposed. The proposed job scheduler combines a priority-based scheduling policy with a submesh reservation policy to obtain high performance in terms of high throughput, high utilization and low turn-around times for jobs. The proposed scheduling strategy offers the flexibility of achieving high performance at the expense of short-term 'fairness' towards certain jobs. A fast and efficient implementation of the proposed scheduler has also been presented. Simulation results indicate that our scheduling strategy outperforms the FCFS policy significantly by reducing the average waiting delay significantly.
