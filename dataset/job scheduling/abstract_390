Looking for an Evolution of Grid Scheduling: Meta-Brokering Ivan Rodero Affiliated with Barcelona SuperComputing Center , Francesc Guim Affiliated with Barcelona SuperComputing Center , Julita Corbalan Affiliated with Barcelona SuperComputing Center , L. L. Fong , Y. G. Liu , S. M. Sadjadi Affiliated with Florida International University A Grid Resource Broker for a Grid domain, or also known as meta-scheduler, is a middleware component used for matching works to available Grid resources from one or more IT organizations. A Grid meta-scheduler usually has its own interfaces for the functionalities it provides and its own job scheduling objectives. This situation causes two main problems: the user uniform access to the Grid is lost, and the scheduling decisions are taken separately while they should be done in coordination. These problems have been observed in different efforts such as the HPC-Europa project but they are still open problems. In this paper we discuss the requirements to achieve a more uniform access to the Grids through a new approach to global brokering. As the results of these discussions on brokering requirements, we propose a meta-brokering design, so called metameta- scheduler design, and discuss how it can be realized as a centralized model for the HPC-Europa project, and as a distributed model for the LA Grid project.
