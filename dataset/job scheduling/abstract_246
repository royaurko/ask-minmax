We first introduce a job re-packing scheme. In this scheme we try to rearrange the order of job execution on their originally allocated processors in a scheduling round to combine small fragments of available processors from different time slots together to form a larger and more useful one in a single time slot. We then describe an efficient resource allocation scheme based on job re-packing. Using this allocation scheme we are able to decrease the cost for detecting available resources when allocating processors and time to each given job, to reduce the average number of time slots per scheduling round and also to balance the workload across the processors.
