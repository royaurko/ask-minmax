However, in Grid environment, job scheduling is confronted with a great challenge. This paper focuses on lightweight jobs scheduling in Grid Computing. An Adaptive Fine-grained Job Scheduling (AFJS) algorithm is proposed. Compared with other fine-grained job scheduling algorithms based on grouping, AFJS can outperform them according to the experimental results. And some other related problems are also illustrated.   Reference   [1]I. Foster and C.
