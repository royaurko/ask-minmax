The Compute Power Market (CPM) is a market-based resource management and job scheduling system for grid computing on Internet-wide computational resources, particularly low-end personal computing devices. It transforms the metacomputing environment into a computational market, wherein one can solve problems by renting computational power, storage, and special services from idle resources (computers). The CPM primarily comprises markets, resource consumers, resource providers and their interactions. It supports various economic models (commodity market model, contract-net/tendering, and auction) for resource pricing and mapping between service consumers and providers. The paper proposes a decentralized computation market with multiple markets and numerous consumers and providers spread across the grid environment. The paper further discusses the basic architecture and the components involved in markets, consumers and providers, namely: a Market Server, a Market Resource Agent, a Market Resource Broker and Market Trader and scheduler used for negotiation and job deployment
