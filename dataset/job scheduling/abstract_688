Volume 4782 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 30-43 Coarse-Grain Time Slicing with Resource-Share Control in Parallel-Job Scheduling Bryan Esbaugh Affiliated with University of Windsor, Computer Science, 401 Sunset Ave., Windsor, Ontario, N9B3P4 , Angela C. Sodan Affiliated with University of Windsor, Computer Science, 401 Sunset Ave., Windsor, Ontario, N9B3P4 We present a parallel job scheduling approach for coarse-grain timesharing which preempts jobs to disk and avoids any additional memory pressure. The approach provides control regarding the resource shares allocated to different job classes. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves response times for short and medium jobs and that it permits controlling different desirable resource-shares for different job classes at different times of the day according to site policies.
