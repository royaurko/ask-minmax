Application of Wasp Colony Algorithm in Job-scheduling of Equipment Repair WANG Hao,TANG Zai-jiang,FAN Rui(Department of Equipment Command & Administration,Armored Force Engineering Academy,Beijing 100072)   How to schedule equipment repair is essential for the repair decision-making.Because of the great performance of Wasp Colony Algorithm(WCA) in job-scheduling especially in dynamic and stochatic job-scheduling,this paper uses the WCA to research problem of the repair scheduling.Results from the simulation instance show that WCA is of great advantage for dynamic and stochastic jobs. 【Key Words】： damaged equipment Wasp Colony Algorithm(WCA) job-scheduling 【CateGory Index】： E075 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【Citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 1 Hits 1 Li Hui-xian~1 Cheng Chun-tian~2 Pang Liao-jun~3(1.Dept.of Computer Science and Engineering,Dalian Univ.of Tech.,Dalian 116024,Liaoning,China;2.Institute of Hydropower System and Hydroinformatics,Dalian Univ.of Tech.,Dalian 116024,Liaoning,China;3.National Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks,Xidian Univ.,Xi'an 710071,Shaanxi,China); High-Efficiency Dynamic Task-Scheduling Algorithm for Grids [J];Journal of South China University of Technology(Natural Science Edition);2006-01 【Co-citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 3 Hits 1 Cui Zhen-dong1 Gao Yue-hua2 Wang Xi-cheng2(1.Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Dalian University of Technology,Dalian 116023,Liaoning,China;2.State Key Laboratory of Structural Analysis for Industrial Equipment,Dalian University of Technology,Dalian 116023,Liaoning,China); Grid Algorithm Based on Approximate Function for Injection Warpage Optimization [J];Journal of South China University of Technology(Natural Science Edition);2009-01 2 WANG Hao (Academy of Armored Force Engineering,Beijing 100072,China); Job-Scheduling for Damaged Equipments in Wartime based on Wasp Colony Algorithm [J];Fire Control and Command Control;2009-S1 3 FAN Xiao-mao,MA Liang (College of Management,University of Shanghai for Science and Technology,Shanghai 200093,China); Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for 0-1 Knapsack Problem [J];Mathematics in Practice and Theory;2010-06 【Secondary Citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 1 Hits 1 Zhu Ling-xiang Zou Liang (Dept. of Applied Mathematics, South China Agricultural Univ. , Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China; College of Traffic and Communications, South China Univ. of Tech. , Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, China); Architecture and Scheduling Algorithm of Distributed Data Mining Systems [J];Journal of South China University of Technology(Natural Science);2004-S1
