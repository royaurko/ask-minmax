This paper presents simple methods for solving two single machine sequencing problems when job processing times are themselves decision variables having their own associated linearly varying costs. These are the problems of minimizing the total processing cost plus either the average flow cost or the maximum tardiness cost. The paper treats only problems with zero ready times and no precedence constraints.
