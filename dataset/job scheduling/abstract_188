It is suggested that this be standardized, in terms of both format and content, so as to ease the evaluation and comparison of different systems. The question remains whether this can encompass both traditional parallel systems and metacomputing systems. This paper is based on a panel on this subject that was held at the workshop, and the ensuing discussion; its authors are both the panel members and participants from the audience. Naturally, not all of us agree with all the opinions expressed here...
