The single machine job scheduling problem, where due dates are assigned using the SLK due date determination method, is examined assuming different penalties for the early and tardy jobs. These penalties are assumed to be job-dependent, proportional to the processing times of jobs raised to an integer, non-negative power. The objective function is the total weighted lateness. Several cases are examined and four algorithms providing the optimal sequences for these cases are presented. Examples are given and conclusions are drawn.
