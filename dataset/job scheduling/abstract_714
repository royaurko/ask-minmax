Scheduling methodologies must be highly customized to deal with the unique technical constraints. This study proposes a scheduling model that can incorporate technical constraints into standard scheduling constraints already present in classical models. Using this approach, technical constraints from one industry can be interchanged with those from another with little modification to the existing methodologies. The conditions under which this approach can be applied are investigated and frameworks for applying dispatching rules are proposed. Numerical experiments evaluate the performance of these dispatching rules and compare them with two meta-heuristics. scheduling, meta-heuristics, push–pull production
