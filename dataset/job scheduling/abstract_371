This paper considers the two-machine (-stage) flow-shop problem of minimizing the total elapsed time, where setup times are separated from processing times. A theorem which is an extension of Johnson's for the two-machine flow-shop problem with setup times included is developed for the optimal scheduling with setup times separated. A numerical example is shown in order to clarify the effect of setup time consideration on the reduction of the total elapsed time.
