Job Scheduling Algorithm Research on Grid Environment Cao Huaihu Yu Zhenwei Xu Shoulin(College of Mechanical and Electron ic Eng ineering and Information,China University of Mining and Technology in Beijing, Beijing100083)   Along with the maturity of computer network tec hn ology,the high performance computing based on network is evolving into grid.A grid system is composed geographically distributed resources(include hosts,dat abase,and peripheral devices,etc.)that can be reached over the network.we deal with algorithmic issues on grid.we show that static scheduling and load-balancing strategies are absolutely needed to achieve good performances.The pro blem is to load balance the work with different-speed resources while minimizin g the communication volume.Technically,we state several NP-completeness heur istics results on MMM algorithms that demonstrate the intrinsic difficulty of s tatic load-balancing on heterogeneous.Experiment with grid shows very promis ing results. 【Key Words】： grid heterogeneous platform scheduling load balancing data allocation 【CateGory Index】： TP393 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 8 Hits 1 LI Jiong,LUO Guang-chun,DONG Shi (School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Eletronic Science and Technology of China Chengdu 610054); Application of OptorSim in Replication Strategies for Data Gird [J];Journal of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China;2007-06 2 SU Yi (Information Center,Loudi Electric Power Bureau,Hunan Electric Power Company,Loudi 417000,China); GridSim Simulation of Min-min Task Scheduling Algorithm in Grid [J];Computer Knowledge and Technology;2010-05 3 MA Shi-long,ZHU Yi-an,YE Cheng(School of Computer Science and Engineering,Northwest Polytechnical University,Xi’an 710072,China); A Dynamic Resource Scheduling Algorithm Based on the Minimum Service Requirement [J];Computer Engineering & Science;2008-09 4 SUN Shi-cui,DING En-jie,XU Xiu(College of Information and Electrical Engineering of CUMT.,Xuzhou 221008,China); Research of Resource Management and Task Scheduling Based on Mine Safety Grid [J];Industry and Mine Automation;2007-06 5 Shan Donghong Yang Zhaofeng(College of Software of Pingdingshan University,Pingdingshan 467000); Research on Grid Workflow Technology of Load Balancing Based on Grenetic Algorithm [J];Computer & Digital Engineering;2011-10 6 WANG Guan-yu(Qiannan Normal College of Nationalities,Duyun 558000,China); Research and Improvement of the Task Scheduling Algorithm in Grid Computing [J];Computer Engineering & Science;2011-10 7 WU Shao-chun,HU Hua-shan(School of Computer Engineering and Science,Shanghai University,Shanghai 200072,China); Earthquake Data Mining Grid and Its Job Schedule [J];Journal of Shanghai University(Natural Science Edition);2006-05 8 SU Heng-yang(Experimental Training Management Center,Guangdong Industry Technical College,Guangzhou 510300,China); Based on the Efficient Load Equilibrium Network Task Allocation Technology [J];Microelectronics & Computer;2011-07 【Citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 1 Hits 1 Zheng Ran Li Shengli Jin Hai Postgraduate; College of Computer.
