The uncertainties of grid nodes security are main hurdle to make the job scheduling secure, reliable and fault-tolerant. The fixed fault-tolerant strategy in jobs scheduling may utilize excessive resources. In this paper, the job scheduling decides which kinds of fault-tolerance strategy will be applied to each individual job for more reliable computation and shorter makespan. And we discuss the fuzziness or uncertainties between TL and SD attributes by the subjective judgment of human beings. Cloud model is a model of the uncertain transition between qualitative concept and its quantitative representation. Based on the cloud model, We propose a security-aware and fault-tolerant jobs scheduling strategy for grid (SAFT), which makes the assess of SD and SL to become more flexible and more reliable. Meanwhile, the different fault-tolerant strategy has been applied in grid job scheduling algorithm by the SD and job workload. Moreover, much more important, we are able to set up some rules and active each qualitative rule to select a suitable fault-tolerant strategy for a scheduling job by input value (the SD and job workload) to realize the uncertainty reasoning. The results demonstrate that our algorithm has shorter makespan and more excellent efficiencies on improving the job failure rate than the fixed fault-tolerant strategy selection.
