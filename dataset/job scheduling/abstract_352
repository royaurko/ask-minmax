We consider an n job, one machine scheduling problem in which all jobs have a common due date. The objective is to determine the optimal value of this due date and an optimal sequence to minimize a total penalty function. This penalty function is based on the due date value and on the earliness or the lateness of each job in the selected sequence. We present a polynomial bound scheduling algorithm for the solution of this problem along with the proof of optimality, a numerical example and discuss some extensions.
