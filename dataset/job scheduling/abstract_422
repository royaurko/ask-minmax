  This paper describes a branch and bound algorithm for project scheduling with resource constraints. The algorithmis based on the idea of using disjunctive arcs for resolving conflicts that are created whenever sets of activities have to be scheduled whose total resource requirements exceed the resource availabilities in some periods. Four lower bounds are examined. The first is a simple lower bound based on longest path computations. The second and third bounds are derived from a relaxed integer programming formulation of the problem. The second bound is based on the Linear Programming relaxation with the addition of cutting planes, and the third bound is based on a Lagrangean relaxation of the formulation. This last relaxation involves a problem which is a generalization of the longest path computation and for which an efficient, though not polynomial, algorithm is given. The fourth bound is based on the disjunctive arcs used to model the problem as a graph. We report computational results on the performance of each bound on randomly generated problems involving up to 25 activities and 3 resources.
