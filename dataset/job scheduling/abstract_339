This paper addresses a single machine sequencing problem with variable processing times and sequence-dependent setups. The objective is to find the best trade-off between the JIT goal and the processing time compression and extension costs by simultaneously determining the job sequence and processing times for concerned jobs. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, it cannot be optimally solved in polynomial time. A tabu search approach is used to provide good and quick solutions. To improve the computational efficiency, an adaptive neighbourhood generation method is proposed and used in the tabu search algorithm. A total of 100 problems of different sizes have been solved to test the proposed approach. Our computational experience shows that the adaptive approach outperforms several other neighbourhood generation methods in terms of both convergence rate and solution quality. The effects of the search parameters are also discussed.
