In this problem, there are a number of processors, each of which belongs to one of several classes. The unit time processing cost for a processor varies with the class to which the processor belongs. There are N jobs, each of which must be processed from a given start time to a given finish time without preemption. A job can be processed by any proc- essor, and the cost of that processing is the product of the processing time and the processor’s unit time process- ing cost. The problem is to find a feasible scheduling of the jobs such that the total processing cost is within a given cost bound. This problem ( CCFJS ) arises in several applications, including off-line multimedia gateway call routing. We show that CCFJS can be solved by a network flow based algorithm when there are only two classes of processors. For more than two classes of processors, we prove that CCFJS is not only NP-Complete , but also that there is no constant ratio approximation algorithm. Finally, we present an approximation algorithm, derive its worst-case performance ratio (non constant), and show that it has a constant approximation ratio in several special cases.
