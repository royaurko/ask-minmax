For any job Jj with length pj , if kj processors are assigned to execute the job, then the actual execution time of the job is tj = pj=kj+(kj􀀀���1)c, where c is a constant overhead cost associated with each processor except the master processor that initiates the parallel computation. Previously, it was shown that the Shortest Execution Time (SET) algorithm has competitive ratio 4(m􀀀���1)=m for even m 2 and 4m=(m + 1) for odd m 3 with respect to makespan. Here we study the Earliest Completion Time (ECT) algorithm, and show that its competitive ratio is 2 and 2.25 on 2 and 3 processors, respectively. We also offer simulation results that show that ECT compares favorably to SET on larger numbers of processors. Finally, we show that any online algorithm for our problem has competitive ratio at least 3/2 for arbitrarily large m.
