Due to its simplicity, regularity and suitability for VLSI implementation, the mesh topology for multiprocessors has drawn considerable attention. Several processor allocation strategies for mesh-connected multiprocessors have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we present the results of a performance study of all the proposed strategies known to authors. Originally each of these allocation strategies was proposed for use with First-Come-First-Served job scheduling. In this paper we also propose and evaluate new variants of these strategies using the Scan scheduling discipline. We find Scan to significantly improve the performance of all the allocation strategies. A wide range of workloads and system sizes are considered. In addition, we compare the overheads of these algorithms and study the effects of overheads on performance
