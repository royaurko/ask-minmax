Design and Implementation of Job Scheduling Algorithm for Multi-User MapReduce Clusters WANG Kai,WU Quan-yuan,YANG Shu-qiang(School of Computer Science,National University of Defense Technology,Changsha 410073,China)   As more enterprises start to use data-intensive cluster computing systems such as Hadoop and Dryad for more applications,sharing MapReduce clusters among multiple users that reducing the cost of establishing an independent cluster and the demand of sharing common data sets resources for users is increasing.Based on fair scheduling algorithm,combining with slot allocation delay and priority technology,the paper proposes an improved algorithm.It can achieve better data locality,improve the performance of the system,such as throughput,response time.To meet the differentiated business services,it sets the appropriate for users to ensure special tasks. 【Key Words】： fair schedule wait schedule MapReduce Hadoop 【CateGory Index】： TP301.6 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【Secondary Citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 8 Hits 1 Liang Yi 1,2, Meng Dan 1, and FAN Jian-Ping 1 1(National Research Center for Intelligent Computing Systems, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080) 2(Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039); RB-FIFIT—A Cluster Job Scheduling Algorithm Combining Firstfit, Reservation and Backfilling [J];Journal of Computer Research and Development;2004-11 2 YE Qinghua，MENG Dan，JIANG Ying (National Research Center for Intelligent Computing Systems, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing 100080); Design and Implementation of Dawning 3000 Cluster Job Management Software [J];Computer Engineering;2003-06 3 YUAN Liqiang, XU Weimin, ZHANG Lixiao ( School of Computer Engineering and Science , Shanghai University, Shanghai 200072); Job Scheduler in PBS and Solution for One Kind of Resource Allocation Failure [J];Computer Engineering;2004-15 4 Zhao Zongdi Hu kai Hu Jianping(School of Computer Science and Engineering,Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Beijing 100083); Design and Implementation of Cluster Job Scheduling Policy Based on PBS [J];Computer & Digital Engineering;2006-11 5 QI Hong\ JU Jiu bin(Department of Computer Science\ Jilin University\ Changchun\ 130021); Scheduling Cooperative Tasks on a Network of Workstations [J];JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE;1998-01 6 Tang Xiaochun, Hu Zhengguo, Lu Weiyang (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072); On Overcoming Shortcomings in Job-Center Manager System Using Cluster Technology [J];Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University;2001-01 7 LI Yuan ZHENG Quan-lu ZENG Yun (Deptof Computer Science & Technology,Information Engineering University of PLA, Zhengzhou 450002 China); The Analyses of PBS [J];Modern Computer;2004-03 8 JIN Hai, ZOU De-qing, Han Zong-fen (Department of Computer Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China); Implementation of a Grid System Based on Web [J];Mini-micro Systems;2003-12
