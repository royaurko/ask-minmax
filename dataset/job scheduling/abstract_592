Vivekanandan and et al.},     title = {A Study on Scheduling in Grid Environment},     year = {} } Grid Computing is a high performance computing environment that allows sharing of geographically distributed resources across multiple administrative domains and used to solve large scale computational demands. In the grid environment, users can access the resources transparently without knowing where they are physically located. To achieve the promising potentials of computational grids, job scheduling is an important issue to be considered. Scheduling is very complicated due to the unique characteristics of the grids. This paper gives a classification of scheduling algorithms in distributed computing and the algorithms that are applicable to grid environment. It also studies performance of various scheduling algorithms and the softwares that support scheduling in real grid environment as well as simulated environment.
