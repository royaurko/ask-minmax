Job scheduling; Operating systems; Scheduling algorithms The job-scheduling function in a multiprogramming computer system plays a key role in the achievement of the performance goals for the system. It is possible and convenient to partition this scheduling function into a priority assignment function and resource assignment function. Implementation of a general purpose resource assignment module permits a large family of scheduling strategies to be implemented via different priority calculation schemes. The implications of this partitioning of the scheduling function are studied by use of a simulation model. A system embodying this approach to job scheduling is discussed as an application of the approach to other types of systems.
