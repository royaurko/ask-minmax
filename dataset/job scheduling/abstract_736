In contrast, Data Grids mostly deal with large computational problems that in turn require evaluating and mining large amounts of data. Replication is regarded as one of the major optimisation techniques for providing fast data access. Within this paper, several replication algorithms are studied. This is achieved using the Grid simulator: OptorSim. OptorSim provides a modular framework within which optimisation strategies can be studied under different Grid configurations. The goal is to explore the stability and transient behaviour of selected optimisation techniques.
