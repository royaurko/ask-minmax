Loosely coordinated (implicit/dynamic) coscheduling is a time-sharing approach that originates from network of workstations environments of mixed parallel/serial workloads and limitedsoftware support. It is meant to be an easy-to-implement and scalable approach. Considering that the percentage of clusters in parallel computing is increasing and easily portable software is needed, loosely coordinated coscheduling becomes an attractive approach for dedicated machines. Loose coordination offers attractive features as a dynamic approach. Static approaches for local job scheduling assign resources exclusively and non-preemptively. Such approaches still remain beyond the desirable resource utilization and average response times. Conversely, approaches for dynamic scheduling of jobs can preempt resources and/or adapt their allocation. They typically provide better resource utilization and response times. Existing dynamic approaches are full preemption with checkpointing, dynamic adaptation of node/CPU allocation, and time sharing via gang or loosely coordinated coscheduling. This survey presents and compares the different approaches, while particularly focusing on the less well-explored loosely coordinated time sharing. The discussion particularly focuses on the implementation problems, in terms of modification of standard operating systems, the runtime system and the communication libraries.
