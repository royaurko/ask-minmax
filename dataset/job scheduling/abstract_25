Volume 1659 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 17-42 Date: 14 July 2000 On the Design and Evaluation of Job Scheduling Algorithms Jochen Krallmann Affiliated with Computer Engineering Institute, University Dortmund , Uwe Schwiegelshohn Affiliated with Computer Engineering Institute, University Dortmund , Ramin Yahyapour Affiliated with Computer Engineering Institute, University Dortmund In this paper we suggest a strategy to design job scheduling systems. To this end, we first split a scheduling system into three components: Scheduling policy, objective function and scheduling algorithm. After discussing the relationship between those components we explain our strategy with the help of a simple example. The main focus of this example is the selection and the evaluation of several scheduling algorithms.
