The goal is to maximize the weighted throughput , that is the total weight of scheduled jobs. We first give a randomized algorithm RMix with competitive ratio of e /( e -1)≈ 1.582. Then we consider s -bounded instances where the span of each job is at most s . We give a 1.25-competitive randomized algorithm for 2-bounded instances, and a deterministic algorithm Edf α , whose competitive ratio on s -bounded instances is at most 2-2/ s + o (1/ s ). For 3-bounded instances its ratio is φ ≈ 1.618, matching the lower bound. We also consider 2-uniform instances, where the span of each job is 2. We prove a lower bounds for randomized algorithms and deterministic memoryless algorithms. Finally, we consider the multiprocessor case and give an \(1/(1-(\frac{M}{M+1})^M)\) -competitive algorithm for M processors. We also show improved lower bounds for the general and 2-uniform cases.
