Job arrival rate and size are “random≓ on a NOWs. In such an environment, partitioning (load balancing) a target job based on only the .rst order moments (means) of system parameters is not optimal. In this paper, it is proposed to consider the second order moments (standard deviations) also in load balancing in order to minimize execution time of a target job on a set of workstations where the round-robin job scheduling policy is adopted. It has been veri.ed through computer simulation that the proposed static and dynamic load balancing schemes can signi.cantly reduce execution time of a target job in a NOWs environment, compared to cases where only the means of the parameters are used.
