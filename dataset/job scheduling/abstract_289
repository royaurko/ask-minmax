Research on a Job Scheduling Model for Fault Tolerant Computational Grid JIN Hai, CHEN Gang, and ZHAO Mei-Ping(School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074)   With the development of grid technology, higher requirements are imposed on the efficiency and quality of the grid system. In this paper, the existing grid-scheduling environment is analyzed and a novel grid-scheduling model is put forward based on fault tolerance of stochastic Petri net. Grid job dispatch policy, job selection policy in computational site and performance metrics in computational grid are also discussed. The performance of computational grid based on fault tolerance is analyzed by software emulation. The numerical results show the effect on different type of jobs. 【Key Words】： computational grid fault tolerance job scheduling stochastic Petri net performance analysis 【Fund】： 国家杰出青年基金项目 ( 60 12 5 2 0 8) 【CateGory Index】： TP393 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats;
