Volume 4671 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 283-292 Dynamic Job Scheduling on the Grid Environment Using the Great Deluge Algorithm Paul McMullan Affiliated with School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen’s University of Belfast , Barry McCollum Affiliated with School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen’s University of Belfast The utilization of the computational Grid processor network has become a common method for researchers and scientists without access to local processor clusters to avail of the benefits of parallel processing for compute-intensive applications. As a result, this demand requires effective and efficient dynamic allocation of available resources. Although static scheduling and allocation techniques have proved effective, the dynamic nature of the Grid requires innovative techniques for reacting to change and maintaining stability for users. The dynamic scheduling process requires quite powerful optimization techniques, which can themselves lack the performance required in reaction time for achieving an effective schedule solution. Often there is a trade-off between solution quality and speed in achieving a solution. This paper presents an extension of a technique used in optimization and scheduling which can provide the means of achieving this balance and improves on similar approaches currently published.
