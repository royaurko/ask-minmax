Tables: Sensitivity of Parallel Job Scheduling to Fat-Tailed Distributions (2000) @TECHREPORT{Feitelson00sensitivityof,     author = {Dror G. Feitelson},     title = {Sensitivity of Parallel Job Scheduling to Fat-Tailed Distributions},     institution = {},     year = {2000} } Fat tailed distributions have been found to characterize many aspects of computer workloads, mainly with regard to communication and les. Analysis of workload logs from parallel supercomputers shows that the load on such machines can also be thus characterized, but that the source is a bursty arrival process, and not a fat-tailed distribution of runtimes. Nevertheless, fat-tailed loads are shown to affect scheduler performance (in terms of the scheduler's own runtime), and to have a significant effect on the convergence of simulations used to evaluate different scheduling policies. 158 Theory and practice in parallel job scheduling - Feitelson, Rudolph, et al. - 1997 (Show Context) Citation Context ...slowdown metric gives the shorter job an extremely high score, because the running time appears in the denominator.

Their solution to this problem is to do away with the use of slowdowns altogether, and stick with response times.
