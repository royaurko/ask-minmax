Processors are frequently the resource involved and the purpose of backfilling is to increase system utilization and reduce average wait time. Generally, a scheduler backfills when the user-specified run times indicate that executing the lower priority jobs will not delay the anticipated initiation of the higher priority jobs. This paper explores the possibility of using a relaxed backfill strategy in which the lower priority jobs are initiated as long as they do not delay the highest priority job too much. A simulator was developed to model this approach; it uses a parameter ω to control the length of the acceptable delay as a factor times the wait time of the highest priority job. Experiments were performed for a range of ω values with both user-estimated run times and actual run times using workload data from two parallel systems, a Cray T3E and an SGI Origin 3800. For these workloads, overall average job wait time typically decreases as ω increases and use of user-estimated run times is superior to use of actual run times. More experiments must be performed to determine the generality of these results.
