Multiprocessor tasks require more than one processor at the same moment of time. This relatively new concept in scheduling theory emerged with the advent of parallel computing systems. In this work we present the state of the art for multiprocessor task scheduling. We show the rationale behind the concept of multiprocessor tasks. The standard three-field notation is extended to accommodate multiprocessor tasks. The main part of the work is presentation of the results in multiprocessor tasks scheduling both for parallel and for dedicated processors.
