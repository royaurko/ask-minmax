Workshop: Distributed Computing and Metacomputing Volume 1593 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 851-860 Date: 17 November 2006 Resource allocation and scheduling in metasystems Uwe Schwiegelshohn Affiliated with Computer Engineering Institute, University Dortmund , Ramin Yahyapour Affiliated with Computer Engineering Institute, University Dortmund In this paper we present NWIRE , a new management architecture for metacomputing systems. After the general introduction of the architecture we first describe the properties that are relevant for scheduling. Then we derive general requirements for scheduling strategies in metasystems and point out differences to conventional job scheduling for parallel processors. This leads to the metacomputing scheduling concept of NWIRE which is based on a brokerage and trading approach. Supported by the NRW Metacomputing grant
