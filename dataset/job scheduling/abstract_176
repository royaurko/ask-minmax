Volume 4927 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 67-74 Online Algorithm for Parallel Job Scheduling and Strip Packing Johann L. Hurink Affiliated with University of Twente , Jacob Jan Paulus Affiliated with University of Twente We consider the online scheduling problem of parallel jobs on parallel machines, P |online − list, m j | C max . For this problem we present a 6.6623-competitive algorithm. This improves the best known 7- competitive algorithm for this problem. The presented algorithm also applies to the special case where machines are ordered on a line and only adjacent machines can be assigned to a job and, therefore, also to online orthogonal strip packing. Since previous results for online orthogonal strip packing assume bounded rectangles, the presented algorithm is the first with a constant competitive ratio.
