In this paper the Discrete Lotsizing and Scheduling Problem (DLSP) is considered. DLSP relates to capacitated lotsizing as well as to job scheduling problems and is concerned with determining a feasible production schedule with minimal total costs in a single-stage manufacturing process. This involves the sequencing and sizing of production lots for a number of different items over a discrete and finite planning horizon. Feasibility of production schedules is subject to production quantities being within bounds set by capacity. A problem classification for DLSP is introduced and results on computational complexity are derived for a number of single and parallel machine problems. Furthermore, efficient algorithms are discussed for solving special single and parallel machine variants of DLSP.
