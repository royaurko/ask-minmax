Scheduling a job j requires selecting an interval of length p j between its release date and deadline, and assigning it to a machine, with the restriction that each machine executes at most one job at any given time. This is one of the basic settings in the resource-minimization job scheduling, and the classical randomized rounding technique of Raghavan and Thompson provides an O (log n /loglog n )-approximation for it. This result has been recently improved to an \(O(\sqrt{\log n})\) -approximation, and moreover an efficient algorithm for scheduling all jobs on O (( OPT ) 2 ) machines has been shown. We build on this prior work to obtain a constant factor approximation algorithm for the problem. An Erratum for this chapter can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-03685-9_54
