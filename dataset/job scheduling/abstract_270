We consider a heuristic which has been applied to assign a common due date to a set of n jobs and schedule them on a set of m parallel and identical machines so that the weighted sum of the due date, earliness and tardiness is approximately minimized. We alter the heuristic slightly and show that the revised version is asymptotically optimal as n →∞. PDF
