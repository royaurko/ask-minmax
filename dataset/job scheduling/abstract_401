De-centralized job scheduling is implemented by job migrations between neighboring grid nodes. To optimize node selection of a new-submitted job, the job may be migrated many times. Here, the hill climbing method is used to determine the migration route. Experiments simulate de-centralized job scheduling, including node adjacencies, local scheduling of grid nodes, and grid workload. Compared with k-distributed and auction methods, hill climbing-based scheduling usually can enhance processor utilization, and can reduce bounded slowdown
