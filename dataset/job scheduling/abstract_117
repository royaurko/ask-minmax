  The static job scheduling problem in a partitionable mesh connected system (PMCS) is addressed. The relationship between static job scheduling and system partitioning is discussed and a lower bound for the absolute worst case performance of any polynomial time static job scheduling approximation algorithm in PMCS is obtained. A heuristic algorithm based on the simple partitioning strategy, layer by layer, and the scheduling policy, longest processing time first, is presented and its performance is analyzed. We prove that 5 + 4 p /(8 q − p ) is a worst case absolute performance bound of our algorithm, where p × q is the size of the PMCS. The bound is improved to 5 when each job requires a square submesh. If for any job we have a ⩽ p / m and b ⩽ q / m , where a × b is the size of the job and m ⩾ 3, then the bound is reduced to 2 + 2/( m − 2); if, in addition, every job requires a square submesh, then the bound is improved to 2 + (2 m − 1)/( m – 1) 2 .
