This paper presents the scheduling strategies in distributed computing. The fact that architecture of the computational environment is distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic along with autonomy of processor nodes, makes it much more difficult to manage and assign resources for job execution which fulfils user expectations for quality of service (QoS). The strategies are implemented using a combination of job-flow and application-level techniques of scheduling and resource co-allocation. Strategy is considered as a set of possible job scheduling variants with a coordinated allocation of the tasks to the processor nodes. Applications are regarded as compound jobs with a complex structure containing several tasks. The choice of the specific scheduling depends on the load level of the resource dynamics and is formed as a resource request, which is sent to a local batch-job management system.
