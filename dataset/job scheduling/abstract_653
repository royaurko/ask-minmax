Date: 25 May 2006 Expanding symmetric multiprocessor capability through gang scheduling Morris A. Jette Affiliated with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems normally provide both space-sharing and time-sharing to insure high system utilization and good responsiveness. However the prevailing lack of concurrent scheduling for parallel programs precludes SMP use in addressing many large-scale problems. Tightly synchronized communications are impractical and normal time-sharing reduces the benefit of cache memory. Evidence gathered at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) indicates that gang scheduling can increase the capability of SMP systems and parallel program performance without adverse impact upon system utilization or responsiveness.
