In the VMC scheduling problem, each job undergoes different processing routes and there is a set of machines to process any operation. Jobs are produced in lot and lot-streaming is permitted. In addition, machines are distributed through the facility, which raises the travelling time issue. For this reason, the decisions are machine assignments, starting times and sub-lot sizes of the operations. We develop a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that considers all aspects of the problem. Owing to the intractability matter, it is unlikely that the MILP could provide solutions for big-sized instances within a reasonable amount of time. We therefore present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a new chromosome structure for the VMC environment. Based on a wide range of examinations, comparative results show that GA is quite favourable and that it obtains the optimum solution for any of the instances in the case where sub-lot number equals 1.
