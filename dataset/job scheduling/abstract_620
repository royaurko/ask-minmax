Efficient job scheduling in grids is challenging due to the large number of distributed autonomous resources. In this paper we study various resource allocation policies in a 2-level grid system. A simulation model is used to evaluate performance of these policies at the grid level and at the local level. Grid level policies include cases where the grid scheduler uses site information (deferred policy), a random policy, and a combination of the two (hybrid). Simulation results indicate that the hybrid performs better regardless of the local policy.
