a. determining a set of requirements necessary to execute the job; b. assembling a set of parts of the plurality of parts so that the set of parts is capable of meeting the set of requirements and so that a part is added to the set of parts based on a determination that the addition of the part will minimize power consumption by the set of parts; and c. causing the set of parts to execute the job. a. testing the power consumption of each part in the set during execution of the job; b. comparing each power consumption tested during job execution of the job to a corresponding indication of power consumption stored in the data structure; and c. updating an indication of power consumption stored in the data structure to reflect a new indication of power consumption corresponding to the power consumption tested during job execution when the power consumption tested during job execution is different from the corresponding indication of power consumption stored in the data structure. a. ranking a set of parts, each part associated with a part type, according to power consumption by the part; a. testing the power consumption of each part allocated to the job during execution of the job; b. comparing each power consumption tested during job execution of the job to a corresponding indication of power consumption stored in the data structure; and c. updating an indication of power consumption stored in the data structure to reflect a new indication of power consumption corresponding to the power consumption tested during job execution when the power consumption tested during job execution is different from the corresponding indication of power consumption stored in the data structure.
