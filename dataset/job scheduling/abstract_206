Volume 2552 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 174-183 Date: 18 December 2002 Effective Selection of Partition Sizes for Moldable Scheduling of Parallel Jobs Srividya Srinivasan Affiliated with Ohio State University , Vijay Subramani Affiliated with Ohio State University , Rajkumar Kettimuthu Affiliated with Ohio State University , Praveen Holenarsipur Affiliated with Ohio State University , P. Sadayappan Affiliated with Ohio State University Although the current practice in parallel job scheduling requires jobs to specify a particular number of requested processors, most parallel jobs are moldable, i.e. the required number of processors is flexible. This paper addresses the issue of effective selection of processor partition size for moldable jobs. The proposed scheduling strategy is shown to provide significant benefits over a rigid scheduling model and is also considerably better than a previously proposed approach to moldable job scheduling.
