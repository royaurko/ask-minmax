Currently, most computational grids (systems allowing transparent sharing of computing resources across organizational boundaries) are assembled using human negotiation. This procedure does not scale well, and is too inflexible to allow for large open grids. Peer-to-peer (P2P) grids present an alternative way to build grids with many sites. However, to actually assemble a large grid, peers must have an incentive to provide resources to the system. In this paper we present an incentive mechanism called the Network of Favors , which makes it in the interest of each participating peer to contribute its spare resources. We show through simulations with up to 10,000 peers and experiments with software implementing the mechanism in a deployed system that the Network of Favors promotes collaboration in a simple, robust and scalable fashion. We also discuss experiences of using OurGrid, a grid based on this mechanism.
