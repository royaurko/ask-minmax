A KIND OF HYBRID HEURISTIC GENETIC ALGORITHM WITH APPLICATIONS TO JOB SHOP SCHEDULING Zhou Hong, Feng Yuncheng(Management School, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, 100083)   A kind of hybrid heuristic genetic algorithm is introduced for the job shop problem n/m/G/C max , in which the scheduling rules of SPT and MWKR are applied, and the neighbourhood search technique (NST) is adopted as an auxiliary procedure to improve the solution performance. The new algorithm is proved to be both effective and efficient by the comparison with some methods in common use at present. 【Key Words】： sequencing production planning heuristic approach genetic algorithm 【Fund】： 国家自然科学基金 【CateGory Index】： C931.1,O223 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 7 Hits 1 JI Bin, ZHOU Hong, LIU Chen-yong(School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Asbonautics, Beijing 100083); A New Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for JOB SHOP Scheduling [J];Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics(Social Sciences Edition);2001-01 2 LIN Keng, HUANG Yuan-shi (Department of mathematics, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002, China); A model of the schedule for MPS in ERP based on adopting adaptive genetic algorithms [J];Journal of Fuzhou University(Natural Sciences Edtion);2002-04 3 YU Jian-jun, SUN Shu-dong, WANG Jun-qiang, WU Xiu-li(School of Mechatronic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi′an 710072, China); Flexible Manufacturing Cell Dynamic Scheduling by Immune Algorithm [J];Acta Aeronautica Et Astronautica Sinica;2007-02 4 LIANG Chun-hua, ZHOU Hong, ZHAO Jian (School of Economics and Management, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China.); Integrated optimization approach for production-distribution planning in supply chain [J];Control and Decision;2011-01 5 ZHOU Hong\+1, CHEUNG Wai\|man\+2 (1.
