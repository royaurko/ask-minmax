Grid computing provides a high performance computing platform to solve larger scale applications by coordinating and sharing computational power, data storage and network resources across dynamic and geographically dispersed organizations. Scheduling onto the Grid is NP-complete, so there is no best scheduling algorithm for all grid computing systems. An alternative is to select an appropriate scheduling algorithm to use in a given grid environment because of the characteristics of the tasks, machines and network connectivity. Job scheduling is one of the key research area in grid computing. The goal of scheduling is to achieve highest possible system throughput and to match the application need with the available computing resources. Motivation of this study is to encourage and help the amateur researcher in the field of grid computing, so that they can understand easily the concept of scheduling and can contribute in developing more efficient and practical scheduling algorithm. This will benefit interested researchers to carry out further work in this thrust area of research.
