In addition to other advantages, computational grids are considered to utilize the participating compute resources more efficiently as well as to improve the response time for user jobs. Due to the lack of common large scale global grids and corresponding studies on grid workloads this assumption is not yet verified. In this paper, the effect of geographical distribution of grid resources on the machine utilization and the average response time is analyzed. To this end, simulations have been performed. The results show a significant benefit for the job scheduling quality due to the participation in a true global grid. The average weighted response times of all submitted jobs decrease up to about 30%. The results have been verified using different workloads and grid configurations.
