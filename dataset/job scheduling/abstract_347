The efficiency of a grid environment largely depends on the scheduling method it follows. This paper proposes a framework for grid scheduling using dynamic information and an ant colony optimization algorithm to improve the decision of scheduling. A notion of two types of ants -‘Red Ants’ and ‘Black Ants’ have been introduced. The purpose of red and Black Ants has been explained and algorithms have been developed for optimizing the resource utilization. The proposed method does optimization at two levels and it is found to be more efficient than existing methods.
