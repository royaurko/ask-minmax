Using trace-based simulation, we show that if performance is viewed within various job categories based on their width (processor request size) and length (job duration), some consistent trends may be observed. Using insights gleaned by the characterization, we develop a selective reservation strategy for backfill scheduling. We demonstrate that the new scheme is better than both conservative and aggressive backfilling. We also consider the issue of fairness in job scheduling and develop a new quantitative approach to its characterization. We show that the newly proposed schemes are also comparable or better than aggressive backfilling with respect to the fairness criterion.
