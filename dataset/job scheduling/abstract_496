In this paper, we propose a price-based user-optimal job allocation scheme for grid systems whose nodes are connected by a communication network. The job allocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative game among the users who try to minimize the expected cost of their own jobs. We use the concept of Nash equilibrium as the solution of our noncooperative game and derive a distributed algorithm for computing it. The prices that the grid users has to pay for using the computing resources owned by different resource owners are obtained using a pricing model based on a game theory framework. Finally, our scheme is compared with a system-optimal job allocation scheme under simulations with various system loads and configurations and conclusions are drawn
