In this paper, we propose a new scheme, termed as QoPS to provide Quality of Service (QoS) in the response time given to the end user in the form of guarantees in the completion time to submitted independent parallel jobs. To the best of our knowledge, this scheme is the first one to implement admission control and guarantee deadlines for admitted parallel jobs.
