JOB SCHEDULING MODEL OF MACHINING SYSTEM FOR GREEN MANUFACTURING HE Yan LIU Fei CAO Huajun LIU Chun (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044)   A machining system is one of important elements for implementing green manufacturing in workshop. It has been discovered that job scheduling, which can decrease resource consumption and reduce environmental impacts, is an approach to improving green attributes of machining systems. A job scheduling model of a machining system for green man- ufacturing is proposed with description of the schematic model and the mathematic model, which describes the whole sch- eduling process and the relations of the elements of the job scheduling model. The objective architecture of the model is constructed in terms of the green attributes of machining systems which is composed of several sub-objectives, and the analysis of each sub-objective is presented. Finally, a case study is analyzed to show the application of the model. 【Key Words】： Green manufacturing Scheduling Machining systems Environmental impacts 【Fund】： 国家自然科学基金(50475062);; 国家科技支撑计划(2006BAF02A03);; 重庆市自然科学基金(2004-47-19)资助项目。 【CateGory Index】： TG506 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 1 BAI Xiao-li,XU Xue-meng,TIAN Yong(College of Mechatronics Engineering,Henan University of Technology,Zhengzhou 450007,China); Application of quality function deployment on green manufacturing [J];Information Technology;2010-01 2 YIN Yong1,ZHOU Zu-de1,LONG Yi-hong2(1.School of Information Engineering,Wuhan University of Technology,Wuhan 430070,China;2.Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing in Hubei Province,Wuhan University of Technology,Wuhan 430070,China); Modeling and Analysis of the Energy and Resource Consumption in Green Manufacturing [J];Modular Machine Tool & Automatic Manufacturing Technique;2009-09 【Citations】 1 HU Shi-cheng, XU Xiao-fei, ZHAN De-chen(Sch.of Computer Sci. &Tech., Harbin Inst.of Tech., Harbin150001, China); A Production Scheduling Algorithm for Cost Optimization [J];Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems;2003-09 2 Cao Huajun Liu Fei Yan Chunping Li Congbo (Institute of Manufacturing Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044); ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EVALUATION METHOD OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND ITS CASE [J];Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering;2005-06 3 HE Yan, LIU Fei, CAO Hua-jun, LI Cong-bo (Institute of Green Manufacturing Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China); A bi-objective model for job-shop scheduling problem to minimize both energy consumption and makespan [J];中南工业大学学报(英文版);2005-S2 【Co-citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 ZHANG Hong-guo1,LI Ji-ge1,CHEN Yu2(1.School of Software,Harbin Univ.Sci.Tech.,Harbin 150080,China;2.Heilongjiang Gamma Telecom.Engineering Co.LTD,Harbin 150080,China); An Optimization Algorithm for Project Plan of Agile Virtual Enterprise with Capital Flow Constraint [J];Journal of Harbin University of Science and Technology;2007-01 2 YU Guo-Yan (Engineering College of Guangdong Ocean University, ZhangJiang Guangdong 524088, China); Research on Green Design Technology for Electromechanical Products [J];Development & Innovation of Machinery & Electrical Products;2007-02 3 TIAN Miao,LUO An (College of Electrical&Information Engineering Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China); J2EE's Technique is Living the Application in Papermaking-industry ERP's System [J];Computing Technology and Automation;2004-03 4 JIANG Zhi-gang1,ZHANG Hua1,FU Cheng1,HE Yan2(1.School of Mechanics & Automation,Wuhan University of Science & Technology,Wuhan 430081,China;2.Institute of Manufacturing Engineering,Chongqing University,Chongqing 400044,China); Comprehensive assessment system for resource and environmental attribution in production process [J];Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems;2009-07 5 LIAO Lan,LIU Xian-bin (Department of Mechanical and Packaging Engineering,Chongqing Technology & Business University,Chongqing,400067,China); Assessment for environment effects of vibratory stress relief and thermal ageing [J];Heat Treatment of Metals;2008-09 6 JIANG Guo-zhang, KONG Jian-yi, LI Gong-fa,XIONG He-gen, YANG Jin-tang (College of Machinery and Automation, Wuhan University of Science and Technology,Wuhan 430081,China); Research on production planning modeling of steel enterprise based on genetic algorithm [J];Machinery Design & Manufacture;2007-05 7 WANG Xian-lin,ZHANG Hua,SONG Jia-jia(College of Mechanism and Automation,Wuhan University of Science and Technology,Wuhan430081,China); A Method for Identifying the Environmental Factors of the Valve Production Process [J];Mechanical & Electrical Engineering Technology;2009-12 8 ZHANG Hua,JIANG Du-ren,JIANG Zhi-gang(College of Machinery and Automation,Wuhan University of Science and Technology,Wuhan 430081,China); Green Evaluation Supporting System of Manufacturing Process Based on Knowledge Management [J];Machinery & Electronics;2010-07 9 WANG Xiao-wei1,2,LI Jian-feng1,LI Fang-yi1,WANG Li-ming1(1.
