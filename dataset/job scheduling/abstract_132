We give the first general upper bound and improve existing lower bounds on the competitive ratio of the problem. The novelty of our work is the introduction of a new job scheduling problem that allows cancellation. We prove that the broadcasting problem can be reduced to this scheduling problem. This reduction frees us from the complication of the broadcasting model and allows us to work on a conceptually simpler model for upper bound results.
