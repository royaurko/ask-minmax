The problems addressed in this paper arise in industry when flexible, automated machines are used to manufacture parts (jobs). These machines include numerically controlled (N/C) tools, robots,...etc. The goal is to avoid unnecessary set-up operations in order to effectively utilize the michines. In this paper we focus on developing a job scheduling model that considers the tool requirement of each job in an explicit fashion.
