  Scheduling is a fundamental issue in achieving high performance on metacomputers and computational grids. For the first time, the job scheduling problem for grid computing on metacomputers is studied as a combinatorial optimization problem. A cost model is proposed for modeling communication heterogeneity on computational grids. A processor allocation algorithm is developed which always finds an optimal processor allocation that minimizes the effective execution time of a job when the job is being scheduled. It is proven that the list scheduling (LS) algorithm can achieve reasonable worst-case performance bound in grid environments supporting distributed supercomputing with large applications. We compare the performance of various job scheduling and processor allocation algorithms for grid computing on metacomputers. We evaluate the performance of 128 combinations of two job scheduling algorithms, four initial job ordering strategies, four processor allocation algorithms, and four metacomputers by extensive simulation. It is found that the combination of largest job first (LJF) initial job ordering and minimum effective execution time (MEET) or largest machine first (LMF) processor allocation algorithm yields the best average-case performance, and the choice of FCFS and LS depends on the range of job sizes. It is also observed that communication heterogeneity does have significant impact on schedule lengths.
