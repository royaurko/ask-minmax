Economies of scale are fundamental to manufacturing operations. With respect to scheduling, this phenomenon manifests itself in efficiencies gained from grouping similar jobs together. This paper reviews the rapidly growing literature on single-machine scheduling models that incorporate benefits from job grouping. We focus on three basic models known as family scheduling with item availability , family scheduling with batch availability , and batch processing . We present known results and introduce new results, and we pay special attention to key theoretical properties and the use of these properties in optimization procedures.
