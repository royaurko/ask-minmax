Volume 5698 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 350-359 Application-Level and Job-Flow Scheduling: An Approach for Achieving Quality of Service in Distributed Computing VictorÂ Toporkov Affiliated with Lancaster University Computer Science Department, Moscow Power Engineering Institute This paper presents the scheduling strategies framework for distributed computing. The fact that architecture of the computational environment is distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic along with autonomy of processor nodes, makes it much more difficult to manage and assign resources for job execution which fulfils user expectations for quality of service (QoS).The strategies are implemented using a combination of job-flow and application-level techniques of scheduling and resource co-allocation within virtual organizations of Grid. Applications are regarded as compound jobs with a complex structure containing several tasks. Strategy is considered as a set of possible job scheduling variants with a coordinated allocation of the tasks to the processor nodes. The choice of the specific variant depends on the load level of the resource dynamics and is formed as a resource request, which is sent to a local batch-job management system.
