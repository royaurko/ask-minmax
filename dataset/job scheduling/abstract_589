Computer solutions have not made a very significant impact on scheduling problems. This reflects the fact that algorithmic solutions are often not appropriate for scheduling problems. Scheduling problems are more amenable to heuristic solution techniques. This paper describes a heuristic system for job scheduling in printed circuit board assembly. The main part of the system is written in Common LISP.
