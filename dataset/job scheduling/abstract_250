Cloud computing aims on delivery of fault tolerant, scalable and reliable infrastructure to host Internet based application services. Our work presents the implementation of an efficient Quality of Service (QoS) based smart-scheduler along with Backfill strategy based light weight Virtual Machine Scheduler for dispatching jobs. The user centric smart-scheduler deals with selection of proper resources to execute high level jobs. The system centric Virtual Machine (VM) scheduler optimally dispatches the jobs to processors for better resource utilization. We also present our proposals on scheduling heuristics that can be incorporated at data center level for selecting ideal host for VM creation. Here Pollaczek-Khintchine (M/G/1) queuing model with non - preemptive priority and single server has been used to build an advanced job-scheduling system, assuming that Cloud-users' jobs come to the server following Poisson distribution while the process time to each job by the server has a general distribution. The implementation can be further extended at the host level, using load balancing in cloud environment.
