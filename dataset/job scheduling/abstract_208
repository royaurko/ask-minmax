Trust-driven job scheduling heuristics for computing grid ZHANG Wei-zhe1,LIU Xin-ran2,3,YUN Xiao-chun1,ZHANG Hong-li1,HU Ming-zeng1,LIU Kai-peng1(1.School of Computer Science and Technology,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin 150001,China;2.National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China,Beijing 100029,China;3.School of Computer Science and Technology,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing 100876,China)   Currently existing grid scheduling algorithms largely ignore the impact of trust mechanism,which made their applicability in a realistic environment rather doubtful.Based on the grid trust model and trust utilization functions,a trust-driven grid job scheduling problem was proposed.Trust-driven Min-min and Sufferage job scheduling heuristics were presented,which were extended based on traditional job scheduling strategies.The algorithms were evaluated with large scale simulation.Simulation result demonstrates trust-driven heuristics perform better than time-driven heuristic on average trust utility and total trust utility.
