We argue that by identifying these assumptions explicitly, it is possible to reach a level of convergence. For example, it is possible to unite most of the different assumptions into a common framework by associating a suitable cost function with the execution of each job. The cost function reflects knowledge about the job and the degree to which it fits the goals of the system. Given such cost functions, scheduling is done to maximize the system's profit.
