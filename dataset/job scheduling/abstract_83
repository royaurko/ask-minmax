The resource broker provides an interface for accessing available and appropriate resources via user credentials. We use the Ganglia and NWS tools to monitor resource status and network-related information, respectively. We also report on using the Globus Toolkit to construct a grid platform called the TIGER project that integrates the distributed resources of five universities in Taichung, Taiwan, where the resource broker was developed. The proposed broker provides secure, updated information about available resources and serves as a link to the diverse systems available in the Grid.
