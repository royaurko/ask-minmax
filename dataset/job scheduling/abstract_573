Volume 7698 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 1-15 Web-Scale Job Scheduling Walfredo Cirne Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University Google , Eitan Frachtenberg Affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University Facebook Web datacenters and clusters can be larger than the world’s largest supercomputers, and run workloads that are at least as heterogeneous and complex as their high-performance computing counterparts. And yet little is known about the unique job scheduling challenges of these environments. This article aims to ameliorate this situation. It discusses the challenges of running web infrastructure and describes several techniques to address them. It also presents some of the problems that remain open in the field.
