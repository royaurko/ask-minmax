An Ant Algorithm Based Grid Computing and Task Scheduling XU Zhi-hong, SUN Ji-zhou (School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China)   The complex resources and tasks in Grid computing environment make it very difficult to validate the methods of resource management and task scheduling. This paper proposes a simulation architecture for grid computing, designs and realizes an ant algorithm based task scheduling method, combines resource management and task scheduling, and gives attention to quality of service (QOS). The experimental results are perfect. 【Key Words】： grid computing task scheduling resource management ant algorithm 【CateGory Index】： TP393.09 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 5 Hits 1 WANG Tong, JIA Zhi-ping (Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan 250101, China); Ad Hoc grid task scheduling algorithm based on trust demand [J];Computer Engineering and Design;2009-10 2 ZHOU Cailan:Assoc.Prof.;School of Computer Science & Technology,WUT,Wuhan 430070,China.HU Jin,GUO Hongjie; Immune-based Ant Colony Algorithm in Grid [J];Journal of Wuhan University of Technology(Information & Management Engineering);2009-03 3 YUE Xiao-bo,LI Jing-jing,TANG Xian-ying (College of Computer Application and Communication,Changsha University of Science and Technology,Changsha 410076,China); An Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm of Resource Scheduling Based on Petri net [J];Computer Technology and Development;2006-01 4 ZHAO Chen-yang1, YANG Yi1, 2, LIU Li1, 2, LI Lian1 (1 Department of Information, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China; 2 School of Mathematics, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China); Research on Job Scheduling Based on Ant Algorithm in Computational Grid [J];Microelectronics & Computer;2007-09 5 HE Zhi-ming , CAO Hai-xia (College of Information Engineering, Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, Ganzhou 341000 China); Research on Job Scheduling based on a Heuristic Intelligent Algorithm in Grid Environment [J];Modern Computer;2006-01 China Proceedings of conference Full-text Database 2 Hits 1 Quanmin Wang, Liang Wang, Zhihong Xu (College of Computer Science, Beijing University of Technology 100022) (College of Electronic and Information Engineering,Tianjin University 300072); Study of Ant Algorithm-Based Batch Job Scheduling in Grid Computing [A];[C];2006 2 LAI Hua, WANG Yong (School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China); Job Scheduling Based on the Improvements of Ant Algorithm in Grid Environment [A];[C];2006 【Co-references】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 LIN Zhi-huan1,LIN Zong-kai2(1.National Research Center for Marine Environmental Forecasts,Beijing 100081,China;2.Institute of Computing Technology,CAS,Beijing 100080,China); The Strategies for Resource Allocation in Grid and Its Applications in Ocean Forecast [J];Journal of Putian University;2004-03 2 Li Longshu (Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Anhui University,Hefei 230039) Zhang Xia (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering,Anhui University,Hefei 230039); Research on a New Type of Information Retrieval System Based on Rough Set [J];Journal of The China Society For Scientific and Technical Information;2002-01 3 Dong Hui (Research Center of Information Resources,Wuhan University,Wuhan 430072); Information Retrieval Based on Ontology and Digital Library [J];Journal of The China Society For Scientific and Technical Information;2003-06 4 Wu Lihua~(1,2) and Liu Lu~2(1.Department of Computer Information System,Beijing Information Technology Institute,Beijing 100101;2.School of Economics & Management,Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Beijing 100083); User Profiling for Personalized Recommending Systems?—A Review [J];Journal of the China Society for Scientific and Technical Information;2006-01 5 WANG Ling, ZHENG Dazhong (Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China); Unified framework for neighbor search algorithms and hybrid optimization strategies [J];JOURNAL OF TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY(SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY);2000-09 6 YANG Zhigang, WANG Xiankui, LIU Chengying, WEI Zhiqiang(Department of Precision Instruments and Mechanology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China); Task model and task allocation algorithm for agile process planning [J];Journal of Tsinghua University(Science and Technology);2002-02 7 JIE Yuxin~1, HU Tao~1, LI Qingyun~2, LI Guangxin~1(1.
