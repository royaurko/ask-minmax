Volume 1459 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 1-24 Date: 25 May 2006 Metrics and benchmarking for parallel job scheduling Dror G. Feitelson Affiliated with Institute of Computer Science, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Larry Rudolph Affiliated with Laboratory for Computer Science, MIT The evaluation of parallel job schedulers hinges on two things: the use of appropriate metrics, and the use of appropriate workloads on which the scheduler can operate. We argue that the focus should be on on-line open systems, and propose that a standard workload should be used as a benchmark for schedulers. This benchmark will specify distributions of parallelism and runtime, as found by analyzing accounting traces, and also internal structures that create different speedup and synchronization characteristics. As for metrics, we present some problems with slowdown and bounded slowdown that have been proposed recently.
