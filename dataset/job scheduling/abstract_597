Research on the Job Shop Scheduling Optimization based on CPSO Algorithm. Source: Journal of Convergence Information Technology . Jun2012, Vol. 7 Issue 11, p60-66. 7p. Author(s): Jia He; Jin Jin Abstract: In consideration of traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm's weaknesses like premature convergence and local optimization etc., we hereby put forward a JSP optimization method based on chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm, with a view to improving the job scheduling efficiency. First of all, we will take the "Minimum Machining Time" as the optimization objective to set up a multi-constraint JSP mathematical model, and then solve the model through the particle algorithm, in addition to maintaining the particle diversification by using the chaos mechanism. Simulation test results show that compared to traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm, CPSO has shorter mean solving time, and leads to better job shop scheduling plan, which helps efficiently resolve the job shop scheduling problem.
