The problem of online job scheduling on various parallel architectures is studied. An O ((log log n ) 1/2 )-competitive algorithm for online dynamic scheduling on an n Ã— n mesh is given. It is proved that this algorithm is optimal up to a constant factor. The algorithm is not greedy, and the lower bound proof shows that no greedy-like algorithm can be very good. The upper bound result can be generalized to any fixed-dimensional meshes. Competitive scheduling algorithms for other architectures are given
