This paper designs a grid resource management model oriented information service and achieves the functions of the various components. The author presents an improved “divided” algorithm based on the traditional, classical Min-Min scheduling algorithm, and then simulates the algorithm by Grid simulator GridSim. Comparing with the traditional Min-Min algorithm, this improved one overcomes the disadvantage of load balancing preferably. resource management system; grid; job scheduling; Qian Zhang, Zhen Li, "Design of Grid Resource Management System Based on Divided Min-Min Scheduling Algorithm", ETCS , 2009, Education Technology and Computer Science, International Workshop on, Education Technology and Computer Science, International Workshop on 2009, pp. 613-617, doi:10.1109/ETCS.2009.670
