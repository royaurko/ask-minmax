The goal of grid computing is to aggregate the power of widely distributed resources. Considering that the probability of failure is great in such systems, fault tolerance has become a crucial area in computational grid. In this paper, we propose a new strategy named RFOH for fault tolerant job scheduling in computational grid. This strategy maintains the history of fault occurrence of resources in Grid Information Server (GIS). Whenever a resource broker has jobs to schedule, it uses this information in Genetic Algorithm and finds a near optimal solution for the problem. Further, it increases the percentage of jobs executed within specified deadline. The experimental result shows that we can have a combination of user satisfaction and reliability. Using checkpoint techniques, the proposed strategy can make grid scheduling more reliable and efficient.
