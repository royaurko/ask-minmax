  The problem of sequencing jobs on a machine in a job shop has been approached by a number of researchers and practitioners. One of the most popular methods is to apply a priority rule to the queue at each machine. The authors have previously published details of an approach which sets the priority of a job as a linear combination of the operation times and due date for that job. The coefficients in the linear combination are set by a simulation and search procedure so as to give good performance based on the performance measure specified. This paper extends this approach to include setup time factors. This extended approach is then applied to data from an actual manufacturing system. The extended approach is shown to improve the performance of the manufacturing system in relation to existing techniques. References 1.
