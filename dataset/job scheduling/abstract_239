Hierarchical strategies have been proposed in the literature for complex scheduling problems, and the tabu search metaheuristic, being able to cope with different memory levels, provides a natural background for the development of a hierarchical algorithm. For the case considered, a two level approach has been devised, based on the decomposition in a routing and a job shop scheduling subproblem, which is obtained by assigning each operation of each job to one among the equivalent machines. Both problems are tackled by tabu search. Coordination issues between the two hierarchical levels are considered. Unlike other hierarchical schemes, which are based on a one-way information flow, the one proposed here is based on a two-way information flow. This characteristic, together with the flexibility of local search strategies like tabu search, allows to adapt the same basic algorithm to different objective functions. Preliminary computational experience is reported.
