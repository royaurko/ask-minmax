Date: 12 July 2005 A historical application profiler for use by parallel schedulers RichardÂ Gibbons Affiliated with University of British Columbia Scheduling algorithms that use application and system knowledge have been shown to be more effective at scheduling parallel jobs on a multiprocessor than algorithms that do not. This paper focuses on obtaining such information for use by a scheduler in a network of workstations environment. The log files from three parallel systems are examined to determine both how to categorize parallel jobs for storage in a job database and what job information would be useful to a schedules. A Historical Profiler is proposed that stores information about programs and users, and manipulates this information to provide schedulers with execution time predictions. Several preemptive and non-preemptive versions of the FCFS, EASY and Least Work First scheduling algorithms are compared to evaluate the utility of the profiler. It is found that both preemption and the use of application execution time predictions obtained from the Historical Profiler lead to improved performance.
