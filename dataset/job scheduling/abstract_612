Factors such as CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time can influence system performance. Different operating systems use different scheduling algorithms to achieve their goals. System performance of grid computing is calculated from resources usages. Job scheduling is more important when jobs are not uniformly distributed in all grid nodes. In order to achieve performance optimization, we propose a maximum processor utilization and throughput (MPUT) scheduling algorithm which maximizes CPU utilization and throughput at the same time and minimizes turnaround time as well. The algorithm is used in all execute grid nodes to schedule their jobs and get good performance
