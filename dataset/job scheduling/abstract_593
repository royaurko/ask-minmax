Fixed Job Scheduling Model and Algorithm of Airline Aircraft Dispatching Problem SUN Hong, DU Wen (School of Traffic and Transp., Southwest Jiaotong Univ., Chengdu 610031, China)   On the basis of analyzing operational management method in Chinese airlines, a fixed job scheduling model for aircraft dispatching problem in single hub and spoke network are constructed, and the corresponding labeling algorithm is found. First, a new concept called “flight pairing” is defined, by which the aircraft flight dispatching problem is transferred to an aircraft flight pairing assignment problem which can be modeled by applying fixed job scheduling theory; Secondly, a labeling function of flight pairing and an aircraft labeling function are introduced; then the labeling algorithm is presented according to the rule “First In First Out”; Finally, an example is analyzed to demonstrate the application of this algorithm. The computerizing complexity of this algorithm is O(mn) . 【Key Words】： aircraft dispatching problem single hub and spoke network flight pairing fixed job scheduling model labeling algorithm 【Fund】： 中国民航科研基金资助 (2 0 0 0 -18) 【CateGory Index】： O223 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 SUN Hong~1,　WANG Da-hai~2　 (1.Air Traffic Management College, China Civil Aviation Flying College, Guanghan 618307, China; 2.Research Department, China Civil Aviation Flying College, Guanghan 618307, China); Airliner Flight Connecting Scheduling Based on Minimum Fleet Available [J];Flight Dynamics;2004-04 2 SUN Hong~1,ZHANG Xiang~1,XU Jie~2(1.CAAC Scientific Research Base of Civil Aviation Flight Technology and Safety,Civil Aviation Flying University of China,Guanghan 618307,China;2.State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety,Beijing Jiaotong University,Beijing 100044,China); Applying the Simulated Annealing Algorithm to Solve Airliner Aircraft Dispatching Problem [J];Flight Dynamics;2006-04 3 WEN Jun~(1,2),SUN Hong~(1,2),XU Jie~1,LIANG Zhi-jie~1 (1.
