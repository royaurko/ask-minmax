Based on the intelligent and agile characteristics of a multi-agents system and the optimizatical capacity of genetic algorithm, a distributed jobshop scheduling method is presented. A multi-agents based model of distributed scheduling system is established, then a distributed scheduling mechanism integrating multi-agents and GA and dynamic scheduling strategies based on multi-agent negotiation are proposed. Finally, a simulation experiment on solving the distributed dynamic scheduling with the methods is given. Simulation results show that the presented scheduling strategy is feasible and effective.
