Multi-capacity bin-packing is a generalization of the classical one-dimensional bin-packing problem in which the bin capacity and the item sizes are represented by d-dimensional vectors. Previous work in d-capacity bin-packing algorithms analyzed variants of single capacity bin-packing, extended to deal with the d capacities. These extended algorithms are oblivious to the additional capacity information, however, and do not scale well with increasing d. We provide new packing algorithms which use the additional capacity information to provide better packing and show how these algorithms might lead to better multi-resource allocation and scheduling solutions
