Efficient multisite job scheduling facilitates the cooperation of multi-domain massively parallel processor systems in a computing grid environment. However, co-allocation, heterogeneity, adaptability, and scalability emerge as tough challenges for the design of multisite job scheduling models and algorithms. This paper presents a new multisite job scheduling schema based on the multisite job scheduling model and the performance model for a heterogeneous grid environment. There are three key components: resource selection, reservation, and backfilling. The optimal and greedy-heuristic adaptive resource selection strategies are introduced. The conservative and easy backfilling are incorporated into the backfilling procedure. Experiments indicate that the scheduler and the algorithm are effective and perform better than a non-adaptive algorithm
