Those expectations may relate to a single job application or an application that consists of a collection of dependent jobs. In the context of Grid computing, applications consisting of dependent tasks become increasingly important, usually known as workflows. This paper focuses on the problem of planning advance reservations for individual tasks of workflow-type of applications when the user specifies a requirement only for the whole workflow application. Two policies to automate advance reservation planning for individual tasks efficiently are presented and evaluated.
