Optimization of Job-Shop Scheduling Based on Simulation MA Yu-min1,FAN Liu-qun2,ZHANG Wei-min2,ZHANG Hao1 (1.CIMS Research Center,Tongji University,Shanghai 200092,China; 2.Sino-German College,Tongji University,Shanghai 200092,China)   A job-shop scheduling problem is proved to be a NP-hard problem. Considering its complexity and its difficulty in solving,a solution that combining simulation and optimization algorithms was provided. A framework of job-shop scheduling simulation optimization system was suggested. The system was analyzed using UML,mapped in eM-Plant simulation software,and its model parameters were optimized through genetic algorithm (GA) to get the ideal scheduling. An example was given to explain the system. This solution is easy and feasible,and provides a shortcut for this kind of complicated problem. 【Key Words】： Job Scheduling Simulation Genetic Algorithm (GA) eM-Plant 【Fund】： 中德政府项目(2002DFG00027) 【CateGory Index】： TP391.9 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 7 Hits 1 XU Xiangbin (Institution of Modern Manufacturing Technology,Eastern China Jiaotong University,Nanchang Jiangxi 330013,China); The Job Shop Scheduling Based on Genetic Algorithm and Implemented by eM-Plant [J];Machine Tool & Hydraulics;2008-09 2 CHEN Xiao-hui ZHANG Qi-zhong(Institute of Industrial Engineering,Chongqing University,Chongqing 400030,China); Production Scheduling Simulation and Optimization of Re-entrant Produce Jop Shop [J];Computer Science;2009-09 3 WANG Wei1,WANG Liang-hui1,ZHANG Xiao-dong2(1Shenyang Institute of Aeronautical Engineering,Shenyang 110136,China)(2Yi_en software,Shenyang 110034,China); Development of management system for aircraft tooling and maintain [J];Machinery Design & Manufacture;2009-10 4 YU Liu YAO Xi-fan ZHANG Zheng YU Guang; Simulation of Shop Floor and Automated Storage Based on Flexsim [J];Microcomputer Information;2009-16 5 PENG Xiong-feng1,LIU Mei-hong1,SUN Xiao-yan1,FU Ya-li2,LIANG Zhi-qiang2 (1.Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering,Kunming University of Science and Technology,Kunming 650093,China; 2.Kunming Ship Design and Research Institute,Kunming Ship Building Equipment Co.Ltd.,Kunming 650051,China); Simulation of job-shop scheduling problem with alterable machines based on Em-plant [J];Journal of Yunnan University(Natural Sciences Edition);2009-S1 6 ZHU Huabing, WU Wentao(School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230009,CHN); Study of Axle Housing Production Systems Simulation Based on UML [J];Manufacturing Technology & Machine Tool;2009-12 7 WU Wen-tao,ZHU Hua-bing(School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering,Hefei University of Technology,Hefei 230009,China); Study of Axle Housing Production Systems Based on Simulation and UML [J];Modular Machine Tool & Automatic Manufacturing Technique;2010-02 【Citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 3 Hits 1 Hu Bin;Li Zhicheng; Study On Dispatching Rules Algorithm for Rescheduling [J];SYSTEMS ENGINEERING;2000-01 2 ZHANG Hong - guo (Computer & Control College, Harbin Univ.
