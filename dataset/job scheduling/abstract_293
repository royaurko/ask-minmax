The authors consider the problem of scheduling a set of simultaneously available jobs on several parallel machines. Specifically, the minimization of the time to finish all the jobs assigned to all machines of scheduling sequence under job deadline constraints for the n jobs, m machines problem is formulated. The simulated annealing and fast simulated annealing algorithms are reviewed and adopted for the scheduling problem. A large number of simulations were carried out which provides an empirical basis for comparing the application of classical simulated annealing and fast simulated annealing algorithms to the scheduling problem
