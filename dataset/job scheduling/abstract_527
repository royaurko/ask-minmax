Volume 3719 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 165-173 Fault-Tolerant Dynamic Job Scheduling Policy J. H. Abawajy Affiliated with Lancaster University School of Information Technology, Deakin University In this paper, we propose a scalable and fault-tolerant job scheduling framework for grid computing. The proposed framework loosely couples a dynamic job scheduling approach with the hybrid replications approach to schedule jobs efficiently while at the same time providing fault-tolerance. The novelty of the proposed framework is that it uses passive replication approach under high system load and active replication approach under low system loads. The switch between these two replication methods is also done dynamically and transparently.
