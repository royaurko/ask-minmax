Parallel and Sequential Job Scheduling in Heterogeneous Clusters: A Simulation Study Using Software in the Loop David E. Collins HCS Research Lab ECE Dept. FAMU-FSU College of Engineering Tallahassee, FL Alan D. George HCS Research Lab ECE Dept. University of Florida Gainesville, FL The task of designing and optimizing job scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous computing environments requires the ability to predict scheduling performance. The complexity of heterogeneous scheduling issues re quires that the experiments devised to test a scheduling paradigm to be both flexible and extensive. Experimen tally determined models for the prediction of job execu tion times on both sequential and parallel computing resources are combined with the implementation of a novel scheduling algorithm and a software-in-the-loop (SWIL) simulation. The result is a potent design and analysis approach for job scheduling algorithms and implementations intended for heterogeneous environ ments. This paper develops the concepts, mechanisms, and results of a SWIL design and analysis approach. The merits of this approach are shown in four case stud ies, which determine overhead, scheduling performance, and the impact of preemption and priority policies. These case studies illustrate the contributions of this research in the form of a new parallel job scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous computing and in the novel application of SWIL simulation to the analysis of job scheduling systems.
