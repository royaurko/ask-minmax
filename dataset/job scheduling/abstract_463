In high throughput computing environments, an opportunistic scheduling policy is used for placement of batch jobs on idle workstations for execution. In this paper, we propose a new opportunistic scheduling policy with the aim of exploiting the idle resources provided by systems such as Condor in an opportunistic manner. We compared the performance of the proposed scheduling policy with three policies namely the scheduling policy used in Condor, job rotate and round robin policies through simulation. The results show that the proposed scheduling policy offers substantial performance improvements over the exiting approaches. Furthermore, this improved performance is achieved without loss of throughput and it results in a more interactive nature of the system thus increasing its appeal.
