Volume 3719 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 184-192 Job Scheduling Policy for High Throughput Grid Computing J. H. Abawajy Affiliated with Lancaster University School of Information Technology, Deakin University The growing computational power requirements of grand challenge applications has promoted the need for merging high throughput computing and grid computing principles to harness computational resources distributed across multiple organisations. This paper identifies the issues in resource management and scheduling in the emerging high throughput grid computing context. We also survey and study the performance of several space-sharing and time-sharing opportunistic scheduling policies that have been developed for high throughput computing.
