This problem has been tackled in the literature by several different meta-heuristics, and our main focus in this work is to develop a new highly competitive technique with respect to the existing ones. For that, we exploit the capabilities of Cellular Memetic Algorithms, a kind of Memetic Algorithm with structured population, for obtaining efficient batch schedulers for Grid systems, and the resulting scheduler is experimentally tested through a Grid simulator.
