  This paper discusses job shop scheduling from the viewpoint of dealing with fuzziness inherent in the problem. Some static problems with fuzzy information regarding due dates and/or operation times are solved using a branch-and-bound algorithm and the meaning of solving such scheduling problems is described. The method for handling dynamic problems with fuzzy information, i.e., fuzzy job shop simulation is also discussed, with the intention of applying the fuzzy theory to real-life job shop scheduling.
