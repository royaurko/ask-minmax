A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Solving a Multi-objective Job Scheduling Problem on Parallel Machines Based JIT Technique HUANG De-cai, GUO Hai-dong,SHEN Liang-zhong (College of Information Engineering,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou 310032,China)   A hybrid genetic algorithm is presented for minimizing the range of lateness and make-span on parallel identical machines. Its coding method is very simple because it utilized the properties of optimal effective algorithm of the corresponding single machine problem. Numeric examples illustrate that the genetic algorithm has the properties of fast convergence. The solutions gained by the genetic algorithm are pretty well. 【Key Words】： JIT job scheduling genetic algorithm 【Fund】： 浙江省自然科学基金 (60 1 0 76) 【CateGory Index】： O223 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 2 Hits 1 He Gui-xia(Zhijiang College,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou 310024,China); Research on Multi-objective Scheduling Problem Subjected to Special Process Constraint on Parallel Machines [J];Industrial Engineering Journal;2008-06 2 GAO Jia-quan(Zhijiang College,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou 310024,China); Parallel hybrid genetic algorithm for solving MPS problem in a kind of textile enterprises [J];Journal of Zhejiang University of Technology;2006-04 China Proceedings of conference Full-text Database 1 Hits 1 Li Junfeng , Dai Wenzhan Depeartment of Automatic control, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018 College of Information and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou 310035; Research of Solving Method against Multi-objective Problem Based on Adaptive Genetic Algorithm and Grey Relation Degree [A];[C];2006 【Citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 4 Hits 1 YIN Wen-jun,LIU Min,WU Cheng (Department of Automation, Tsinghua University,Beijing 100084,China); Currnet Staus and Prospect of Evolutionary Computation Applied to Production Scheduling [J];Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems;2001-12 2 LIU Min WU Cheng (Department of Automation,Tsinghua University,Beijing 100084); HYBRID GENETIC ALGORITHM METHOD FOR IDENTICAL PARALLEL MACHINE EARLINESS/TARDINESS SCHEDULING PROBLEM [J];;2000-02 3 ZHOU Hong\+1, CHEUNG Wai\|man\+2 (1.
