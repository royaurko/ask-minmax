Our approach is based on heuristic principles and has the advantage of both ACO and Cuckoo search. In this paper, we present a Hybrid algorithm, based on ant colony optimization (ACO) and Cuckoo Search which efficiently solves the Job scheduling problem, which reduces the total execution time. In ACO, pheromone is chemical substances that are deposited by the real ants while they walk. When it comes to solving optimization problems it acts as if it lures the artificial ants. To perform a local search, we use Cuckoo Search where there is essentially only a single parameter apart from the population size and it is also very easy to implement.
