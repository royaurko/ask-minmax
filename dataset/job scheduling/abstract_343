Therefore, efficient scheduling strategies are vitally important to any metacomputing project. A real metacomputer management system will not gain exclusive access to all its resources, because participating centers will not be willing to give up autonomy. As a consequence, the scheduling algorithm has to deal with a set of local sub-schedulers performing individual machine management. Based on the proposal made by Feitelson and Rudolph in 1998 we developed a scheduling model that takes these circumstances into account. It has been implemented as a generic simulation environment, which we make available to the public. Using this tool, we examined the behavior of several well known scheduling algorithms in a metacomputing scenario. The results demonstrate that interaction with the sub-schedulers, communication of parallel applications, and the huge size of the metacomputer are among the most important aspects for scheduling a metacomputer. Based upon these observations we developed a new technique that makes it possible to use scheduling algorithms developed for less realistic machine models for real world metacomputing projects. Simulation runs demonstrate that this technique leads to far better results than the algorithms currently used in metacomputer management systems.
