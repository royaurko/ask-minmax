A Novel Economic-Based Scheduling Heuristic for Computational Grids Omer Ozan Sonmez Department of Computer Engineering, Koc University, Istanbul Attila Gursoy Department of Computer Engineering, Koc University, Istanbul, agursoy{at}ku.edu.tr In the economic-based computational grids we need effective schedulers not only to minimize the makespan but also to minimize the costs that are spent for the execution of the jobs. In this work, a novel economy driven job scheduling heuristic is proposed and a simulation application is developed by using GridSim toolkit to investigate the performance of the heuristic. The simulation-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic both in terms of parameter sweep and sequential workflow type of applications.
