Volume 1911 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 137-153 The Performance Impact of Advance Reservation Meta-scheduling Quinn Snell Affiliated with Brigham Young University , Mark Clement Affiliated with Brigham Young University , David Jackson Affiliated with Brigham Young University , Chad Gregory Affiliated with Brigham Young University As supercomputing resources become more available, users will require resources managed by several local schedulers. To gain access to a collection of resources, current systems require metajobs to run during locked down periods when the resources are only available for metajob use. It is more convenient and e.cient if the user is able to make a reservation at the soonest time when all resources are available. System administrators are reluctant to allow reservations external to locked down periods because of the impact reservations may have on utilization and the Quality of Service that the center is able to provide to its normal users. This research quanti.es the impact of advance reservations on and outlines the algorithms that must be used to schedule metajobs. The Maui scheduler is used to examine metascheduling using trace .les from existing supercomputing centers. These results indicate that advance reservations can improve the response time for metajobs, while not signi.cantly impacting overall system performance.
