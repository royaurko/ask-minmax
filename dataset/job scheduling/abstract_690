Our system, Cluster Computing on the Fly , seeks to harvest cycles from ordinary users in an open access, non-institutional environment. CCOF encompasses all activities involved in the management of idle cycles: overlay construction for hosts donating cycles, resource discovery within the overlay, application-based scheduling, local scheduling on the host node, and meta-level scheduling among a community of application-level schedulers. In this paper, we identify four important classes of cycle-sharing applications, each requiring its own scheduling strategy: workpile, workpile with deadlines, tree-based search, and point-of-presence. We describe a Wave Scheduler for workpile tasks that exploits idle night-time cycles using a geographic-based overlay. The scheduler incorporates a quizzing mechanism to check the correctness of results and determine trust ratings for the hosts. We also propose a Point-of-Presence Scheduler to discover and schedule hosts that meet application-specific requirements for location, topological distribution, and available resources.
