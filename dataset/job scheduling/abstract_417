Real life scheduling problems require the decision maker to consider a number of criteria before arriving at any decision. A solution which is optimal with respect to a given criterion might be a poor candidate for some other. The trade-offs involved in considering several different criteria provide useful insights to the decision maker. Thus considering problems with more than one criterion is more releBANt in the context of real life scheduling problems. Surprisingly, research in this important field has been scarce when compared to research in single criterion scheduling. In this paper, we provide a detailed literature survey of multiple and bicriteria problems in scheduling. We also provide a broad classification scheme for scheduling problems.
