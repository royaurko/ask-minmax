Title: On-line algorithms for hybrid flow shop scheduling Authors: Havill, Jessen T. ; Mao, Weizhen Citation: J.T. Havill, W.

The objective is to minimize the makespan. In this paper, we propose two on-line algorithms based on the greedy strategy. We also present analysis on the performance of the algorithms.
