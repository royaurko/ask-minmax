The analysis of workload traces from real production parallel machines can aid a wide variety of parallel processing research, providing a realistic basis for experimentation in the management of resources over an entire workload. We analyze a five-month workload trace of an Intel Paragon machine supporting a production parallel workload at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), comparing and contrasting it with a similar workload study of an Intel iPSC/860 machine at NASA Ames NAS. Our analysis of workload characteristics takes into account the job scheduling policies of the sites and focuses on characteristics such as job size distribution (job parallelism), resource usage, runtimes, submission patterns, and wait times. Despite fundamental differences in the two machines and their respective usage environments, we observe a number of interesting similarities with respect to job size distribution, system utilization, runtime distribution, and interarrival time distribution. We hope to gain insight into the potential use of workload traces for evaluating resource management policies at supercomputing sites and for providing both real-world job streams and accurate stochastic workload models for use in simulation analysis of resource management policies
