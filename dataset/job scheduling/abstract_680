Simulation and Analysis on Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling Toward Networked Manufacturing ZHAO Hai-feng, TANG Liang, ZHANG Yan-cheng, WANG Wan-shan (School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110004, China)   Aiming at the system characteristic of the network-manufacturing environment, the framework of job scheduling was constructed for remote synergic production. Based on scheduling framework, the dynamic simulation calculation was carried, and the fuzzy theory was applied to judge the distributable probability of products time, to confirm job scheduling evaluated parameter of the enterprise interior. The Hopfield neural network was applied to comprehensive decision-making, to extract the feasible solution between enterprise external cooperation production and internal scheduling. The scheduling framework was applied in practical job scheduling, to optimize the result that obtained by simulation calculation continued, and then a good and feasible scheduling result was obtained. 【Key Words】： networked-manufacturing dynamic job shop scheduling erlang distribution fuzzy judgment Hopfield neural networks 【Fund】： 教育部高等学校博士学科点专项科研基金(20060145017) 【CateGory Index】： TP391.9 CAJViewer7.0 supports all the CNKI file formats; AdobeReader only supports the PDF format. 【References】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 2 Hits 1 GE Chang-yue(Taizhou Radio and Television University,Taizhou 318000,China); Research on the Collaboration of Enterprise Cluster Networked Manufacture [J];Group Technology & Production Modernization;2009-01 2 DING Lei,WANG Ai-min,NING Ru-xin(School of Mechanical Vehicular Engineering,Beijing Institute of Technology,Beijing 100081,China); Job-Shop scheduling technology with uncertain processing time [J];Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems;2010-01 【Citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 4 Hits 1 QU Ji-shuang1,LI Qun-tang2,QU Song-bai2 (1 Institute of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410073, China; 2The Third Institute of The Second Artillery, Beijing 100085, China); Simulation Analysis for Task Scheduling and Resources Access of Task/Resource Graph(Ⅰ) [J];Acta Simulata Systematica Sinica;2003-03 2 XU Gang,WU ZhiMing(1416 Postbox Haoran building,Institute of Automation,Shanghai Jiaotong university,Shanghai 200030,China); Integrated Design Method:Modeling Simulating and Verifying for FMS [J];Acta Simulata Systematica Sinica;2004-05 3 CHEN Hua-ping,GU Feng,LU Bing-yuan,GU Chun-sheng(Department of Information Management and Decision Science,University of Science and Technology of China,Hefei 230026,China); Application of Self-adaptive Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm in Flexible Job Shop Scheduling [J];Journal of System Simulation;2006-08 4 ZHANG Chuan-fu, ZHA Ya-bing, LIU Yun-sheng, ZHANG Tong, HUANG Ke-di (Department of Automatic Control, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410073, China); Method and Simulation of Deadlock Free Resource Co-allocation in Simulation-grid [J];Journal of System Simulation;2006-09 【Co-citations】 Chinese Journal Full-text Database 10 Hits 1 WEN Ling-bo~(1,2), WANG Yu-hai~(2), LI Xing-kun~(2), XUE Chun-yu~(2) (1.National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410003,China;2.Tsinghua University State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, Beijing 100084,China); AMT Control Strategy Simulation System based on MATLAB/STATEFLOW [J];Acta Armamentarll The Volume of Tank, Armored Vehicle and Engine;2005-01 2 Deng Xiaojin;Wu Huizhong(Nanjing University of science and Technology); CONTINUOUS AND DISCRETE-EVENT MIXED SIMULATION METHOD FOR THE SIMULATION OF SMALL CALIBER ANTIAIRCRAFT GUNS ANTAGONIZING AIRCRAFTS [J];Acta Armamentarii;1995-04 3 LIU Cheng-li,L Zhen-zhou(School of Aeronautics,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Xi'an 710072,Shaanxi,China); The Simulation of Damage Effectiveness of a Volume Target [J];Acta Armamentarii;2006-02 4 Cheng Changdong Wen Chuanyuan (Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Dept. of Automatic Control); Clock Synchronization Method and Performance Evaluation on a Class of Hybrid Systems [J];JOURNAL OF BEIJING UNIVERSITY OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS;1999-05 5 WANG Jiao dong,\ SHI Xin sheng (Institute of Automobile Mauagement, Anhui Bengbu 233011, China); Applications of computer simulation software in military communications railway transportation [J];Journal of Chongqing Jiaotong Institute;2002-02 6 HUANG De sheng (Dept. of Computer and Mathe Matics, Techers College, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030012, China); The Development of the Emulation and Intelligent Technology [J];JOURNAL OF TEST AND MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY;2002-01 7 DONG Hai, WANG Wan-shan, GONG Ya-dong, LI Yan-ping (1.
