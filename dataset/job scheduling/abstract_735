receiving requests for job execution for a batch of jobs, the requests including a set of job requirements, wherein the set of job requirements includes a set of data objects needed for executing the jobs, a set of computing resources needed for executing the jobs, and quality of service expectations; identifying a set of execution sites within the grid for executing the jobs based on the job requirements; determining data transfers needed for providing the set of data objects for executing the batch of jobs; identifying data for replication for providing data objects to reduce the data transfers needed to provide the set of data objects for executing the batch of jobs, wherein the step of identifying data for replication is performed based on current replica information in the grid topology, estimated cost savings obtained by creating a replica at an additional site, availability of storage for holding a replica at a site, and other constraints stipulated by global objectives; identifying a set of end-points in the distributed grid topology for use in data replication and data transfers, wherein the step of identifying the set of end-points in the grid topology for use in the data transfer and data replications comprises determining a set of remote sites from which to transfer data objects and determining a set of remote links along which to transfer the data objects; and generating a schedule for data transfer, data replication and job execution in the grid, wherein the step of generating a schedule for data transfers, data replication, and job execution comprises estimating time to complete each data transfer, data replication, and job execution, determining how to perform data transfers, data replication, and job execution in parallel in such a manner that system constraints are not violated, and determining an ordering of job executions, data transfers, and data replications such that the global objectives are satisfied in accordance with the global objectives.
