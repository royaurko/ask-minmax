First, based on the present grid architecture, we try to figure out what would be the newly required services in such a mobile/grid integrated architecture. There are a number of challenging issues when taking mobile environment into account, such as intermittent connectivity, device heterogeneity, and weak security. Among these issues to solve, we particularly focus on a disconnected operation problem in this paper since mobile resources are prone to frequent disconnections due to their confined communication range and device mobility. We develop a new job scheduling algorithm for mobile grid system and evaluate it by various methods such as mathematical analysis, simulation, and prototype implementation.
