Grid computing is a novel technology for building high speed computing environment in which heterogeneous, distributed and dynamically available resources are integrated. However, in Grid environment, it is a big challenge to design an efficient scheduler and its implementation. This paper focuses on small jobs scheduling in Grid Computing. Constraint-Based Job and Resource scheduling (CBJRS) algorithm is proposed which will reduce the processing time, processing cost and enhance the resource utilization in comparison to other algorithms.
