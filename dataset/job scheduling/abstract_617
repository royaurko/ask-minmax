We describe an architecture for the runtime environment for parallel applications as prelude to describing how parallel applications might interface to their environment in a portable way. We propose extensions to the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) Standard that provide for dynamic process management, including spawning of new processes by a running application and connection to existing processes to support client/server applications. Such extensions are needed if more of the runtime environment for parallel programs is to be accessible to MPI programs or to be themselves written using MPI. The extensions proposed here are motivated by real applications and fit cleanly with existing concepts of MPI. No changes to the existing MPI Standard are proposed, thus all present MPI programs will run unchanged
