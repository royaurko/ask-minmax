Buffered coscheduling is a scheduling methodology for time-sharing communicating processes in parallel and distributed systems. The methodology has two primary features: communication buffering and strobing. With communication buffering, communication generated by each processor is buffered and performed at the end of regular intervals to amortize communication and scheduling overhead. This infrastructure is then leveraged by a strobing mechanism to perform a total exchange of information at the end of each interval, thus providing global information to more efficiently schedule communicating processes. This paper describes how buffered coscheduling can optimize resource utilization by analyzing workloads with varying computational granularities, load imbalances, and communication patterns. The experimental results, performed using a detailed simulation model, show that buffered coscheduling is very effective on fast SANs such as Myrinet as well as slower switch-based LANs
