  We consider a problem of scheduling orders on identical parallel machines. An order can be released after a given ready time and must be completed before its due date. An order is split into multiple jobs (batches) and a job is processed on one of the parallel machines. The objective of the scheduling problem is to minimize the holding costs of orders including work-in-process as well as finished job inventories. We suggest two local search heuristics, simulated annealing and taboo search algorithms, for the problem. Performance of the suggested algorithms is tested through computational experiments on randomly generated test problems.
