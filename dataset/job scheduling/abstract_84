With the increasing acceptance of grid middleware like Globus, new requirements for the underlying local resource management systems arise. Features like advanced reservation or quality of service are needed to implement high level functions like co-allocation. However it is difficult to realize these features with a resource management system based on the queuing concept since it considers only the present resource usage. In this paper we present an approach which closes this gap. By assigning start times to each resource request, a complete schedule is planned. Advanced reservations are now easily possible. Based on this planning approach functions like diffuse requests, automatic duration extension, or service level agreements are described. We think they are useful to increase the usability, acceptance and performance of HPC machines. In the second part of this paper we present a planning based resource management system which already covers some of the mentioned features.
