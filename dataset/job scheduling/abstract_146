There is no best scheduling algorithm for all grid computing systems. An alternative is to select an appropriate scheduling algorithm to use in a given grid environment because of the characteristics of the tasks, machines and network connectivity. In this paper a survey is presented on the problem and the different aspects of job scheduling in grids such as (a) fault-tolerance; (b) security; and (c) simulation of grid job scheduling strategies are discussed. This paper also presents a discussion on the future research topics and the challenges of job scheduling in grids.
