Job scheduling on large-scale systems is an increasingly complicated affair, with numerous factors influencing scheduling policy. Addressing these concerns results in sophisticated scheduling policies that can be difficult to reason about. In this paper, we present a general utility-based scheduling framework to balance various scheduling requirements and priorities. It enables system owners to customize scheduling policies under different circumstances without changing the scheduling code. We also develop a fault-aware job allocation strategy for Blue Gene/P systems to address the increasing concern of system failures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these facilities by means of event-driven simulations with real job traces collected from the production Blue Gene/P system at Argonne National Laboratory.
