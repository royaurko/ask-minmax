Volume 1291 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science pp 238-261 Date: 12 July 2005 Improved utilization and responsiveness with gang scheduling Dror G. Feitelson Affiliated with Institute of Computer Science, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Morris A. Jettee Affiliated with Livermore Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Most commercial multicomputers use space-slicing schemes in which each scheduling decision has an unknown impact on the future: should a job be scheduled, risking that it will block other larger jobs later, or should the processors be left idle for now in anticipation of future arrivals? This dilemma is solved by using gang scheduling, because then the impact of each decision is limited to its time slice, and future arrivals can be accommodated in other time slices. This added flexibility is shown to improve overall system utilization and responsiveness. Empirical evidence from using gang scheduling on a Cray T3D installed at Lawrence Livermore National Lab corroborates these results, and shows conclusively that gang scheduling can be very effective with current technology.
