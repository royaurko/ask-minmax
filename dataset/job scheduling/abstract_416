We are currently developing and testing a gangscheduling job control system for these machines that exploits space-and time-sharing in the presence of dedicated communication devices. Our initial experience with this system indicates that, though applications pay a small overhead, overall system performance as measured by average job queue and response times improves significantly. This gang-scheduling system is planned for deployment into production mode during 1999 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
