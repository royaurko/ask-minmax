PVM enables users to write parallel applications using message passing primitives and statically places the parallel tasks on a collection of nodes. System schedulers schedule atomic jobs over a predefined number of nodes. DynamicPVM addresses the problem of scheduling parallel tasks over a set of nodes. It therefore has to integrate a process checkpointing, migration and restart restart mechanism with the PVM runtime support system. DynamicPVM facilitates an efficient use of existing computational resources for computational jobs consisting of parallel subtasks. Typical target HPC platforms for DynamicPVM are multi user, multi tasking, loosely coupled processors.
