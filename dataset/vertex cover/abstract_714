The diagonalisation of the transfer matrices of solvable vertex models with
alternating spins is given. The crystal structure of (semi-)infinite tensor
products of finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{sl}_2)$ crystals with alternating
dimensions is determined. Upon this basis the vertex models are formulated and
then solved by means of $U_q(\hat{sl}_2)$ intertwiners.
