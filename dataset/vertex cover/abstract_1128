We present a calculation of the three-gluon vertex from its Dyson-Schwinger
equation in Landau-gauge Yang-Mills theory. All tensor structures are
considered and back-coupled self-consistently. Within the chosen truncation,
two-loop diagrams as well as diagrams containing Green's functions beyond the
primitively divergent ones are neglected. Only the three-gluon vertex is chosen
to be dynamical; the other propagators and vertex functions are provided as
separate solutions of their Dyson-Schwinger equations or by Ansatz. For both
scaling- and decoupling-type solutions we observe, in agreement with other
studies, a sign change in the tree-level tensor dressing at a non-perturbative
scale.
