In the context of computer assist surgical techniques, a new elastic
registration method of 3D meshes is presented. In our applications, one mesh is
a high density mesh (30000 vertexes), the second is a low density one (1000
vertexes). Registration is based upon the minimisation of a symmetric distance
between both meshes, defined on the vertexes, in a multi resolution approach.
Results on synthetic images are first presented. Then, thanks to this
registration method, a statistical model of the skull is build from Computer
Tomography exams collected for twelve patients.
