We investigate ideals of vertex covers for the edge ideals associated to
considerable classes of connected graphs with loops and exhibit algebraic
information about them, such as the existence of linear quotients, the
computation of invariant values, and the Cohen-Macaulay property. These
algebraic procedures are good instruments for evaluating situations of minimal
node coverings in networks.
