We calculate higher spin BPST vertex operators for open bosonic string and
express these operstors in terms of Kummer function of the second kind. We
derive infinite number of recurrence relations among BPST vertex operators of
different string states. These recurrence relations among BPST vertex operators
lead to the recurrence relations among Regge string scattering amplitudes
discovered recently.
