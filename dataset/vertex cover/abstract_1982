We present results for the gluon and ghost propagators and the ghost-gluon
vertex obtained from Dyson-Schwinger equations. In the zero temperature case we
elaborate on the role of the three-gluon vertex and discuss a model that can
capture its qualitative features like its anomalous dimensions and a zero
crossing of the dressing function. Our results compare well with lattice data.
At non-zero temperature we calculated the ghost propagator which agrees rather
well with lattice results already within our simple truncation. These results
are used to obtain the temperature dependence of the ghost-gluon vertex. We
also explain why the ghost propagator does not react to the phase transition
despite its direct coupling to the chromoelectric gluon.
