Phase diagram of a symmetric vertex model which allows 7 vertex
configurations is obtained by use of the corner transfer matrix renormalization
group (CTMRG), which is a variant of the density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG). The critical indices of this model are identified as $\beta = 1/8$ and
$\alpha = 0$.
