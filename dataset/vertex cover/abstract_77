Assuming the AND-distillation conjecture, the Pathwidth problem of
determining whether a given graph G has pathwidth at most k admits no
polynomial kernelization with respect to k. The present work studies the
existence of polynomial kernels for Pathwidth with respect to other,
structural, parameters. Our main result is that, unless NP is in coNP/poly,
Pathwidth admits no polynomial kernelization even when parameterized by the
vertex deletion distance to a clique, by giving a cross-composition from
Cutwidth. The cross-composition works also for Treewidth, improving over
previous lower bounds by the present contributors. For Pathwidth, our result rules
out polynomial kernels with respect to the distance to various classes of
polynomial-time solvable inputs, like interval or cluster graphs. This leads to
the question whether there are nontrivial structural parameters for which
Pathwidth does admit a polynomial kernelization. To answer this, we give a
collection of graph reduction rules that are safe for Pathwidth. We analyze the
success of these results and obtain polynomial kernelizations with respect to
the following parameters: the size of a vertex cover of the graph, the vertex
deletion distance to a graph where each connected component is a star, and the
vertex deletion distance to a graph where each connected component has at most
c vertices.
