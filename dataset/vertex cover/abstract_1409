Infinite-dimensional Lie algebras are introduced, which are only partially
graded, and are specified by indices lying on cyclotomic rings. They may be
thought of as generalizations of the Onsager algebra, but unlike it, or its
sl(n) generalizations, they are not subalgebras of the loop algebras associated
with sl(n). In a particular interesting case associated with sl(3), their
indices lie on the Eisenstein integer triangular lattice, and these algebras
are expected to underlie vertex operator combinations in CFT, brane physics,
and graphite monolayers.
