We consider general linear superalgebra (type A) and tensor with Laurent
polynomial ring in several variables. We then consider the universal central
extension of this Lie superalgebra which we call toroidal superalgebra. We give
a faithful representation of toroidal superalgebra using vertex operators and
bosons.
