This paper discusses a distance guarding concept on triangulation graphs,
which can be associated with distance domination and distance vertex cover. We
show how these subjects are interconnected and provide tight bounds for any
n-vertex maximal outerplanar graph: the 2d-guarding number, g_{2d}(n) = n/5;
the 2d-distance domination number, gamma_{2d}(n) = n/5; and the 2d-distance
vertex cover number, beta_{2d}(n) = n/4.
