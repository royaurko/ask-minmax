We consider exceptional vertex operator algebras for which particular Casimir
vectors constructed from the primary vectors of lowest conformal weight are
Virasoro descendants of the vacuum. We discuss constraints on these theories
that follow from an analysis of appropriate genus zero and genus one two point
correlation functions. We find explicit differential equations for the
partition function in the cases where the lowest weight primary vectors form a
Lie algebra or a Griess algebra. Examples include the Wess-Zumino-Witten model
for Deligne's exceptional Lie algebras and the Moonshine Module. We partially
verify the irreducible decomposition of the tensor product of Deligne's
exceptional Lie algebras and consider the possibility of similar decompositions
for tensor products of the Griess algebra. We briefly discuss some conjectured
extremal vertex operator algebras arising in Witten's recent work on three
dimensional black holes.
