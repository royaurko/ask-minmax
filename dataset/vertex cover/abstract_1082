Belavin's $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$-symmetric model is considered on the
basis of bosonization of vertex operators in the $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$ model and
vertex-face transformation. The corner transfer matrix (CTM) Hamiltonian of
$(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$-symmetric model and tail operators are expressed in
terms of bosonized vertex operators in the $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$ model. Correlation
functions of $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$-symmetric model can be obtained by
using these objects, in principle. In particular, we calculate spontaneous
polarization, which reproduces the result by myselves in 1993.
