We consider how to normalize the scattering amplitudes of 4D heterotic
superstrings in a Minkowski background. We fix the normalization of the vacuum
amplitude (the string partition function) at each genus, and of every vertex
operator describing a physical external string state in a way consistent with
unitarity of the $S$-matrix. We also provide an explicit expression for the map
relating the vertex operator of an incoming physical state to the vertex
operator describing the same physical state, but outgoing. This map is related
to hermitean conjugation and to the hermiticity properties of the scattering
amplitudes.
