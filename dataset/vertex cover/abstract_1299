We report on the status of a study of the quark propagator and quark-gluon
vertex in momentum space. Quark propagators have been generated at beta=6.0
using the O(a)-improved Sheikholeslami-Wohlert action and fixed to the Landau
gauge. The first results for the quark pole mass and field renormalisation
constant are reported, and plans for future work are presented.
