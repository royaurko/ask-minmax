Motivated by questions in mass-action kinetics, we introduce the notion of
vertexical family of differential inclusions. Defined on open hypercubes, these
families are characterized by particular good behavior under projection maps.
The motivating examples are certain families of reaction networks -- including
reversible, weakly reversible, endotactic, and strongly endotactic reaction
networks -- that give rise to vertexical families of mass-action differential
inclusions. We prove that vertexical families are amenable to structural
induction. Consequently, a trajectory of a vertexical family approaches the
boundary if and only if either the trajectory approaches a vertex of the
hypercube, or a trajectory in a lower-dimensional member of the family
approaches the boundary. With this technology, we make progress on the global
attractor conjecture, a central open problem concerning mass-action kinetics
systems. Additionally, we phrase mass-action kinetics as a functor on reaction
networks with variable rates.
