We study vertex operators in 4D conformal field theory derived from quantized
gravity, whose dynamics is governed by the Wess-Zumino action by Riegert and
the Weyl action. Conformal symmetry is equal to diffeomorphism symmetry in the
ultraviolet limit, which mixes positive-metric and negative-metric modes of the
gravitational field and thus these modes cannot be treated separately in
physical operators. In this paper, we construct gravitational vertex operators
such as the Ricci scalar, defined as space-time volume integrals of them are
invariant under conformal transformations. Short distance singularities of
these operator products are computed and it is shown that their coefficients
have physically correct sign. Furthermore, we show that conformal algebra holds
even in the system perturbed by the cosmological constant vertex operator as in
the case of the Liouville theory shown by Curtright and Thorn.
