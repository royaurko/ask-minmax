We investigate whether an n-vertex instance (G,k) of Treewidth, asking
whether the graph G has treewidth at most k, can efficiently be made sparse
without changing its answer. By giving a special form of OR-cross-composition,
we prove that this is unlikely: if there is an e > 0 and a polynomial-time
algorithm that reduces n-vertex Treewidth instances to equivalent instances, of
an arbitrary problem, with O(n^{2-e}) bits, then NP is in coNP/poly and the
polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level.
  Our sparsification lower bound has implications for structural
parameterizations of Treewidth: parameterizations by measures that do not
exceed the vertex count, cannot have kernels with O(k^{2-e}) bits for any e >
0, unless NP is in coNP/poly. Motivated by the question of determining the
optimal kernel size for Treewidth parameterized by vertex cover, we improve the
O(k^3)-vertex kernel from Bodlaender et al. (STACS 2011) to a kernel with
O(k^2) vertices. Our improved kernel is based on a novel form of
treewidth-invariant set. We use the q-expansion lemma of Fomin et al. (STACS
2011) to find such sets efficiently in graphs whose vertex count is
superquadratic in their vertex cover number.
