We prove that an equivalent condition for a uniform space to be coverable is
that the images of the natural projections in the fundamental inverse system
are uniformly open in a certain sense. As corollaries we (1) obtain a concrete
way to find covering entourage, (2) correct an error in [3] and (3) show that
coverable is equivalent to chain connected and uniformly joinable in the sense
of arXiv:0706.3937.
