The three Apollonius circles of a triangle, each passing through a triangle
vertex, the corresponding vertex of the cevian triangle of the incenter and the
corresponding vertex of the circumcevian triangle of the symmedian point, are
coaxal. Similarly defined three circles remain coaxal, when the circumcevian
triangle is defined with respect to any point on the triangle circumconic
through the incenter and symmedian point. Inversion in the incircle of the
reference triangle carries these three coaxal circles into coaxal circles, each
passing through a vertex of the inverted triangle and centered on the opposite
sideline, at the intersection of the orthotransversal with respect to a point
on the Euler line of the inverted triangle. A similar circumconic exists in a
more general configuration, when the cevian triangle is defined with respect to
an arbitrary point, passing through this arbitrary point and isogonal conjugate
of its complement.
