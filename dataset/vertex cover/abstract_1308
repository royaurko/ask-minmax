The leading heavy-top two-loop corrections to the \Zbb~vertex are determined
from a direct evaluation of the corresponding Feynman diagrams in the large
\Mt~limit. %The calculation is done in the naive %dimensional regularization
scheme with anticommuting $\ga_5$. The leading one-loop top-mass effect is
enhanced by $[1+\GF\Mt^2(9-\pi^2/3)/(8\pi^2\sqrt{2})]$. Our calculation
confirms a recent result of Barbieri et al.
