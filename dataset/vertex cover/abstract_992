In \cite{kim11} we have generalized a tangency condition in the
Treibich-Verdier theory \cite{trei89,tv90,trei97} about elliptic solitons to a
Hitchin system. As an application of this generalization, we will define,
so-called, Hitchin hyperelliptic tangential covers and show the finiteness of
them among all Hitchin tangential covers.
