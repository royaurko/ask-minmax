The chiral de Rham complex is a sheaf of vertex algebras {\Omega}^ch_M on any
nonsingular algebraic variety or complex manifold M, which contains the
ordinary de Rham complex as the weight zero subspace. We show that when M is a
Kummer surface, the algebra of global sections is isomorphic to the N = 4
superconformal vertex algebra with central charge 6. Previously, CP^n was the
only manifold where a complete description of the global section algebra was
known.
