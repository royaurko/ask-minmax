This note uses some recent calculations of Conder and Bujalance (on
classifying finite index group extensions of Fuchsian groups with abelian
quotient and torsion free kernel) in order to determine the full automorphism
groups of some cylic coverings of the line (including curves of Fermat and
Lefschetz type). The answer is complete for cyclic covers that branch over
three points.
