We discuss the chirally symmetric solution of the massless, quenched,
Dyson-Schwinger equation for the fermion propagator in three and four
dimensions. The solutions are manifestly gauge covariant. We consider a gauge
covariance constraint on the fermion--gauge-boson vertex, which motivates a
vertex Ansatz that both satisfies the Ward identity when the fermion self-mass
is zero and ensures gauge covariance of the fermion propagator.
