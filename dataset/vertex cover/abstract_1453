We provide a simple construction of a Gerstenhaber-infinity algebra structure
on a class of vertex algebras V, which lifts the strict Gerstenhaber algebra
structure on BRST cohomology of V introduced by Lian and Zuckerman.
  We outline two applications: the construction of a sheaf of
Gerstenhaber-infinity algebras on a Calabi-Yau manifold extending the
multiplication and bracket of functions and vector fields, and of a
Lie-infinity structure related to the bracket of Courant.
