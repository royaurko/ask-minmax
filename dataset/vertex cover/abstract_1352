Calculations of heavy quark and charmonium hadroproduction are presented in
the k_t-factorization approach. The resulting differential cross sections are
compared to experimental values and NLO collinear predictions. The application
of the full effective Fadin-Lipatov quark-antiquark- production-vertex has an
important influence on the results and in particular leads to a strong
suppression of certain color octet contributions which are related to the
outstanding problem of the production of polarized J/Psi.
