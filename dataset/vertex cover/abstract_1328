In this report we present a review of recent developments in the TC/ETC
theories, concentrating on the theoretical estimations and the phenomenological
analysis about the Non-Oblique corrections on the $Zb\overline{b}$ vertex from
ETC dynamics and Pseudo-Goldstone Bosons. The relevant studies about the vertex
corrections on other processes from the PGBs were also considered.
