In the presence of the supersymmetric CP phases, e^+ e^- \to Z^{*} \to h A
scattering is analyzed, with special emphasis on Z^{*} h A vertex, taking into
account radiatve corrections due to dominant top quark and top squark loops in
the Higgs sector as well as the vertex formfactors. It is found that the
lightest Higgs remains essentially CP-even whereas the heavier ones mix with
each other strongly. Moreover, the supersymmetric CP phases are found to create
tree-level couplings between a pseudoscalar and identical sfermion mass
eigenstates which, together with the radiative corrections in the Higgs sector,
are found to enhance the vertex formfactors significantly.
