Let $L_{D_{\ell}}(-\ell +{3/2},0)$ (resp. $L_{B_{\ell}}(-\ell +{3/2},0)$) be
the simple vertex operator algebra associated to affine Lie algebra of type
$D_{\ell}^{(1)}$ (resp. $B_{\ell}^{(1)}$) with the lowest admissible
half-integer level $-\ell + {3/2}$. We show that $L_{D_{\ell}}(-\ell +{3/2},0)$
is a vertex subalgebra of $L_{B_{\ell}}(-\ell +{3/2},0)$ with the same
conformal vector. For $\ell =4$, $L_{D_{4}}(-{5/2},0)$ is a vertex subalgebra
of three copies of $L_{B_{4}}(-{5/2},0)$ contained in $L_{F_{4}}(-{5/2},0)$,
and all five of these vertex operator algebras have the same conformal vector.
