The sigma clique cover number (resp. sigma clique partition number) of graph
G, denoted by scc(G) (resp. scp(G)), is de?ned as the smallest integer k for
which there exists a collection of cliques of G, covering (resp. partitioning)
all edges of G such that the sum of sizes of the cliques is at most k. In this
paper, among some results we provide some tight bounds for scc and scp.
