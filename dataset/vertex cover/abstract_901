The 3-transposition groups that act on a vertex operator algebra in the way
described by Miyamoto are classified under the assumption that the group is
centerfree and the VOA carries a positive-definite invariant Hermitian form.
This generalizes and refines the result of Kitazume and Miyamoto. Application
to a similar but different situation is also considered in part by a slight
generalization of the argument.
