We present Roadmap Sparsification by Edge Contraction (RSEC), a simple and
effective algorithm for reducing the size of a motion-planning roadmap. The
algorithm exhibits minimal effect on the quality of paths that can be extracted
from the new roadmap. The primitive operation used by RSEC is edge contraction
- the contraction of a roadmap edge to a single vertex and the connection of
the new vertex to the neighboring vertices of the contracted edge. For certain
scenarios, we compress more than 98% of the edges and vertices at the cost of
degradation of average shortest path length by at most 2%.
