For a vertex operator algebra, notions of semi-conformal subalgebras and
semi-conformal vectors were first introduced by Jiang and Lin in \cite{JL2} to
research vertex algebra commutant theory. Using these new objects, we attempt
to investigate the structure theory of a vertex operator algebra. First, we
formulate the set of semi-conformal vectors of a vertex operator algebra, then
we show that it is an affine variety with a partial order and an involution
map. Taking a Heisenberg vertex operator algebra as an example, we research
properties of the algebraic variety of its semi-conformal vectors. Moreover,
based on given results in the case of the Heisenberg vertex operator algebra,
we give a new description of a Heisenberg vertex operator algebra.
