We summarise recent results for the quark loop part of the light-by-light
scattering contribution to the muons anomalous magnetic moment. In particular
we focus on the impact of a momentum dependent quark and quark-photon vertex.
We compare the Dyson-Schwinger description with that of the extended
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model (ENJL) and find important quantitative differences.
In particular the transverse parts of the quark-photon-vertex, which serve as a
dynamical extension of simple vector meson dominance models, do not yield the
large suppression as found in the ENJL model.
