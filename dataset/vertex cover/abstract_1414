In this letter we establish a connection of Picard-type elliptic solutions of
Painleve VI equation with the special solutions of the non-stationary Lame
equation. The latter appeared in the study of the ground state properties of
Baxter's solvable eight-vertex lattice model at a particular point,
$\eta=\pi/3$, of the disordered regime.
