In a recent paper [3], Bakalov and Milanov proved that the total descendant
potential of a simple singularity satisfies the W-constraints, which come from
the W-algebra of the lattice vertex algebra associated to the root lattice of
this singularity and a twisted module of this vertex algebra. In the present
paper, we prove that the solution of these W-constraints is unique up to a
constant factor, as conjectured by Bakalov and Milanov in their paper.
