We obtain a new representation for the partition function of the six vertex
model with domain wall boundaries using a functional equation recently derived
by the contributor. This new representation is given in terms of a sum over the
permutation group where the partial homogeneous limit can be taken trivially.
We also show by construction that this partition function satisfies a linear
partial differential equation.
