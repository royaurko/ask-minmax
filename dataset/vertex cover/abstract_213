We give a natural extension of the notion of the contragredient module for a
vertex operator algebra. By using this extension we prove that for regular
vertex operator algebras, Zhu's $C_{2}$-finiteness condition holds, fusion
rules are finite and the vertex operator algebras themselves are finitely
generated.
