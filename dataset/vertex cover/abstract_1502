The graded reflection equation is investigated for the
$U_{q}[osp(r|2m)^{(1)}]$ vertex model. We have found four classes of diagonal
solutions with at the most one free parameter and twelve classes of
non-diagonal ones with the number of free parameters depending on the number of
bosonic ($r$) and fermionic ($2m$) degrees of freedom.
