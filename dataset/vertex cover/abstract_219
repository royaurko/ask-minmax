It is shown that a certain representation of the Heisenberg type
Krichever-Novikov algebra gives rise to a state field correspondence that is
quite similar to the vertex algebra structure of the usual Heisenberg algebra.
Finally a definition of Krichever-Novikov type vertex algebras is proposed and
its relation to vertex algebras is discussed.
