The silicon pixel vertex detector is one of the key elements of the BTeV
spectrometer. Detector prototypes were tested in a beam at Fermilab. We report
here on the measured spatial resolution as a function of the incident angles
for different sensor-readout electronics combinations. We compare the results
with predictions from our Monte Carlo simulation.
