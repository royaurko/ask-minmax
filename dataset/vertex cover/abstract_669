We compute the quark-gluon vertex in quenched lattice QCD, in the Landau
gauge using an off-shell mean-field O(a)-improved fermion action. The complete
vertex is computed in two specific kinematical limits, while the Dirac-vector
part is computed for arbitrary kinematics. We find a nontrivial and rich tensor
structure, including a substantial infrared enhancement of the interaction
strength regardless of kinematics.
