The quotient-cusp singularities are isolated complex surface singularities
that are double-covered by cusp singularities. We show that the universal
abelian cover of such a singularity, branched only at the singular point, is a
complete intersection cusp singularity of embedding dimension 4. This supports
a general conjecture that we make about the universal abelian cover of a
$\Q$-Gorenstein singularity.
