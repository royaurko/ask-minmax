Vertices are of central importance for constructing QCD bound states out of
the individual constituents of the theory, i.e. quarks and gluons. In
particular, the determination of three-point vertices is crucial in
non-perturbative investigations of QCD. We use numerical simulations of lattice
gauge theory to obtain results for the 3-point vertices in Landau-gauge SU(2)
Yang-Mills theory in three and four space-time dimensions for various kinematic
configurations. In all cases considered, the ghost-gluon vertex is found to be
essentially tree-level-like, while the three-gluon vertex is suppressed at
intermediate momenta. For the smallest physical momenta, reachable only in
three dimensions, we find that some of the three-gluon-vertex tensor structures
change sign.
