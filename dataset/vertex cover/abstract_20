For a clique cover $C$ in the undirected graph $G$, the clique cover graph of
$C$ is the graph obtained by contracting the vertices of each clique in $C$
into a single vertex. The clique cover width of G, denoted by $CCW(G)$, is the
minimum value of the bandwidth of all clique cover graphs of $G$. When $G$ is
the clique sum of $G_1$ and $G_2$, we prove that $CCW(G) \le 3/2(CCW(G_1) +
CCW(G_2))$.
