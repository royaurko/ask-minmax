Using quasiclassical limit of Baxter's 8 - vertex R - matrix, an elliptic
generalization of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation is constructed. Via
Off-Shell Bethe ansatz an integrable representation for this equation is
obtained. It is shown that there exists a gauge transformation connecting this
equation with Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation for SU(2)-WZNW model on
torus.
