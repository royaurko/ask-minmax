We propose a method of construction of a cubic interaction in massless Higher
Spin gauge theory both in flat and in AdS space-times of arbitrary dimensions.
We consider a triplet formulation of the Higher Spin gauge theory and
generalize the Higher Spin symmetry algebra of the free model to the
corresponding algebra for the case of cubic interaction. The generators of this
new algebra carry indexes which label the three Higher Spin fields involved
into the cubic interaction. The method is based on the use of oscillator
formalism and on the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) technique. We derive
general conditions on the form of cubic interaction vertex and discuss the
ambiguities of the vertex which result from field redefinitions. This method
can in principle be applied for constructing the Higher Spin interaction vertex
at any order. Our results are a first step towards the construction of a
Lagrangian for interacting Higher Spin gauge fields that can be holographically
studied.
