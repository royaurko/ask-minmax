Several algorithms for tracking and for primary and secondary vertex
reconstruction have been developed by the ATLAS collaboration following
different approaches. This has allowed a thorough cross-check of the
performances of the algorithms and of the reconstruction software. The results
of the most recent studies on this topic are discussed and compared.
