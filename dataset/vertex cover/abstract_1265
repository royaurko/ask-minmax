We define new natural variants of the notions of weighted covering and
separation numbers and discuss them in detail. We prove a strong duality
relation between weighted covering and separation numbers and prove a few
relations between the classical and weighted covering numbers, some of which
hold true without convexity assumptions and for general metric spaces. As a
consequence, together with some volume bounds that we discuss, we provide a
bound for the famous Levi-Hadwiger problem concerning covering a convex body by
homothetic slightly smaller copies of itself, in the case of centrally
symmetric convex bodies, which is qualitatively the same as the best currently
known bound. We also introduce the weighted notion of the Levi-Hadwiger
covering problem, and settle the centrally-symmetric case, thus also confirm
Nasz\'{o}di's equivalent fractional illumination conjecture in the case of
centrally symmetric convex bodies (including the characterization of the
equality case, which was unknown so far).
