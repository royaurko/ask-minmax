We show that holomorphic Parafermions exist in the eight vertex model. This
is done by extending the definition from the six vertex model to the eight
vertex model utilizing a parameter redefinition. These Parafermions exist on
the critical plane and integrable cases of the eight vertex model. We show that
for the case of staggered eight vertex model, these Parafermions correspond to
those of the Ashkin-Teller model. Furthermore, the loop representation of the
eight vertex model enabled us to show a connection with the O(n) model which is
in agreement with the six vertex limit found as a special case of the O(n)
model.
