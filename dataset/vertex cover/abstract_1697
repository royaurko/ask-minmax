In 1988 Fellows conjectured that if a finite, connected graph admits a finite
planar emulator, then it admits a finite planar cover. We construct a finite
planar emulator for K_{4,5} - 4K_2. Archdeacon showed that K_{4,5} - 4K_2 does
not admit a finite planar cover; thus K_{4,5} - 4K_2 provides a counterexample
to Fellows' Conjecture.
  It is known that Negami's Planar Cover Conjecture is true if and only if
K_{1,2,2,2} admits no finite planar cover. We construct a finite planar
emulator for K_{1,2,2,2}. The existence of a finite planar cover for
K_{1,2,2,2} is still open.
