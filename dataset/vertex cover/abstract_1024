In this paper a method previously employed by Salmhofer to establish an exact
equivalence of the one-flavour strong coupling lattice Schwinger model with
Wilson fermions to some 8-vertex model is applied to the case with two
flavours. As this method is fairly general and can be applied to strong
coupling QED and purely fermionic models with any (sufficiently small) number
of Wilson fermions in any dimension the purpose of the present study is mainly
a methodical one in order to gain some further experience with it. In the paper
the vertex model equivalent to the two-flavour strong coupling lattice
Schwinger model with Wilson fermions is found. It turns out to be some modified
3-state 20-vertex model on the square lattice, which can also be understood as
a regular 6-state vertex model. In analogy with the one- flavour case, this
model can be viewed as some loop model.
