We determine both real and virtual next-to-leading order corrections to the
gluon induced forward jet vertex, from the high energy effective action
proposed by Lipatov. For these calculations we employ the same regularization
and subtraction formalism developed in our previous work on the quark-initiated
vertex. We find agreement with previous results in the literature.
