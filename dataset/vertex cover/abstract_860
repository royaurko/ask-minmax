We present the algebraic Bethe Ansatz solution for the vertex model recently
proposed by Zhou as the classical analog of the Bariev interacting XY chains.
The relevant commutation rules between the creation fields contain the Hecke
symmetry pointed out recently by Hikami and Murakami. The eigenvalues of the
corresponding transfer matrix are explicitly given.
