We propose an alternative perturbative expansion for QCD. All scheme and
scale dependence is reduced to one free parameter. Fixing this parameter with a
fastest apparent convergence criterion gives sensible results in the whole
energy region. We apply the expansion to the calculation of the zero flavor
triple gluon vertex, the quark gluon vertex, the gluon propagator and the ghost
propagator. A qualitative agreement with the corresponding lattice results is
found.
