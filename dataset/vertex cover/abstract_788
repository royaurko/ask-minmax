The Dyson-Schwinger equation for the ghost-gluon vertex of the Hamiltonian
approach to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge is solved at one-loop level
using as input the non-perturbative ghost and gluon propagators previously
determined within the variational approach. The obtained ghost-gluon vertex is
IR finite but IR enhanced compared to the bare one by 15% to 25%, depending on
the kinematical momentum regime.
