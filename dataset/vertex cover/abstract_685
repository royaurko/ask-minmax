We calculate the next-to-leading corrections to the jet vertex which is
relevant for the Mueller-Navelet-jets production in p-pbar collisions and for
the forward jet cross section in e-p collisions. In this first part we present
the results of the vertex for an incoming quark. Particular emphasis is given
to the separation of the collinear divergent part and the central region of the
produced gluon.
