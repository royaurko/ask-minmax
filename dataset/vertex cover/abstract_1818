The gauge independence of the dynamical fermion mass generated through chiral
symmetry breaking in QED in a strong, constant external magnetic field is
critically examined. We show that the bare vertex approximation, in which the
vertex corrections are ignored, is a consistent truncation of the
Schwinger-Dyson equations in the lowest Landau level approximation. The
dynamical fermion mass, obtained as the solution of the truncated
Schwinger-Dyson equations evaluated on the fermion mass shell, is shown to be
manifestly gauge independent. By establishing a direct correspondence between
the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equations and the 2PI (two-particle-irreducible)
effective action truncated at the lowest nontrivial order in the loop expansion
as well as in the 1/N_f expansion (N_f is the number of fermion flavors), we
argue that in a strong magnetic field the dynamical fermion mass can be
reliably calculated in the bare vertex approximation.
