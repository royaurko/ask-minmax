A commutative associative algebra $A$ over ${\mathbb C}$ with a derivation is
one of the simplest examples of a vertex algebra. However, the differences
between the modules for $A$ as a vertex algebra and the modules for $A$ as an
associative algebra are not well understood.
  In this paper, I give the classification of finite-dimensional indecomposable
untwisted or twisted modules for the polynomial ring in one variable over
${\mathbb C}$ as a vertex algebra.
