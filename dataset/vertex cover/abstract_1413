We numerically computed the energy of QCD string junctions in
non-supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theories as the energy of brane configurations
in the background of AdS black hole solutions, and extracted the contribution
of baryon vertices. We obtain a negative vertex energy for the three- and
four-dimensional Yang-Mills theories and a vanishing vertex energy for the
five-dimensional theory.
