The center phase transition at non-vanishing temperatures is investigated in
Landau gauge Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and scalar QCD. For each theory novel
order parameters for the transition are introduced. The matter-gluon vertex
which occurs in the Dyson-Schwinger equations of the propagators has to be
modeled in contemporary studies. It is found that the nature of the phase
transition depends strongly on the detailed structure of this vertex. Our
investigation motivates a precise determination of the matter-gluon vertex at
non-vanishing temperatures.
