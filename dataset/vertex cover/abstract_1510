We propose a classification of the solutions of the graded reflection
equations to the $U_{q}[spo(2n|2m)]$ vertex model. We find twelve distinct
classes of reflection matrices such that four of them are diagonal. In the
non-diagonal matrices the number of free parameters depending on the number of
bosonic ($2n$) and fermionic ($2m$) degrees of freedom while in the diagonal
ones we find solutions with at most one free parameter.
