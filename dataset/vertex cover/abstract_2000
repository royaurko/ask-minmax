Fan-planar graphs were recently introduced as a generalization of 1-planar
graphs. A graph is fan-planar if it can be embedded in the plane, such that
each edge that is crossed more than once, is crossed by a bundle of two or more
edges incident to a common vertex. A graph is outer-fan-planar if it has a
fan-planar embedding in which every vertex is on the outer face. If, in
addition, the insertion of an edge destroys its outer-fan-planarity, then it is
maximal outer-fan-planar. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm
to test whether a given graph is maximal outer-fan-planar. The algorithm can
also be employed to produce an outer-fan-planar embedding, if one exists. On
the negative side, we show that testing fan-planarity of a graph is NP-hard,
for the case where the rotation system (i.e., the cyclic order of the edges
around each vertex) is given.
