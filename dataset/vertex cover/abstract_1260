Past studies of the Brauer group of a scheme tells us the importance of the
interrelationship among Brauer groups of its finite \'etale coverings. In this
paper, we consider these groups simultaneously, and construct an integrated
object "Brauer-Mackey functor".
  We realize this as a {\it cohomological Mackey functor} on the Galois
category of finite \'etale coverings. For any finite \'etale covering of
schemes, we can associate two homomorphisms for Brauer groups, namely the
pull-back and the norm map. These homomorphisms make Brauer groups into a
bivariant functor ($=$ Mackey functor) on the Galois category.
  As a corollary, Restricting to a finite Galois covering of schemes, we obtain
a cohomological Mackey functor on its Galois group. This is a generalization of
the result for rings by Ford. Moreover, applying Bley and Boltje's theorem, we
can derive certain isomorphisms for the Brauer groups of intermediate
coverings.
