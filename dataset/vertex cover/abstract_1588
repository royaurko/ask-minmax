On-shell supergravity vertex operators in an $AdS_5\times S^5$ background are
described in the pure spinor formalism by the zero mode cohomology of a BRST
operator. After expanding the pure spinor BRST operator in terms of the $AdS_5$
radius variable, this cohomology is computed using N=4 harmonic superspace
variables and explicit superfield expressions are obtained for the behavior of
supergravity vertex operators near the boundary of $AdS_5$.
