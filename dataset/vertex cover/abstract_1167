Given a branched covering of degree d between closed surfaces, it determines
a collection of partitions of d, the branch data. In this work we show that any
branch data are realized by an indecomposable primitive branched covering on a
connected close surface N with Euler's characteristic less than or equal to 0.
This shows that decomposable and indecomposable realizations may coexist.
Moreover, we characterize the branch data of a decomposable primitive branched
covering.
