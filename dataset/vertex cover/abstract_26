We describe adjacency of the extreme points of the (unbounded version of
the)set covering polyhedron, similar to the description given by Chv\'atal for
the stable set polytope. We find sufficient conditions and show that these are
also necessary when the underlying matrix is row circular. We apply our
findings to show a new infinite family of minimally nonideal matrices.
