We obtain analytic expressions for the energy and polar-angle double
differential distributions of a secondary lepton l+ (l-) arising from the decay
of t (tbar) in e+e- -> t tbar with an anomalous tbW decay vertex. We also
obtain analytic expressions for the various differential cross sections with
the lepton energy integrated over. In this case, we find that the angular
distributions of the secondary lepton do not depend on the anomalous coupling
in the decay, regardless of possible anomalous couplings occurring in the
production amplitude for e+e- -> t tbar. Our study includes the effect of
longitudinal e- and e+ beam polarization. We also study the lepton energy and
beam polarization dependence of certain CP-violating lepton angular asymmetries
arising from an anomalous tbW decay vertex and compare them with the
asymmetries arising due to CP violation in the production process due to the
top electric or weak dipole moment.
