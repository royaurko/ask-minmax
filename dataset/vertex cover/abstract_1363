We study the effects of heavy Higgs bosons on the top-pair production process
at photon linear colliders. The interference patterns between the resonant
Higgs-production amplitudes and the continuum QED amplitudes are examined. The
patterns tell us not only the CP nature of the Higgs bosons but also the phase
of the $\gamma\gamma$--Higgs vertex which gives new information about the Higgs
couplings to new charged particles.
