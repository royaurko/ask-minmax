At the center of the ZEUS detector situated on the collider HERA at DESY in
Hamburg, a Micro Vertex Detector has been installed in 2000/01. Situated close
to the beam line, this subdetector is designed to measure precisely the tracks
near the interaction point (the vertex). A package called KFFIT is designated
to perform the track fit of the Micro Vertex Detector hits using a Kalman
Filter. This paper is a report of all improvements done in this package. After
a brief description of the algorithm, the improvements of KFFIT will be
presented comparing the last version (v10 released in December 2006) to the
initial one (v1 released in December 2005 (=v2005a.1)).
