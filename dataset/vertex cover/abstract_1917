We define the partition and $n$-point correlation functions for a vertex
operator superalgebra on a genus two Riemann surface formed by sewing two tori
together. For the free fermion vertex operator superalgebra we obtain a closed
formula for the genus two continuous orbifold partition function in terms of an
infinite dimensional determinant with entries arising from torus Szeg\"o
kernels. We prove that the partition function is holomorphic in the sewing
parameters on a given suitable domain and describe its modular properties.
Using the bosonized formalism, a new genus two Jacobi product identity is
described for the Riemann theta series. We compute and discuss the modular
properties of the generating function for all $n$-point functions in terms of a
genus two Szeg\"o kernel determinant. We also show that the Virasoro vector one
point function satisfies a genus two Ward identity.
