This paper studies the co-maximal graph $\Om(R)$, the induced subgraph
$\G(R)$ of $\Om(R)$ whose vertex set is $R\setminus (U(R)\cup J(R))$ and a
retract $\G_r(R)$ of $\G(R)$, where $R$ is a commutative ring. We show that the
core of $\G(R)$ is a union of triangles and rectangles, while a vertex in
$\G(R)$ is either an end vertex or a vertex in the core. For a non-local ring
$R$, we prove that both the chromatic number and clique number of $\G(R)$ are
identical with the number of maximal ideals of $R$. A graph $\G_r(R)$ is also
introduced on the vertex set $\{Rx|\,x\in R\setminus (U(R)\cup J(R))\}$, and
graph properties of $\G_r(R)$ are studied.
