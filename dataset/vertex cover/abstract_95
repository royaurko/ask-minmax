We determine the factor types of the extremal KMS weights for generalized
gauge actions on a graph algebra, and the ground states for the restriction of
the action to a corner defined from a vertex. The assumptions on the graph and
the action varies a bit, but they all cover, at the very least, the case of the
gauge action on a strongly connected graph with at most countably many exits.
These are the graphs for which all the KMS weights of the gauge action were
determined in the first part of this work.
