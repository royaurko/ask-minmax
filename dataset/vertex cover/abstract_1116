We present results for the propagators and the ghost-gluon vertex of Landau
gauge Yang-Mills theory obtained from Dyson-Schwinger equations. Solving these
three quantities simultaneously constitutes a new step in truncating these
equations. We also introduce a new model for the three-gluon vertex that is
motivated by lattice results. It features a zero crossing which is confirmed a
posteriori by a Dyson-Schwinger calculation. Within our setup we can reproduce
lattice data very well. We establish that also for the ghost-gluon vertex a
difference between decoupling and scaling solutions is present. For the scaling
solution we discuss the possibility of modifying the infrared exponents via an
angle dependence of the ghost-gluon vertex. However, no such dependence is
found in our calculations. Finally, we calculate the Schwinger function for the
gluon propagator.
