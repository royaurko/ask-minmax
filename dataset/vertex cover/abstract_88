Planar locally finite graphs which are almost vertex transitive are
discussed. If the graph is 3-connected and has at most one end then the group
of automorphisms is a planar discontinuous group and its structure is
well-known. A general result is obtained for such graphs where no restriction
is put on the number of ends. It is shown that such a graph can be built up
from one ended or finite planar graphs in a precise way. The results give a
classification of the finitely generated groups with planar Cayley graphs.
