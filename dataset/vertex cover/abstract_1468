We study the interactions of the octet baryons in a relativistic meson
exchange approach connecting free-space and in-medium interactions with those
in finite (hyper)nuclei. A short sketch of the model including the relativistic
T- and G-matrix and the mapping of the G-matrix onto density dependent vertex
functionals in the density dependent relativistic hadron field theory (DDRH) is
given. From new spectroscopic data on medium mass hypernuclei we extract the
single particle spectrum including spin-orbit splitting. An extraction of the
$\Lambda\omega$ vector- and tensor vertex as well as the $\Lambda\sigma$-vertex
shows a strong breaking of SU(3) symmetry.
