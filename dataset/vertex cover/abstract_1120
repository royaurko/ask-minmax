The six-vertex model on a square lattice is "exactly solvable" because an
exact formula for the free energy can be obtained by Bethe Ansatz. However,
exact formulas for the correlations of local bulk observables, such as the
orientation of the arrow at a given edge, are in general not available. In this
paper we consider the isotropic "zero-field" six-vertex model at small
|\Delta|. We derive the large-distance asymptotic formula of the arrow-arrow
correlation, which displays a power law decay and an anomalous exponent. Our
method is based on an interacting fermions representation of the six-vertex
model and does not use any information obtained from the exact solution.
