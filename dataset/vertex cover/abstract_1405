We study the renormalization group equations following from the Hopf algebra
of graphs. Vertex functions are treated as vectors in dual to the Hopf algebra
space. The RG equations on such vertex functions are equivalent to RG equations
on individual Feynman integrals. The solution to the RG equations may be
represented as an exponent of the beta-function. We explicitly show that the
exponent of the one-loop beta function enables one to find the coefficients in
front of the leading logarithms for individual Feynman integrals. The same
results are obtained in parquet approximation.
