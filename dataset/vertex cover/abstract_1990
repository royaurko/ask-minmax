We introduce a graph-theoretic vertex dissolution model that applies to a
number of redistribution scenarios such as gerrymandering in political
districting or work balancing in an online situation. The central aspect of our
model is the deletion of certain vertices and the redistribution of their load
to neighboring vertices in a completely balanced way.
  We investigate how the underlying graph structure, the knowledge of which
vertices should be deleted, and the relation between old and new vertex loads
influence the computational complexity of the underlying graph problems. Our
results establish a clear borderline between tractable and intractable cases.
