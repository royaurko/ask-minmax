We show that if $G$ is a group and $G$ has a graph-product decomposition with
finitely-generated abelian vertex groups, then $G$ has two canonical
decompositions as a graph product of groups: a unique decomposition in which
each vertex group is a directly-indecomposable cyclic group, and a unique
decomposition in which each vertex group is a finitely-generated abelian group
and the graph satisfies the $T_0$ property. Our results build on results by
Droms, Laurence and Radcliffe.
