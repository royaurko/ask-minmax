Let $D$ be a strongly connected digraphs on $n\ge 4$ vertices. A vertex $v$
of $D$ is noncritical, if the digraph $D-v$ is strongly connected. We prove,
that if sum of the degrees of any two adjacent vertices of $D$ is at least
$n+1$, then there exists a noncritical vertex in $D$, and if sum of the degrees
of any two adjacent vertices of $D$ is at least $n+2$, then there exist two
noncritical vertices in $D$. A series of examples confirm that these bounds are
tight.
