A Ward-Takahashi identity preserving Bethe-Salpeter kernel can always be
calculated explicitly from a dressed-quark-gluon vertex whose diagrammatic
content is enumerable. We illustrate that fact using a vertex obtained via the
complete resummation of dressed-gluon ladders. While this vertex is planar, the
vertex-consistent kernel is nonplanar and that is true for any dressed vertex.
In an exemplifying model the rainbow-ladder truncation of the gap and
Bethe-Salpeter equations yields many results; e.g., pi- and rho-meson masses,
that are changed little by including higher-order corrections. Repulsion
generated by nonplanar diagrams in the vertex-consistent Bethe-Salpeter kernel
for quark-quark scattering is sufficient to guarantee that diquark bound states
do not exist.
