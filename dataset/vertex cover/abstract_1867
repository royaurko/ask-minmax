In this paper the dependence of meson-nucleon-nucleon vertex form factors is
studied as a function of termperature. The results are obtained starting from a
zero temperature Bonn potential. The temperature dependence of the vertex form
factors and radii is studied in the thermofield dynamics, a real-time operator
formalism of finite temperature field theory. It is anticipated that these
results will have an impact on the study of relativistic heavy-ion collisions
as the critical temperature for the phase transition from hadronic to
quark-gluon system is approached.
