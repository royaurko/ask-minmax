We estimate the size of the triple Pomeron vertex in perturbative QCD and
compare with the phenomenological value extracted from Regge fits to
experimental data. For simplicity, the results of the QCD analysis are taken in
the large-N_c limit. We find that the perturbative triple Pomeron coupling is
of the same order of magnitude as the observed one. We also estimate the size
of the Pomeron self energy and its contribution to the renormalization of the
Pomeron intercept. The effect is very small, in agreement with previous
nonperturbative estimates.
