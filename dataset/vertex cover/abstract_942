In this paper we introduce and study a twisted tensor product construction of
nonlocal vertex algebras. Among the main results, we establish a universal
property and give a characterization of a twisted tensor product. Furthermore,
we give a construction of modules for a twisted tensor product. We also show
that smash products studied by one of us before can be realized as twisted
tensor products.
