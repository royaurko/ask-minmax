One of candidates for the International Linear Collider(ILC)'s vertex
detector is the Fine Pixel CCD (FPCCD) with a pixel size of 5 \times 5
(\mum^2). Sensor and readout systems are currently being studied and prototypes
have been developed. In this paper we will report on the performance of latest
developed readout ASIC prototype as well as the outline of the design strategy
for the next ASIC prototype.
