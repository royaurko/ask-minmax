We present the results of the calculation of the one-loop correction to the
effective vertex for the quark-antiquark pair production in collisions of the
virtual photon with the Reggeized gluon. This vertex is supposed then to be
used for the calculation of the virtual photon impact factor, which is
extremely important, for instance, for the description of the small $x$ deep
inelastic scattering in the BFKL approach.
