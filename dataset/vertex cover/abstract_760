Edge-homotopy and vertex-homotopy are equivalence relations on spatial graphs
which are generalizations of Milnor's link-homotopy. Fleming and the contributor
introduced some edge (resp. vertex)-homotopy invariants of spatial graphs by
applying the Sato-Levine invariant for the constituent 2-component
algebraically split links. In this paper, we construct some new edge (resp.
vertex)-homotopy invariants of spatial graphs without any restriction of
linking numbers of the constituent 2-component links by applying the
generalized Sato-Levine invariant.
