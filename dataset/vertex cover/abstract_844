The equitable coloring problem, introduced by Meyer in 1973, has received
considerable attention and research. Recently, Wu et al. introduced the concept
of equitable (t,k)-tree-coloring, which can be viewed as a generalization of
proper equitable t-coloring. The strong equitable vertex k-arboricity of
complete bipartite equipartition graphs was investigated in 2013. In this
paper, we study the exact value of the strong equitable vertex 3-arboricity of
complete equipartition tripartite graphs.
