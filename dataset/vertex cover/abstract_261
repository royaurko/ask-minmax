Based on any chiral vertex operator algebra satisfying a suitable finiteness
condition, the semisimplicity of the zero-mode algebra as well as a regularity
for induced modules, we construct conformal field theory over the projective
line with the chiral vertex operator algebra as symmetries of the theory. We
appropriately generalize the argument in [TUY] so that we are able to define
sheaves of conformal blocks for chiral vertex operator algebras and study them
in detail. We prove the factorization theorem under the fairly general
conditions for chiral vertex operator algebras and the zero-mode algebras.
