The b-chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\phi(G)$, is the largest
integer $k$ that $G$ admits a proper $k$-coloring such that each color class
has a vertex that is adjacent to at least one vertex in each of the other color
classes. We prove that for each $d$-regular graph $G$ which contains no
4-cycle, $\phi(G)\geq\lfloor\frac{d+3}{2}\rfloor$ and if $G$ has a triangle,
then $\phi(G)\geq\lfloor\frac{d+4}{2}\rfloor$. Also, if $G$ is a $d$-regular
graph which contains no 4-cycle and $diam(G)\geq6$, then $\phi(G)=d+1$.
Finally, we show that for any $d$-regular graph $G$ which does not contain
4-cycle and $\kappa(G)\leq\frac{d+1}{2}$, $\phi(G)=d+1$.
