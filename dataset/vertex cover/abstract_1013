We construct a well-behaved compactification of finite covers of a stacky
curve using admissible cover degenerations. Using our construction, we
compactify the space of tetragonal curves on Hirzebruch surfaces. As an
application, we explicitly describe the boundary divisors of the closure in
$\overline{M}_6$ of the locus of smooth plane quintic curves.
