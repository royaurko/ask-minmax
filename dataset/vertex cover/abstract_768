We derive the recursive relations of the partition function for the
eight-vertex model on an $N\times N$ square lattice with domain wall boundary
condition. Solving the recursive relations, we obtain the explicit expression
of the domain wall partition function of the model. In the
trigonometric/rational limit, our results recover the corresponding ones for
the six-vertex model.
