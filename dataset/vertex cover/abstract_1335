The differential equation method is applied to evaluate analytically two-loop
vertex Feynman diagrams. Three on-shell infrared divergent planar two-loop
diagrams with zero thresholds contributing to the processes Z --> bb bar (for
zero b mass) and/or H --> gg are calculated in order to demonstrate a new
application of this method.
