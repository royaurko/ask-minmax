We initiate a novel formalism for computing correlation functions of trace
operators in the planar N=4 SYM theory. The central object in our formalism is
the spin vertex, which is the weak coupling analogy of the string vertex in
string field theory. We construct the spin vertex explicitly for all sectors at
the leading order using a set of bosonic and fermionic oscillators. We prove
that the vertex has trivial monodromy, or put in other words, it is a Yangian
invariant. Since the monodromy of the vertex is the product of the monodromies
of the three states, the Yangian invariance of the vertex implies an infinite
exact symmetry for the three-point function. We conjecture that this infinite
symmetry can be lifted to any loop order.
