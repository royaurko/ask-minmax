We study properties of automorphisms of graph products of groups. We show
that graph product $\Gamma\mathcal{G}$ has non-trivial pointwise inner
automorphisms if and only if some vertex group corresponding to a central
vertex has non-trivial pointwise inner automorphisms. We use this result to
study residual finiteness of $\mathop{Out}(\Gamma \mathcal{G})$. We show that
if all vertex groups are finitely generated residually finite and the vertex
groups corresponding to central vertices satisfy certain technical (yet
natural) condition, then $\mathop{Out}(\Gamma\mathcal{G})$ is residually
finite. Finally, we generalise this result to graph products of residually
$p$-finite groups to show that if $\Gamma\mathcal{G}$ is a graph product of
finitely generated residually $p$-finite groups such that the vertex groups
corresponding to central vertices satisfy the $p$-version of the technical
condition then $\mathop{Out}(\Gamma\mathcal{G})$ is virtually residually
$p$-finite. We use this result to prove bi-orderability of Torreli groups of
some graph products of finitely generated residually torsion-free nilpotent
groups.
