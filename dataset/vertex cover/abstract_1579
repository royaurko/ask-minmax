We introduce a notion of a (V,T)-module over a vertex algebra V for an
arbitrary positive integer T, which is a generalization of a twisted V-module.
Under some conditions on V, we construct an associative algebra A^{T}_{m}(V)
for m\in(1/T)\N and an A^{T}_{m}(V)-A^{T}_{n}(V)-bimodule A^{T}_{n,m}(V) for
n,m\in(1/T)\N and we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of
isomorphism classes of simple left A^{T}_{0}(V)-modules and that of simple
(1/T)\N-graded (V,T)-modules.
