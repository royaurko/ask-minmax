The study of charmonium dissociation in heavy ion collisions is generally
performed in the framework of effective Lagrangians with meson exchange. Some
studies are also developed with the intention of calculate form factors and
coupling constants related with charmed and light mesons. These quantities are
important in the evaluation of charmonium cross sections. In this paper we
present a calculation of the $\omega DD$ vertex that is a possible interaction
vertex in some meson-exchange models spread in the literature. We used the
standard method of QCD Sum Rules in order to obtain the vertex form factor as a
function of the transferred momentum. Our results are compatible with the value
of this vertex form factor (at zero momentum transfer) obtained in the
vector-meson dominance model.
