The six-vertex model, or the square ice model, with domain wall boundary
conditions (DWBC) has been introduced and solved for finite $n$ by Korepin and
Izergin. The solution is based on the Yang-Baxter equations and it represents
the free energy in terms of an $n\times n$ Hankel determinant. Paul Zinn-Justin
observed that the Izergin-Korepin formula can be re-expressed in terms of the
partition function of a random matrix model with a nonpolynomial interaction.
We use this observation to obtain the large $n$ asymptotics of the six-vertex
model with DWBC. The solution is based on the Riemann-Hilbert approach. In this
paper we review asymptotic results obtained in different regions of the phase
diagram.
