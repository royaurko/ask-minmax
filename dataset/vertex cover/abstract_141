Graph homomorphism has been studied intensively. Given an m x m symmetric
matrix A, the graph homomorphism function is defined as \[Z_A (G) =
\sum_{f:V->[m]} \prod_{(u,v)\in E} A_{f(u),f(v)}, \] where G = (V,E) is any
undirected graph. The function Z_A can encode many interesting graph
properties, including counting vertex covers and k-colorings. We study the
computational complexity of Z_A for arbitrary symmetric matrices A with
algebraic complex values. Building on work by Dyer and Greenhill, Bulatov and
Grohe, and especially the recent beautiful work by Goldberg, Grohe, Jerrum and
Thurley, we prove a complete dichotomy theorem for this problem. We show that
Z_A is either computable in polynomial-time or #P-hard, depending explicitly on
the matrix A. We further prove that the tractability criterion on A is
polynomial-time decidable.
