A random graph evolution based on the interactions of N vertices is studied.
During the evolution both the preferential attachment method and the uniform
choice of vertices are allowed. The weight of a vertex means the number of its
interactions. The asymptotic behaviour of the weight and the degree of a fixed
vertex, moreover the limit of the maximal weight and the maximal degree are
described. The proofs are based on martingale methods.
