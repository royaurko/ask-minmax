If V(R) is the vertex sequence of a symmetric cycle R in the tope graph of a
simple acyclic oriented matroid M on a t-element ground set, then the set min
V(R) of minimal elements in the subposet V(R) of the tope poset of M, based at
the positive tope, is a critical committee for M that votes for the base tope.
We consider the sequence zR of poset ranks of the elements from the vertex
sequence of R as a fragment of a signal with period 2t and relate the number of
members of the committee min V(R) to the magnitudes of [t/2] components, with
odd indices, of the discrete Fourier transform of the distance vector zR.
