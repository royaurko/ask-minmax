Seymour's distance two conjecture states that in any digraph there exists a
vertex (a "Seymour vertex") that has at least as many neighbors at distance two
as it does at distance one. We explore the validity of probabilistic statements
along lines suggested by Seymour's conjecture, proving that almost surely there
are a "large" number of Seymour vertices in random tournaments and "even more"
in general random digraphs.
