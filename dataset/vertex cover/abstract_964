We give a sharp refinement of a result of Alon, Ben-Shimon and Krivelevich.
This gives a sufficient condition for a finite sequence of positive integers to
be the vertex degree list of both parts of a bipartite graph. The condition
depends only on the length of the sequence and its largest and smallest
elements.
