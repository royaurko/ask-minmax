We recalculate, completely within the original BFKL approach and at the
next-to-leading order, the jet vertex relevant for the production of
Mueller-Navelet jets in proton collisions and of forward jets in DIS. We
consider both processes with incoming quark and gluon. The starting point is
the definition of quark and gluon impact factors in the BFKL approach.
Following this procedure we show explicitly that all infrared divergences
cancel when renormalized parton densities are considered. We compare our
results for the vertex with the former calculation of Refs. [1,2] and, in the
case of the quark contribution, clarify the discrepancy present in the
literature.
