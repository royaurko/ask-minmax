We describe a well-known collection of vertex operators on the infinite wedge
representation as a limit of geometric correspondences on the equivariant
cohomology groups of a finite-dimensional approximation of the Sato
grassmannian, by cutoffs in high and low degrees. We prove that locality, the
boson-fermion correspondence, and intertwining relations with the Virasoro
algebra are limits of the localization expression for the composition of these
operators. We then show that these operators are, almost by definition, the
Hilbert scheme vertex operators defined by Okounkov and the contributor in \cite{CO}
when the surface is $\mathbb{C}^2$ with the torus action $z\cdot (x,y) =
(zx,z^{-1}y)$.
