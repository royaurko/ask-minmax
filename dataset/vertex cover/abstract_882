A ``dilute'' generalisation of the Birman--Wenzl--Murakami algebra is
considered. It can be ``Baxterised'' to a solution of the Yang--Baxter algebra.
The $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ vertex models are examples of corresponding solvable
lattice models and can be regarded as the dilute version of the $B^{(1)}_{n}$
vertex models.
