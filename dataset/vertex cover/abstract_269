If a vertex operator algebra $V=\oplus_{n=0}^{\infty}V_n$ satisfies $\dim
V_0=1, V_1=0$, then $V_2$ has a commutative (nonassociative) algebra structure
called Griess algebra. One of the typical examples of commutative
(nonassociative) algebras is a Jordan algebra. For example, the set $Sym_d(\C)$
of symmetric matrices of degree $d$ becomes a Jordan algebra. On the other
hand, in the theory of vertex operator algebras, central charges influence the
properties of vertex operator algebras. In this paper, we construct vertex
operator algebras with central charge $c$ and its Griess algebra is isomorphic
to $Sym_d(\C)$ for any complex number $c$.
