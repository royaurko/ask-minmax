We prove that in any recurrent reversible random rooted graph, two
independent simple random walks started at the same vertex collide infinitely
often almost surely. This applies to the Uniform Infinite Planar Triangulation
and Quadrangulation and to the Incipient Infinite Cluster in $\mathbb{Z}^2$.
