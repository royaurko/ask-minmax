Spherical Whittaker functions on the metaplectic n-fold cover of GL(r+1) over
a nonarchimedean local field containing n distinct n-th roots of unity may be
expressed as the partition functions of statistical mechanical systems that are
variants of the six-vertex model. If n=1 then in view of the Casselman-Shalika
formula this fact is related to Tokuyama's deformation of the Weyl character
formula. It is shown that various properties of these Whittaker functions may
be expressed in terms of the commutativity of row transfer matrices for the
system. Potentially these properties (which are already proved by other
methods, but very nontrivial) are amenable to proof by the Yang-Baxter
equation.
