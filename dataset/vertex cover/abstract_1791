We report a new measurement of Rb=Gamma(Z -> bb)/ Gamma(Z -> hadrons) using a
double tag technique where the b selection is based on topological
reconstruction of the mass of the B-decay vertex. The measurement was performed
using a sample of 150k hadronic Z0 events collected with the SLD at the SLAC
Linear Collider during the years 1993-1995. The method utilizes the 3-D
vertexing abilities of the SLD CCD pixel vertex detector and the small stable
SLC beams to obtain a high b tagging efficiency of 37% for a purity of 97.2%.
The high purity reduces the systematics introduced by charm contamination and
correlations with Rc. We obtain a result of
Rb=0.2176+/-0.0033(stat.)+/-0.0017(syst.)+/-0.0008(Rc).
