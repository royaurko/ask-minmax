In this paper we show that many snarks have shortest cycle covers of length
$\frac{4}{3}m+c$ for a constant $c$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the
graph, in agreement with the conjecture that all snarks have shortest cycle
covers of length $\frac{4}{3}m+o(m)$.
  In particular we prove that graphs with perfect matching index at most 4 have
cycle covers of length $\frac{4}{3}m$ and satisfy the $(1,2)$-covering
conjecture of Zhang, and that graphs with large circumference have cycle covers
of length close to $\frac{4}{3}m$. We also prove some results for graphs with
low oddness and discuss the connection with Jaeger's Petersen colouring
conjecture.
