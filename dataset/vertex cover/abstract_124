The NP-hard 2-Club problem is, given an undirected graph G=(V,E) and l\in N,
to decide whether there is a vertex set S\subseteq V of size at least l such
that the induced subgraph G[S] has diameter at most two. We make progress
towards a systematic classification of the complexity of 2-Club with respect to
a hierarchy of prominent structural graph parameters. First, we present the
following tight NP-hardness results: 2-Club is NP-hard on graphs that become
bipartite by deleting one vertex, on graphs that can be covered by three
cliques, and on graphs with domination number two and diameter three. Then, we
consider the parameter h-index of the input graph. This parameter is motivated
by real-world instances and the fact that 2-Club is fixed-parameter tractable
with respect to the larger parameter maximum degree. We present an algorithm
that solves 2-Club in |V|^{f(k)} time with k being the h-index. By showing
W[1]-hardness for this parameter, we provide evidence that the above algorithm
cannot be improved to a fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, the reduction
used for this hardness result can be modified to show that 2-Club is NP-hard if
the input graph has constant degeneracy. Finally, we show that 2-Club is
fixed-parameter tractable with respect to distance to cographs.
