The Caccetta-Haggkvist conjecture states that if G is a finite directed graph
with at least n/k edges going out of each vertex, then G contains a directed
cycle of length at most k. Hamidoune used methods and results from additive
number theory to prove the conjecture for Cayley graphs and for
vertex-transitive graphs. This expository paper contains a survey of results on
the Caccetta-Haggkvist conjecture, and complete proofs of the conjecture in the
case of Cayley and vertex-transitive graphs.
