We are developing the vertex detector with a fine pixel CCD (FPCCD) for the
international linear collider (ILC), whose pixel size is $5 \times 5$
$\mu$m$^{2}$. To evaluate the performance of the FPCCD vertex detector and
optimize its design, development of the software dedicated for the FPCCD is
necessary. We, therefore, started to develop the software for FPCCD. In this
article, the status of the study is reported.
