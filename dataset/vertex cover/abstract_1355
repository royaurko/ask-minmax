We consider a process of quasielastic $e\mu$ large-angle scattering at high
energies with radiative corrections up to a two-loop level. A lowest order
radiative correction arising both from one-loop virtual photon emission and a
real soft emission are presented to a power accuracy. Two-loop level
corrections are supposed to be of three gauge-invariant classes. One of them,
so called vertex contribution, is given in logarithmic approximation. Relation
with the renormalization group approach is discussed.
