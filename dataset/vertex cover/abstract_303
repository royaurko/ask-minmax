The strong cycle double cover conjecture states that for every circuit $C$ of
a bridgeless cubic graph $G$, there is a cycle double cover of $G$ which
contains $C$. We conjecture that there is even a 5-cycle double cover $S$ of
$G$ which contains $C$, i.e. $C$ is a subgraph of one of the five 2-regular
subgraphs of $S$. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a 2-regular
subgraph to be contained in a 5-cycle double cover of $G$.
