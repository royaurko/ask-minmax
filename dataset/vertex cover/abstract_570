The revised Szeged index $Sz^*(G)$ is defined as $Sz^*(G)=\sum_{e=uv \in
E}(n_u(e)+ n_0(e)/2)(n_v(e)+ n_0(e)/2),$ where $n_u(e)$ and $n_v(e)$ are,
respectively, the number of vertices of $G$ lying closer to vertex $u$ than to
vertex $v$ and the number of vertices of $G$ lying closer to vertex $v$ than to
vertex $u$, and $n_0(e)$ is the number of vertices equidistant to $u$ and $v$.
Hansen used the AutoGraphiX and made the following conjecture about the revised
Szeged index for a connected bicyclic graph $G$ of order $n \geq 6$: $$
Sz^*(G)\leq \{{array}{ll} (n^3+n^2-n-1)/4,& {if $n$ is odd}, (n^3+n^2-n)/4, &
{if $n$ is even}. {array}. $$ with equality if and only if $G$ is the graph
obtained from the cycle $C_{n-1}$ by duplicating a single vertex. This paper is
to give a confirmative proof to this conjecture.
