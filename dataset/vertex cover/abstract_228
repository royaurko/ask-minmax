We determine fusion rules (dimensions of the space of intertwining operators)
among simple modules for the vertex operator algebra obtained as an even part
of the symplectic fermionic vertex operator superalgebra. By using these fusion
rules we show that the fusion algebra of this vertex operator algebra is
isomorphic to the group algebra of the Klein four group over Z.
