An efficient algorithm is presented to compute the characteristic polynomial
of a threshold graph. Threshold graphs were introduced by Chv\'atal and Hammer,
as well as by Henderson and Zalcstein in 1977. A threshold graph is obtained
from a one vertex graph by repeatedly adding either an isolated vertex or a
dominating vertex, which is a vertex adjacent to all the other vertices.
Threshold graphs are special kinds of cographs, which themselves are special
kinds of graphs of clique-width 2. We obtain a running time of $O(n \log^2 n)$
for computing the characteristic polynomial, while the previously fastest
algorithm ran in quadratic time. Keywords: Efficient Algorithms, Threshold
Graphs, Characteristic Polynomial.
