An edge (vertex) coloured graph is rainbow-connected if there is a rainbow
path between any two vertices, i.e. a path all of whose edges (internal
vertices) carry distinct colours. Rainbow edge (vertex) connectivity of a graph
$G$ is the smallest number of colours needed for a rainbow edge (vertex)
colouring of $G$. In this paper we propose a very simple approach to studying
rainbow connectivity in graphs. Using this idea, we give a unified proof of
several known results, as well as some new ones.
