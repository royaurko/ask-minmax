The new integrable systems associated to the space of elliptic branched
coverings are constructed. The relationship of these systems with elliptic
Schlesinger's system is described. For the standard two-fold elliptic coverings
the integrable system is written explicitly. A trigonometric degeneration of
the construction is presented.
