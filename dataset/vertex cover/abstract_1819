Effective field theory of interacting BFKL pomerons is investigated and
Langevin equations for the theory, which arise after the introduction of
additional auxiliary field, are obtained. The Langevin equations are considered
for the case of interacting BFKL pomerons with both splitting and merging
vertexes and for the interaction which includes additional "toy" four pomeron
interaction vertex. In the latest case an analogy with the Regge field theory
in zero dimensions (RFT-0) was used in order to obtain this "toy" four pomeron
interaction vertex. The comparison between the Langevin equations obtained in
the frameworks of dipole and RFT approaches is performed, the interpretation of
results is given and possible implementation of obtained equations is
discussed.
