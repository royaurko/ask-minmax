Twisted vertex operators based on rational lattices have had many
applications in vertex operator algebra theory and conformal field theory. In
this paper, ``relativized'' twisted vertex operators are constructed in a
general context based on isometries of rational lattices, and a generalized
twisted Jacobi identity is established for them. This result generalizes many
previous results. Relatived untwisted vertex operators had been studied in a
monograph by the contributors. The present paper includes as a special case the
proof of the main relations among twisted vertex operators based on even
lattices announced some time ago by the second contributor.
