In this paper we compute the first vertex of a generic Newton polygon in some
special cases, and the corresponding Hasse polynomial. This allows us to show
the nonexistence of $p$-cyclic coverings of the projective line in
characteristic $p$ with supersingular jacobian for some (infinite families of)
genera.
