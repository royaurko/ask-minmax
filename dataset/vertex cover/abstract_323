We study minimal generating subspaces of "weak PBW type" for vertex operator
algebras that satisfy a certain condition on the grading, and we develop a
procedure for finding such subspaces. As applications, we derive some results
on generalized modules and produce a minimal generating space of weak PBW type
for the vertex operator algebra $V_L$ associated with any positive-definite
even lattice $L$.
