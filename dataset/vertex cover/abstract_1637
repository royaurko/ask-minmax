We characterise connected cubic graphs admitting a vertex- transitive group
of automorphisms with an abelian normal subgroup that is not semiregular. We
illustrate the utility of this result by using it to prove that the order of a
semiregular subgroup of maximum order in a vertex-transitive group of
automorphisms of a connected cubic graph grows with the order of the graph.
