This paper is an exposition of the representation theory of vertex operator
algebras in terms of associative algebras A_n(V) and their bimodules. A new
result on the rationality is given. That is, a simple vertex operator algebra V
is rational if and only if its Zhu algebra A(V) is a semisimple associative
algebra and each irreducible admissible $V$-module is ordinary.
