We construct irreducible modules of centrally-extended classical Lie algebras
over left ideals of the algebra of differential operators on the circle,
through certain irreducible modules of centrally-extended classical Lie
algebras of infinite matrices with finite number of nonzero entries. The
structures of vertex algebras associated with the vaccum representations of
these algebras are determined. Moreover, we prove that under certain
conditions, the highest weight irreducible modules of centrally-extended
classical Lie algebras of infinite matrices with finite number of nonzero
entries narually give rise to the irreducible modules of the simple quotients
of these vertex algebras. Our results are natural generalizations of the
well-known WZW models in conformal field theory associated with affine
Kac-Moody algebras. They can also be viewed as quadratic generalizations of
free field theory.
