Recently, Mullins calculated the Casson-Walker invariant of the 2-fold cyclic
branched cover of an oriented link in S^3 in terms of its Jones polynomial and
its signature, under the assumption that the 2-fold branched cover is a
rational homology 3-sphere. Using elementary principles, we provide a similar
calculation for the general case. In addition, we calculate the LMO invariant
of the p-fold branched cover of twisted knots in S^3 in terms of the Kontsevich
integral of the knot.
