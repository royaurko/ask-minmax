This paper studies certain relations among vertex algebras, vertex Lie
algebras and vertex Poisson algebras. In this paper, the notions of vertex Lie
algebra (conformal algebra) and vertex Poisson algebra are revisited and
certain general construction theorems of vertex Poisson algebras are given. A
notion of filtered vertex algebra is formulated in terms of a notion of good
filtration and it is proved that the associated graded vector space of a
filtered vertex algebra is naturally a vertex Poisson algebra. For any vertex
algebra $V$, a general construction and a classification of good filtrations
are given. To each $\N$-graded vertex algebra $V=\coprod_{n\in \N}V_{(n)}$ with
$V_{(0)}=\C {\bf 1}$, a canonical (good) filtration is associated and certain
results about generating subspaces of certain types of $V$ are also obtained.
Furthermore, a notion of formal deformation of a vertex (Poisson) algebra is
formulated and a formal deformation of vertex Poisson algebras associated with
vertex Lie algebras is constructed.
