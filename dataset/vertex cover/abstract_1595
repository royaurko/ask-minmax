An approach based on the spectral and Lie - algebraic techniques for
constructing vertex operator representation for solutions to a Riemann type
Gurevicz-Zybin hydrodynamical hierarchy is devised. A functional representation
generating an infinite hirerachy of dispersive Lax type integrable flows is
obtaned.
