We present two constructions in this paper: (a) A 10-vertex triangulation
$\CC P^{2}_{10}$ of the complex projective plane $\CC P^{2}$ as a subcomplex of
the join of the standard sphere ($S^{2}_4$) and the standard real projective
plane ($\RR P^{2}_{6}$, the decahedron), its automorphism group is $A_4$; (b) a
12-vertex triangulation $(S^{2} \times S^{2})_{12}$ of $S^{2} \times S^{2}$
with automorphism group $2S_5$, the Schur double cover of the symmetric group
$S_5$. It is obtained by generalized bistellar moves from a simplicial
subdivision of the standard cell structure of $S^{2} \times S^{2}$. Both
constructions have surprising and intimate relationships with the icosahedron.
It is well known that $\CC P^{2}$ has $S^{2} \times S^{2}$ as a two-fold
branched cover; we construct the triangulation $\CC P^{2}_{10}$ of $\CC P^{2}$
by presenting a simplicial realization of this covering map $S^{2} \times S^{2}
\to \CC P^{2}$. The domain of this simplicial map is a simplicial subdivision
of the standard cell structure of $S^{2} \times S^{2}$, different from the
triangulation alluded to in (b). This gives a new proof that Kuehnel's $\CC
P^{2}_{9}$ triangulates $\CC P^{2}$. It is also shown that $\CC P^{2}_{10}$ and
$(S^{2} \times S^{2})_{12}$ induce the standard piecewise linear structure on
$\CC P^{2}$ and $S^{2} \times S^{2}$ respectively.
