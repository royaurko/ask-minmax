It has been proposed recently that topological A-model string amplitudes for
toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds in non self-dual graviphoton background can be
caluculated by a diagrammatic method that is called the ``refined topological
vertex''. We compute the extended A-model amplitudes for SU(N)-geometries using
the proposed vertex. If the refined topological vertex is valid, these
computations should give rise to the Nekrasov's partition functions of N=2
SU(N) gauge theories via the geometric engineering. In this article, we verify
the proposal by confirming the equivalence between the refined A-model
amplitude and the K-theoretic version of the Nekrasov's partition function by
explicit computation.
