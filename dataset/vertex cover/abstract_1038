In a recent paper, we investigated the effects of the massive charged gauge
bosons (bileptons) predicted by the minimal 331 model on the off-shell vertex
WWV^* (V=gamma, Z) using a SU_L(2) X U_Y(1) covariant gauge-fixing term for the
bileptons. We proceed along the same lines and calculate the effects of the
gauge bosons predicted by the 331 model with right-handed neutrinos. It is
found that the bilepton effects on the WWV^* vertex are of the same order of
magnitude than those arising from the SM and several of its extensions,
provided that the bilepton mass is of the order of a few hundred of GeVs. For
heavier bileptons, their effects on the WWV^* vertex are negligible. The
behavior of the form factors at high energies is also discussed as it is a
reflect of the gauge invariance and gauge independence of the WWV^* Green
function obtained via our quantization method.
