We study integrations over light-cone momenta in the gauge invariant
effective action of high energy QCD. A regularization mechanism which allows
for the evaluation of the longitudinal integrations is presented. After a
rederivation of the reggeized gluon and the BFKL-equation from the effective
action, we study the 1-3 and 2-4 reggeized gluon transition vertex of QCD
Reggeon field theory and discuss their connection with the usual triple Pomeron
vertex of perturbative QCD.
