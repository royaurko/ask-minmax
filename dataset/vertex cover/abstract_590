The line graph of a graph with signed edges carries vertex signs. A
vertex-signed graph is consistent if every circle (cycle, circuit) has positive
vertex-sign product. Acharya, Acharya, and Sinha recently characterized
line-consistent signed graphs, i.e., edge-signed graphs whose line graphs, with
the naturally induced vertex signature, are consistent. Their proof applies
Hoede's relatively difficult characterization of consistent vertex-signed
graphs. We give a simple proof that does not depend on Hoede's theorem as well
as a structural description of line-consistent signed graphs.
