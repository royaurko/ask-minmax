The calculation method of the hadron interaction vertex with constant
external fields in QCD sum rules is discussed. The representation of the
polarization operator in terms of physical states contributions is considered
and the most suitable form of this representation is suggested. The estimates
of uncertainties in the previous calculations of hadron interaction vertices
with external fields are given.
