In vertex operator algebra theories, most of the general theorems are proved
under the assumptions of rationality and C_2-cofiniteness. In this paper, we
obtain several general theorems without the assumption of rationality so that
we can use them for proving rationality of given C_2-cofinite vertex operator
algebras. For example, we apply them to orbifold models and show that if g is a
finite automorphism of a rational C_2-cofinite vertex operator algebra T of
CFT-type with T'\cong T and a fixed point subVOA T^g is C_2-cofinite, then T^g
is also rational.
