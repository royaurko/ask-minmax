Let $p$ be a prime and let $L$ be either the intransitive permutation group
$C_p\times C_p$ of degree $2p$ or the transitive permutation group $C_p \wr
C_2$ of degree $2p$. Let $\Gamma$ be a connected $G$-vertex-transitive and
$G$-edge-transitive graph and let $v$ be a vertex of $\Gamma$. We show that if
the permutation group induced by the vertex-stabiliser $G_v$ on the
neighbourhood $\Gamma(v)$ is isomorphic to $L$ then either $|V(\Gamma)|\geq
p|G_v|\log_p\left(|G_v|/2\right)$, or $|V(\Gamma)|$ is bounded by a constant
depending only on $p$, or $\Gamma$ is a very-well understood graph. This
generalises a few recent results.
