Covering model provides a general framework for granular computing in that
overlapping among granules are almost indispensable. For any given covering,
both intersection and union of covering blocks containing an element are
exploited as granules to form granular worlds at different abstraction levels,
respectively, and transformations among these different granular worlds are
also discussed. As an application of the presented multi-granular perspective
on covering, relational interpretation and axiomization of four types of
covering based rough upper approximation operators are investigated, which can
be dually applied to lower ones.
