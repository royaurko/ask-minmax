In this paper we consider a simple model of random graph process with {\it
hard} copying as follows: At each time step $t$, with probability $0<\alpha\leq
1$ a new vertex $v_t$ is added and $m$ edges incident with $v_t$ are added in
the manner of {\it preferential attachment}; or with probability $1-\alpha$ an
existing vertex is copied uniformly at random. In this way, while a vertex with
large degree is copied, the number of added edges is its degree and thus the
number of added edges is not upper bounded. We prove that, in the case of
$\alpha$ being large enough, the model possesses a mean degree sequence as $
d_{k}\sim Ck^{-(1+2\alpha)}$, where $d_k$ is the limit mean proportion of
vertices of degree $k$.
