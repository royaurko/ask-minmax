We discuss 3-manifolds which are cyclic coverings of the 3-sphere, branched
over 2-bridge knots and links. Different descriptions of these manifolds are
presented: polyhedral, Heegaard diagram, Dehn surgery and coloured graph
constructions. Using these descriptions, we give presentations for their
fundamental groups, which are cyclic presentations in the case of 2-bridge
knots. The homology groups are given for a wide class of cases. Moreover, we
prove that each singly-cyclic branched covering of a 2-bridge link is the
composition of a meridian-cyclic branched covering of a determined link and a
cyclic branched covering of a trivial knot.
