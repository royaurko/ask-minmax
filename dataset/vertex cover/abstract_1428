We obtain general identities for the product of two Schur functions in the
case where one of the functions is indexed by a rectangular partition, and give
their t-analogs using vertex operators. We study subspaces forming a filtration
for the symmetric function space that lends itself to generalizing the theory
of Schur functions and also provides a convenient environment for studying the
Macdonald polynomials. We use our identities to prove that the vertex operators
leave such subspaces invariant. We finish by showing that these operators act
simply on the k-Schur functions, thus leading to a concept of irreducibility
for these functions.
