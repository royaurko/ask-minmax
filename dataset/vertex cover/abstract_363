We propose a simple geometric recipe for constructing phase diagrams for a
general class of vertex models obeying the ice rule. The disordered phase maps
onto the intersecting loop model which is interesting in its own right and is
related to several other statistical mechanical models. This mapping is also
useful in understanding some ordered phases of these vertex models as they
correspond to the polymer loop models with cross-links in their vulcanised
phase.
