We consider the problem of the exact computation of the correlation functions
of the eight-vertex solid-on-solid model by means of the algebraic Bethe
Ansatz. We compute the scalar product between a Bethe eigenstate and an
arbitrary state of Bethe type and show that, in the cyclic case, it can be
formulated as a single determinant of usual functions. It allows us to obtain
determinant representations for finite-size form factors. By summing up over
the form factors, we also give a multiple integral representation for a
generating function of the two-point function.
