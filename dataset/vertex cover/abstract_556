For any vertex algebra V and any subalgebra A of V, there is a new subalgebra
of V known as the commutant of A in V. This construction was introduced by
Frenkel-Zhu, and is a generalization of an earlier construction due to
Kac-Peterson and Goddard-Kent-Olive known as the coset construction. In this
paper, we interpret the commutant as a vertex algebra notion of invariant
theory. We present an approach to describing commutant algebras in an
appropriate category of vertex algebras by reducing the problem to a question
in commutative algebra. We give an interesting example of a Howe pair (ie, a
pair of mutual commutants) in the vertex algebra setting.
