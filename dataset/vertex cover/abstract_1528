In this article we define a minor relation, which is stronger than the
classical one, but too strong to become a well-quasi-order on the class of
finite graphs. Nevertheless, with this terminology we are able to introduce a
conjecture, which would imply the Lovasz conjecture and give an interesting
insight on the symmetry of vertex-transitive graphs, if true. Though it could
become an approach to solve the Lovasz conjecture. These ideas were first
introduced by the contributor in his Diploma Thesis.
