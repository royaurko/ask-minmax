The open-closed vertex in the maximally supersymmetric type IIB plane-wave
light-cone string field theory is considered and an explicit solution for the
bosonic part of the vertex is derived, valid for all values of the mass
parameter, \mu. This vertex is of relevance to IIB plane-wave orientifolds, as
well as IIB plane-wave strings in the presence of D-branes and their gauge
theory duals. Methods of complex analysis are used to develop a systematic
procedure for obtaining the solution. This procedure is first applied to the
vertex in flat space and then extended to the plane-wave case. The plane-wave
solution for the vertex requires introducing certain ``\mu-deformed Gamma
functions'', which are generalizations of the ordinary Gamma function. The
behaviour of the Neumann matrices is graphically illustrated and their
large-\mu asymptotics are analysed.
