We compute the perturbative one-to-three Pomeron vertex in the colour glass
condensate using the extended generalized leading logarithmic approximation in
high energy QCD. The vertex is shown to be a conformal four-point function in
two-dimensional impact parameter space. Our result can be used to compare
different theoretical descriptions of the colour glass condensate.
