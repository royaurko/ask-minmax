We consider pure gravity in light-cone gauge and derive the complete quintic
interaction vertex. Up to quartic order, the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations
can be made manifest at the level of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. The
quintic interaction vertex represents an essential first step in further
extending the off-shell validity of the KLT relations to higher order vertices.
