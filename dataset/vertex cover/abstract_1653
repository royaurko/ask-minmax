We obtain an asymptotic formula for the partition function of the six-vertex
model with partial domain wall boundary conditions in the ferroelectric phase
region. The proof is based on a formula for the partition function involving
the determinant of a matrix of mixed Vandermonde/Hankel type. This determinant
can be expressed in terms of a system of discrete orthogonal polynomials, which
can then be evaluated asymptotically by comparison with the Meixner
polynomials.
