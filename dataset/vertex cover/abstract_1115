We solve the Dyson-Schwinger equations of the ghost and gluon propagators of
Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory together with that of the ghost-gluon vertex.
The latter plays a central role in many truncation schemes for functional
equations. By including it dynamically we can determine its influence on the
propagators. We also suggest a new model for the three-gluon vertex motivated
by lattice data which plays a crucial role to obtain stable solutions when the
ghost-gluon vertex is included. We find that both vertices have a sizable
quantitative impact on the mid-momentum regime and contribute to the reduction
of the gap between lattice and Dyson-Schwinger equation results. Furthermore,
we establish that the three-gluon vertex dressing turns negative at low momenta
as suggested by lattice results in three dimensions.
