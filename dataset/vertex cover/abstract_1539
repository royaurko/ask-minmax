We study a special anisotropic XYZ-model on a periodic chain of an odd length
and conjecture exact expressions for certain components of the ground state
eigenvectors. The results are written in terms of tau-functions associated with
Picard's elliptic solutions of the Painlev\'e VI equation. Connections with
other problems related to the eight-vertex model are briefly discussed.
