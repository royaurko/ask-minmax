Constraints on the whole spectrum of lepton flavor violating vertices are
shown in the context of the standard two Higgs doublet model. The vertex
involving the $e-\tau $ mixing is much more constrained than the others, and
the decays proportional to such vertex are usually very supressed. On the other
hand, bounds on the quark sector are obtained from leptonic decays of the
$B_{d,s}^{0}$ mesons and from $\Delta M_{B_{d}^{0}}$. We emphasize that
although the $B_{d}^{0}-\bar{B}_{d}^{0}$ mixing restricts severely the $% d-b$
mixing vertex, the upper bound for this vertex could still give a sizeable
contribution to the decay $B_{d}^{0}\to \mu \bar{\mu}$ respect to the standard
model contribution, from which we see that such vertex could still play a role
in the phenomenology.
