As for an elliptic $R$-operator which satisfies the Yang--Baxter equation,
the incoming and outgoing intertwining vectors are constructed, and the
vertex--IRF correspondence for the elliptic $R$-operator is obtained. The
vertex--IRF correspondence implies that the Boltzmann weights of the IRF model
satisfy the star--triangle relation. By means of these intertwining vectors,
the factorized L-operators for the elliptic $R$-operator are also constructed.
The vertex--IRF correspondence and the factorized L-operators for Belavin's
$R$-matrix are reproduced from those of the elliptic $R$-operator.
