The MAPS technology is considered as a possible choice for the ILC Vertex
Detector. Test results of MIMOSA-5 sensors indicate that the pixel multiplicity
and the single point resolution depend significantly on the incident particle
angle. We propose a simple model describing charge distribution in the
detector, which can be used for detailed simulation of the Vertex Detector
response. Good agreement with beam test data is obtained. A new class for Track
Detailed Simulation (TDS) has been developed and implemented in the EUTelescope
software framework.
