Ohta proposed a solution for the well-known difficulty of satisfying the
Ward-Takahashi identity for a photo-meson-baryon-baryon amplitude ($\gamma$MBB)
when a dressed meson-baryon-baryon (MBB) vertex function is present. He
obtained a form for the $\gamma$MBB amplitude which contained, in addition to
the usual pole terms, longitudinal seagull terms which were determined entirely
by the MBB vertex function. He arrived at his result by using a Lagrangian
which yields the MBB vertex function at tree level. We show that such a
Lagrangian can be neither hermitian nor charge conjugation invariant. We have
been able to reproduce Ohta's result for the $\gamma$MBB amplitude using the
Ward-Takahashi identity and no other assumption, dynamical or otherwise, and
the most general form for the MBB and $\gamma$MBB vertices. However, contrary
to Ohta's finding, we find that the seagull terms are not robust. The seagull
terms extracted from the $\gamma$MBB vertex occur unchanged in tree graphs,
such as in an exchange current amplitude. But the seagull terms which appear in
a loop graph, as in the calculation of an electromagnetic form factor, are, in
general, different. The whole procedure says nothing about the transverse part
of the ($\gamma$MBB) vertex and its contributions to the amplitudes in
question.
