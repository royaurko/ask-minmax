The vertex reconstruction toolkit RAVE has been extended by an option for the
inclusion of kinematic constraints, and embedded into the ILD analysis
framework Marlin. The new tools have been tested with an exemplary
reconstruction of WW and ZZ decays. The presented results show the improvements
achieved in precision of the fitted masses, and demonstrate the usage and
functionality of the toolkit.
