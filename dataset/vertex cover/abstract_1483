Affine Toda equations based on simple Lie algebras arise by imposing zero
curvature condition on a Lax connection which belongs to the corresponding loop
Lie algebra in the principal gradation. In the particular case of $A_n^{(1)}$
 Toda models, we exploit the symmetry of the underlying linear problem to
calculate the dressing group element which generates arbitrary $N$-soliton
solution from the vacuum. Starting from this result we recover the vertex
operator representation of the soliton tau functions.
