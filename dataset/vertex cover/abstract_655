We discuss some of the difficulties that have been mentioned in the
literature in connection with the Bethe ansatz for the six-vertex model and XXZ
chain, and for the eight-vertex model. In particular we discuss the ``beyond
the equator'', infinite momenta and exact complete string problems. We show how
they can be overcome and conclude that the coordinate Bethe ansatz does indeed
give a complete set of states, as expected.
