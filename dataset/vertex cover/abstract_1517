The lowest order pomeron loop is calculated for the leading conformal weight
with full dependence of the triple pomeron vertex on intermediate conformal
weights. The loop is found to be convergent. Its contribution to the pomeron
Green function begins to dominate already at rapidities 10$\div$15. The pomeron
pole renormalization is found to be quite small due to a rapid fall of the
triple pomeron vertex with rising conformal weights.
