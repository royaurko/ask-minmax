A word is quasiperiodic (or coverable) if it can be covered with occurrences
of another finite word, called its quasiperiod. A word is multi-scale
quasiperiodic (or multi-scale coverable) if it has infinitely many different
quasiperiods. These notions were previously studied in the domains of text
algorithms and combinatorics of right infinite words.
  We extend them to infinite pictures (two-dimensional words). Then we compare
the regularity properties (uniform recurrence, uniform frequencies, topological
entropy) of quasiperiodicity with multi-scale quasiperiodicity, and we also
compare each of them with its one-dimensional counterpart.
  We also study which properties of quasiperiods enforce properties on the
quasiperiodic words.
