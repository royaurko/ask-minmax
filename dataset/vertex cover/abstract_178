Vertex operator superalgebras are studied and various results on rational
Vertex operator superalgebras are obtained. In particular, the vertex operator
super subalgebras generated by the weight 1/2 and weight 1 subspaces are
determined. It is also established that if the even part $V_{\bar 0}$ of a
vertex operator superalgebra $V$ is rational, so is $V.$
