The infrared behaviour of Landau gauge QCD vertex functions is investigated
employing a skeleton expansion of the Dyson-Schwinger and Renormalization Group
equations. Results for the ghost-gluon, three-gluon, four-gluon and quark-gluon
vertex functions are presented. Positivity violation of the gluon propagator,
and thus gluon confinement, is demonstrated. Results of the Dyson-Schwinger
equations for a finite volume are compared to corresponding lattice data. It is
analytically demonstrated that a linear rising potential between heavy quarks
can be generated by infrared singularities in the dressed quark-gluon vertex.
The selfconsistent mechanism that generates these singularities necessarily
entails the scalar Dirac amplitudes of the full vertex and the quark
propagator. These can only be present when chiral symmetry is broken, either
explicitly or dynamically.
