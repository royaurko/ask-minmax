In plane wave one-body approximation the reaction of deuteron
photodisintegration is considered in the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter
formalism for two-nucleon system. Results are obtained for deuteron vertex
function, which is the solution of the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with
a multi-rank separable interaction kernel, with a given analytical form. A
comparison is presented with predictions of non-relativistic, quasipotential
approaches and the equal time approximation. It is shown that important
contributions come from the boost in the arguments of the initial state vertex
function and the boost on the relative energy in the one-particle propagator
due to recoil.
