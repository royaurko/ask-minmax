We consider a three-dimensional lattice model consisting of layers of vertex
models coupled with interlayer interactions. For a particular non-trivial
interlayer interaction between charge-conserving vertex models and using a
transfer matrix approach, we show that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
transfer matrix are related to those of the two-dimensional vertex model. The
result is applied to analyze the phase transitions in a realistic
three-dimensional dimer system.
