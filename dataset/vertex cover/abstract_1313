We present a new method of calculating scalar propagator and vertex functions
in the two-loop approximation, for arbitrary masses of particles. It is based
on a double integral representation, suitable for numerical evaluation. Real
and imaginary parts of the diagrams are calculated separately, so that there is
no need to use complex arithmetics in the numerical program.
