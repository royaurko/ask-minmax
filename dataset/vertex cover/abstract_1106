Any finite group can be encoded as the automorphism group of an unlabeled
simple graph. Recently Hartke, Kolb, Nishikawa, and Stolee (2010) demonstrated
a construction that allows any ordered pair of finite groups to be represented
as the automorphism group of a graph and a vertex-deleted subgraph. In this
note, we describe a generalized scenario as a game between a player and an
adversary: An adversary provides a list of finite groups and a number of
rounds. The player constructs a graph with automorphism group isomorphic to the
first group. In the following rounds, the adversary selects a group and the
player deletes a vertex such that the automorphism group of the corresponding
vertex-deleted subgraph is isomorphic to the selected group. We provide a
construction that allows the player to appropriately respond to any sequence of
challenges from the adversary.
