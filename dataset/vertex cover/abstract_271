In the first article of this series, we pointed out a difficulty in the
attempt to derive the low-energy behavior of the graviton two-point function,
from the loop-quantum-gravity dynamics defined by the Barrett-Crane vertex
amplitude. Here we show that this difficulty disappears when using the
corrected vertex amplitude recently introduced in the literature. In
particular, we show that the asymptotic analysis of the new vertex amplitude
recently performed by Barrett, Fairbairn and others, implies that the vertex
has precisely the asymptotic structure that, in the second article of this
series, was indicated as the key necessary condition for overcoming the
difficulty.
