We extend recent studies of the effects of quark-gluon vertex dressing upon
the solutions of the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the quark propagator. A
momentum delta function is used to represent the dominant infrared strength of
the effective gluon propagator so that the resulting integral equations become
algebraic. The quark-gluon vertex is constructed from the complete set of
diagrams involving only 2-point gluon lines. The additional diagrams, including
those with crossed gluon lines, are shown to make an important contribution to
the DSE solutions for the quark propagator, because of their large color
factors and the rapid growth in their number.
