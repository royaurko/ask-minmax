For a simple vertex operator algebra whose Virasoro element is a sum of
commutative Virasoro elements of central charge 1/2, two codes are introduced
and studied. It is proved that such vertex operator algebras are rational. For
lattice vertex operator algebras and related ones, decompositions into direct
sums of irreducible modules for the product of the Virasoro algebras of central
charge 1/2 are explicitly described. As an application, the decomposition of
the moonshine vertex operator algebra is obtained for a distinguished system of
48 Virasoro algebras.
