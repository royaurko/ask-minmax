We investigate vertex operator algebras $L(k,0)$ associated with
modular-invariant representations for an affine Lie algebra $A_1 ^{(1)}$ ,
where k is 'admissible' rational number. We show that VOA $L(k,0)$ is rational
in the category $\cal O$ and find all irreducible representations in the
category of weight modules.
