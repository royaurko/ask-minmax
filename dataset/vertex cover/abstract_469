Given a graph G with positive integer weights on the vertices, and a token
placed on some current vertex u, two players alternately remove a positive
integer weight from u and then move the token to a new current vertex adjacent
to u. When the weight of a vertex is set to 0, it is removed and its
neighborhood becomes a clique. The player making the last move wins. This
adaptation of Nim on graphs is called Vertexnim, and slightly differs from the
game Vertex NimG introduced by Stockman in 2004. Vertexnim can be played on
both directed or undirected graphs. In this paper, we study the complexity of
deciding whether a given game position of Vertexnim is winning for the first or
second player. In particular, we show that for undirected graphs, this problem
can be solved in quadratic time. Our algorithm is also available for the game
Vertex NimG, thus improving Stockman's exptime algorithm. In the directed case,
we are able to compute the winning strategy in polynomial time for several
instances, including circuits or digraphs with self loops.
