We calculate an effect of spinless impurities on the spin Hall effect of the
Luttinger model representing p-type semiconductors. The self-energy in the Born
approximation becomes diagonal in the helicity basis and its value is
independent of the wavenumber or helicity. The vertex correction in the ladder
approximation vanishes identically, in sharp contrast with the Rashba model.
This implies that in the clean limit the spin Hall conductivity reproduces the
value of the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity calculated in earlier papers.
