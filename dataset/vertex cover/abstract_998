This paper contains a classication of the regular minimal abstract polytopes
that act as covers for the convex polyhedral prisms and antiprisms. It includes
a detailed discussion of their topological structure, and completes the
enumeration of such covers for convex uniform polyhedra. Additionally, this
paper addresses related structural questions in the theory of string C-groups.
