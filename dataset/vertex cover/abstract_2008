In this article, the prospects for studying the tensor structure of the HZZ
vertex with the LHC experiments are presented. The structure of tensor
couplings in Higgs di-boson decays is investigated by measuring the asymmetries
and by studing the shapes of the final state angular distributions. The
expected background contributions, detector resolution, and trigger and
selection efficiencies are taken into account. The potential of the LHC
experiments to discover sizeable non-Standard Model contributions to the HZZ
vertex with $300\;{\rm fb}^{-1}$ and $3000\;{\rm fb}^{-1}$ is demonstrated.
