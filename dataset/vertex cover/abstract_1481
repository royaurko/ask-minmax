In this paper all eight-vertex type solutions of the colored Yang-Baxter
equation dependent on spectral as well as color parameter are given. It is
proved that they are composed of three groups of basic solutions, three groups
of their degenerate forms and two groups of trivial solutions up to five
solution transformations. Moreover, all non-trivial solutions can be classified
into two types called Baxter and Free-Fermion type.
