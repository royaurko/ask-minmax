We provide the twisted Alexander polynomials of finite abelian covers over
three-dimensional manifolds whose boundary is a finite union of tori. This is a
generalization of a well-known formula for the usual Alexander polynomial of
knots in finite cyclic branched covers over the three-dimensional sphere.
