A good deal of research has been done and published on coloring of the
vertices of graphs for several years while studying of the excellent work of
those maestros, we get inspire to work on the vertex coloring of graphs in case
of a particular triangular closed path structure what we achieve from the front
view of a pyramidal structure. From here we achieve a repetitive nature of
vertex coloring in case of odd and even number of horizontal lines within this
triangular structure. In order to apply this repetitive nature of vertex
coloring in case of a binary tree, we get a success in Krafts Inequality.
Actually our work mainly deals with a particular triangular closed path vertex
coloring and repetition of the vertex coloring nature in case of the Krafts
inequality in the field of Information Theory and Coding.
