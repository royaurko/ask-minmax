Given a configuration of pebbles on the vertices of a graph, a pebbling move
is defined by removing two pebbles from some vertex and placing one pebble on
an adjacent vertex. The cover pebbling number of a graph, gamma(G), is the
smallest number of pebbles such that through a sequence of pebbling moves, a
pebble can eventually be placed on every vertex simultaneously, no matter how
the pebbles are initially distributed. The cover pebbling number for complete
multipartite graphs and wheel graphs is determined. We also prove a sharp bound
for gamma(G) given the diameter and number of vertices of G.
