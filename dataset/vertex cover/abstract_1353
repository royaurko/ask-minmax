It is shown how the axial vector current of current quarks is related to that
of constituent quarks within the framework of the global color symmetry model.
Gluon dressing of the axial vector vertex and the quark self-energy functions
is described by the inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder
approximation and the Schwinger-Dyson equation in the rainbow approximation,
respectively.
