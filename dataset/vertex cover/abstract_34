We present results on partitioning the vertices of $2$-edge-colored graphs
into monochromatic paths and cycles. We prove asymptotically the two-color case
of a conjecture of S\'ark\"ozy: the vertex set of every $2$-edge-colored graph
can be partitioned into at most $2\alpha(G)$ monochromatic cycles, where
$\alpha(G)$ denotes the independence number of $G$. Another direction, emerged
recently from a conjecture of Schelp, is to consider colorings of graphs with
given minimum degree. We prove that apart from $o(|V(G)|)$ vertices, the vertex
set of any $2$-edge-colored graph $G$ with minimum degree at least
$(1+\eps){3|V(G)|\over 4}$ can be covered by the vertices of two vertex
disjoint monochromatic cycles of distinct colors. Finally, under the assumption
that $\overline{G}$ does not contain a fixed bipartite graph $H$, we show that
in every $2$-edge-coloring of $G$, $|V(G)|-c(H)$ vertices can be covered by two
vertex disjoint paths of different colors, where $c(H)$ is a constant depending
only on $H$. In particular, we prove that $c(C_4)=1$, which is best possible.
