We study baryons in SU(N) gauge theories, according to the gauge/string
correspondence based on IIB string theory. The D5 brane, in which $N$
fundamental strings are dissolved as a color singlet, is introduced as the
baryon vertex, and its configurations are studied. We find point- and
split-type of vertex. In the latter case, two cusps appears and they are
connected by a flux composed of dissolved fundamental strings with a definite
tension. In both cases, $N$ fundamental quarks are attached on the cusp(s) of
the vertex to cancel the surface term. In the confining phase, we find that the
quark in the baryon feel the potential increasing linearly with the distance
from the vertex. At finite temperature and in the deconfining phase, we find a
stable k-quarks "baryons", which are constructed of arbitrary number of $k(<N)$
quarks.
