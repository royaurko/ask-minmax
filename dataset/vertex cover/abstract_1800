The pseudoscalar ``hairpin'' vertex (i.e. quark-disconnected vertex) plays a
key role in quenched chiral perturbation theory. Direct calculations using
lattice simulations find that it has a significant dependence on quark mass. I
show that this mass dependence can be used to determine the quenched
Gasser-Leutwyler constant L5. This complements the calculation of L5 using the
mass dependence of the axial decay constant of the pion. In an appendix, I
discuss power counting for quenched chiral perturbation theory and describe the
particular scheme used in this paper.
