The two-loop three-gluon vertex is calculated in an arbitrary covariant
gauge, in the limit when two of the gluons are on the mass shell. The
corresponding two-loop results for the ghost-gluon vertex are also obtained. It
is shown that the results are consistent with the Ward-Slavnov-Taylor
identities.
