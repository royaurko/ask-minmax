In this work we devise a new method to study quark anti-quark interactions
beyond simple ladder-exchange that yield massless pions in the chiral limit.
The method is based on the requirement to have a representation of the
quark-gluon vertex that is explicitly given in terms of quark dressings
functions. We outline a general procedure to generate the Bethe-Salpeter kernel
for a given vertex representation. Our method allows not only the
identification of the mesons' masses but also the extraction of their
Bethe-Salpeter wave functions exposing their internal structure. We exemplify
our method with vertex models that are of phenomenological interest.
