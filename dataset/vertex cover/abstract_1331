We review the calculation of one-loop contributions to the three-gluon
vertex, for arbitrary (off-shell) external momenta, in arbitrary covariant
gauge and in arbitrary space-time dimension. We discuss how one can get the
results for all on-shell limits of interest directly from the general off-shell
expression.
