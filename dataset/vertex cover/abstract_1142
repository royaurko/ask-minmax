The thermo-magnetic corrections to the quark-gluon vertex in the presence of
a weak magnetic field are calculated in the frame of the Hard Thermal Loop
approximation. The vertex satisfies a QED-like Ward identity with the quark
self-energy calculated within the same approximation. It turns out that only
the longitudinal vertex components get modified. The calculation provides a
first principles result for the quark anomalous magnetic moment at high
temperature in a weak magnetic field. The effective thermo-magnetic quark-gluon
coupling shows a decreasing behavior as function of the field strength. This
result supports the observation that the behavior of the effective quark-gluon
coupling in the presence of a magnetic field is an important ingredient in
order to understand the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon recently observed
in the lattice QCD simulations.
