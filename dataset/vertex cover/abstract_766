We compute the form factors of the photon-quark-anti-quark vertex and the
effective vertex of a Higgs boson and two gluons to three-loop order within
massless perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. These results provide building
blocks for many third-order cross sections. Furthermore, this is the first
calculation of complete three-loop vertex corrections.
