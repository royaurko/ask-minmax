A proper edge $t$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of edges of $G$ with
colors $1,2,...,t$ such that each of $t$ colors is used, and adjacent edges are
colored differently. The set of colors of edges incident with a vertex $x$ of
$G$ is called a spectrum of $x$. A proper edge $t$-coloring of a graph $G$ is
interval for its vertex $x$ if the spectrum of $x$ is an interval of integers.
A proper edge $t$-coloring of a graph $G$ is persistent-interval for its vertex
$x$ if the spectrum of $x$ is an interval of integers beginning from the color
1.
  For graphs $G$ from some classes of graphs, we obtain estimates for the
possible number of vertices for which a proper edge $t$-coloring of $G$ can be
interval or persistent-interval.
