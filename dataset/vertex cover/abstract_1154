Let k be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. The goal
of this paper is to characterize the proper smooth curves X/k of positive genus
g equipped with a k-rational point P such that X\P can be realized as an etale
cover of the affine line.
  A first elementary analysis shows that such a cover exists if and only if
there exists an exact regular differential form on X having a unique zero at P
(of order 2g-2). The main inconvenient of this approach is that it doesn't give
any control on the degree of the cover. A finer investigation, essentially
based on the duality between the Cartier operator and the Frobenius map allows
to overcome this problem.
