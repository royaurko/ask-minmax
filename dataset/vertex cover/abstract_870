The structure of the nonperturbative vector meson vertex function complicates
the proof of the factorisation theorem for the reaction $\gamma^*p\to Vp$. It
leads to additional contributions but, in a simple model for the vertex
function, gauge invariance ensures that they cancel and factorisation is
preserved.
