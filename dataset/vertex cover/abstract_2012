An $n$-vertex graph is prime if it has no non-trivial homogeneous set, that
is a set $X$ of vertices ($2\le |X|\le n-1$) such that every vertex not in $X$
is either complete or anticomplete to $X$. A chain of length $t$ is a sequence
of $t+1$ vertices such that for every vertex in the sequence except the first
one, its immediate predecessor is its unique neighbor or its unique
non-neighbor among all of its predecessors. We prove that for all $n$, there
exists $N$ such that every prime graph with at least $N$ vertices contains one
of the following graphs or their complements as an induced subgraph: (1) the
graph obtained from $K_{1,n}$ by subdividing every edge once, (2) the line
graph of $K_{2,n}$, (3) the line graph of the graph in (1), (4) the half-graph
of height $n$, (5) a prime graph induced by a chain of length $n$, (6) two
particular graphs obtained from the half-graph of height $n$ by making one side
a clique and adding one vertex.
