We prove bounds on the chromatic number $\chi$ of a vertex-transitive graph
in terms of its clique number $\omega$ and maximum degree $\Delta$. We
conjecture that every vertex-transitive graph satisfies $\chi \le \max
\left\{\omega, \left\lceil\frac{5\Delta + 3}{6}\right\rceil\right\}$ and we
prove results supporting this conjecture. Finally, for vertex-transitive graphs
with $\Delta \ge 13$ we prove the Borodin-Kostochka conjecture, i.e.,
$\chi\le\max\{\omega,\Delta-1\}$.
