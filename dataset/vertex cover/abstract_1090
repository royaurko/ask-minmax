We propose to search for wrong displaced vertices, where decay products of
the secondary vertex move towards the primary vertex instead of away from it,
as a signature for microscopic violation of causality. We analyze in detail the
leptonic sector of the recently proposed Lee-Wick Standard Model, which
provides a well motivated framework to study acausal effects. We find that,
assuming Minimal Flavor Violation, the Lee-Wick partners of the electron,
{\tilde l}^e and \tilde e, can produce measurable wrong vertices at the LHC,
the most promising channel being q \bar{q} --> \bar{\tilde l}^e {\tilde l}^e
--> e^+ e^- jjjj. A Monte-Carlo simulation using MadGraph/MadEvent suggests
that for M_l < 450 GeV the measurement of these acausal vertex displacements
should be accessible in the LHC era.
