We continue with [LY] to construct and classify graded simple twisted modules
for the $\N$-graded vertex algebras constructed by Gorbounov, Malikov and
Schechtman from vertex algebroids. Meanwhile we determine the full automorphism
groups of those $\N$-graded vertex algebras in terms of the automorphism groups
of the corresponding vertex algebroids.
