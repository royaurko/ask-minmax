We calculated the effective vertex of the quark production in the collision
of Reggeized quark and Reggeized gluon in the next-to-leading order (NLO). The
vertex in question is the missing component of the multi-Regge NLO amplitudes
with the quark and gluon exchanges in $t_i$ channels. The calculation allows us
to develop the bootstrap approach to the quark Reggeization proof within
next-to-leading logarithmic approximation.
