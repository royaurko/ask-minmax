Haisheng Li showed that given a module (W,Y_W(\cdot,x)) for a vertex algebra
(V,Y(\cdot,x)), one can obtain a new V-module W^{\Delta} =
(W,Y_W(\Delta(x)\cdot,x)) if \Delta(x) satisfies certain natural conditions. Li
presented a collection of such \Delta-operators for V=L(k,0) (a vertex operator
algebra associated with an affine Lie algebras, k a positive integer). In this
paper, for each irreducible L(k,0)-module W, we find a highest weight vector of
W^{\Delta} when \Delta is associated with a miniscule coweight. From this we
completely determine the action of these \Delta-operators on the set of
isomorphism equivalence classes of L(k,0)-modules.
