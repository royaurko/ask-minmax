We construct a spin foam model of Yang-Mills theory coupled to gravity by
using a discretized path integral of the BF theory with polynomial interactions
and the Barret-Crane ansatz. In the Euclidian gravity case we obtain a vertex
amplitude which is determined by a vertex operator acting on a simple spin
network function. The Euclidian gravity results can be straightforwardly
extended to the Lorentzian case, so that we propose a Lorentzian spin foam
model of Yang-Mills theory coupled to gravity.
