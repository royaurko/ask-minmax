An asymmetric covering D(n,R) is a collection of special subsets S of an
n-set such that every subset T of the n-set is contained in at least one
special S with |S| - |T| <= R. In this paper we compute the smallest size of
any D(n,1) for n <= 8. We also investigate ``continuous'' and ``banded''
versions of the problem. The latter involves the classical covering numbers
C(n,k,k-1), and we determine the following new values: C(10,5,4) = 51,
C(11,7,6,) =84, C(12,8,7) = 126, C(13,9,8)= 185 and C(14,10,9) = 259. We also
find the number of nonisomorphic minimal covering designs in several cases.
