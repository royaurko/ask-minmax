Let G/Q be an homogeneous variety embedded in a projective space P thanks to
an ample line bundle L. Take a projective space containing P and form the cone
X over G/Q, we call this a cone over an homogeneous variety.
  Let $\alpha$ a class of 1-cycle on X. In this article we describe the
irreducible components of the scheme of morphisms of class $\alpha$ from a
rational curve to X.
  The situation depends on the line bundle L : if the projectivised tangent
space to the vertex contains lines (i.e. if G/Q contains lines in P) then the
irreducible components are described as in our paper math.AG/0407123 by the
difference between Cartier and Weil divisors. On the contrary if there is no
line in the projectivised tangent space to the vertex then there are new
irreducible components corresponding to the multiplicity of the curve through
the vertex.
  As in math.AG/0407123 we use a resolution Y of X (the blowing-up) and study
the curves on Y.
