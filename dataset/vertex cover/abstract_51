We establish a new group-theoretic realization of the basic representations
of the twisted affine and twisted toroidal algebras of ADE types in the same
spirit of our new approach to the McKay correspondence. Our vertex operator
construction provides a unified description to the character tables for the
spin cover of the wreath product of the twisted hyperoctahedral groups and an
arbitrary finite group.
