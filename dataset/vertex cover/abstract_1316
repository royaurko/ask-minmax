A recently proposed method of calculating scalar two-loop propagator and
vertex functions with massive particles is illustrated with simple examples. A
double integral representation is derived with the example of a propagator
function. An analogous representation is used to compute the vertex function
for space-like external momenta. Ways of dealing with divergent diagrams and of
controlling the accuracy of the numerical evaluation of the two-loop functions
are also discussed.
