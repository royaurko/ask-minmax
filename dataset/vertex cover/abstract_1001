Given a finite connected simple graph $\Gamma$, and a subgroup $G$ of its
automorphism group, a general method for finding all finite abelian regular
coverings of $\Gamma$ that admit a lift of each element of $G$ is developed. As
an application, all connected arc-transitive abelian regular coverings of the
Petersen graph are classified up to isomorphism.
