Vertex detector cable requirements are considered within the context of the
SiD concept. Cable material should be limited so that the number of radiation
lengths represented is consistent with the material budget. In order to take
advantage of the proposed accelerator beam structure and allow cooling by flow
of dry gas, pulsed power is assumed. Potential approaches to power
distribution, cable paths, and cable design for operation in a 5 T magnetic
field are described.
