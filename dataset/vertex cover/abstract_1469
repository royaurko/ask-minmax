The temperature and density dependence of the meson-nucleon vertex form
factors is studied in the framework of thermofield dynamics. Results are
obtained for two rather different nucleon-nucleon potentials: the usual Bonn
potential and the variation with a softer $\pi NN$ form factor, due to Holinde
and Thomas. In general, the results show only a modest degree of sensitivity to
the choice of interaction.
