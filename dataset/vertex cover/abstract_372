We study the feasibility of level expansion and test the quartic vertex of
closed string field theory by checking the flatness of the potential in
marginal directions. The tests, which work out correctly, require the
cancellation of two contributions: one from an infinite-level computation with
the cubic vertex and the other from a finite-level computation with the quartic
vertex. The numerical results suggest that the quartic vertex contributions are
comparable or smaller than those of level four fields.
