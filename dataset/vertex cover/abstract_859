In this note we study the electron spectral weight of doped Mott insulators
based on the 2D slave boson gauge field theory. The vertex correction with
static gauge field is calculated in the second order perturbation theory. The
vertex correction is found to be singular at low energy and requires
non-perturbative treatments.
