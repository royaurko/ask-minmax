The relative merits and disadvantages of various alternatives for vertexing
and central tracking detectors for the Linear Collider detector are presented.
Research and development prospects for the various alternatives are also
discussed, as well as a preliminary study of the prospects for forward
(cos(theta) > 0.9) tracking.
