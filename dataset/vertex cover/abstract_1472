The problem of splitting effects by vertex angles is discussed for
nonintegrable rational polygonal billiards. A statistical analysis of the decay
dynamics in weakly open polygons is given through the orbit survival
probability. Two distinct channels for the late-time relaxation of type
1/t^delta are established. The primary channel, associated with the universal
relaxation of ''regular'' orbits, with delta = 1, is common for both the closed
and open, chaotic and nonchaotic billiards. The secondary relaxation channel,
with delta > 1, is originated from ''irregular'' orbits and is due to the
rationality of vertices.
