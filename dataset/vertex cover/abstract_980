In this paper, we classify all the K3 surfaces covering a Kummer surface. Our
classification is expressed in terms of period lattices and extends Morrison's
criterion of K3 surfaces with a Shioda-Inose structure. Moreover, we list all
the K3 surfaces covering a general Kummer surface and provide very geometrical
examples of such a phenomenon.
