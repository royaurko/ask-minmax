We show that three numerical semigroups <5,6,7,8>, <3,7,8 > and <3,5> are of
double covering type, i.e., the Weierstrass semigroups of ramification points
on double covers of curves. Combining this with the results of
Oliveira-Pimentel and Komeda we can determine the Weierstrass semigroups of the
ramification points on double covers of genus two curves.
