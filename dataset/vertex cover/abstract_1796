The polarization of the $W$ boson in $t \to W b$ decay is unambiguously
predicted by the Standard Model of weak interactions and is a powerful test of
our understanding of the $tbW$ vertex. The subsequent $W \to l \nu$ decay
serves as a polarimeter for the $W$, and the invariant mass of the lepton and
$b$ quark in top decay provides a measurement of the $W$ decay angle. In this
paper we present a measurement of the decay rate of the W produced from the
decay of the top quark in the hypothesis of V+A structure of the tWb vertex. We
find no evidence for the non-standard V+A vertex and set a limit on $f_{V+A}$
$<$ 0.80 @ 95% confidence level. By combining this result with a complementary
observable in the same data, we assign a limit of $f_{V+A}$ $<$ 0.61 @ 95% CL.
