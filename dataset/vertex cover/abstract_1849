We study a large family of competing spatial growth models. In these the
vertices in Z^d can take on three possible states {0,1,2}. Vertices in states 1
and 2 remain in their states forever, while vertices in state 0 which are
adjacent to a vertex in state 1 (or state 2) can switch to state 1 (or state
2). We think of the vertices in states 1 and 2 as infected with one of two
infections while the vertices in state 0 are considered uninfected. In this way
these models are variants of the Richardson model. We start the models with a
single vertex in state 1 and a single vertex is in state 2. We show that with
positive probability state 1 reaches an infinite number of vertices and state 2
also reaches an infinite number of vertices. This extends results and proves a
conjecture of Haggstrom and Pemantle. The key tool is applying the ergodic
theorem to stationary first passage percolation.
