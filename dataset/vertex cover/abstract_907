Finite XXZ chain with double boundaries is considered at critical regime
$-1<\Delta<1$. We construct the eigenvectors of finite Hamiltonian by means of
vertex operators and the quasi-boundary states. Using the free field
realizations of the vertex operators and the quasi-boundary states, integral
representations for the correlation functions are derived.
