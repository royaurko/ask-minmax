We generalize Feigin and Miwa's construction of extended vertex operator
(super)algebras $A_{k}(sl(2))$ for other types of simple Lie algebras. For all
the constructed extended vertex operator (super)algebras, irreducible modules
are classified, complete reducibility of every module is proved and fusion
rules are determined modulo the fusion rules for vertex operator algebras of
affine type.
