We derive certain systems of differential equations for matrix elements of
products and iterates of logarithmic intertwining operators among strongly
graded generalized modules for a strongly graded conformal vertex algebra under
suitable assumptions. Using these systems of differential equations, we verify
the convergence and extension property needed in the logarithmic tensor
category theory for such strongly graded generalized modules developed by
Huang, Lepowsky and Zhang.
