In a previous article we have show that there are difficulties in obtaining
the correct graviton propagator from the loop-quantum-gravity dynamics defined
by the Barrett-Crane vertex amplitude. Here we show that a vertex amplitude
that depends nontrivially on the intertwiners can yield the correct propagator.
We give an explicit example of asymptotic behavior of a vertex amplitude that
gives the correct full graviton propagator in the large distance limit.
