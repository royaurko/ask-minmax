We consider non-local currents in the context of quantized affine algebras,
following the construction introduced by Bernard and Felder. In the case of
$U_q(A_1^{(1)})$ and $U_q(A_2^{(2)})$, these currents can be identified with
configurations in the six-vertex and Izergin--Korepin nineteen-vertex models.
Mapping these to their corresponding Temperley--Lieb loop models, we directly
identify non-local currents with discretely holomorphic loop observables. In
particular, we show that the bulk discrete holomorphicity relation and its
recently derived boundary analogue are equivalent to conservation laws for
non-local currents.
