We propose a framework for computing the (light cone) string field theory
vertex in the case when the string worldsheet QFT is a generic integrable
theory. The prime example and ultimate goal would be the $AdS_5 \times S^5$
superstring theory cubic string vertex and the chief application will be to use
this framework as a formulation for ${ \cal N}=4$ SYM theory OPE coefficients
valid at any coupling up to wrapping corrections. In this paper we propose
integrability axioms for the vertex, illustrate them on the example of the
pp-wave string field theory and also uncover similar structures in weak
coupling computations of OPE coefficients.
