In these proceedings a recent calculation of the last missing piece of the
two-loop O(alpha alpha(s)) corrections to gamma t anti-t vertex at the t anti-t
threshold due to the exchange of a W boson and a gluon is summarised. The
calculation constitutes a building block of the top quark threshold production
cross section at electron positron colliders.
