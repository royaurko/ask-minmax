Recently there is huge interest in graph theory and intensive study on
computing integer powers of matrices. In this paper, we investigate
relationships between one type of graph and well-known Fibonacci sequence. In
this content, we consider the adjacency matrix of one type of graph with 2k
(k=1,2,...) vertices. It is also known that for any positive integer r, the
(i,j)th entry of A^{r} (A is the adjacency matrix of the graph) is just the
number of walks from vertex i to vertex j, that use exactly k edges.
