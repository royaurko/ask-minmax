Single cluster covering approach provides a plausible mechanism for the
formation and stability of octagonal and decagonal quasiperiodic structures.
For dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern such a single cluster covering scheme is
still unavailable. Here we demonstrated that the ship tiling, one of the
dodecagonal quasiperioidic structures, can be constructed from one single
prototile with matching rules. A deflation procedure is devised by assigning
proper orientations to the tiles present in the ship tiling including regular
triangle, 30{\deg}-rhombus and square, and fourteen types of vertical
configurations have been identified in the deflated pattern, which fulfill the
closure condition under deflation and all result in a T-cluster centered at
vertex. This result can facilitate the study of physical properties of
dodecagonal quasicrystals.
