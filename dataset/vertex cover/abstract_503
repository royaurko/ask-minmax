We compute the equivariant zeta function for bundles over infinite graphs and
for infinite covers. In particular, we give a ``transfer formula'' for the zeta
function of infinite graph covers. Also, when the infinite cover is given as a
limit of finite covers, we give a formula for the limit of the zeta functions.
