We study graphs whose vertex degree tends and which are, therefore, called
rapidly branching. We prove spectral estimates, discreteness of spectrum, first
order eigenvalue and Weyl asymptotics solely in terms of the vertex degree
growth. The underlying techniques are estimates on the isoperimetric constant.
Furthermore, we give lower volume growth bounds and we provide a new criterion
for stochastic incompleteness.
