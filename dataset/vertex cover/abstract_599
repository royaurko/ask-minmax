We consider distance queries in vertex labeled planar graphs. For any fixed
$0 < \epsilon \leq 1/2$ we show how to preprocess a planar graph with vertex
labels and edge lengths into a data structure that answers queries of the
following form. Given a vertex $u$ and a label $\lambda$ return a
$(1+O(\epsilon))$-approximation of the distance between $u$ and its closest
vertex with label $\lambda$. For an undirected $n$-vertex planar graph the
preprocessing time is $O(\epsilon^{-2}n\lg^{3}{n})$, the size is
$O(\epsilon^{-1}n\lg{n})$, and the query time is $O(\lg\lg{n} +
\epsilon^{-1})$. For a directed planar graph with arc lengths bounded by $N$,
the preprocessing time is $O(\epsilon^{-2}n\lg^{3}{n}\lg(nN))$, the data
structure size is $O(\epsilon^{-1}n\lg{n}\lg(nN))$, and the query time is
$O(\lg\lg{n}\lg\lg(nN) + \epsilon^{-1})$.
