In this letter we generalise the baryon vertex configuration of AdS/CFT by
adding a suitable instantonic magnetic field on its worldvolume, dissolving
D-string charge. A careful analysis of the configuration shows that there is an
upper bound on the number of dissolved strings. This should be a manifestation
of the stringy exclusion principle. We provide a microscopical description of
this configuration in terms of a dielectric effect for the dissolved strings.
