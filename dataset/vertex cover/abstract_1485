The contribution gives an overview of the LCFIVertex package, providing
software tools for high-level event reconstruction at the International Linear
Collider using vertex-detector information. The package was validated using a
fast Monte Carlo simulation. Performance obtained with a more realistic
GEANT4-based detector simulation and realistic tracking code is presented. The
influence of hadronic interactions on flavour tagging is discussed.
