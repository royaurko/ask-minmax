We define a version of a derived chiral De Rham complex over a locally
complete intersection, thereby "chiralizing" a result by Illusie and Bhatt. A
similar construction attaches to a graded ring a dg vertex algebra, which we
prove to be Morita equivalent to a dg algebra of differential operators. For
example, the dg vertex algebra associated to a fat point, which also arises in
the Landau-Ginzburg model, is shown to be derived rational.
