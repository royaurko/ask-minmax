Real and virtual contributions to the quark-initiated forward jet vertex in
QCD are calculated at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy using Lipatov's
effective action, valid in the high energy multi-Regge limit. A regularization
of longitudinal divergencies is proposed which allows for the determination of
jet observables. Agreement with previous results in the literature is found.
