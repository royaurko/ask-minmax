The vertex is constructed for gluon production in interaction of two reggeons
coupled to projectiles and two reggeons coupled to targets. The vertex can be
used to build cross-sections for collisions of two pairs of nucleons in AA
scattering. Transversality of the constructed vertex is demonstrated as well as
its good behaviour at large longitudinal momenta necessary for applications.
Poles at zero values of longitudinal momenta are discussed and it is found that
they remain in the amplitudes unlike in the case of a single projectile.
