The procedure for obtaining integrable open spin chain Hamiltonians via
reflection matrices is explicitly carried out for some three-state vertex
models. We have considered the 19-vertex models of Zamolodchikov-Fateev and
Izergin-Korepin, and the $Z_{2}$-graded 19-vertex models with $sl(2|1)$ and
$osp(1|2)$ invariances. In each case the eigenspectrum is determined by
application of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz.
