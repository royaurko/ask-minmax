Equilibrium crystal shape of oxygen-covered tungsten is followed as a
function of temperature using field ion microscopy. In the vicinity of the
(111) region, at the temperature $970\pm70$ K, the system undergoes a phase
transition from a polyhedral form (sharp edges and sharp vertex) to a rounded
form (sharp edges, rounded vertex).
