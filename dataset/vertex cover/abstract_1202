Wyner's soft-covering lemma is a valuable tool for achievability proofs of
information theoretic security, resolvability, channel synthesis, and source
coding. The result herein sharpens the claim of soft-covering by moving away
from an expected value analysis. Instead, a random codebook is shown to achieve
the soft-covering phenomenon with high probability. The probability of failure
is doubly-exponentially small in the block-length, enabling more powerful
applications through the union bound.
