Matsuo algebras are an algebraic incarnation of 3-transposition groups with a
parameter $\alpha$, where idempotents takes the role of the transpositions. We
show that a large class of idempotents in Matsuo algebras satisfy the Seress
property, making these nonassociative algebras well-behaved analogously to
associative algebras, Jordan algebras and vertex (operator) algebras. We
calculate eigenvalues in the Matsuo algebra of ${\rm Sym}(n)$ for any $\alpha$,
generalising some vertex algebra results for which $\alpha=\frac{1}{4}$.
Finally, in the Matsuo algebra of the root system ${\rm D}_n$, we show $n-3$
conjugacy classes of involutions coming from the Weyl group are in natural
bijection with idempotents in the algebra via their fusion rules.
