Partial cubes are graphs isometrically embeddable into hypercubes. In this
paper it is proved that every cubic, vertex-transitive partial cube is
isomorphic to one of the following graphs: $K_2\, \square \, C_{2n}$, for some
$n\geq 2$, generalized Petersen graph $G(10,3)$, permutahedron, truncated
cuboctahedron, or truncated icosidodecahedron. This complete classification of
cubic, vertex-transitive partial cubes, a family that includes all cubic,
distance-regular partial cubes (Weichsel, 1992), is a generalization of results
of Bre\v{s}ar et. al. from 2004 on cubic mirror graphs, and a contribution to
the classification of all cubic partial cubes.
