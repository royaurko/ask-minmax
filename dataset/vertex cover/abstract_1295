The design, construction and performance of the H1 silicon vertex detector is
described. It consists of two cylindrical layers of double sided, double metal
silicon sensors read out by a custom designed analog pipeline chip. The analog
signals are transmitted by optical fibers to a custom designed ADC board and
are reduced on PowerPC processors. Details of the design and construction are
given and performance figures from the first data taking periods are presented.
