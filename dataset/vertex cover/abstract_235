In ``Rips complexes and covers in the uniform category'' the contributors define,
following James, covering maps of uniform spaces and introduce the concept of
generalized uniform covering maps. Conditions for the existence of universal
uniform covering maps and generalized uniform covering maps are given. This
paper notes that the universal generalized uniform covering map is uniformly
equivalent to the inverse limit of uniform covering maps and is therefore
approximated by uniform covering maps. A characterization of generalized
uniform covering maps that are approximated by uniform covering maps is
provided as well as a characterization of generalized uniform covering maps
that are uniformly equivalent to the inverse limit of uniform covering maps.
Inverse limits of group actions that induce generalized uniform covering maps
are also treated.
