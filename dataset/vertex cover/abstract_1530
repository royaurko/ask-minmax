Let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$. A dominating set of $G$ is a set $S$
of vertices of $G$ so that every vertex of $G$ is either in $S$ or adjacent to
a vertex in $S$. The domination polynomial of $G$ is the polynomial
$D(G,x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} d(G,i) x^{i}$, where $d(G,i)$ is the number of
dominating sets of $G$ of size $i$. In this paper we show that cycles are
determined by their domination polynomials.
