We reformulate, using super worldline formalism, the pinched gluon vertex
operator proposed by Strassler. The pinched vertex operator turns out to be the
product of two gluon vertex operators with the insertion of $\delta$-function
which makes the super distances between them zero. Thus the pinch procedures
turn out to be nothing but the insertions of $\delta$-function. Applying our
formulation to two-loop diagrams which are the QED correction to gluon
scatterings via a single spinor loop, with the QED charge e being replaced by
the strong coupling g, we show various formulae on pinched N-point
functions.
