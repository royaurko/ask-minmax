The Nil geometry, which is one of the eight 3-dimensional Thurston
geometries, can be derived from {W. Heisenberg}'s famous real matrix group.
  The aim of this paper to study {\it lattice coverings} in Nil space. We
introduce the notion of the density of considered coverings and give upper and
lower estimations to it, moreover we formulate a conjecture for the ball
arrangement of the least dense lattice-like geodesic ball covering and give its
covering density $\Delta\approx 1.42900615$.
  The homogeneous 3-spaces have a unified interpretation in the projective
3-sphere and in our work we will use this projective model of the Nil geometry.
