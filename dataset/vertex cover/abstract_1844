We give an algorithm that constructs the Hasse diagram of the face lattice of
a convex polytope P from its vertex-facet incidences in time O(min{n,m}*a*f),
where n is the number of vertices, m is the number of facets, a is the number
of vertex-facet incidences, and f is the total number of faces of P. This
improves results of Fukuda and Rosta (1994), who described an algorithm for
enumerating all faces of a d-polytope in O(min{n,m}*d*f^2) steps. For simple or
simplicial d-polytopes our algorithm can be specialized to run in time
O(d*a*f). Furthermore, applications of the algorithm to other atomic lattices
are discussed, e.g., to face lattices of oriented matroids.
