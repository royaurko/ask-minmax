We propose and analyze a quasirandom analogue of the classical push model for
disseminating information in networks ("randomized rumor spreading"). In the
classical model, in each round each informed vertex chooses a neighbor at
random and informs it, if it was not informed before. It is known that this
simple protocol succeeds in spreading a rumor from one vertex to all others
within O(log n) rounds on complete graphs, hypercubes, random regular graphs,
Erdos-Renyi random graph and Ramanujan graphs with probability 1-o(1). In the
quasirandom model, we assume that each vertex has a (cyclic) list of its
neighbors. Once informed, it starts at a random position on the list, but from
then on informs its neighbors in the order of the list. Surprisingly,
irrespective of the orders of the lists, the above-mentioned bounds still hold.
In some cases, even better bounds than for the classical model can be shown.
