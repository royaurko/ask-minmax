A vertex-colored graph $G$ is {\it rainbow vertex-connected} if any pair of
vertices in $G$ are connected by a path whose internal vertices have distinct
colors, which was introduced by Krivelevich and Yuster. The {\it rainbow
vertex-connection number} of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $rvc(G)$, is the
smallest number of colors that are needed in order to make $G$ rainbow
vertex-connected. In a previous paper we showed that it is NP-Complete to
decide whether a given graph $G$ has $rvc(G)=2$. In this paper we show that for
every integer $k\geq 2$, deciding whether $rvc(G)\leq k$ is NP-Hard. We also
show that for any fixed integer $k\geq 2$, this problem belongs to NP-class,
and so it becomes NP-Complete.
