Semi-infinite forms on the moduli spaces of genus-zero Riemann surfaces with
punctures and local coordinates are introduced. A partial operad for
semi-infinite forms is constructed. Using semi-infinite forms and motivated by
a partial suboperad of the partial operad for semi-infinite forms, topological
vertex partial operads of type $k<0$ and strong topological vertex partial
operads of type $k<0$ are constructed. It is proved that the category of
(locally-)grading-restricted (strong) topological vertex operator algebras of
type $k<0$ and the category of (weakly) meromorphic ${\Bbb Z}\times {\Bbb
Z}$-graded algebras over the (strong) topological vertex partial operad of type
k are isomorphic. As an application of this isomorphism theorem, the following
conjecture of Lian-Zuckerman and Kimura-Voronov-Zuckerman is proved: A strong
topological vertex operator algebra gives a homotopy Gerstenhaber algebra.
These results hold in particular for the tensor product of the moonshine module
vertex operator algebra, the vertex algebra constructed {from} a rank 2 Lorentz
lattice and the ghost vertex operator algebra, studied in detail first by Lian
and Zuckerman.
