In this work we establish a relation between the six-vertex model with Domain
Wall Boundary Conditions (DWBC) and the $XXZ$ spin chain with anti-periodic
twisted boundaries. More precisely, we demonstrate a formal relation between
the zeroes of the partition function of the six-vertex model with DWBC and the
zeroes of the transfer matrix eigenvalues associated with the six-vertex model
with a particular non-diagonal boundary twist.
