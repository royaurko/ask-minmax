Finite covers are a technique for building new structures from simpler ones.
The original motivation to study finite covers is in the Ladder theorem of
Zilber which describes how totally categorical structures are built from
strictly minimal sets by a sequence of covers.
  Let W be a first-order structure and r be an Aut(W)-congruence on W. In this
paper we define the almost-free finite covers of W with respect to r, and we
show how to construct them. These are a generalization of free finite covers. A
consequence of a result of Evans and Hrushovski in the paper "On the
automorphism groups of finite covers" is that any finite cover of W with
binding groups all equal to a simple non-abelian permutation group is
almost-free with respect to some r on W. Our main result gives a description
(up to isomorphism) in terms of the Aut(W)-congruences on W of the kernels of
principal finite covers of W with bindings groups equal at any point to a
simple non-abelian regular permutation group G. Then we analyze almost-free
finite covers of the set of ordered n-tuples of distinct elements from a
countable set Omega, regarded as a structure with automorphism group equal to
the Sym(Omega) and we show a result of biinterpretability.
