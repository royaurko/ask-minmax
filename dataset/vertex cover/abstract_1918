We define a class of $Y(sl_{(m|n)})$ Yangian invariant Haldane-Shastry (HS)
like spin chains, by assuming that their partition functions can be written in
a particular form in terms of the super Schur polynomials. Using some
properties of the super Schur polynomials, we show that the partition functions
of this class of spin chains are equivalent to the partition functions of a
class of one-dimensional vertex models with appropriately defined energy
functions. We also establish a boson-fermion duality relation for the partition
functions of this class of supersymmetric HS like spin chains by using their
correspondence with one-dimensional vertex models.
