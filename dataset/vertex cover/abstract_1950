A ball-polyhedron is the intersection with non-empty interior of finitely
many (closed) unit balls in Euclidean 3-space. One can represent the boundary
of a ball-polyhedron as the union of vertices, edges, and faces defined in a
rather natural way. A ball-polyhedron is called a simple ball-polyhedron if at
every vertex exactly three edges meet. Moreover, a ball-polyhedron is called a
standard ball-polyhedron if its vertex-edge-face structure is a lattice (with
respect to containment). To each edge of a ball-polyhedron one can assign an
inner dihedral angle and say that the given ball-polyhedron is locally rigid
with respect to its inner dihedral angles if the vertex-edge-face structure of
the ball-polyhedron and its inner dihedral angles determine the ball-polyhedron
up to congruence locally. The main result of this paper is a Cauchy-type
rigidity theorem for ball-polyhedra stating that any simple and standard
ball-polyhedron is locally rigid with respect to its inner dihedral angles.
