We prove the existence and associativity of the nonmeromorphic operator
product expansion for an infinite family of vertex operator algebras, the
triplet W-algebras, using results from P(z)-tensor product theory. While doing
this, we also show that all these vertex operator algebras are C_2-cofinite.
