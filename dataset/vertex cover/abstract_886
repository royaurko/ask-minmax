Brane-like states are defined by physical vertex operators in NSR superstring
theory, existing at nonzero pictures only. These states exist both in open and
closed string theories, in the NS and NS-NS sectors respectively. In this paper
we present a detailed analysis of their BRST properties, giving a proof that
these vertex operators are physical, i.e. BRST invariant and BRST non-trivial.
