We calculate the HQET quark-gluon vertex at one loop, for arbitrary external
momenta, in an arbitrary covariant gauge and space-time dimension. Relevant
results and algorithms for the three-point HQET integrals are presented. We
also show how one can obtain the HQET limit directly from QCD results for the
quark-gluon vertex.
