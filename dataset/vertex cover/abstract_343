Let $K$ be a differential field over $\C$ with derivation $D$, $G$ a finite
linear automorphism group over $K$ which preserves $D$, and $K^G$ the fixed
point subfield of $K$ under the action of $G$. We show that every
finite-dimensional vertex algebra $K^G$-module is contained in some twisted
vertex algebra $K$-module.
