The usual vertex algebras have as underlying symmetry the Hopf algebra
$H_D=\mathbb C[D]$ of infinitesimal translations. We show that it is possible
to replace $H_D$ by another symmetry algebra $H_T=\mathbb C[T,T\inv]$, the
group algebra of the Abelian group generated by $T$. $H_T$ is the algebra of
symmetries of a lattice of rank 1, and the construction gives a class of vertex
algebras related to the Infinite Toda Lattice in the same way as the usual
$H_D$-vertex algebras are related to Korteweg-de Vries hierarchies.
