We give the operadic formulation of (weak, strong) topological vertex
algebras, which are variants of topological vertex operator algebras studied
recently by Lian and Zuckerman. As an application, we obtain a conceptual and
geometric construction of the Batalin-Vilkovisky algebraic structure (or the
Gerstenhaber algebra structure) on the cohomology of a topological vertex
algebra (or of a weak topological vertex algebra) by combining this operadic
formulation with a theorem of Getzler (or of Cohen) which formulates
Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras (or Gerstenhaber algebras) in terms of the homology
of the framed little disk operad (or of the little disk operad).
