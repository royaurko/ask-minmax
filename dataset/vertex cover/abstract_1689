Let A be a basic finite dimensional and connected algebra over an
algebraically closed field k with zero characteristic. If the ordinary quiver
of A has no double bypasses, we show that A admits a Galois covering which
satisfies a universal property with respect to the Galois coverings of A. This
universal property is similar to the one of the universal cover of a connected
topological space.
