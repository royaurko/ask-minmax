We compute all genus topological amplitudes on configurations of ruled
surfaces obtained by resolving lines of D-E singularities in compact Calabi-Yau
threefolds. We find that our results are in agreement with genus zero mirror
symmetry calculations, which is further evidence for the ruled vertex formalism
for degenerate torus actions.
