Given a sequence of undirected connected graphs $G_n$ of $m_n$ vertices with
bounded degrees and weights and an additional sequence of killing parameters
$c_n$, one can define a sequence $\mu_n$ of natural non-normalized measures of
non-trivial loops on $G_n$. Denote by $Q_n$ the transition matrix associated
with $G_n$. Assuming that the empirical distributions $\nu_n$ of the
eigenvalues of $Q_n$ converge, the main result is the determination of the
limit of the $\mu_n-$proportion of loops which cover every vertex as
$n\rightarrow\infty$. Let $\mathcal{L}_n$ be the Poissonian "loop soup" with
intensity $\frac{\mu_n}{m_n}$. A corollary of the main result is the limit law
of the number of the loops covering the whole graph. This paper also gives a
criterion for the convergence of the empirical distributions of the eigenvalues
of the transition matrices and states that modifications on the weights on a
small number of edges of $G_n$ do not change the limit mentioned above. Several
examples of graphs are analysed at the end of the paper.
