A domino covering of a board is saturated if no domino is redundant. We
introduce the concept of a fragment tiling and show that a minimal fragment
tiling always corresponds to a maximal saturated domino covering. The size of a
minimal fragment tiling is the domination number of the board. We define a
class of regular boards and show that for these boards the domination number
gives the size of a minimal X-pentomino covering. Natural sequences that count
maximal saturated domino coverings of square and rectangular boards are
obtained. These include the new sequences A193764, A193765, A193766, A193767,
and A193768 of OEIS.
