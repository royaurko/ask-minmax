We investigate a neutrino mass model in which the neutrino data is accounted
for by bilinear R-parity violating supersymmetry with anomaly mediated
supersymmetry breaking. We focus on the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
phenomenology, studying the reach of generic supersymmetry search channels with
leptons, missing energy and jets. A special feature of this model is the
existence of long lived neutralinos and charginos which decay inside the
detector leading to detached vertices. We demonstrate that the largest reach is
obtained in the displaced vertices channel and that practically all of the
reasonable parameter space will be covered with an integrated luminosity of 10
fb-1. We also compare the displaced vertex reaches of the LHC and Tevatron.
