It is well-known that a complete Riemannian manifold M which is locally
isometric to a symmetric space is covered by a symmetric space. Here we prove
that a discrete version of this property (called local to global rigidity)
holds for a large class of vertex-transitive graphs, including Cayley graphs of
torsion-free lattices in simple Lie groups, and Cayley graph of torsion-free
virtually nilpotent groups. By contrast, we exhibit various examples of Cayley
graphs of finitely presented groups (e.g. $PGL(5,Z)$) which fail to have this
property, answering a question of Benjamini, Ellis, and Georgakopoulos.
  Answering a question of Cornulier, we also construct a continuum of non
pairwise isometric large-scale simply connected locally finite
vertex-transitive graphs. This question was motivated by the fact that
large-scale simply connected Cayley graphs are precisely Cayley graphs of
finitely presented groups and therefore have countably many isometric classes.
