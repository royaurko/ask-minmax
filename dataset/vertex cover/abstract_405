A graph of order $n$ is $p$-factor-critical, where $p$ is an integer of the
same parity as $n$, if the removal of any set of $p$ vertices results in a
graph with a perfect matching. 1-Factor-critical graphs and 2-factor-critical
graphs are factor-critical graphs and bicritical graphs, respectively. It is
well known that every connected vertex-transitive graph of odd order is
factor-critical and every connected non-bipartite vertex-transitive graph of
even order is bicritical. In this paper, we show that a simple connected
vertex-transitive graph of odd order at least 5 is 3-factor-critical if and
only if it is not a cycle.
