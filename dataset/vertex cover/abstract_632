Suppose that Y is a cyclic cover of projective space branched over a
hyperplane arrangement D, and that U is the complement of the ramification
locus in Y. The first theorem implies that the Beilinson-Hodge conjecture holds
for U if certain multiplicities of D are coprime to the degree of the cover.
For instance this applies when D is reduced with normal crossings. The second
theorem shows that when D has normal crossings and the degree of the cover is a
prime number, the generalized Hodge conjecture holds for any toroidal
resolution of Y. The last section contains some partial extensions to more
general nonabelian covers.
