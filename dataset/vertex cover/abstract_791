We analyze open string vertex operators describing connection gauge fields
for spin 3 in Vasiliev's frame-like formalism and perform their extended BRST
analysis. Gauge symmetry transformations, generalized zero torsion constraints
relating extra fields to the dynamical frame-like field and relation between
dynamical frame-like field and fully symmetric Fronsdal's field for spin 3 are
all realized in terms of BRST constraints on these vertex operators in string
theory. Using the construction, we analyze the 3-point correlator for spin 3
field and calculate Chern-Simons type cubic interactions described by
3-derivative Berends-Burgers-van Dam (BBD) type vertex in the frame-like
formalism.
