In this paper, we study the covering theory of laura algebras. We prove that
if a connected laura algebra is standard (that is, it is not quasi-tilted of
canonical type and its connecting components are standard), then this algebra
has nice Galois coverings associated to the coverings of the connecting
component. As a consequence, we show that the first Hochschild cohomology group
of a standard laura algebra vanishes if and only if it has no proper Galois
coverings.
