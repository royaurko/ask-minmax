We classify graphs and, more generally, finite relational structures that are
identified by C2, that is, two-variable first-order logic with counting. Using
this classification, we show that it can be decided in almost linear time
whether a structure is identified by C2. Our classification implies that for
every graph identified by this logic, all vertex-colored versions of it are
also identified. A similar statement is true for finite relational structures.
  We provide constructions that solve the inversion problem for finite
structures in linear time. This problem has previously been shown to be
polynomial time solvable by Martin Otto. For graphs, we conclude that every
C2-equivalence class contains a graph whose orbits are exactly the classes of
the C2-partition of its vertex set and which has a single automorphism
witnessing this fact.
  For general k, we show that such statements are not true by providing
examples of graphs of size linear in k which are identified by C3 but for which
the orbit partition is strictly finer than the Ck-partition. We also provide
identified graphs which have vertex-colored versions that are not identified by
Ck.
