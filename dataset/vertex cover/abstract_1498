In this paper, several discrete schemes for Gaussian curvature are surveyed.
The convergence property of a modified discrete scheme for the Gaussian
curvature is considered. Furthermore, a new discrete scheme for Gaussian
curvature is resented. We prove that the new scheme converges at the regular
vertex with valence not less than 5. By constructing a counterexample, we also
show that it is impossible for building a discrete scheme for Gaussian
curvature which converges over the regular vertex with valence 4. Finally,
asymptotic errors of several discrete scheme for Gaussian curvature are
compared.
