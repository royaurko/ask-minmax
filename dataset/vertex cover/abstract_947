A propeller graph is obtained from an $\infty$-graph by attaching a path to
the vertex of degree four, where an $\infty$-graph consists of two cycles with
precisely one common vertex. In this paper, we prove that all propeller graphs
are determined by their Laplacian spectra as well as their signless Laplacian
spectra.
