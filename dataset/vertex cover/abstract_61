In this article we show how to construct hierarchies of partial differential
equations from the vertex operator representations of toroidal Lie algebras. In
the smallest example - rank 2 toroidal cover of $sl_2$ - we obtain an extension
of the KdV hierarchy. We use the action of the corresponding
infinite-dimensional group to construct solutions for these non-linear PDEs.
