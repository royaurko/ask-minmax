The identical relations among the transverse parts of variant vertex
functions are derived by computing the curl of the time-ordered products of
three-point Green functions involving the vector, the axial-vector and the
tensor current operators, respectively. These transverse relations are coupled
each other. Combining these transverse relations with the normal (longitudinal)
Ward-Takahashi identities forms a complete set of constraint relations for
three-point vertex functions. As a consequence, the full vector, the full
axial-vector and the full tensor vertex functions in the momentum space are
exactly obtained.
