It is typical for a semi-infinite cohomology complex associated with a graded
Lie algebra to occur as a vertex operator (or chiral) superalgebra where all
the standard operators of cohomology theory, in particular the differential,
are modes of vertex operators (fields). Although vertex operator superalgebras
-with the inherent Virasoro action- are regarded as part of Conformal Field
Theory (CFT), a VOSA may exhibit a square-zero operator (often, but not always,
the semi-infinite cohomology differential) for which the Virasoro algebra acts
trivially in the cohomology. Capable of shedding its CFT features, such a VOSA
is called a ``topological chiral algebra'' (TCA). We investigate the
semi-infinite cohomology of the vertex operator Weil algebra and indicate a
number of differentials which give rise to TCA structures.
