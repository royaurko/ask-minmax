It is know that most of the clouds producing associated absorption in the
spectra of AGNs and quasars do not completely cover the background source
(continuum + broad emission line region, BLR). We note that the covering factor
derived for the absorption is the fraction of photons occulted by the absorbing
clouds, and is not necessarily the same as the fractional area covered. We show
that the variability in absorption lines can be produced by the changes in the
covering factor caused by the variation in the continuum and the finite light
travel time across the BLR. We discuss how such a variability can be
distinguished from the variability caused by other effects and how one can use
the variability in the covering factor to probe the BLR.
