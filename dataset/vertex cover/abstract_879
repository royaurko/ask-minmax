We study chiral symmetry breaking in quenched QED$_4$, using a vertex Ansatz
recently proposed by Curtis and Pennington. Bifurcation analysis is employed to
establish the existence of a critical coupling and to estimate its value. The
main results are in qualitative agreement with the ladder approximation, the
numerical changes being minor.
