Local field potentials (LFPs) sampled with extracellular electrodes are
frequently used as a measure of population neuronal activity. However, relating
such measurements to underlying neuronal behaviour and connectivity is
non-trivial. To help study this link, we developed the Virtual Electrode
Recording Tool for EXtracellular potentials (VERTEX). We first identified a
reduced neuron model that retained the spatial and frequency filtering
characteristics of extracellular potentials from neocortical neurons. We then
developed VERTEX as an easy-to-use Matlab tool for simulating LFPs from large
populations (>100 000 neurons). A VERTEX-based simulation successfully
reproduced features of the LFPs from an in vitro multi-electrode array
recording of macaque neocortical tissue. Our model, with virtual electrodes
placed anywhere in 3D, allows direct comparisons with the in vitro recording
setup. We envisage that VERTEX will stimulate experimentalists, clinicians, and
computational neuroscientists to use models to understand the mechanisms
underlying measured brain dynamics in health and disease.
