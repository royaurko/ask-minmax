Given a configuration of pebbles on the vertices of a graph, a pebbling move
is defined by removing two pebbles from some vertex and placing one pebble on
an adjacent vertex. The cover pebbling number of a graph is the smallest number
of pebbles necessary so that through a sequence of pebbling moves, a pebble can
eventually be placed on every vertex simultaneously, no matter how the pebbles
are initially distributed. We determine Bose Einstein and Maxwell Boltzmann
cover pebbling thresholds for the complete graph. Also, we show that the cover
pebbling decision problem is NP-complete.
