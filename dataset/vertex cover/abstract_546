We construct an iterative procedure to compute the vertex operators of the
closed superstring in the covariant formalism given a solution of IIA/IIB
supergravity. The manifest supersymmetry allows us to construct vertex
operators for any generic background in presence of Ramond-Ramond (RR) fields.
We extend the procedure to all massive states of open and closed superstrings
and we identify two new nilpotent charges which are used to impose the gauge
fixing on the physical states. We solve iteratively the equations of the vertex
for linear x-dependent RR field strengths. This vertex plays a role in studying
non-constant C-deformations of superspace. Finally, we construct an action for
the free massless sector of closed strings, and we propose a form for the
kinetic term for closed string field theory in the pure spinor formalism.
