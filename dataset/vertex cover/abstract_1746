We exhibit a connection between two constructions of twisted modules for a
general vertex operator algebra with respect to inner automorphisms. We also
study pseudo-derivations, pseudo-endomorphisms, and twist deformations of
ordinary modules by pseudo-endomorphisms, which are intrinsically connected to
one of the two constructions.
