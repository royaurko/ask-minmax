Given a vertex Lie algebra $\mathscr L$ equipped with an action by
automorphisms of a cyclic group $\Gamma$, we define spaces of cyclotomic
coinvariants over the Riemann sphere. These are quotients of tensor products of
smooth modules over `local' Lie algebras $\mathsf L(\mathscr L)_{z_i}$ assigned
to marked points $z_i$, by the action of a `global' Lie algebra ${\mathsf
L}^{\Gamma}_{\{z_i \}}(\mathscr L)$ of $\Gamma$-equivariant functions.
  On the other hand, the universal enveloping vertex algebra $\mathbb V
(\mathscr L)$ of $\mathscr L$ is itself a vertex Lie algebra with an induced
action of $\Gamma$. This gives `big' analogs of the Lie algebras above. From
these we construct the space of `big' cyclotomic coinvariants, i.e.
coinvariants with respect to ${\mathsf L}^{\Gamma}_{\{z_i \}}(\mathbb
V(\mathscr L))$. We prove that these two definitions of cyclotomic coinvariants
in fact coincide, provided the origin is included as a marked point. As a
corollary we prove a result on the functoriality of cyclotomic coinvariants
which we require for the solution of cyclotomic Gaudin models in
arXiv:1409.6937.
  At the origin, which is fixed by $\Gamma$, one must assign a module over the
stable subalgebra $\mathsf L(\mathscr L)^{\Gamma}$ of $\mathsf L(\mathscr L)$.
This module becomes a $\mathbb V(\mathscr L)$-quasi-module in the sense of Li.
As a bi-product we obtain an iterate formula for such quasi-modules.
