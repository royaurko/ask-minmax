In a multilevel database, cover stories are usually managed using the
ambiguous technique of polyinstantiation. In this paper, we define a new
technique to manage cover stories and propose a formal representation of a
multilevel database containing cover stories. Our model aims to be a generic
model, that is, it can be interpreted for any kind of database (e.g.
relational, object- oriented etc). We then consider the problem of updating a
multilevel database containing cover stories managed with our technique.
