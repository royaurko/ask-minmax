A characterization of vertex operator algebra $V_L^+$ for any rank one
positive definite even lattice $L$ is given in terms of dimensions of
homogeneous subspaces of small weights. This result reduces the classification
of rational vertex operator algebras of central charge 1 to the
characterization of three vertex operator algebras in the $E$-series of central
charge one.
