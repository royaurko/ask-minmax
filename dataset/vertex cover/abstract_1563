We characterize the rank of edge connection matrices of partition functions
of real vertex models, as the dimension of the homogeneous components of the
algebra of $G$-invariant tensors. Here $G$ is the sub- group of the real
orthogonal group that stabilizes the vertex model. This answers a question of
Bal\'azs Szegedy from 2007.
