Molecular dynamics calculations of the fluctuation of bond vibration revealed
the shell-resolved kinetics of surface melting of closed-shelled cluster
containing 147atoms with Lennard-Jones type interaction. It is found that the
surface melting is imitated by the migrating of the vertex atoms and the
melting process can be divided into three major stages, i.e., vertex migrating,
surface melting, and general melting. Although the melting process of the LJ147
cluster could be divided into discrete stages of shell-by-shell surface
melting, in general, there is still a continuous process of melting from the
surface to the core interior.
