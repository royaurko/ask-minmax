The $Z^0 \to b\bar b$ width, $\Gamma_b$, is analysed in conjunction with the
total and hadronic $Z^0$ widths, $\Gamma_T$ and $\Gamma_h$. Assuming,
tentatively, that the present 2$\sigma$ discrepancy in $\Gamma_b$ will
substantiate as time goes on, for large values of $m_H$ it will be sufficient
to modify the $Z^0 b \bar b$ vertex only. In contrast, for small values of
$m_H$, the theoretical predictions for both the $Z^0$ width into light quarks
and leptons as well as the $Z^0 \to b\bar b$ vertex will have to be modified.
