For finite sequence $\underbar{\em d}$ of positive integers, we consider
graphs that have $\underbar{\em d}$ as their list of vertex degrees, and
bipartite graphs for which each part has $\underbar{\em d}$ as its list of
vertex degrees. In particular, we make a connection between a result for
bipartite graphs by Alon, Ben-Shimon and Krivelevich and a result of Zverovich
and Zverovich for graphs, and we give an improvement of a result of Zverovich
and Zverovich. We show that the bipartite graphs with vertex degree sequences
$(\underbar{\em d},\underbar{\em d}\,)$ are in one to one correspondence with
graphs with loops with reduced degree sequence $\underbar{\em d}$, where the
reduced degree of a vertex is defined to be the number of edges incident to the
vertex, with loops counted only once. We also give two Erd\H{o}s--Gallai type
theorems for graphs with loops.
