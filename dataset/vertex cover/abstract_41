In this paper we give upper bounds on the number of minimal separators and
potential maximal cliques of graphs w.r.t. two graph parameters, namely vertex
cover ($\operatorname{vc}$) and modular width ($\operatorname{mw}$). We prove
that for any graph, the number of minimal separators is
$\mathcal{O}^*(3^{\operatorname{vc}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}^*(1.6181^{\operatorname{mw}})$, and the number of potential
maximal cliques is $\mathcal{O}^*(4^{\operatorname{vc}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}^*(1.7347^{\operatorname{mw}})$, and these objects can be listed
within the same running times. (The $\mathcal{O}^*$ notation suppresses
polynomial factors in the size of the input.) Combined with known results, we
deduce that a large family of problems, e.g., Treewidth, Minimum Fill-in,
Longest Induced Path, Feedback vertex set and many others, can be solved in
time $\mathcal{O}^*(4^{\operatorname{vc}})$ or
$\mathcal{O}^*(1.7347^{\operatorname{mw}})$.
