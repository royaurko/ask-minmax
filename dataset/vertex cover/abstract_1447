Let V be a vertex operator algebra and m,n be nonnegative integers. We
construct an A_n(V)-A_m(V)-bimodule A_{n,m}(V) which determines the action of V
from the level m subspace to level n subspace of an admissible V-module. We
show how to use A_{n,m}(V) to construct naturally admissible V-modules from
A_m(V)-modules. We also determine the structure of A_{n,m}(V) when V is
rational.
