In this article we present a high-precision evaluation of the expansions in
$\e=(4-d)/2$ of (up to) four-loop scalar vacuum master integrals, using the
method of difference equations developed by S. Laporta. We cover the complete
set of `QED-type' master integrals, i.e. those with a single mass scale only
(i.e. $m_i\in\{0,m\}$) and an even number of massive lines at each vertex.
Furthermore, we collect all that is known analytically about four-loop
`QED-type' masters, as well as about {\em all} single-mass-scale vacuum
integrals at one-, two- and three-loop order.
