We present a complete study of the one graviton-two neutral gauge bosons
vertex at 1-loop level in the electroweak theory. This vertex provides the
leading contribution to the interaction between the Standard Model and gravity,
mediated by the trace anomaly, at first order in the inverse Planck mass and at
second order in the electroweak expansion. At the same time, these corrections
are significant for precision studies of models with low scale gravity at the
LHC. We show, in analogy with previous results in the QED and QCD cases, that
the anomalous interaction between gravity and the gauge current of the Standard
Model, due to the trace anomaly, is mediated, in each gauge invariant sector,
by effective massless scalar degrees of freedom. We derive the Ward and
Slavnov-Taylor identities characterizing the vertex. Our analysis includes the
contributions from the improvements of the scalar sector, induced by a
conformally coupled Higgs sector in curved space.
