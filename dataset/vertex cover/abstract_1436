We describe a logarithmic tensor product theory for certain module categories
for a ``conformal vertex algebra.'' In this theory, which is a natural,
although intricate, generalization of earlier work of Huang and Lepowsky, we do
not require the module categories to be semisimple, and we accommodate modules
with generalized weight spaces. The corresponding intertwining operators
contain logarithms of the variables.
