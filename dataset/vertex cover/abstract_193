In Two Higgs doublet extensions of the Standard Model, flavor-changing
neutral current constraints can be addressed by introducing a U(1)' gauge
symmetry, under which the Higgs doublets carry different charges. That scenario
implies the presence of a H^\pm W^\mp Z' vertex at tree level. For the light
"dark" Z model (Z'=Z_d) with m_{Z_d} < 10 GeV, such a coupling leads to the
dominant decay mode H^\pm \to W^\pm + Z_d (for m_{H^\pm} \lsim 175 GeV), rather
than the usual type I model decay H^\pm \to \tau^\pm \nu, for a broad range of
parameters. We find that current analyses do not place significant bounds on
this scenario. Over much of the parameter space considered, the decay of a
pair-produced t ({\bar t}) into H^+ b (H^- {\bar b}) provides the dominant
H^\pm production. Analysis of available LHC data can likely cover significant
ranges of our parameters, if Z_d \to \mu^+\mu^- has a branching ratio of \sim
20%. If the Z_d decays mainly invisibly then probing the entire relevant
parameter space would likely require additional data from future LHC runs. We
briefly discuss the phenomenology for m_{H^\pm}\gsim 175 GeV.
