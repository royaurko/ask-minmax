Let $G$ be a graph. A set $S$ of vertices in $G$ dominates the graph if every
vertex of $G$ is either in $S$ or a neighbor of a vertex in $S$. Finding a
minimal cardinality set which dominates the graph is an NP-complete problem.
The graph $G$ is well-dominated if all its minimal dominating sets are of the
same cardinality. The complexity status of recognizing well-dominated graphs is
not known. We show that recognizing well-dominated graphs can be done
polynomially for graphs without cycles of lengths $4$ and $5$, by proving that
a graph belonging to this family is well-dominated if and only if it is
well-covered.
  Assume that a weight function $w$ is defined on the vertices of $G$. Then $G$
is $w$-well-dominated} if all its minimal dominating sets are of the same
weight. We prove that the set of weight functions $w$ such that $G$ is
$w$-well-dominated is a vector space, and denote that vector space by $WWD(G)$.
We prove that $WWD(G)$ is a subspace of $WCW(G)$, the vector space of weight
functions $w$ such that $G$ is $w$-well-covered. We provide a polynomial
characterization of $WWD(G)$ for the case that $G$ does not contain cycles of
lengths $4$, $5$, and $6$.
