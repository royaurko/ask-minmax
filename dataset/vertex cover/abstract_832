We present the calculation of the forward jet vertex associated to a rapidity
gap (coupling of a hard pomeron to the jet) in the BFKL formalism at
next-to-leading order (NLO). Real emission contributions are computed via
Lipatov's effective action. The NLO jet vertex turns out to be finite within
collinear factorization and allows, together with the NLO non-forward gluon
Green's function, to perform NLO studies of jet production in diffractive
events (e.g. Mueller-Tang dijets).
