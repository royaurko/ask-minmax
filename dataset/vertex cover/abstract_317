Starting with a new bosonization scheme for the \beta\gamma CFT of the
super-conformal ghosts, vertex operators are constructed for massless open
string states in the intersecting D-brane world. These vertex operators satisfy
all requirements for a consistent RNS formulation of superstring theories, so
GSO projections can be properly taken.
