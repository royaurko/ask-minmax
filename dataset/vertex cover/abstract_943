We prove that Vertex Reinforced Random Walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ with weight of
order $k^\alpha$, with $\alpha\in [0,1/2)$, is either almost surely recurrent
or almost surely transient. This improves a previous result of Volkov who
showed that the set of sites which are visited infinitely often was a.s. either
empty or infinite.
