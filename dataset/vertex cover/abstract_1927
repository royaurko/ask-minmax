We consider a generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a power
nonlinearity |\psi|^2\mu\psi, of focusing type, describing propagation on the
ramified structure given by N edges connected at a vertex (a star graph). To
model the interaction at the junction, it is there imposed a boundary condition
analogous to the \delta potential of strength \alpha on the line, including as
a special case (\alpha=0) the free propagation. We show that nonlinear
stationary states describing solitons sitting at the vertex exist both for
attractive (\alpha<0, representing a potential well) and repulsive (\alpha>0, a
potential barrier) interaction. In the case of sufficiently strong attractive
interaction at the vertex and power nonlinearity \mu<2, including the standard
cubic case, we characterize the ground state as minimizer of a constrained
action and we discuss its orbital stability. Finally we show that in the free
case, for even N only, the stationary states can be used to construct traveling
waves on the graph.
