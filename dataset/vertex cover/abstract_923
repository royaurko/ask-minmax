We study vertex algebras and their modules associated with possibly
degenerate even lattices, using an approach somewhat different from others.
Several known results are recovered and a number of new results are obtained.
We also study modules for Heisenberg algebras and we classify irreducible
modules satisfying certain conditions and obtain a complete reducibility
theorem.
