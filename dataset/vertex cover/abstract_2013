Neutrinos are one of the least known elementary particles. The detection of
neutrinos is an extremely difficult task since they are affected only by weak
sub-atomic force or gravity. Therefore large detectors are constructed to
reveal neutrino's properties. Among them the Liquid Argon Time Projection
Chamber (LAr-TPC) detectors provide excellent imaging and particle
identification ability for studying neutrinos. The computerized methods for
automatic reconstruction and identification of particles are needed to fully
exploit the potential of the LAr-TPC technique. Herein, the novel method for
electron neutrino classification is presented. The method constructs a feature
descriptor from images of observed event. It characterizes the signal
distribution propagated from vertex of interest, where the particle interacts
with the detector medium. The classifier is learned with a constructed feature
descriptor to decide whether the images represent the electron neutrino or
cascade produced by photons. The proposed approach assumes that the position of
primary interaction vertex is known. The method's performance in dependency to
the noise in a primary vertex position and deposited energy of particles is
studied.
