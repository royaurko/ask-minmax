In the recent vast increase of available real world networks it became clear
that while biological/physical networks on the one hand and social networks on
the other hand may have the same degree sequences, they are very different
indeed: one good measure for this is their assortativity. The need to
successfully generate graphs with different prescribed parameters initiated
several models. One of the earliest is the Joint Degree Matrix model: the
vertices of the graphs are partitioned by their predetermined degrees and for
each pair of vertex classes the number of the edges between the classes in the
realizations is prescribed. The JDM model is able to handle the differences in
assortativity of the different type of real world networks of any given degree
sequence.
  There is a natural way to generalize this approach: the Partition Adjacency
Matrix (PAM) model. Here the vertices with given degree sequence are
partitioned, independent from their degree, and for each pair of vertex classes
the number of edges between the classes in the realizations is prescribed. In
this paper we study a closely related notion: the skeleton graph. It carries
all the data of a PAM, but it is much more comfortable when there is a
relatively small number of vertex pairs with non-zero prescribed edge number.
This notion will be used for two particular structures: realizations with two
vertex classes and prescribed number of edges between the classes, and skeleton
graphs with at most one cycle in every component.
