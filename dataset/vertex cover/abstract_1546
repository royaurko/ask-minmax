The high resolution of the LHCb vertex detector makes it possible to perform
precise measurements of the vertex positions of beam-gas and beam-beam
interactions. With these measurements beam parameters such as width and
position can be measured. A novel method for determining the absolute
luminosity at the LHC using the directly measured beam parameters is presented.
The data taken in 2009 is used to illustrate the procedure.
