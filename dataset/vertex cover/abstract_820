Let $G$ be a finite simple graph on a vertex set $V(G)=\{x_{11}, \ldots,
x_{n1}\}$. Also let $m_1, \ldots,m_n \geq 2$ be integers and $G_1, \ldots, G_n$
be connected simple graphs on the vertex sets $V(G_i)=\{x_{i1}, \ldots,
x_{im_i}\}$. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on
$G_1, \ldots, G_n$ for which the graph obtained by attaching $G_i$ to $G$ is
unmixed or vertex decomposable. Then we characterize Cohen--Macaulay and
sequentially Cohen--Macaulay graphs obtained by attaching the cycle graphs or
connected chordal graphs to an arbitrary graphs.
