The form factors and the coupling constants in the $B^{\ast}B^{\ast}\rho$
vertex are evaluated in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. The
correlation functions responsible for the form factors are evaluated
considering contributions of both $B^{\ast}$ and $\rho$ mesons as off-shell
states. The obtained numerical results for the coupling constants are in
agreement with light-cone QCD sum rules calculations.
