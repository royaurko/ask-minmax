By means of an algebraic Bethe ansatz approach we study the
Zamolodchikov-Fateev and Izergin-Korepin vertex models with non-diagonal
boundaries, characterized by reflection matrices with an upper triangular form.
Generalized Bethe vectors are used to diagonalize the associated transfer
matrix. The eigenvalues as well as the Bethe equations are presented.
