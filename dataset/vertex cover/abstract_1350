The values of the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix are
constrained by direct and indirect measurements. A fit to experimental data and
theory calculations allows the indirect determination of the vertex and angles
of the unitarity triangle as: rho = 0.18 +/- 0.07 eta = 0.35 +/- 0.05 sin
2alpha = 0.14 +0.25 -0.38 sin 2beta = 0.73 +/- 0.07 gamma = 63 +8 -11 degrees.
Information is derived on the presence of CP violation in the matrix, on
non-perturbative QCD parameters and on the Bs oscillation frequency.
