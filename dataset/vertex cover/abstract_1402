A self-consistent treatment of two and three point functions in models with
trilinear interactions forces them to have opposite anomalous dimensions. We
indicate how the anomalous dimension can be extracted nonperturbatively by
solving and suitably truncating the topologies of the full set of
Dyson-Schwinger equations. The first step requires a sensible ansatz for the
full vertex part which conforms to first order perturbation theory at least. We
model this vertex to obtain typical transcendental equations between anomalous
dimension and coupling constant $g$ which coincide with know results to order
$g^4$.
