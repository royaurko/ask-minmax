The tempered fundamental group of a p-adic analytic space classifies
coverings that are dominated by a topological covering (for the Berkovich
topology) of a finite etale covering of the space. Here we construct
cospecialization homomorphisms between (p') versions of the tempered
fundamental groups of the fibers of a smooth family of curves with semistable
reduction. To do so, we will translate our problem in terms of cospecialization
morphisms of fundamental groups of the log fibers of the log reduction. In
particular, we will have to study invariance of the geometric log fundamental
group of saturated log smooth log schemes over a log point by change of log
point.
