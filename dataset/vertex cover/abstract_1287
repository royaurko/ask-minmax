SPIRES is the largest database of scientific papers in the subject field of
high energy and nuclear physics. It contains information on the citation graph
of more than half a million of papers (vertexes of the citation graph). We
outline the EqRank algorithm designed to cluster vertexes of directed graphs,
and present the results of EqRank application to the SPIRES citation graph. The
hierarchical clustering of SPIRES yielded by EqRank is used to set up a web
service, which is also outlined.
