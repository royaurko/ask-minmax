Motivated by the correspondence between the vertex and IRF models in
statistical mechanics, we define and study a notion of vertex-IRF
transformation for dynamical twists that generalizes a usual gauge
transformation. We use vertex-IRF transformations to quantize all completely
degenerate dynamical r-matrices on finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
