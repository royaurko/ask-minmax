This article is a continuation of our work on the classification of
holomorphic framed vertex operator algebras of central charge 24. We show that
a holomorphic framed VOA of central charge 24 is uniquely determined by the Lie
algebra structure of its weight one subspace. As a consequence, we completely
classify all holomorphic framed vertex operator algebras of central charge 24
and show that there exist exactly 56 such vertex operator algebras, up to
isomorphism.
