A vertex-algebraic analogue of the Lie algebroid complex is constructed,
which generalizes the "small" chiral de Rham complex on smooth manifolds. The
notion of VSA-inductive sheaves is also introduced. This notion generalizes
that of sheaves of vertex superalgebras. The complex mentioned above is
constructed as a VSA-inductive sheaf. With this complex, the equivariant Lie
algebroid cohomology is generalized to a vertex-algebraic analogue, which we
call the chiral equivariant Lie algebroid cohomology. In fact, the notion of
the equivariant Lie algebroid cohomology contains that of the equivariant
Poisson cohomology. Thus the chiral equivariant Lie algebroid cohomology is
also a vertex-algebraic generalization of the equivariant Poisson cohomology. A
special kind of complex is introduced and its properties are studied in detail.
With these properties, some isomorphisms of cohomologies are developed, which
enables us to compute the chiral equivariant Lie algebroid cohomology in some
cases. Poisson-Lie groups are considered as such a special case.
