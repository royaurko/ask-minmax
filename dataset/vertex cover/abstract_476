In this paper, we continue the study on toroidal vertex algebras initiated in
\cite{LTW}, to study concrete toroidal vertex algebras associated to toroidal
Lie algebra $L_{r}(\hat{\frak{g}})=\hat{\frak{g}}\otimes L_r$, where
$\hat{\frak{g}}$ is an untwisted affine Lie algebra and
$L_r=$\mathbb{C}[t_{1}^{\pm 1},\ldots,t_{r}^{\pm 1}]$. We first construct an
$(r+1)$-toroidal vertex algebra $V(T,0)$ and show that the category of
restricted $L_{r}(\hat{\frak{g}})$-modules is canonically isomorphic to that of
$V(T,0)$-modules.Let $c$ denote the standard central element of
$\hat{\frak{g}}$ and set $S_c=U(L_r(\mathbb{C}c))$. We furthermore study a
distinguished subalgebra of $V(T,0)$, denoted by $V(S_c,0)$. We show that
(graded) simple quotient toroidal vertex algebras of $V(S_c,0)$ are
parametrized by a $\mathbb{Z}^r$-graded ring homomorphism $\psi:S_c\rightarrow
L_r$ such that Im$\psi$ is a $\mathbb{Z}^r$-graded simple $S_c$-module. Denote
by $L(\psi,0}$ the simple $(r+1)$-toroidal vertex algebra of $V(S_c,0)$
associated to $\psi$. We determine for which $\psi$, $L(\psi,0)$ is an
integrable $L_{r}(\hat{\frak{g}})$-module and we then classify irreducible
$L(\psi,0)$-modules for such a $\psi$. For our need, we also obtain various
general results.
