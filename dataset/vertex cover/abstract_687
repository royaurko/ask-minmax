We address the old difficulty in accommodating the scalar quark-antiquark
confining potential together with chiral symmetry breaking. We develop a quark
confining potential inspired in the QCD scalar flux tube. The coupling to
quarks consists in a double vector vertex. We study the Dirac and spin
structure of this potential. In the limit of massless quarks the quark vertex
is vector. Nevertheless symmetry breaking generates a new scalar quark vertex.
In the heavy quark limit the coupling is mostly scalar. We solve the mass gap
equation and find that this potential produces spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking for light quarks. The quantitative results of this model are
encouraging.
