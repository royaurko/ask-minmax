A many-body theory approach is developed for the problem of positron-atom
scattering and annihilation. Strong electron-positron correlations are included
non-perturbatively through the calculation of the electron-positron vertex
function. It corresponds to the sum of an infinite series of ladder diagrams,
and describes the physical effect of virtual positronium formation. The vertex
function is used to calculate the positron-atom correlation potential and
nonlocal corrections to the electron-positron annihilation vertex. Numerically,
we make use of B-spline basis sets, which ensures rapid convergence of the sums
over intermediate states. We have also devised an extrapolation procedure that
allows one to achieve convergence with respect to the number of
intermediate-state orbital angular momenta included in the calculations. As a
test, the present formalism is applied to positron scattering and annihilation
on hydrogen, where it is exact. Our results agree with those of accurate
variational calculations. We also examine in detail the properties of the large
correlation corrections to the annihilation vertex.
