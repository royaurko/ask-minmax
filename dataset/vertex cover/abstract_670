We compute the quark-gluon vertex in quenched lattice QCD, in the Landau
gauge using an off-shell mean-field O(a)-improved fermion action. The
Dirac-vector part of the vertex is computed for arbitrary kinematics. We find a
substantial infrared enhancement of the interaction strength regardless of the
kinematics.
