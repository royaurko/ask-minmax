The potential of LC+HERAp based Gamma-p collider to probe WW-Gamma vertex is
presented through the discussion of sensitivity to anomalous couplings and P_T
distribution of the final quark. The limits of -0.04<\Delta\kappa<0.04 and
-0.11<\lambda<0.11 at 95% C.L. can be reached with integrated luminosity
200(1/pb). The limit for \Delta\kappa is comparable to one which is expected
from LHC. The bounds are also obtained from corresponding ep collider using
Weizsacker-Williams Approximation to compare with real photons.
