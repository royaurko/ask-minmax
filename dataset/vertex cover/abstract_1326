I stress the fact that a complete study of possible New Physics effects in
the $Z \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ vertex requires a combined analysis of the ratio
$R_b= \Gamma(Z \rightarrow b\bar{b})/ \Gamma(Z \rightarrow hadrons)$ and the
longitudinally polarized forward backward asymmetry, $A_b$.
 This is illustrated with a number of models such as the two Higgs-doublet
model, the MSSM, Technicolour and models with an extra $Z'$. The use of
effective lagrangean techniques is briefly discussed.
