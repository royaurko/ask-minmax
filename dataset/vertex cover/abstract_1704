We investigate the range of covering factors (determined from the ratio of IR
to UV/optical luminosity) seen in luminous type 1 quasars using a combination
of data from the WISE, UKIDSS and SDSS surveys. Accretion disk (UV/optical) and
obscuring dust (IR) luminosities are measured via the use of a simple three
component SED model. We use these estimates to investigate the distribution of
covering factors and its relationship to both accretion luminosity and IR SED
shape. The distribution of covering factors (f_C) is observed to be log-normal,
with a bias-corrected mean of <log10 f_C>=-0.41 and standard deviation of 0.2.
The fraction of IR luminosity emitted in the near-IR (1--5 micron) is found to
be high (~40 per cent), and strongly dependant on covering factor.
