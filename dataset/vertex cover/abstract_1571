We define a formalism for computing open orbifold GW invariants of [C^3/G]
where G is any finite abelian group. We prove that this formalism and a
suitable gluing algorithm can be used to compute GW invariants in all genera of
any toric CY orbifold of dimension 3. We conjecture a correspondence with the
DT orbifold vertex of Bryan-Cadman-Young.
