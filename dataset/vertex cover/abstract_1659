We prove that the torsion of any closed space curve which bounds a simply
connected locally convex surface vanishes at least 4 times. This answers a
question of Rosenberg related to a problem of Yau on characterizing the
boundary of positively curved disks in Euclidean space. Furthermore, our result
generalizes the 4 vertex theorem of Sedykh for convex space curves, and thus
constitutes a far reaching extension of the classical 4 vertex theorem. The
proof involves studying the arrangement of convex caps in a locally convex
surface, and yields a Bose type formula for these objects.
