The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a project of an electron-positron
(e+e-) linear collider with the centre-of-mass energy of 200-500 GeV.
Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are one of the proposed silicon pixel
detector concepts for the ILC vertex detector (VTX). Basic characteristics of
two MAPS pixel matrices MIMOSA-5 (17 $\mu$m pixel pitch) and MIMOSA-18 (10
$\mu$m pixel pitch) are studied and compared (pedestals, noises, calibration of
the ADC-to-electron conversion gain, detector efficiency and charge collection
properties). The e+e- collisions at the ILC will be accompanied by intense
beamsstrahlung background of electrons and positrons hitting inner planes of
the vertex detector. Tracks of this origin leave elongated clusters contrary to
those of secondary hadrons. Cluster characteristics and orientation with
respect to the pixels netting are studied for perpendicular and inclined
tracks. Elongation and precision of determining the cluster orientation as a
function of the angle of incidence were measured. A simple model of signal
formation (based on charge diffusion) is proposed and tested using the
collected data.
