We prove that the fermionic form of the generating function of the
Gromov-Witten invariants of the resolved conifold is a Bogoliubov transform of
the fermionic vacuum; in particular, it is a tau function of the KP hierarchy.
Our proof is based on the gluing rule of the topological vertex and the
formulas of the fermionic representations of the framed one-legged and
two-legged topological vertex which were conjectured by Aganagic et al and
proved in our recent work.
