The instanton-induced effective vertex is derived for N=2 supersymmetric QCD
(SQCD) with arbitrary mass matter hypermultiplets for the case of SU(2). The
leading term of the low energy effective lagrangian obtained from this vertex
agrees with one-instanton effective term of the Seiberg-Witten result.
