We calculate in next-to-leading order BFKL the jet vertex relevant for the
production of Mueller-Navelet jets in proton collisions and of forward jets in
deep inelastic scattering. Starting from the definition of the totally
inclusive quark and gluon impact factors in the BFKL approach and suitably
considering the parton densities and the jet selection functions, we show that
an infrared-free result can be found for the jet vertex. Finally we compare our
expression for the vertex with the previous calculation of Refs. 1.
