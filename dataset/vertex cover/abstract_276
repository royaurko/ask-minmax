We study the genuine non-perturbative corrections to the Landau gauge
ghost-gluon vertex in terms of the non-vanishing dimension-two gluon
condensate, and prove these corrections to give account of current SU(2)
lattice data for the vertex with different kinematical configurations in the
domain of intermediate momenta, roughly above 2-3 GeV. Based on this OPE
analysis, we also present a simple model for the vertex, in acceptable
agreement with the lattice data also in the IR domain. The necessity of a
non-vanishing dimension-two gluon condensate will be also investigated through
the analysis of the running coupling defined by the ghost-gluon vertex in
Taylor kinematics.
