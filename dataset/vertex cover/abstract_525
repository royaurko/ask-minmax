An edge-colored graph $G$ is rainbow connected if any two vertices are
connected by a path whose edges have distinct colors. The rainbow connection
number of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $rc(G)$, is the smallest number of
colors that are needed in order to make $G$ rainbow connected. It was proved
that computing $rc(G)$ is an NP-Hard problem, as well as that even deciding
whether a graph has $rc(G)=2$ is NP-Complete. It is known that deciding whether
a given edge-colored graph is rainbow connected is NP-Complete. We will prove
that it is still NP-Complete even when the edge-colored graph is a planar
bipartite graph. We also give upper bounds of the rainbow connection number of
outerplanar graphs with small diameters. A vertex-colored graph is rainbow
vertex-connected if any two vertices are connected by a path whose internal
vertices have distinct colors. The rainbow vertex-connection number of a
connected graph $G$, denoted by $rvc(G)$, is the smallest number of colors that
are needed in order to make $G$ rainbow vertex-connected. It is known that
deciding whether a given vertex-colored graph is rainbow vertex-connected is
NP-Complete. We will prove that it is still NP-Complete even when the
vertex-colored graph is a line graph.
