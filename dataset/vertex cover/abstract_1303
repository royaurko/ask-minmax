We analyse the Structure Function collaboration data on the quark
pseudoscalar vertex and extract the Goldstone boson pole contribution, in 1/p2.
The strength of the pole is found to be quite large at presently accessible
scales. We draw the important consequences of this finding for the various
definitions of quark masses, and point out potential problems with the operator
product expansion.
