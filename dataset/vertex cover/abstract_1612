We present analytical and numerical results for the Dirac form factor of the
quark-gluon vertex in the quark symmetric limit, where the incoming and
outgoing quark momenta have the same magnitude but opposite sign. To accomplish
this, we compute the relevant components of the quark-ghost scattering kernel
at the one-loop dressed approximation, using as basic ingredients the full
quark propagator, obtained as a solution of the quark gap equation, and the
gluon propagator and ghost dressing function, obtained from large-volume
lattice simulations.
