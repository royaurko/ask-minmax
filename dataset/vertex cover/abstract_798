The arctic curve, i.e. the spatial curve separating ordered (or `frozen') and
disordered (or `temperate) regions, of the six-vertex model with domain wall
boundary conditions is discussed for the root-of-unity vertex weights. In these
cases the curve is described by algebraic equations which can be worked out
explicitly from the parametric solution for this curve. Some interesting
examples are discussed in detail. The upper bound on the maximal degree of the
equation in a generic root-of-unity case is obtained.
