In general a universal covering of a non connected topological group need not
admit a topological group structure such that the covering map is a morphism of
topological groups. This result is due to R.L. Taylor (1953). We generalise
this result and relate it to the theory of obstructions to group extensions.
The methods use: the equivalence between covering maps of X and covering
groupoids of the fundamental groupoid of X; the equivalence between group
groupoids and crossed modules; and descriptions of cohomology in terms of
crossed complexes.
