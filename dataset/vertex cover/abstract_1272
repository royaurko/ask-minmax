The good performance of the GW approximation for band-structure calculations
in solids was long taken as a sign that the sum of self-energy diagrams is
converged and that all omitted terms are small. However, with modern
computational resources it has now become possible to evaluate self-consistency
and vertex corrections explicitly, and the numerical results show that they
are, in general, not individually negligible. In this review the available data
is examined, and the implications for practical calculations and the
theoretical foundation of the GW approximation are discussed.
