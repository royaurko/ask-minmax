We show that the shadow vertex simplex algorithm can be used to solve linear
programs in strongly polynomial time with respect to the number $n$ of
variables, the number $m$ of constraints, and $1/\delta$, where $\delta$ is a
parameter that measures the flatness of the vertices of the polyhedron. This
extends our recent result that the shadow vertex algorithm finds paths of
polynomial length (w.r.t. $n$, $m$, and $1/\delta$) between two given vertices
of a polyhedron.
  Our result also complements a recent result due to Eisenbrand and Vempala who
have shown that a certain version of the random edge pivot rule solves linear
programs with a running time that is strongly polynomial in the number of
variables $n$ and $1/\delta$, but independent of the number $m$ of constraints.
Even though the running time of our algorithm depends on $m$, it is
significantly faster for the important special case of totally unimodular
linear programs, for which $1/\delta\le n$ and which have only $O(n^2)$
constraints.
