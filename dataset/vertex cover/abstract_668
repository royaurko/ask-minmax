We present the first results from a study of the quark--gluon vertex function
in the Landau gauge. The results are obtained for quenched QCD with an
O(a)-improved Wilson fermion action, at beta=6.0. We discuss plans for further
study, including extraction of a renormalised QCD coupling from the momentum
dependence of the vertex.
