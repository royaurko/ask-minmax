We consider algebraic developments of graph theory through suitable
applications in real connection problems. We investigate ideals of vertex
covers for the edge ideals associated to a significative class of connected
graphs. It is shown that algebraic procedures linked to minimal vertex covering
of such graphs are good instruments concerned about how sensor networks can be
encoded and their properties measured. Moreover algebraic properties of such
ideals are studied. Using the notion of linear quotients, standard algebraic
invariants are computed and these ideals are stated to be Cohen-Macaulay.
