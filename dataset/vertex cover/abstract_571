While the light-front quark model (LFQM) is employed to calculate hadronic
transition matrix elements, the vertex functions must be pre-determined. In
this work we derive the vertex functions for all d-wave states in this model.
Especially, since both of $^3D_1$ and $^3S_1$ are $1^{--}$ mesons, the Lorentz
structures of their vertex functions are the same. Thus when one needs to study
the processes where $^3D_1$ is involved, all the corresponding formulas for
$^3S_1$ states can be directly applied, only the coefficient of the vertex
function should be replaced by that for $^3D_1$. The results would be useful
for studying the newly observed resonances which are supposed to be d-wave
mesons and furthermore the possible 2S-1D mixing in $\psi'$ with the LFQM.
