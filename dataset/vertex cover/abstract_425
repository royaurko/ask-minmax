Seymour's second neighborhood conjecture states that every simple digraph
(without digons) has a vertex whose first out-neighborhood is at most as large
as its second out-neighborhood. Such a vertex is said to have the second
neighborhood property (SNP). We define "good" digraphs and prove a statement
that implies that every feed vertex of a tournament has the SNP. In the case of
digraphs missing a matching, we exhibit a feed vertex with the SNP by refining
a proof due to Fidler and Yuster and using good digraphs. Moreover, in some
cases we exhibit two vertices with SNP.
