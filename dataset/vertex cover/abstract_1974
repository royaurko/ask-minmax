We define and compute the continuous orbifold partition function and a
generating function for all $n$-point correlation functions for the rank two
free fermion vertex operator superalgebra on a genus two Riemann surface formed
by self-sewing a torus. The partition function is proportional to an infinite
dimensional determinant with entries arising from torus Szego kernel and the
generating function is proportional to a finite determinant of genus two Szego
kernels. These results follow from an explicit analysis of all torus $n$-point
correlation functions for intertwiners of the irreducible modules of the
Heisenberg vertex operator algebra. We prove that the partition and $n$-point
correlation functions are holomorphic on a suitable domain and describe their
modular properties. We also describe an identity for the genus two Riemann
theta series analogous to the Jacobi triple product identity.
