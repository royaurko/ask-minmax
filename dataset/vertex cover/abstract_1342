We discuss the size of the electron-antineutrino electron into
electron-antineutrino electron cross section reduction due to the rejection of
the events with a vertex bremsstrahlung photon above a certain energy in the
final state. In particular we analyze the effect in experiments designed to
detect the low energy electron-antineutrino and electron-neutrino from a
nuclear reactor and from the Sun. We find that such reduction has to be
considered in a relatively high statistic reactor experiment, while it is
negligible for pp and 7Be solar neutrino detection.
