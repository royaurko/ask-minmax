We present an explicit construction of the special part of the three gluon
vertex, which incorporates the Schwinger mechanism into the Schwinger-Dyson
equation of the gluon propagator, enabling the generation of a dynamical gluon
mass. This vertex contains massless, longitudinally coupled poles, acting
effectively as composite Nambu-Goldstone bosons, generated by the strong QCD
dynamics. The basic ingredients required for this construction are the
longitudinal nature of this vertex and the Slavnov-Taylor identities that it
must satisfy, in order for gauge-invariance and BRST symmetry to remain intact
in the presence of a gluon mass.
