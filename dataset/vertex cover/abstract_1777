A connection between integrability properties and general statistical
properties of the spectra of symmetric transfer matrices of the asymmetric
eight-vertex model is studied using random matrix theory (eigenvalue spacing
distribution and spectral rigidity). For Yang-Baxter integrable cases,
including free-fermion solutions, we have found a Poissonian behavior, whereas
level repulsion close to the Wigner distribution is found for non-integrable
models. For the asymmetric eight-vertex model, however, the level repulsion can
also disappearand the Poisson distribution be recovered on (non Yang--Baxter
integrable) algebraic varieties, the so-called disorder varieties. We also
present an infinite set of algebraic varieties which are stable under the
action of an infinite discrete symmetry group of the parameter space. These
varieties are possible loci for free parafermions. Using our numerical
criterion we have tested the generic calculability of the model on these
algebraic varieties.
