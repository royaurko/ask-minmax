The coupled system of the quark-gluon vertex and quark propagator
Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) is investigated within Landau gauge QCD. The
aim is to get a deeper insight into the mechanisms of quark confinement and
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and into a possible relation between these
two phenomena. To this end an earlier study is extended by improving
systematically on the truncations imposed on the quark-gluon vertex DSE. A
clear infrared enhancement for all tensor structures of the quark-gluon vertex
is obtained.
