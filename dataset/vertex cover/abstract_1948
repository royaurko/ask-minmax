We consider an interaction of a spin-3/2 field with the electromagnetic field
in the framework of the hard-wall model of AdS/QCD. We write Lagrangian for
this interaction including all kinds interaction terms in the bulk of AdS$_{5}$
space and present the scattering matrix element in integrals over the fifth
coordinate. Comparing the current matrix element obtained in the boundary of
this space with the one known from field theory, we find the vertex function
coefficients for the $\gamma^{*}\Delta\Delta$ interaction vertex. As an
example, we apply the obtained coefficients to the computation of the charge
form factor $G_{E0}$ for the $\Delta^{+}$ baryon and compare the result with
the one obtained in the field theory.
