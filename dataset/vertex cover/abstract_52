This version is similar to math.CO/0210113. We've changed Conjectures 1.1 and
1.2 so that they cover arbitrary graphs(digraphs). Let G be an arbitrary
graph(digraph). Then - in polynomial time - either an algorithm obtains a
hamilton circuit(cycle)or else the algorithm points to at least one vertex that
cannot belong to any hamilton circuit(cycle) of G. We give criteria for
determining which vertices should be examined.
