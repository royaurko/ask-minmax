We show results for the quark-gluon vertex in the Landau gauge, using a
mean-field improved Sheikholeslami-Wohlert fermion action. We compute all the
three non-zero form factors of the vertex at zero gluon momentum, and compare
them to the abelian vertex. The quark mass dependence of the vertex is also
investigated and found to be negligible for the range of masses considered.
