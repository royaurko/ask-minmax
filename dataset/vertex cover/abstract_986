Using combinatorics and character theory, we determine the imprimitive
faithful complex characters, i.e., the irreducible faithful complex characters
which are induced from proper subgroups, of the Schur covers of the symmetric
and alternating groups. Furthermore, for every imprimitive character we
establish all its minimal block stabilizers. As a corollary, we also determine
the monomial faithful characters of the Schur covers.
