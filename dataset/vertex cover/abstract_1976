Real-life networks often encounter vertex dysfunctions, which are usually
followed by recoveries after appropriate maintenances. In this paper we present
our research on a model of scale-free networks whose vertices are regularly
removed and put back. Both the frequency and length of time of the
disappearance of each vertex depend on the degree of the vertex, creating a
heterogeneous control over the network. Our simulation results show very
interesting growth pattern of this kind of networks. We also find that the
scale-free property of the degree distribution is maintained in the proposed
heterogeneously controlled networks. However, the overall growth rate of the
networks in our model can be remarkably reduced if the inactive periods of the
vertices are kept long.
