We embody the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method for the
19-vertex model on a square lattice in order to investigate the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Elements of the transfer matrix of
the 19-vertex model are classified in terms of the total value of arrows in one
layer of the square lattice. By using this classification, we succeed to reduce
enormously the dimension of the matrix which has to be diagonalized in the DMRG
method. We apply our method to the 19-vertex model with the interaction
$K=1.0866$ and obtain $c=1.006(1)$ for the conformal anomaly. PACS. 05.90.+m,
