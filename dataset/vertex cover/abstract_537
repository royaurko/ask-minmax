We evaluate the fermion-photon vertex in QED at the one loop level in Hard
Thermal Loop approximation and write it in covariant form. The complete vertex
can be expanded in terms of 32 basis vectors. As is well known, the
fermion-photon vertex and the fermion propagator are related through a
Ward-Takahashi Identity (WTI). This relation splits the vertex into two parts:
longitudinal (Gamma_L) and transverse (Gamma_T). Gamma_L is fixed by the WTI.
The description of the longitudinal part consumes 8 of the basis vectors. The
remaining piece Gamma_T is then written in terms of 24 spin amplitudes.
Extending the work of Ball and Chiu and Kizilersu et. al., we propose a set of
basis vectors T^mu_i(P_1,P_2) at finite temperature such that each of these is
transverse to the photon four-momentum and also satisfies T^mu_i(P,P)=0, in
accordance with the Ward Identity, with their corresponding coefficients being
free of kinematic singularities. This basis reduces to the form proposed by
Kizilersu et. al. at zero temperature. We also evaluate explicitly the
coefficient of each of these vectors at the above-mentioned level of
approximation.
