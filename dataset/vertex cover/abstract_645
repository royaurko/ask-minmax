We give an algorithm to classify singular fibers of finite cyclic covering
fibrations of a ruled surface by using singularity diagrams. As a first
application, we classify all fibers of 3-cyclic covering fibrations of genus 4
of a ruled surface and show that the signature of a complex surface with this
fibration is non-positive by computing the local signature for any fiber. As a
second application, we classify all fibers of hyperelliptic fibrations of genus
3 into 12 types according to the Horikawa index. We also prove that finite
cyclic covering fibrations of a ruled surface have no multiple fibers if the
degree of the covering is greater than 3.
