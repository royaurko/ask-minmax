In this paper, we prove an analogue of Corr{\'a}di and Hajnal's result. There
exists $n_0$ such that for every $n \in 3\mathbb{Z}$ when $n \ge n_0$ the
following holds. If $G$ is an oriented graph on $n$ vertices and $\delta^0(G)
\ge 7n/18$, then $G$ contains a perfect $TT_3$-tiling, which is a collection of
vertex disjoint transitive triangles covering every vertex of $G$. This result
is best possible, as there exists an oriented graph $G$ on $n$ vertices without
a perfect $TT_3$-tiling and $\delta^0(G) = \lfloor 7n/18\rfloor -1.$
