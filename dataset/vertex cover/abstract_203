The rational and C_2-cofinite simple vertex operator algebras whose effective
central charges and the central charges c are equal and less than 1 are
classified. Such a vertex operator algebra is zero if c<0 and C if c=0. If c>0,
it is an extension of discrete Virasoro vertex operator algebra L(c_{p,q},0) by
its irreducible modules. It is also proved that for any rational and
C_2-cofinite simple vertex operator algebra whose effective central charge and
central charge are equal, the vertex operator subalgebra generated by the
Virasoro vector is simple.
