For a vertex operator algebra $V$ and a vertex operator subalgebra $V'$ which
is invarinant under an automorphism $g$ of $V$ of finite order, we introduce a
$g$-twisted induction functor from the category of $g$-twisted $V'$-modules to
the category of $g$-twisted $V$-modules. This functor satisfies the Frobenius
reciprocity and transitivity. The results are illustrated with $V$ being simple
or with $V'$ being $g$-rational.
