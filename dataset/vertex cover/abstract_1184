A conjecture of Serre concerns the number of rational points of bounded
height on a finite cover of projective space P^{n-1}. In this paper, we achieve
Serre's conjecture in the special case of smooth cyclic covers of any degree
when n is at least 10, and surpass it for covers of degree 3 or higher when n >
10. This is achieved by a new bound for the number of perfect r-th power values
of a polynomial with nonsingular leading form, obtained via a combination of an
r-th power sieve and the q-analogue of van der Corput's method.
