PHENIX has a well defined program for measuring the polarized gluon
distribution in the nucleon. We measure the gluon polarization in the proton
with polarized $p$-$p$ collisions at PHENIX. The measurements of gluon
polarization $via$ the direct-photon production and the heavy-flavor production
can be significantly improved by the silicon vertex tracker upgrade. We have
studied the possible improvements of the gluon polarization measurements using
Monte Carlo simulation and they are shown and discussed in this paper.
