We construct an analogue of Dirac's reduction for an arbitrary local or
non-local Poisson bracket in the general setup of non-local Poisson vertex
algebras. This leads to Dirac's reduction of an arbitrary non-local Poisson
structure. We apply this construction to an example of a generalized
Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy.
