We compute the full one loop correction to the quartic vertex of QCD at the
fully symmetric point. This allows us to define a new momentum subtraction
(MOM) scheme in the class of schemes introduced by Celmaster and Gonsalves.
Hence using properties of the renormalization group equation, the two loop
renormalization group functions for this scheme are given.
