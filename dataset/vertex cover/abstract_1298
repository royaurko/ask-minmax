I present some preliminary results, obtained in collaboration with C. Bernard
and A. Soni, for the lattice evaluation of 2- and 3-point gluon correlation
functions in momentum space, with emphasis on the amputated 3-gluon vertex
function. The final goal of this approach is the study of the running QCD
coupling constant as defined from the amputated 3-gluon vertex.
