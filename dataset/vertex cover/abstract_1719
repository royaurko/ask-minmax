We derive in detail a novel solution of the spin fermion model which is valid
in the quasi-static limit pi T<<omega_sf, found in the intermediate
(pseudoscaling) regime of the magnetic phase diagram of cuprate
superconductors, and use it to obtain results for the temperature and doping
dependence of the single particle spectral density, the electron-spin
fluctuation vertex function, and the low frequency dynamical spin
susceptibility. The resulting strong anisotropy of the spectral density and the
vertex function lead to the qualitatively different behavior of_hot_ (around
k=(pi,0)) and_cold_ (around k=(pi/2,pi/2)) quasiparticles seen in ARPES
experiments. We find that the broad high energy features found in ARPES
measurements of the spectral density of the underdoped cuprate superconductors
are determined by strong antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations and incoherent
precursor effects of an SDW state, with reduced renormalized effective coupling
constant. The electron spin-fluctuation vertex function, i.e. the effective
interaction of low energy quasiparticles and spin degrees of freedom, is found
to be strongly anisotropic and enhanced for hot quasiparticles; the
corresponding charge-fluctuation vertex is considerably diminished. We thus
demonstrate that, once established, strong AF correlations act to reduce
substantially the effective electron-phonon coupling constant in cuprate
superconductors.
