An explicit expression is obtained for the generating series for the number
of ramified coverings of the sphere by the double torus, with elementary branch
points and prescribed ramification type over infinity. Thus we are able to
prove a conjecture of Graber and Pandharipande, giving a linear recurrence
equation for the number of these coverings with no ramification over infinity.
The general form of the series is conjectured for the number of these coverings
by a surface of arbitrary genus that is at least two.
