In the framework of gauge invariant approach involving Stueckelberg and
auxiliary fields, totally symmetric arbitrary spin anomalous conformal current
and shadow field in flat space-time of dimension greater than or equal to four
are studied. Gauge invariant differential constraints for such anomalous
conformal current and shadow field and realization of global conformal
symmetries are obtained. Gauge invariant two-point vertex of the arbitrary spin
anomalous shadow field is also obtained. In Stueckelberg gauge frame, the
two-point gauge invariant vertex becomes the standard two-point vertex of CFT.
Light-cone gauge two-point vertex of the arbitrary spin anomalous shadow field
is derived. The AdS/CFT correspondence for arbitrary spin anomalous conformal
current and shadow field and the respective normalizable and non-normalizable
modes of massive arbitrary spin AdS field is studied. The AdS field is
considered in modified de Donder gauge which simplifies considerably the study
of AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that on-shell leftover gauge symmetries of
bulk massive field are related to gauge symmetries of boundary anomalous
conformal current and shadow field, while the modified de Donder gauge
condition for bulk massive field is related to differential constraints for
boundary anomalous conformal current and shadow field.
