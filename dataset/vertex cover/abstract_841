A simple and connected $n$-vertex graph has a prime vertex labeling if the
vertices can be injectively labeled with the integers $1, 2, 3,\ldots, n$, such
that adjacent vertices have relatively prime labels. We will present previously
unknown prime vertex labelings for new families of graphs including cycle
pendant stars, cycle chains, prisms, and generalized books.
