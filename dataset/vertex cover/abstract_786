In this article, we consider permutation orbifold models of $C_2$-cofinite
vertex operator algebras of CFT type. We show the $C_2$-cofiniteness of the
2-cyclic permutation orbifold model $(V\otimes V)^{S_2}$ for an arbitrary
$C_2$-cofinite simple vertex operator algebra $V$ of CFT type. We also give a
proof of the $C_2$-cofiniteness of a $\Z_2$-orbifold model $V_L^+$ of the
lattice vertex operator algebra $V_L$ associated with a rank one positive
definite even lattice $L$ by using our result and the $C_2$-cofiniteness of
$V_L$.
