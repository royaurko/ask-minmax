In this paper,we give the explicit formulae of vertex operators of
${U_q}(\widehat{B}_l)$ for level-one as operators on the Fock space. Meanwhile,
we point out that the free field realization (by one fermionic field and $l$
bosonic fields) of highest weight module with highest weight $\Lambda_l$ has
two irreducible modules.
