Consider genus g curves that admit degree d covers to an elliptic curve
simply branched at 2g-2 points. Vary a branch point and the locus of such
covers forms a one-parameter family W. We investigate the geometry of W by
using admissible covers to study its slope, genus and components. The results
can also be applied to study slopes of effective divisors on the moduli space
of genus g curves.
