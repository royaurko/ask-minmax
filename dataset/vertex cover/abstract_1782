The symmetries of the twisted XXZ spin-chain (alias the twisted six-vertex
model) at roots of unity are investigated. It is shown that when the twist
parameter is chosen to depend on the total spin an infinite-dimensional
non-abelian symmetry algebra can be explicitly constructed for all spin
sectors. This symmetry algebra is identified to be the upper or lower Borel
subalgebra of the sl_2 loop algebra. The proof uses only the intertwining
property of the six-vertex monodromy matrix and the familiar relations of the
six-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra.
