The canonical recursive Dyson--Schwinger equations for the three-gluon and
ghost-gluon vertices are solved numerically. The employed truncation includes
several previously neglected diagrams and includes back-coupling effects. We
find an infrared finite ghost-gluon vertex and an infrared diverging
three-gluon vertex. We also compare our results with those obtained in previous
calculations, where bare vertices were used in the loop diagrams.
