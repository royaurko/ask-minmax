The main goal of this article is to relate asymptotic geometric properties on
a tower of coverings of a non-compact K\"ahler manifold of finite volume with
reasonable geometric assumptions to its universal covering. Applicable examples
include moduli spaces of hyperbolic punctured Riemann surfaces and Hermitian
locally symmetric spaces of finite volume.
