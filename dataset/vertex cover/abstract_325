Free field relization of vertex operators for lvel two modules of
$U_q(\hat{sl(2)})$ is shown through the free field relization of the modules
given by Idzumi in Ref.[4,5]. We constructed types I and II vertex operators
when the spin of the addociated evaluation modules is 1/2 and typ II's for the
spin 1.
