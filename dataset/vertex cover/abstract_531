We consider a vertex model on the simple-quartic lattice defined by line
graphs on the lattice for which there is always an odd number of lines incident
at a vertex. This is the odd 8-vertex model which has eight possible vertex
configurations. We establish that the odd 8-vertex model is equivalent to a
staggered 8-vertex model. Using this equivalence we deduce the solution of the
odd 8-vertex model when the weights satisfy a free-fermion condition. It is
found that the free-fermion model exhibits no phase transitions in the regime
of positive vertex weights. We also establish the complete equivalence of the
free-fermion odd 8-vertex model with the free-fermion 8-vertex model solved by
Fan and Wu. Our analysis leads to several Ising model representations of the
free-fermion model with pure 2-spin interactions.
