We evaluate the analytic expression for the one-loop fermion-boson vertex in
massless QED3 in an arbitrary covariant gauge. The result is written in terms
of elementary functions of its momenta. The vertex is decomposed into a
longitudinal part, that is fully responsible for ensuring the Ward and
Ward-Takahashi identities are satisfied, and a transverse part. Following Ball
and Chiu and K{\i}z{\i}lers\"{u} {\it et. al.}, the transverse part is written
in its most general form as a function of 4 independent vectors. We calculate
the coefficients of each of these vectors. We also check the transversality
condition to two loops and evaluate the fermion propagator to the same order.
We compare our results with a conjecture of the non-perturbative vertex by
Tjiang and Burden.
