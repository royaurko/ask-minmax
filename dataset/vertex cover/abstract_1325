An algorithm for obtaining the Taylor coefficients of an expansion of Feynman
diagrams is proposed. It is based on recurrence relations which can be applied
to the propagator as well as to the vertex diagrams. As an application, several
coefficients of the Taylor series expansion for the two-loop propagator and
two-loop non-planar vertex diagrams are calculated. The results of the
numerical evaluation of these diagrams using conformal mapping and Pade
approximants are given.
