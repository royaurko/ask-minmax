In this article we study surface subgroups of groups acting simply
transitively on vertex sets of certain hyperbolic triangular buildings.
Kangaslampi and Vdovina have constructed and classified all groups acting
simply transitively on the vertices of hyperbolic triangular buildings of the
smallest non-trivial thickness. These groups gave the first examples of
cocompact lattices acting simply transitively on vertices of hyperbolic
triangular Kac-Moody buildings that are not right-angled. The hyperbolic
buildings arise as universal covers of polyhedra glued together from with 15
triangular faces with words written on the boundary. Later they proved, that
most of the obtained 23 torsion free groups do not admit periodic planes of
genus 2. Here we take another approach to study surface subgroups of these
groups. Namely, we consider first 2-cycles in the 1-vertex polyhedron defined
by the triangles, then in the 3-vertex cover of this polyhedron. As a result we
find surface subgroups in three of the 23 torsion free groups.
