Fractal structure of the six-vertex model is introduced with the use of the
IFS (Iterated Function Systems). The fractal dimension satisfies an equation
written by the free energy of the six-vertex model. It is pointed out that the
transfer matrix method and the $n$-equivalence relation introduced in lattice
theories have also been introduced in the area of fractal geometry. All the
results can be generalized for the models suitable to the transfer matrix
treatment, and hence this gives general relation between solvable lattice
models and fractal geometry.
