Medium modifications of the pion-omega-rho vertex are analyzed in context of
the omega -> pi gamma* and rho -> pi gamma* decays in nuclear matter. A
relativistic hadronic model with mesons, nucleons, and Delta(1232)isobars is
applied. A substantial increase of the widths for the decays omega -> pi gamma*
and rho -> pi gamma* is found for photon virtualities in the range 0.3-0.6 GeV.
This enhancement has a direct importance for the description of dilepton yields
obtained in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
