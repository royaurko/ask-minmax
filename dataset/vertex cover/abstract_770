Proper vertex colorings of a graph are related to its boundary map, also
called its signed vertex-edge incidence matrix. The vertex Laplacian of a
graph, a natural extension of the boundary map, leads us to introduce
nowhere-harmonic colorings and analogues of the chromatic polynomial and
Stanley's theorem relating negative evaluations of the chromatic polynomial to
acyclic orientations. Further, we discuss some examples demonstrating that
nowhere-harmonic colorings are more complicated from an enumerative perspective
than proper colorings.
