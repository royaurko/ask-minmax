We study relationships between spinor representations of certain Lie algebras
and Lie superalgebras of differential operators on the circle and values of
$\zeta$--functions at the negative integers. By using formal calculus
techniques we discuss the appearance of values of $\zeta$--functions at the
negative integers underlying the construction. In addition we provide a
conceptual explanation of this phenomena through several different notions of
normal ordering via vertex operator algebra theory. We also derive a general
Jacobi--type identity generalizing our previous construction. At the end we
discuss related constructions associated to Dirichlet $L$--functions.
