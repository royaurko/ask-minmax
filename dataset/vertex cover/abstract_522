We introduce a notion of strongly C^{\times}-graded, or equivalently,
C/Z-graded generalized g-twisted V-module associated to an automorphism g, not
necessarily of finite order, of a vertex operator algebra. We also introduce a
notion of strongly C-graded generalized g-twisted V-module if V admits an
additional C-grading compatible with g. Let V=\coprod_{n\in \Z}V_{(n)} be a
vertex operator algebra such that V_{(0)}=\C\one and V_{(n)}=0 for n<0 and let
u be an element of V of weight 1 such that L(1)u=0. Then the exponential of
2\pi \sqrt{-1} Res_{x} Y(u, x) is an automorphism g_{u} of V. In this case, a
strongly C-graded generalized g_{u}-twisted V-module is constructed from a
strongly C-graded generalized V-module with a compatible action of g_{u} by
modifying the vertex operator map for the generalized V-module using the
exponential of the negative-power part of the vertex operator Y(u, x). In
particular, we give examples of such generalized twisted modules associated to
the exponentials of some screening operators on certain vertex operator
algebras related to the triplet W-algebras. An important feature is that we
have to work with generalized (twisted) V-modules which are doubly graded by
the group C/Z or C and by generalized eigenspaces (not just eigenspaces) for
L(0), and the twisted vertex operators in general involve the logarithm of the
formal variable.
