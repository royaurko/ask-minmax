The diffractive process ep \rightarrow eXY, where Y denotes a proton or its
low mass excitation with MY < 1.6 GeV, is studied with the H1 experiment at
HERA. The analysis is restricted to the phase space region of the photon
virtuality 3 \leq Q2 \leq 1600 GeV2, the square of the four-momentum transfer
at the proton vertex |t| < 1.0 GeV2 and the longitudinal momentum fraction of
the incident proton carried by the colourless exchange xIP < 0.05. Triple
differential cross sections are measured as a function of xIP, Q2 and beta =
x/xIP where x is the Bjorken scaling variable. These measurements are made
after selecting diffractive events by demanding a large empty rapidity interval
separating the final state hadronic systems X and Y . High statistics
measurements covering the data taking periods 1999-2000 and 2004-2007 are
combined with previously published results in order to provide a single set of
diffractive cross sections from the H1 experiment using the large rapidity gap
selection method. The combined data represent a factor between three and thirty
increase in statistics with respect to the previously published results. The
measurements are compared with predictions from NLO QCD calculations based on
diffractive parton densities and from a dipole model. The proton vertex
factorisation hypothesis is tested.
