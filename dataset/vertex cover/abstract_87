The D0 Run II silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) has 3 square meters of Si
area. There are 792,576 channels read out by 6192 SVXIIe chips on 912 read out
modules. The SMT provides track and vertex reconstruction capabilities over the
full pseudorapidity coverage of the D0 detector. The full detector has been
running successfully since April 2002. This presentation covers the experience
in commissioning and operating, the recent electronics upgrade which improved
stability of the SMT and estimates of the radiation damage.
