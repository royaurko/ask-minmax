A vertex colouring of a graph is \emph{nonrepetitive} if there is no path
whose first half receives the same sequence of colours as the second half. A
graph is nonrepetitively $k$-choosable if given lists of at least $k$ colours
at each vertex, there is a nonrepetitive colouring such that each vertex is
coloured from its own list. It is known that every graph with maximum degree
$\Delta$ is $c\Delta^2$-choosable, for some constant $c$. We prove this result
with $c=1$ (ignoring lower order terms). We then prove that every subdivision
of a graph with sufficiently many division vertices per edge is nonrepetitively
5-choosable. The proofs of both these results are based on the Moser-Tardos
entropy-compression method, and a recent extension by Grytczuk, Kozik and Micek
for the nonrepetitive choosability of paths. Finally, we prove that every graph
with pathwidth $k$ is nonrepetitively $O(k^{2})$-colourable.
