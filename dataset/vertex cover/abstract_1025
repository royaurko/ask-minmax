This is the first part of a study of the quark propagator and the vertex
function of the vector current on the lattice in the Landau gauge and using
both Wilson-clover and overlap actions. In order to be able to identify lattice
artifacts and to reach large momenta we use a range of lattice spacings. The
lattice artifacts turn out to be exceedingly large in this study. We present a
new and very efficient method to eliminate the hypercubic (anisotropy)
artifacts based on a systematic expansion on hypercubic invariants which are
not SO(4) invariant. A simpler version of this method has been used in previous
works. This method is shown to be significantly more efficient than the popular
``democratic'' methods. It can of course be applied to the lattice simulations
of many other physical quantities. The analysis indicates a hierarchy in the
size of hypercubic artifacts: overlap larger than clover and propagator larger
than vertex function. This pleads for the combined study of propagators and
vertex functions via Ward identities.
