We investigate the momentum dependence of the g*-g-eta' vertex form factor in
the presence of the nonperturbative QCD vacuum condensate. The behaviour of
this form factor is crucial for, among other things, some proposed mechanisms
devised to explain the large branching ratio for fast eta' production in
charmless B decays observed by CLEO. We show that the leading momentum
dependence of this vertex form factor is not altered when the contribution of
nonperturbative quark condensate is considered.
