This paper gives lower and upper bounds on the covering radius of codes over
$\Z_{2^s}$ with respect to homogenous distance. We also determine the covering
radius of various Repetition codes, Simplex codes (Type $\alpha$ and Type
$\beta$) and their dual and give bounds on the covering radii for MacDonald
codes of both types over $\Z_4$.
