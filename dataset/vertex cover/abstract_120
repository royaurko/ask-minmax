Let V be a vertex operator algebra and G a finite automorphism group of V.
For each g\in G and nonnegative rational number n\in {\mathbb Z}/|g|, a
g-twisted Zhu algebra A_{g,n}(V) plays an important role in the theory of
vertex operator algebras, but the given product in A_{g,n}(V) depends on the
eigenspaces of g. We show that there is a uniform definition of products on V
and we introduce a G-twisted Zhu algebra A_{G,n}(V) which covers all g-twisted
Zhu algebras.
  Assume that V is simple and let {\cal S} be a finite set of inequivalent
irreducible twisted V-modules which is closed under the action of G. There is a
finite dimensional semisimple associative algebra {\cal A}_{\alpha}(G,{\cal S})
for a suitable 2-cocycle naturally determined by the G-action on {\cal S}. We
show that a duality theorem of Schur-Weyl type holds for the actions of {\cal
A}_{\alpha}(G,{\cal S}) and V^G on the direct sum of twisted V-modules in {\cal
S} as an application of the theory of A_{G,n}(V). It follows as a natural
consequence of the result that for any g\in G every irreducible g-twisted
V-module is a completely reducible V^G-module.
