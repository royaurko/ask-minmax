A \emph{$k$-tree} is a chordal graph with no $(k+2)$-clique. An
\emph{$\ell$-tree-partition} of a graph $G$ is a vertex partition of $G$ into
`bags', such that contracting each bag to a single vertex gives an $\ell$-tree
(after deleting loops and replacing parallel edges by a single edge). We prove
that for all $k\geq\ell\geq0$, every $k$-tree has an $\ell$-tree-partition in
which every bag induces a connected $\floor{k/(\ell+1)}$-tree. An analogous
result is proved for oriented $k$-trees.
