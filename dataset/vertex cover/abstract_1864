At zero-density, meson-nucleon vertex corrections to vacuum polarization are
studied in the $\sigma-\omega$ model with the cutoff. It is shown that the
properties of the vertex corrections to vacuum polarization are somewhat
different from those described by the ordinary renormalization procedures when
the cutoff is small (< 5 GeV). The low-energy effective Lagrangian is
constructed in the framework of the renormalization group method. The weak
tensor and derivative couplings of meson-nucleon interactions may be needed in
the low-energy effective theory of mesons and nucleons.
