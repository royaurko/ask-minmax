A variety of experiments suggest that in the cuprates, the low-energy
superconducting quasiparticles undergo forward scattering from extended
impurity potentials. We argue that when such potentials dominate the
scattering, the penetration depth may be computed in a simple zero-angle
scattering approximation (ZSA), in which the vertex corrections to the Meissner
effect may be summed exactly. We find a remarkably simple relationship between
the normal fluid density and the quasiparticle density of states of the
disordered system which holds for every realization of the disorder. We expect
this result to be relevant to the $ab$-plane penetration depth in high-purity
single crystals of underdoped YBCO.
