We show how to decompose a Lagrangian for reducible massless bosonic Higher
Spin modes into the ones describing irreducible (Fronsdal) Higher Spin modes on
a D dimensional AdS space. Using this decomposition we construct a new
Nonabelian cubic interaction vertex for reducible higher spin modes and two
scalars on AdS from the already known vertex which involves irreducible
(Fronsdal) modes.
