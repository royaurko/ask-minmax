In this paper we develop the theory of coverings of a small connected
category B. We show that the category of Galois coverings of B is equivalent to
the category of Galois coverings of its fundamental groupoid. Making use of
effective gradings of B we explicitly construct Galois coverings through a
smash product analogous to the one considered in the linear case. In
particular, the universal cover of B can be obtained from its fundamental
groupoid.
