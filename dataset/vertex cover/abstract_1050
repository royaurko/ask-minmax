We compute the one loop, $O(\th)$ correction to the vertex in the
noncommutative Chern-Simons theory with scalar fields in the fundamental
representation. Emphasis is placed on the parity odd part of the vertex, since
the same leads to the magnetic moment structure. We find that, apart from the
commutative term, a $\th$-dependent magnetic moment type structure is induced.
In addition to the usual commutative graph, cubic photon vertices also give a
finite $\th$ dependent contribution. Furthermore, the two two-photon vertex
diagrams, that give zero in the commutative case yield finite $\th$ dependent
terms to the vertex function.
