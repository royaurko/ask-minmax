It is proved that g-rationality of a vertex operator superalgebra
V=V_{\bar0}+V_{\bar1} for all g in G imply rationality of V^G, and also imply
that each irreducible V^G-module is a submodule of an irreducible g-twisted
V-module for some g in G, where G is any finite abelian subgroup of Aut(V). We
also prove that for any finite solvable G, rationality of V^G implies
g-rationality of V for any g in G.
