The vertex operator algebras and modules associated to the highest weight
modules for the Virasoro algebra over an arbitrary field F whose characteristic
is not equal to 2 are studied. The irreducible modules of vertex operator
algebra L(1/2,0)_F are classified. The rationality of L(1/2,0)_F is established
if the characteristic of F is different from 7.
