An edge colouring of a graph is said to be an $r$-local colouring if the
edges incident to any vertex are coloured with at most $r$ colours.
Generalising a result of Bessy and Thomass\'e, we prove that the vertex set of
any $2$-locally coloured complete graph may be partitioned into two disjoint
monochromatic cycles of different colours. Moreover, for any natural number
$r$, we show that the vertex set of any $r$-locally coloured complete graph may
be partitioned into $O(r^2 \log r)$ disjoint monochromatic cycles. This
generalises a result of Erd\H{o}s, Gy\'arf\'as and Pyber.
