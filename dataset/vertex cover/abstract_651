We give various applications of essential circles (introduced in an earlier
paper by the contributors) in a compact geodesic space X. Essential circles
completely determine the homotopy critical spectrum of X, which we show is
precisely 2/3 the covering spectrum of Sormani-Wei. We use finite collections
of essential circles to define "circle covers," which extend and contain as
special cases the delta-covers of Sormani and Wei (equivalently the
epsilon-covers of the contributors); the constructions are metric adaptations of
those utilized by Berestovskii-Plaut in the construction of entourage covers of
uniform spaces. We show that, unlike delta- and epsilon-covers, circle covers
are in a sense closed with respect to Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, and we
prove a finiteness theorem concerning their deck groups that does not hold for
covering maps in general. This allows us to completely understand the structure
of Gromov-Hausdorff limits of delta-covers. Also, we use essential circles to
strengthen a theorem of E. Cartan by finding a new (even for compact Riemannian
manifolds) finite set of generators of the fundamental group of a semilocally
simply connected compact geodesic space. We conjecture that there is always a
generating set of this sort having minimal cardinality among all generating
sets.
