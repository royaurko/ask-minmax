We study a self-dual N=1 super vertex operator algebra and prove that the
full symmetry group is Conway's largest sporadic simple group. We verify a
uniqueness result which is analogous to that conjectured to characterize the
Moonshine vertex operator algebra. The action of the automorphism group is
sufficiently transparent that one can derive explicit expressions for all the
McKay-Thompson series. A corollary of the construction is that the perfect
double cover of the Conway group may be characterized as a point-stabilizer in
a spin module for the Spin group associated to a 24 dimensional Euclidean
space.
