We apply the methods developed in [Br1] to study holomorphic functions of
slow growth on coverings of pseudoconvex domains in Stein manifolds. In
particular, we extend and strengthen certain results of Gromov, Henkin and
Shubin [GHS] on holomorphic L^{2} functions on coverings of pseudoconvex
manifolds in the case of coverings of Stein manifolds.
