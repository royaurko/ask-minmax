Vertex operator realizations of symplectic and orthogonal Schur functions are
studied and expanded. New proofs of determinant identities of irreducible
characters for the symplectic and orthogonal groups are given. We also give a
new proof of the duality between the universal orthogonal and symplectic Schur
functions using vertex operators.
