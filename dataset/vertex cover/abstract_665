The study of the process $e^+e^- \to W^+W^-$ at Linear Collider energies
presents a good opportunity to investigate anomalous triple gauge boson
couplings and $W^+_LW^-_L$ rescattering. The helicity analysis of the $e^+e^-
\to W^+_LW^-_L$ decays will benefit if the charm quark containing jet can be
identified for events which contain one hadronic $W$ boson decay to a charm and
another quark. A JAVA implementation of the SLD collaboration's topological
vertex finding algorithm (ZVTOP) in the linear collider analysis framework has
been used to extract charm tag efficiencies and purities based on vertex
multiplicities.
