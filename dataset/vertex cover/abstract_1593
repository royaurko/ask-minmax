We use the recent measurements of top quark decay asymmetries in ATLAS and
the t-channel single top cross section in CMS to set the first combined LHC
limits on the Wtb vertex. This combination allows to obtain much better limits
than the separate measurements. The resulting constraints are comparable,
although still weaker, than the ones obtained using Tevatron data with much
more statistics.
