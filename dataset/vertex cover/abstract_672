*REVISED VERSION* Two quark propagators with different analytic structure are
employed in on and off mass-shell Bethe-Salpeter type equations for the pion
and scalar diquark form-factors. One of the quark propagators has been
calculated with the inclusion of a trivial quark-gluon vertex and, as a
consequence, contains a complex conjugate pair of logarithmic branch points.
The other quark propagator includes a non-trivial vertex ansatz and is entire,
with an essential singularity at infinity. The different quark propagators lead
to qualitatively different diquark form-factors.
