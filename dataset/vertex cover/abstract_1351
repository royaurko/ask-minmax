The one-loop off-shell massive quark contribution to the three-gluon vertex
is calculated in an arbitrary space-time dimension. The results for all
relevant on-shell and symmetric limits are obtained directly from the general
off-shell results. The analytic structure of the results for the relevant
massive scalar integrals is also discussed.
