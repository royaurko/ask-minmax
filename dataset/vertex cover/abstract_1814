The pion electromagnetic form factor is calculated in the space- and
time-like regions from -10 $(GeV/c)^2$ up to 10 $(GeV/c)^2$, within a
front-form model. The dressed photon vertex where a photon decays in a
quark-antiquark pair is depicted generalizing the vector meson dominance
ansatz, by means of the vector meson vertex functions. An important feature of
our model is the description of the on-mass-shell vertex functions in the
valence sector, for the pion and the vector mesons, through the front-form wave
functions obtained within a realistic quark model. The theoretical results show
an excellent agreement with the data in the space-like region, while in the
time-like region the description is quite encouraging.
