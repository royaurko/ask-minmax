An almost Belyi covering is an algebraic covering of the projective line,
such that all ramified points except one simple ramified point lie above a set
of 3 points of the projective line. In general, there are 1-dimensional
families of these coverings with a fixed ramification pattern. (That is,
Hurwitz spaces for these coverings are curves.) In this paper, three almost
Belyi coverings of degrees 11, 12, and 20 are explicitly constructed. We
demonstrate how these coverings can be used for computation of several
algebraic solutions of the sixth Painleve equation.
