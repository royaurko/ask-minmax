We study the effect of adding lower dimensional brane charges to the 't Hooft
monopole, di-baryon and baryon vertex configurations in AdS_4 x CP^3. We show
that these configurations capture the background fluxes in a way that depends
on the induced charges, requiring additional fundamental strings to cancel the
worldvolume tadpoles. The dynamics reveal that the charges must lie inside some
interval, a situation familiar from the baryon vertex in AdS_5 x S^5 with
charges. For the baryon vertex and the di-baryon the number of fundamental
strings must also lie inside an allowed interval. Some ideas about the
existence of these bounds in relation to the stringy exclusion principle are
given.
