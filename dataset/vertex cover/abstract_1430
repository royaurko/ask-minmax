We characterize stability of graph C*-algebras by giving five conditions
equivalent to their stability. We also show that if G is a graph with no
sources, then C*(G) is stable if and only if each vertex in G can be reached by
an infinite number of vertices. We use this characterization to realize the
stabilization of a graph C*-algebra. Specifically, if G is a graph and F is the
graph formed by adding a head to each vertex of G, then C*(F) is the
stabilization of C*(G).
