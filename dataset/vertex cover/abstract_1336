We calculate the nucleon contribution to the electromagnetic vertex of a
neutrino in a background of particles, including the effect of the anomalous
magnetic moment of the nucleons. Explicit formulas for the form factors are
given in various physical limits of practical interest. Several applications of
the results are mentioned, including the effect of an external magnetic field
on the dispersion relation of a neutrino in matter.
