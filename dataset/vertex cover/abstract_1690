We develop an explicit covering theory for complexes of groups, parallel to
that developed for graphs of groups by Bass. Given a covering of developable
complexes of groups, we construct the induced monomorphism of fundamental
groups and isometry of universal covers. We characterize faithful complexes of
groups and prove a conjugacy theorem for groups acting freely on polyhedral
complexes. We also define an equivalence relation on coverings of complexes of
groups, which allows us to construct a bijection between such equivalence
classes, and subgroups or overgroups of a fixed lattice $\Gamma$ in the
automorphism group of a locally finite polyhedral complex $X$.
