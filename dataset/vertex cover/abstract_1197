We describe an evolving and conjectural extension of the Langlands program
for a class of nonlinear covering groups of algebraic origin studied by
Brylinski-Deligne. In particular, we describe the construction of an L-group
extension of such a covering group (over a split reductive group) due to
Weissman, study some of its properties and discuss a variant of it. Using this
L-group extension, we describe a local Langlands correspondence for covering
(split) tori and unramified genuine representations, using work of Savin,
McNamara, Weissman and W.W. Li. Finally, we define the notion of automorphic
(partial) L-functions attached to genuine automorphic representations of the BD
covering groups.
