The DEPFET Collaboration pursues the development of a high resolution pixel
vertex detector for future colliders (like ILC), based on the integration of
amplifying transistors into a fully depleted bulk. In August 2008, six DEPFET
prototypes were tested in a pion beam at SPS complex at CERN, collecting more
than 20 million of events. In this contribution, the prototype system, the
experimental setup, the analysis software and preliminary results are
presented.
