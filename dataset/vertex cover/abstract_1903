A random geometric digraph $G_n$ is constructed by taking $\{X_1,X_2,...
X_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ independently at random with a common bounded density
function. Each vertex $X_i$ is assigned at random a sector $S_i$ of central
angle $\alpha$ with inclination $Y_i$, in a circle of radius $r$ (with vertex
$X_i$ as the origin). An arc is present from vertex $X_i$ to $X_j$, if $X_j$
falls in $S_i$. Suppose $k$ is fixed and $\{k_n\}$ is a sequence with $1\ll
k_n\ll n^{1/2}$, as $n\to\infty$. We prove central limit theorems for $k-$ and
$k_n-$nearest neighbor distance of out- and in-degrees in $G_n$. We also show
that the degree distribution of this model, which varies with the probability
distribution of the underlying point processes, can be either homogeneous or
inhomogeneous. Our work should provide valuable insights for alternative
mechanisms wrapped in real-world complex networks.
