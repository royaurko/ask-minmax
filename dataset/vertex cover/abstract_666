During the HERA luminosity shutdown period 2000/01 the tracking system of the
ZEUS experiment has been upgraded with a silicon Micro Vertex Detector (MVD).
The barrel part of the detector consists of three layers of single sided
silicon strip detectors, while the forward section is composed of four wheels.
In this report we shortly present the assembly procedure and in more details
the test beam results on the spatial resolution of half modules. The first
results of a cosmic ray test are presented and the radiation monitor system is
described.
