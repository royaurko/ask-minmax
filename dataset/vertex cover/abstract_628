In Rips Complexes and Covers in the Uniform Category (arXiv:0706.3937) we
define, following James, covering maps of uniform spaces and introduce the
concept of generalized uniform covering maps. In this paper we investigate when
these covering maps are induced by group actions. Also, as an application of
our results we present an exposition of Prajs' homogeneous curve that is
path-connected but not locally connected.
