In the family of clustering problems, we are given a set of objects (vertices
of the graph), together with some observed pairwise similarities (edges). The
goal is to identify clusters of similar objects by slightly modifying the graph
to obtain a cluster graph (disjoint union of cliques). Hueffner et al. [Theory
Comput. Syst. 2010] initiated the parameterized study of Cluster Vertex
Deletion, where the allowed modification is vertex deletion, and presented an
elegant O(2^k * k^9 + n * m)-time fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by
the solution size. In our work, we pick up this line of research and present an
O(1.9102^k * (n + m))-time branching algorithm.
