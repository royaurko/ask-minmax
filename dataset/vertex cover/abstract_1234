Iwasa investigated the preservation of various covering properties of
opological spaces under Cohen forcing. By improving the argument in Iwasa's
paper, we prove that the Rothberger property, the Menger property and selective
screenability are also preserved under Cohen forcing and forcing with the
measure algebra.
