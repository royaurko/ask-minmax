We present a local algorithm for finding dense subgraphs of bipartite graphs,
according to the definition of density proposed by Kannan and Vinay. Our
algorithm takes as input a bipartite graph with a specified starting vertex,
and attempts to find a dense subgraph near that vertex. We prove that for any
subgraph S with k vertices and density theta, there are a significant number of
starting vertices within S for which our algorithm produces a subgraph S' with
density theta / O(log n) on at most O(D k^2) vertices, where D is the maximum
degree. The running time of the algorithm is O(D k^2), independent of the
number of vertices in the graph.
