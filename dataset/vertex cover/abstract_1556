We examine the nucleon's electromagnetic form factors in a Poincare-covariant
Faddeev framework. The three-quark core contributions to the form factors are
obtained by employing a quark-diquark approximation. We implement the
self-consistent solution for the quark-photon vertex from its inhomogeneous
Bethe-Salpeter equation. We find that the resulting transverse parts which add
to the Ball-Chiu vertex have no significant impact on nucleon magnetic moments.
The current-quark mass evolution of the form factors agrees with results from
lattice QCD.
