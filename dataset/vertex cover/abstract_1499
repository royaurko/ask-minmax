It has been proposed recently that the topological A-model string theory on
local toric Calabi-Yau manifolds has a two parameter extension. Amplitudes of
the two parameter topological strings can be computed using a diagrammatic
method called the refined topological vertex. In this paper we study properties
of the refined amplitudes under the flop transition of toric Calabi-Yau
three-folds. We also discuss that the slicing invariance and the flop
transition imply a simple formula for the homological sl(N) invariants of the
Hopf link. The new expression for the invariants gives a simple refinement of
the Hopf link invariant of Chern-Simons theory.
