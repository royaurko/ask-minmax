In this paper we are concerned with contact processes with random vertex
weights on oriented lattices. In our model, we assume that each vertex x of Z^d
takes i. i. d. positive random value \rho(x). Vertex y infects vertex x at rate
proportional to \rho(x)\rho(y) when and only when there is an oriented edge
from y to x. We give the definition of the critical value \lambda_c of
infection rate under the annealed measure and show that
\lambda_c=[1+o(1)]/(dE\rho^2) as d grows to infinity. Classic contact processes
on oriented lattices and contact processes on clusters of oriented site
percolation are two special cases of our model.
