Let $\D$ be the Lie algebra of regular differentialoperators on ${\C}
\setminus \{0\}$, and ${\hD}= {\D} + {\C} C$ be the central extension of
${\D}$. Let $W_{1+\infty,-N}$ be the vertex algebra associated to the
irreducible vacuum $\hD$-module with the central charge $c=-N$. We show that
$W_{1+\infty,-N}$ is a subalgebra of the Heisenberg vertex algebra M(1) with $2
N$ generators, and construct 2N-dimensional family of irreducible
$W_{1+\infty,-N}$-modules. Considering these modules as $\hD$-modules, we
identify the corresponding highest weights.
