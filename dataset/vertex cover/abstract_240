We consider coverings of real algebraic curves to real rational algebraic
curves. We show the existence of such coverings having prescribed topological
degree on the real locus. From those existence results we prove some results on
Brill-Noether Theory for pencils on real curves. For coverings having
topological degree 0 we introduce the covering number k and we prove the
existence of coverings of degree 4 with prescribed covering number.
