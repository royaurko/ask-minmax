Loi and Piergallini showed that a smooth compact, connected $4$-manifold $X$
with boundary admits a Stein structure if and only if $X$ is a simple cover of
a $4$-disk $D^4$ branched along a positive braided surface $S$ in a bidisk
$D_{1}^{2} \times D_{2}^{2} \approx D^4$. For each integer $N$ greater than
one, we construct a braided surface $S_{N}$ in $D^4$ and simple covers
$X_{N,1}, X_{N,2}, \dots , X_{N,N}$ of $D^{4}$ branched along $S_{N}$ such that
the covers are mutually diffeomorphic, but the Stein structures determined by
the covers are mutually not homotopic. Furthermore, by reinterpreting this
result in terms of contact topology, we also construct transverse links in the
standard contact $3$-sphere and contact $3$-manifolds, similar to the above.
