Given a polynomial f and a finite field F one can construct a directed graph
where the vertices are the values in the finite field, and emanating from each
vertex is an edge joining the vertex to its image under f. When f is a
Chebyshev polynomial of prime degree, the graphs display an unusual degree of
symmetry. In this paper we provide a complete description of these graphs, and
also provide some examples of how these graphs can be used to determine the
decomposition of primes in certain field extensions.
