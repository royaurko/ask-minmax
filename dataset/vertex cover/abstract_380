This paper studies the twisted representations of vertex operator algebras.
Let V be a vertex operator algebra and g an automorphism of V of finite order
T. For any m,n in (1/T)Z_+, an A_{g,n}(V)-A_{g,m}(V)-bimodule A_{g,n,m}(V) is
constructed. The collection of these bimodules determines any admissible
g-twisted V-module completely. A Verma type admissible g-twisted V-module is
constructed naturally from any A_{g,m}(V)-module. Furthermore, it is shown with
the help of bimodule theory that a simple vertex operator algebra V is
g-rational if and only if its twisted associative algebra A_g(V) is semisimple
and each irreducible admissible g-twisted V-module is ordinary.
