Associated with every graph $G$ of chromatic number $\chi$ is another graph
$G'$. The vertex set of $G'$ consists of all $\chi$-colorings of $G$, and two
$\chi$-colorings are adjacent when they differ on exactly one vertex. According
to a conjecture of Bj\"{o}rner and Lov\'asz, this graph $G'$ must be
disconnected. In this note we give a counterexample to this conjecture.
