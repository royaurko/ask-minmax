The vertex for gluon emission during the splitting of a reggeized gluon into
two is constructed in the framework of Lipatov effective action formalism. Its
reduction to a pure transverse form for the diffractive amplitude gives the
standard Bartels vertex plus an additional contribution corresponding to the
emission from a pointlike splitting vertex. This additional contribution turns
out to be given by a longitudinal integral divergent both in the ultraviolet
and infrared. A certain specific recipe for this part, including the principal
value prescription for the integration, allows to eliminate this unwanted
contribution.
