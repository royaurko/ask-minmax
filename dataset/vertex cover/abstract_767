It was shown by Abe, Buhl and Dong that the vertex algebra $V_L^+$ and its
irreducible weak modules satisfy the $C_2$-cofiniteness condition when $L$ is a
positive definite even lattice. In this paper, we extend their results by
showing that the vertex algebra $V_L^+$ and its irreducible weak modules are
$C_2$-cofinite when $L$ is a negative definite even lattice and when $L$ is a
non-degenerate even lattice that is neither negative definite nor positive
definite.
