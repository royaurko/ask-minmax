We show that Albanese varieties of abelian covers of projective plane are
isogenous to product of isogeny components of abelian varieties associated with
singularities of the ramification locus. In particular Albanese varieties of
abelian covers of projective plane ramified over arrangements of lines and
uniformized by unit ball are isogenous to a product of Jacobians of Fermat
curves. Periodicity of the sequence of (semi-abelian) Albanese varieties of
unramified cyclic covers of complements to a plane singular curve is shown.
