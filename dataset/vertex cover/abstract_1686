We prove that a resolution of singularities of any finite covering of the
projective plane branched along a Hurwitz curve $\bar H$ and, maybe, along a
line "at infinity" can be embedded as a symplectic submanifold into some
projective algebraic manifold equipped with an integer K\"{a}hler symplectic
form (assuming that if $\bar H$ has negative nodes, then the covering is
non-singular over them). For cyclic coverings we can realize this embeddings
into a rational algebraic 3--fold. Properties of the Alexander polynomial of
$\bar{H}$ are investigated and applied to the calculation of the first Betti
number $b_1(\bar X_n)$ of a resolution $\bar X_n$ of singularities of
$n$-sheeted cyclic coverings of $\mathbb C\mathbb P^2$ branched along $\bar H$
and, maybe, along a line "at infinity". We prove that $b_1(\bar X_n)$ is even
if $\bar H$ is an irreducible Hurwitz curve but, in contrast to the algebraic
case, that it can take any non-negative value in the case when $\bar H$
consists of several irreducible components.
