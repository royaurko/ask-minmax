Zero forcing parameters, associated with graphs, have been studied for over a
decade, and have gained popularity as the number of related applications grows.
In particular, it is well-known that such parameters are related to certain
vertex coverings. Continuing along these lines, we investigate positive zero
forcing within the context of certain clique coverings. A key object considered
here is the compressed cliques graph. We study a number of properties
associated with the compressed cliques graph, including: uniqueness, forbidden
subgraphs, connections to Johnson graphs, and positive zero forcing.
