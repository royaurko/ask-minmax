We point out that the so--called 'radiative return' events at LEP2 are suited
to the study of nonstandard physics, particularly if the vector bosons are
emitted into the central detector region. An effective vertex is constructed
which contains the most general gauge invariant eeZGamma interaction and its
phenomenological consequences are examined. Low Energy Constraints on the
effective vertex are discussed as well.
