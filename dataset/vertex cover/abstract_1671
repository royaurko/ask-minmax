An IC-plane graph is a topological graph where every edge is crossed at most
once and no two crossed edges share a vertex. We show that every IC-plane graph
has a visibility drawing where every vertex is an L-shape, and every edge is
either a horizontal or vertical segment. As a byproduct of our drawing
technique, we prove that an IC-plane graph has a RAC drawing in quadratic area
with at most two bends per edge.
