A factor $u$ of a word $w$ is a cover of $w$ if every position in $w$ lies
within some occurrence of $u$ in $w$. A word $w$ covered by $u$ thus
generalizes the idea of a repetition, that is, a word composed of exact
concatenations of $u$. In this article we introduce a new notion of
$\alpha$-partial cover, which can be viewed as a relaxed variant of cover, that
is, a factor covering at least $\alpha$ positions in $w$. We develop a data
structure of $O(n)$ size (where $n=|w|$) that can be constructed in $O(n\log
n)$ time which we apply to compute all shortest $\alpha$-partial covers for a
given $\alpha$. We also employ it for an $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm computing
a shortest $\alpha$-partial cover for each $\alpha=1,2,\ldots,n$.
