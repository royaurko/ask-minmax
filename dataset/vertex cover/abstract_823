In this work we propose a mechanism for converting the spectral problem of
vertex models transfer matrices into the solution of certain linear partial
differential equations. This mechanism is illustrated for the
$U_q[\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(2)]$ invariant six-vertex model and the resulting
partial differential equation is studied for particular values of the lattice
length.
