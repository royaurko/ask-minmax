A set of proper subgroups is a covering for a group if its union is the whole
group. The minimal number of subgroups needed to cover $G$ is called the
covering number of $G$, denoted by $\sigma(G)$. Determining $\sigma(G)$ is an
open problem for many non-solvable groups. For symmetric groups $S_n$, Mar\'oti
determined $\sigma(S_n)$ for odd $n$ with the exception of $n=9$ and gave
estimates for $n$ even. In this paper we determine $\sigma(S_n)$ for $n = 8$,
$9$, $10$ and $12$. In addition we find the covering number for the Mathieu
group $M_{12}$ and improve an estimate given by Holmes for the Janko group
$J_1$.
