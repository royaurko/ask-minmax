A general multiband formulation of linear and non-linear optical response
functions for realistic models of correlated crystals is presented. Dipole
forbidden d-d optical transitions originate from the vertex functions, which we
consider assuming locality of irreducible four-leg vertex. The unified
formulation for second- and third-order response functions in terms of the
three-leg vertex is suitable for practical calculations in solids. We
illustrate the general approach by consideration of intraatomic spin-flip
contributions, with the energy of 2J, where J is a Hund exchange, in the
simplest two-orbital model.
