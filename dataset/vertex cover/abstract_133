The ZEUS detector has been used to study dissociation of virtual photons in
events with a leading proton, gamma^* p -> X p, in e^+p collisions at HERA. The
data cover photon virtualities in two ranges, 0.03<Q^2<0.60 GeV^2 and 2<Q^2<100
GeV^2, with M_X>1.5 GeV, where M_X is the mass of the hadronic final state, X.
Events were required to have a leading proton, detected in the ZEUS leading
proton spectrometer, carrying at least 90% of the incoming proton energy. The
cross section is presented as a function of t, the squared four-momentum
transfer at the proton vertex, Phi, the azimuthal angle between the positron
scattering plane and the proton scattering plane, and Q^2. The data are
presented in terms of the diffractive structure function, F_2^D(3). A
next-to-leading-order QCD fit to the higher-Q^2 data set and to previously
published diffractive charm production data is presented.
