We study properties of a C_2-cofinite vertex operator algebra of CFT type. If
it is also rational and V'\cong V, then the rigidity of the tensor category of
modules has been proved by Huang. When we treat an irrational C_2-cofinite VOA,
the rigidity is too strong, because it is almost equivalent to be rational as
we see. We introduce a natural weaker condition "semi-rigidity". Under this
condition, we prove the following results. For a projective cover P of a
V-module V and a finitely generated V-module M, the projective cover of M is a
direct summand of the tensor product P\boxtimes M defined by logarithmic
intertwining operators. Using this result, we prove the flatness property of
finitely generated modules for the tensor products, that is, if 0\to A\to B\to
C\to 0 is exact then so is 0\to D\boxtimes A\to D\boxtimes B\to D\boxtimes C\to
0 for any finitely generated V-modules A, B, C and D. As a corollary, we have
that if a semi-rigid C_2-cofinite V contains a rational subVOA with the same
Virasoro element, then V is rational.
