We introduce the notion of ``local system of $\Bbb{Z}_{T}$-twisted vertex
operators'' on a $\Bbb{Z}_{2}$-graded vector space $M$, generalizing the notion
of local system of vertex operators [Li]. First, we prove that any local system
of $\Bbb{Z}_{T}$-twisted vertex operators on $M$ has a vertex superalgebra
structure with an automorphism $\sigma$ of order $T$ with $M$ as a
$\sigma$-twisted module. Then we prove that for a vertex (operator)
superalgebra $V$ with an automorphism $\sigma$ of order $T$, giving a
$\sigma$-twisted $V$-module $M$ is equivalent to giving a vertex (operator)
superalgebra homomorphism from $V$ to some local system of
$\Bbb{Z}_{T}$-twisted vertex operators on $M$. As applications, we study the
twisted modules for vertex operator (super)algebras associated to some
well-known infinite-dimensional Lie (super)algebras and we prove the complete
reducibility of $\Bbb{Z}_{T}$-twisted modules for vertex operator algebras
associated to standard modules for an affine Lie algebra.
