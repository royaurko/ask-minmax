It is proved that Zhu's algebra for vertex operator algebra associated to a
positive-definite even lattice of rank one is a finite-dimensional
semiprimitive quotient algebra of certain associative algebra introduced by
Smith. Zhu's algebra for vertex operator algebra associated to any
positive-definite even lattice is also calculated and is related to a
generalization of Smith's algebra.
