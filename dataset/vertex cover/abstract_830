We study the thermodynamic limit of the six-vertex model with domain wall
boundary and reflecting end. We evaluated the partition function explicitly in
special cases. We calculated the homogeneous limit of the Tsuchiya determinant
formula for the partition function. We evaluated the thermodynamic limit and
obtain the free energy of the six-vertex model with reflecting end. We
determined the free energy in the disordered regime.
