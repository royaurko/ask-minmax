Vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $n$-colors can be equivalently thought to
be a graph homomorphism (edge preserving vertex mapping) of $G$ to the complete
graph $K_n$ of order $n$. So, in that sense, the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of
$G$ will be the order of the smallest complete graph to which $G$ admits a
homomorphism to. As every graph, which is not a complete graph, admits a
homomorphism to a smaller complete graph, we can redefine the chromatic number
$\chi(G)$ of $G$ to be the order of the smallest graph to which $G$ admits a
homomorphism to. Of course, such a smallest graph must be a complete graph as
they are the only graphs with chromatic number equal to their order.
  The concept of vertex coloring can be generalize for other types of graphs.
Naturally, the chromatic number is defined to be the order of the smallest
graph (of the same type) to which a graph admits homomorphism to. The analogous
notion of clique turns out to be the graphs with order equal to their (so
defined) "chromatic number". These "cliques" turns out to be much more
complicated than their undirected counterpart and are interesting objects of
study. In this article, we mainly study different aspects of "cliques" for
signed (graphs with positive or negative signs assigned to each edge) and
switchable signed graphs (equivalence class of signed graph with respect to
switching signs of edges incident to the same vertex).
