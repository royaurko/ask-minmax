We study the properties of shifted vertex operator algebras, which are vertex
algebras derived from a given theory by shifting the conformal vector. In this
way, we are able to exhibit large numbers of vertex operator algebras which are
regular(rational and C_2-cofinite) and yet are pathological in one way or
another.
