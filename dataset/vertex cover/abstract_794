We calculate in the BFKL approach the jet vertex relevant for the production
of Mueller-Navelet jets in proton-proton collisions. We consider both cases of
incoming quark and gluon and show explicitly that all infrared divergences
cancel when renormalized parton densities are considered. Finally we compare
our expression for the vertex with a previous calculation [1].
