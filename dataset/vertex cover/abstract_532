We study numerically and partly diagrammatically the renormalization of the
electron-spin interaction or vertex in a two-dimensional one-band Hubbard model
with spin-fluctuation momentum transfer ${\vv q}=(\pi,\pi)$. We find that the
renormalized electron-spin vertex decreases quite generally with decreasing
temperature at all doping densities. As a combination of two concurring
effects, i.e. the decrease of the vertex and the increase of the spin
susceptibility, the effective pairing interaction increases with lowering
temperature in the intermediate-correlation regime, but {\it flattens off} in
the strong-correlation regime. Our findings indicate that in the high-T$_c$
cuprates the pairing mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations is
substantially reduced due to vertex corrections.
