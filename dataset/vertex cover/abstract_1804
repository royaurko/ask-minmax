Within the framework of the Dyson-Schwinger equations in the axial gauge, we
study the effect that non-perturbative glue has on the quark propagator. We
show that Ward-Takahashi identities, combined with the requirement of matching
perturbative QCD at high momentum transfer, guarantee the multiplicative
renormalisability of the answer. Technically, the matching with perturbation
theory is accomplished by the introduction of a transverse part to the
quark-gluon vertex. We show that this transverse vertex is crucial for chiral
symmetry breaking, and that massless solutions exist below a critical value of
the strong coupling constant. Using the gluon propagator that we previously
calculated, we obtain small corrections to the quark propagator, which keeps a
pole at the origin in the chiral phase.
