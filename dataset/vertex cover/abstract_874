We present the ultraviolet poles and finite terms of two-loop vertex
corrections for diagrams with massive partons in the eikonal approximation. We
discover and prove that the results for a set of the corrections generalize to
n-loop eikonal diagrams. These results will enhance theoretical understanding
and allow greater calculational accuracy for the many partonic processes where
the eikonal approximation is applied.
