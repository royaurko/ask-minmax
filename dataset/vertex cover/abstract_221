In the references [HL1]--[HL5] and [H1], a theory of tensor products of
modules for a vertex operator algebra is being developed. To use this theory,
one first has to verify that the vertex operator algebra satisfies certain
conditions. We show in the present paper that for any vertex operator algebra
containing a vertex operator subalgebra isomorphic to a tensor product algebra
of minimal Virasoro vertex operator algebras (vertex operator algebras
associated to minimal models), the tensor product theory can be applied. In
particular, intertwining operators for such a vertex operator algebra satisfy
the (nonmeromorphic) commutativity (locality) and the (nonmeromorphic)
associativity (operator product expansion). Combined with a result announced in
[HL4], the results of the present paper also show that the category of modules
for such a vertex operator algebra has a natural structure of a braided tensor
category. In particular, for any pair $p, q$ of relatively prime positive
integers larger than $1$, the category of minimal modules of central charge
$1-6\frac{(p-q)^{2}}{pq}$ for the Virasoro algebra has a natural structure of a
braided tensor category.
