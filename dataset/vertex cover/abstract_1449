We show how the evolving set methodology of Morris and Peres can be used to
show Cheeger inequalities for bounding the spectral gap of a finite Markov
kernel. This leads to sharp versions of several previous Cheeger inequalities,
including ones involving edge-expansion, vertex-expansion, and mixtures of
both. A bound on the smallest eigenvalue also follows.
