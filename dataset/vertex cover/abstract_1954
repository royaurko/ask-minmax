The three-gluon vertex is a basic object of interest in nonabelian gauge
theory. It contains important structural information, in particular on infrared
divergences, and also figures prominently in the Schwinger-Dyson equations. At
the one-loop level, it has been calculated and analyzed by a number of contributors.
Here we use the worldline formalism to unify the calculations of the scalar,
spinor and gluon loop contributions to the one-loop vertex, leading to an
extremely compact representation. The SUSY - related sum rule found by Binger
and Brodsky follows from an off-shell extension of the Bern-Kosower replacement
rules. We explain the relation of the structure of our representation to the
low-energy effective action.
