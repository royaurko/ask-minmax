This is the first part in a series of papers developing a tensor product
theory for modules for a vertex operator algebra. The goal of this theory is to
construct a ``vertex tensor category'' structure on the category of modules for
a suitable vertex operator algebra. The notion of vertex tensor category is
essentially a ``complex analogue'' of the notion of symmetric tensor category,
and in fact a vertex tensor category produces a braided tensor category in a
natural way. The theory applies in particular to many familiar ``rational''
vertex operator algebras, including those associated with WZNW models, minimal
models and the moonshine module. In this paper (Part I), we introduce the
notions of $P(z)$- and $Q(z)$-tensor product, where $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$ are two
special elements of the moduli space of spheres with punctures and local
coordinates, and we present the fundamental properties and constructions of
$Q(z)$-tensor products.
