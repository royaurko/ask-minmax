This paper presents a study of vertex tracking with a beam hodoscope
consisting of three layers of monolithic pixel sensors in SOI technology on
high-resistivity substrate. We study the track extrapolation accuracy,
two-track separation and vertex reconstruction accuracy in pion-Cu interactions
with 150 and 300 GeV/c pions at the CERN SPS. Results are discussed in the
context of vertex tracking at future lepton colliders.
