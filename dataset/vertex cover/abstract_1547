A boundary one point function related to the boundary spontaneous
polarization, which is different from the ones considered in the past, is
studied for the six vertex model on a 2N \times N lattice with domain wall
boundary condition and left reflecting end. It is expressible in terms of a
special kind of coordinate space wave functions, which can be expressed as
determinants.
