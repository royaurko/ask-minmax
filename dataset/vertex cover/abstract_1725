A vertex algebra is an algebraic counterpart of a two-dimensional conformal
field theory. We give a new definition of a vertex algebra which includes
chiral algebras as a special case, but allows for fields which are neither
meromorphic nor anti-meromorphic. To any complex torus equipped with a flat
Kahler metric and a closed 2-form we associate an N=2 superconformal vertex
algebra (N=2 SCVA) in the sense of our definition. We find a criterion for two
different tori to produce isomorphic N=2 SCVA's. We show that for algebraic
tori isomorphism of N=2 SCVA's implies the equivalence of the derived
categories of coherent sheaves corresponding to the tori or their
noncommutative generalizations (Azumaya algebras over tori). We also find a
criterion for two different tori to produce N=2 SCVA's related by a mirror
morphism. If the 2-form is of type (1,1), this condition is identical to the
one proposed by Golyshev, Lunts, and Orlov, who used an entirely different
approach inspired by the Homological Mirror Symmetry Conjecture of Kontsevich.
Our results suggest that Kontsevich's conjecture must be modified: coherent
sheaves must be replaced with modules over Azumaya algebras, and the Fukaya
category must be ``twisted'' by a closed 2-form. We also describe the
implications of our results for BPS D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds.
