A cover of a finite non-cyclic group $G$ is a family $\mathcal{H}$ of proper
subgroups of $G$ whose union equals $G$. A cover of $G$ is called minimal if it
has minimal size, and irredundant if it does not properly contain any other
cover. We classify the finite non-cyclic groups all of whose irredundant covers
are minimal.
