We explain how sheaves of vertex algebras are related to mathematical
structures encoded by a class of Lagrangians. The exposition is focused on two
examples: the WZW model and the (1,1)-supersymmetric $\sigma$-model. We
conclude by showing how to construct a family of vertex algebras with base the
Barannikov-Kontsevich moduli space.
