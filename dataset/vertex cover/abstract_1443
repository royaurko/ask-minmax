We construct an action of a braid group associated to a complete graph on the
derived category of a certain symmetric Nakayama algebra which is also a Brauer
star algebra with no exceptional vertex. We connect this action with the affine
braid group action on Brauer star algebras defined by Schaps and Zakay-Illouz.
We show that for Brauer star algebras with no exceptional vertex, the action is
faithful.
