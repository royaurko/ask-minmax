We argue that recent calculations by Amin and Stamp (PRL 77, 301
(1996); cond-mat/9601086) overestimate the strength of the vertex corrections
in the spin-fermion model for cuprates. We clarify the physical origin of the
apparent discrepancy between their results and earlier calculations. We also
comment on the relative sign of the vertex correction.
