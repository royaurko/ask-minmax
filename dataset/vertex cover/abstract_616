We prove the homotopy invariance of L^2 torsion for covering spaces, whenever
the covering transformation group is either residually finite or amenable. In
the case when the covering transformation group is residually finite and when
the L^2 cohomology of the covering space vanishes, the homotopy invariance was
established earlier by Lueck. We also give some applications of our results.
