We consider the class of the topologically locally finite (in short TLF)
planar vertex-transitive graphs, a class containing in particular all the
one-ended planar Cayley graphs and the normal transitive tilings. We
characterize these graphs with a finite local representation and a special kind
of finite state automaton named labeling scheme. As a result, we are able to
enumerate and describe all TLF-planar vertex-transitive graphs of any given
degree. Also, we are able decide to whether any TLF-planar transitive graph is
Cayley or not.
