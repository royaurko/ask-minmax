We construct several modular compactifications of the Hurwitz space
$H^d_{g/h}$ of genus $g$ curves expressed as $d$-sheeted, simply branched
covers of genus $h$ curves. These compactifications are obtained by allowing
the branch points of the covers to collide to a variable extent. They are very
well-behaved if $d = 2, 3$, or if relatively few collisions are allowed. We
recover as special cases the spaces of twisted admissible covers of Abramovich,
Corti and Vistoli and the spaces of hyperelliptic curves of Fedorchuk.
