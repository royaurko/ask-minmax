In this paper we survey the behavior of various graph operations on the graph
parameters clique-width and NLC-width. We give upper and lower bounds for the
clique-width and NLC-width of the modified graphs in terms of the clique-width
and NLC-width of the involved graphs. Therefore we consider the binary graph
operations join, disjoint union, union, products, corona, substitution, and
1-sum, and the unary graph operations subgraph, edge complement, bipartite edge
complement, power of graphs, line graphs, local complementation, switching,
edge addition, edge deletion, edge subdivision, vertex identification, and
vertex addition.
