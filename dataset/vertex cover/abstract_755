We consider genus one n-point functions for a vertex operator superalgebra
with a real grading. We compute all n-point functions for rank one and rank two
fermion vertex operator superalgebras. In the rank two fermion case, we obtain
all orbifold n-point functions for a twisted module associated with a
continuous automorphism generated by a Heisenberg bosonic state. The modular
properties of these orbifold n-point functions are given and we describe a
generalization of Fay's trisecant identity for elliptic functions.
