We prove the rationality of all the minimal series principal W-algebras
discovered by Frenkel, Kac and Wakimoto in 1992, thereby giving a new family of
rational and C_2-cofinite vertex operator algebras. A key ingredient in our
proof is the study of Zhu's algebra of simple W-algebras via the quantized
Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. We show that the functor of taking Zhu's algebra
commutes with the reduction functor. Using this general fact we determine the
maximal spectrums of the associated graded of Zhu's algebra of all the
admissible affine vertex algebras as well.
