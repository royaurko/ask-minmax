A summary of the construction procedure of generalized versions of Baxter's
Q-operator is given. Illustrated by several figures and diagrams the use of
representation theory is explained step-by-step avoiding technical details. The
relation with the infinite-dimensional non-abelian symmetries of the six-vertex
model at roots of unity is discussed and parallels with the eight-vertex case
outlined.
