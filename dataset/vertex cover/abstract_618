We generalize results of the paper math.AG/9803144, in which Chisini's
conjecture on the unique reconstruction of f by the curve B is investigated.
For this fibre products of generic coverings are studied. The main inequality
bounding the degree of a covering in the case of existence of two nonequivalent
coverings with the branch curve B is obtained. This inequality is used for the
proof of the Chisini conjecture for m-canonical coverings of surfaces of
general type for $m\ge 5$.
