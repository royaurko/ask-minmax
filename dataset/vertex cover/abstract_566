We study planar "vertex" models, which are probability measures on edge
subsets of a planar graph, satisfying certain constraints at each vertex,
examples including dimer model, and 1-2 model, which we will define. We express
the local statistics of a large class of vertex models on a finite hexagonal
lattice as a linear combination of the local statistics of dimers on the
corresponding Fisher graph, with the help of a generalized holographic
algorithm. Using an $n\times n$ torus to approximate the periodic infinite
graph, we give an explicit integral formula for the free energy and local
statistics for configurations of the vertex model on an infinite bi-periodic
graph. As an example, we simulate the 1-2 model by the technique of Glauber
dynamics.
