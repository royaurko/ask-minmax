The aim of this paper is to present a few versions of the Riemann-Hurwitz
formula for a regular branched covering of graphs. By a graph, we mean a finite
connected multigraph. The genus of a graph is defined as the rank of the first
homology group. We consider a finite group acting on a graph, possibly with
fixed and invertible edges, and the respective factor graph. Then, the obtained
Riemann-Hurwitz formula relates genus of the graph with genus of the factor
graph and orders of the vertex and edge stabilisers.
