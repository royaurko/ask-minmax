The vertex arboricity $a(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that
$V(G)$ can be partitioned into $k$ sets where each set induces a forest. For a
planar graph $G$, it is known that $a(G)\leq 3$. In two recent papers, it was
proved that planar graphs without $k$-cycles for some $k\in\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$
have vertex arboricity at most 2. For a toroidal graph $G$, it is known that
$a(G)\leq 4$. Let us consider the following question: do toroidal graphs
without $k$-cycles have vertex arboricity at most 2? It was known that the
question is true for k=3, and recently, Zhang proved the question is true for
$k=5$. Since a complete graph on 5 vertices is a toroidal graph without any
$k$-cycles for $k\geq 6$ and has vertex arboricity at least three, the only
unknown case was k=4. We solve this case in the affirmative; namely, we show
that toroidal graphs without 4-cycles have vertex arboricity at most 2.
