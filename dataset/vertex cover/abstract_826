For a given finite directed graph $G$, there are two types of Markov-Dyck
shifts, the Markov-Dyck shift $D_G^V$ of vertex type and the Markov-Dyck shift
$D_G^E$ of edge type. It is shown that, if $G$ does not have multi-edges, the
former is a finite-to-one factor of the latter, and they have the same
topological entropy. An expression for the zeta function of a Markov-Dyck shift
of vertex type is given. It is different from that of the Markov-Dyck shift of
edge type.
