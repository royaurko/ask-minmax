Community detection and edge prediction are both forms of link mining: they
are concerned with discovering the relations between vertices in networks. Some
of the vertex similarity measures used in edge prediction are closely related
to the concept of community structure. We use this insight to propose a novel
method for improving existing community detection algorithms by using a simple
vertex similarity measure. We show that this new strategy can be more effective
in detecting communities than the basic community detection algorithms.
