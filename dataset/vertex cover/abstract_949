In this article, we calculated the refined topological vertex for the one
parameter case using the Jack symmetric functions. Also, we obtain the
partition function for elliptic N=2 models, the results coincide with those of
Nekrasov instanton counting partition functions for the $N=2^{\ast}$ theories.
