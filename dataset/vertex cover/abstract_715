For vertex operator algebra V_{\sqrt{2}A_l} associated to the even lattice
\sqrt{2}A_l which is \sqrt{2} times root lattice of type A_l, it was shown by
Dong-Li-Maosn-Norton that the Virasoro vector is a sum of l+1 mutually
orthogonal conformal vectors with central charges c_i=1-6/(i+2)(i+3) for
i=1,...,l and c_{l+1}=2l/(l+3) and the subalgebra T generated by these vectors
is a tensor product of Virasoro vertex operator algebras L(c_i,0). In this
paper we determine the decomposition of V_{\sqrt{2}A_3} into the sum of
irreducible T-modules completely.
