We present an algebraic Bethe ansatz for certain submanifolds of the bilayer
vertex models proposed by Shiroishi and Wadati as coupled asymmetric six-vertex
free-fermion models. A peculiar feature of our formulation is the presence of a
diagonal monodromy matrix element that does not generate unwanted terms. The
model contains two free-parameters entering into the Bethe ansatz equations as
a pure phase factor.
