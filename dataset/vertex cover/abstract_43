We establish a twisted analog of our recent work on vertex representations
and the McKay correspondence. For each finite group $\Gamma$ and a virtual
character of $\Gamma$ we construct twisted vertex operators on the Fock space
spanned by the super spin characters of the spin wreath products
$\Gamma\wr\widetilde{S}_n$ of $\Gamma$ and a double cover of the symmetric
group $S_n$ for all $n$. When $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb C)$ with
the McKay virtual character, our construction gives a group theoretic
realization of the basic representations of the twisted affine and twisted
toroidal algebras. When $\Gamma$ is an arbitrary finite group and the virtual
character is trivial, our vertex operator construction yields the spin
character tables for $\Gamma\wr\widetilde{S}_n$.
