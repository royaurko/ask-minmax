The nonperturbative mechanism of baryon-antibaryon production due to double
quark pair $(q\bar q)$($q\bar q)$ generation inside a hadron is considered and
the amplitude is calculated as matrix element of the vertex operator between
initial and final hadron wave functions. The vertex operator is expressed
solely in terms of first principle input: current quark masses, string tension
$\sigma$ and $\alpha_s$. In contrast to meson-meson production via single pair
generation, in baryon case a new entity appears in the vertex: the vacuum
correlation length $\lambda $, which was computed before through string tension
$\sigma$. As an application electroproduction of $\Lambda_c \bar\Lambda_c$ was
calculated and an enhancement near 4.61 GeV was found in agreement with recent
experimental data.
