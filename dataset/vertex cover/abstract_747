The class framework developed for vertex reconstruction in CMS is described.
We emphasize how we proceed to develop a flexible, efficient and reliable piece
of reconstruction software. We describe the decomposition of the algorithms
into logical parts, the mathematical toolkit, and the way vertex reconstruction
integrates into the CMS reconstruction project ORCA. We discuss the tools that
we have developed for algorithm evaluation and optimization and for code
release.
