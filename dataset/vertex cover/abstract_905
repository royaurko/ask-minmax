This paper gives an analogue of A_g(V) theory for a vertex operator
superalgebra V and an automorphism g of finite order. The relation between the
g-twisted V-modules and A_g(V)-modules is established. It is proved that if V
is g-rational, then A_g(V) is finite dimensional semisimple associative algebra
and there are only finitely many irreducible g-twisted V-modules.
