We apply the pinch technique , which is a method to construct the gauge
independent off-shell Green's functions, to the process $e^-\gamma \rightarrow
W^-\nu$ to study the effects of radiative corrections to $WW\gamma$ three gauge
boson vertex. The one-loop contributions to the anomalous gauge boson couplings
are estimated in the standard model.
