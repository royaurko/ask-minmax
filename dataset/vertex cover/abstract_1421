We derive the exchange relations of the vertex operators of $U_q(A_2^{(2)})$
and show that these vertex operators give the bosonization of the
Izergin-Korepin model. We give an integral expression of the correlation
functions of the Izergin-Korepin model and derive the difference equations
which they satisfy.
