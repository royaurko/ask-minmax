Let V be a simple vertex operator algebra and let G be a finite automorphism
group of V. In [DY], it was shown that any irreducible V-module is a completely
reducible V^G-module where V^G is the G-invariant sub-vertex operator algebra
of V. In this paper, we give an alternative proof of this fact using the theory
of skew group algebras. We also extend this result to any irreducible g-twisted
V-module when g is in the center of G and V is a g-rational vertex operator
algebra.
