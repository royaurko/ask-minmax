Large scale graph processing is a major research area for Big Data
exploration. Vertex centric programming models like Pregel are gaining traction
due to their simple abstraction that allows for scalable execution on
distributed systems naturally. However, there are limitations to this approach
which cause vertex centric algorithms to under-perform due to poor compute to
communication overhead ratio and slow convergence of iterative superstep. In
this paper we introduce GoFFish a scalable sub-graph centric framework
co-designed with a distributed persistent graph storage for large scale graph
analytics on commodity clusters. We introduce a sub-graph centric programming
abstraction that combines the scalability of a vertex centric approach with the
flexibility of shared memory sub-graph computation. We map Connected
Components, SSSP and PageRank algorithms to this model to illustrate its
flexibility. Further, we empirically analyze GoFFish using several real world
graphs and demonstrate its significant performance improvement, orders of
magnitude in some cases, compared to Apache Giraph, the leading open source
vertex centric implementation.
