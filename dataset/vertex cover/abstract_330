Let M(1) be the vertex algebra for a single free boson. We classify
irreducible modules of certain vertex subalgebras of M(1) generated by two
generators. These subalgebras correspond to the W(2, 2p-1)--algebras with
central charge $1- 6 \frac{(p - 1) ^{2}}{p}$ where p is a positive integer, $p
\ge 2$. We also determine the associated Zhu's algebras.
