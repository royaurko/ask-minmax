We define an integral intertwining operator among modules for a vertex
operator algebra to be an intertwining operator which respects integral forms
in the modules, and we show that an intertwining operator is integral if it is
integral when restricted to generators of the integral forms in the modules. We
apply this result to classify integral intertwining operators which respect
certain natural integral forms in modules for affine Lie algebra and lattice
vertex operator algebras.
