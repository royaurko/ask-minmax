In this paper the W-algebra W(2,2) and its representation theory are studied.
It is proved that a simple vertex operator algebra generated by two weight 2
vectors is either a vertex operator algebra associated to a highest irreducible
W(2,2)-module or a tensor product of two irreducible Virasoro vertex operator
algebras. Furthermore, any rational, C_2-cofinite simple vertex operator
algebra whose weight 1 subspace is zero and weight 2 subspace is 2-dimensional,
and with central charge c=1 is isomorphic to L(1/2,0)\otimes L(1/2,0).
