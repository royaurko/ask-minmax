We continue the study of the vertex operator algebra $L(k,0)$ associated to a
type $G_2^{(1)}$ affine Lie algebra at admissible one-third integer levels, $k
= -2 + m + \tfrac{i}{3}\ (m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}, i = 1,2)$, initiated in
\cite{AL}. Our main result is that there is a finite number of irreducible
$L(k,0)$-modules from the category $\mathcal{O}$. The proof relies on the
knowledge of an explicit formula for the singular vectors. After obtaining this
formula, we are able to show that there are only finitely many irreducible
$A(L(k,0))$-modules form the category $\mathcal{O}$. The main result then
follows from the bijective correspondence in $A(V)$-theory.
