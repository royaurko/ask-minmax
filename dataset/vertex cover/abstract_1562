We prove that $\chi(G) \leq \max {\omega(G), \Delta_2(G), (5/6)(\Delta(G) +
1)}$ for every graph $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 3$. Here $\Delta_2$ is the
parameter introduced by Stacho that gives the largest degree that a vertex $v$
can have subject to the condition that $v$ is adjacent to a vertex whose degree
is at least as large as its own. This upper bound generalizes both Brooks'
Theorem and the Ore-degree version of Brooks' Theorem.
