In this paper, we compute the number of covers of curves with given branch
behavior in characteristic p for one class of examples with four branch points
and degree p. Our techniques involve related computations in the case of three
branch points, and allow us to conclude in many cases that for a particular
choice of degeneration, all the covers we consider degenerate to separable
(admissible) covers. Starting from a good understanding of the complex case,
the proof is centered on the theory of stable reduction of Galois covers.
