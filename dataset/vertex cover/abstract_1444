This paper presents a solution of the polycirculant conjecture which states
that every vertex-transitive graph G has an automorphism that permutes the
vertices in cycles of the same length. This is done by identifying
vertex-transitive graphs as coset graphs. For a coset graph H, an equivalence
relation $\sim$ is defined on the vertices of cosets with classes as double
cosets of the stabiliser and any other proper subgroup A' of a transitive group
A of G. Induced left translations of elements of the subgroup A' are
semi-regular since they preserve these double cosets and acts regularly on each
of them. The coset graph is equivalent to G by a theorem of Sabidussi.
