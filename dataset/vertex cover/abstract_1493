We study a random graph $G_n$, which combines aspects of geometric random
graphs and preferential attachment. The resulting random graphs have power-law
degree sequences with finite mean and possibly infinite variance. In
particular, the power-law exponent can be any value larger than 2.
  The vertices of $G_n$ are $n$ sequentially generated vertices chosen at
random in the unit sphere in $\mathbb R^3$. A newly added vertex has $m$ edges
attached to it and the endpoints of these edges are connected to old vertices
or to the added vertex itself. The vertices are chosen with probability
proportional to their current degree plus some initial attractiveness and
multiplied by a function, depending on the geometry.
