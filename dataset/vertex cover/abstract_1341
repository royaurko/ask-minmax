We compute the virtual next-to-leading corrections to the Lipatov vertex in
the helicity-amplitude formalism. These agree with previous results by Fadin
and collaborators, in the conventional dimensional-regularization scheme. We
discuss the choice of reggeization scale in order to minimize its impact on the
next-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to the BFKL equation.
