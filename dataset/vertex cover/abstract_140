The dissociation of virtual photons, $\gamma^{\star} p \to X p$, in events
with a large rapidity gap between $X$ and the outgoing proton, as well as in
events in which the leading proton was directly measured, has been studied with
the ZEUS detector at HERA. The data cover photon virtualities $Q^2>2$ GeV$^2$
and $\gamma^{\star} p$ centre-of-mass energies $40<W<240$ GeV, with $M_X>2$
GeV, where $M_X$ is the mass of the hadronic final state, $X$. Leading protons
were detected in the ZEUS leading proton spectrometer. The cross section is
presented as a function of $t$, the squared four-momentum transfer at the
proton vertex and $\Phi$, the azimuthal angle between the positron scattering
plane and the proton scattering plane. It is also shown as a function of $Q^2$
and $\xpom$, the fraction of the proton's momentum carried by the diffractive
exchange, as well as $\beta$, the Bjorken variable defined with respect to the
diffractive exchange.
