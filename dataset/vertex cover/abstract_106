The boxicity of a graph $G$ is the least integer $d$ such that $G$ has an
intersection model of axis-aligned $d$-dimensional boxes. Boxicity, the problem
of deciding whether a given graph $G$ has boxicity at most $d$, is NP-complete
for every fixed $d \ge 2$. We show that boxicity is fixed-parameter tractable
when parameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number of the input graph.
This generalizes the result of Adiga et al., that boxicity is fixed-parameter
tractable in the vertex cover number.
  Moreover, we show that boxicity admits an additive $1$-approximation when
parameterized by the pathwidth of the input graph.
  Finally, we provide evidence in favor of a conjecture of Adiga et al. that
boxicity remains NP-complete when parameterized by the treewidth.
