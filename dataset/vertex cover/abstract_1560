We study the relationship between the momentum twistor MHV vertex expansion
of planar amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills and the all-loop generalization of
the BCFW recursion relations. We demonstrate explicitly in several examples
that the MHV vertex expressions for tree-level amplitudes and loop integrands
satisfy the recursion relations. Furthermore, we introduce a rewriting of the
MHV expansion in terms of sums over non-crossing partitions and show that this
cyclically invariant formula satisfies the recursion relations for all numbers
of legs and all loop orders.
