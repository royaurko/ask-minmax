In this talk we present a new method for determining the nonperturbative
quark-gluon vertex, which constitutes a crucial ingredient for a variety of
theoretical and phenomenological studies. This new method relies heavily on the
exact all-order relation connecting the conventional quark-gluon vertex with
the corresponding vertex of the background field method, which is Abelian-like.
The longitudinal part of this latter quantity is fixed using the standard gauge
technique, whereas the transverse is estimated with the help of the so-called
transverse Ward identities. This method allows the approximate determination of
the nonperturbative behavior of all twelve form factors comprising the
quark-gluon vertex, for arbitrary values of the momenta. Numerical results are
presented for the form factors in three special kinematical configurations
(soft gluon and quark symmetric limit, zero quark momentum), and compared with
the corresponding lattice data.
