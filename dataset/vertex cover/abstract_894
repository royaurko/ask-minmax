We investigate the general structure of the automorphism group and the Lie
algebra of derivations of a finitely generated vertex operator algebra. The
automorphism group is isomorphic to an algebraic group. Under natural
assumptions, the derivation algebra has an invariant bilinear form and the
ideal of inner derivations is nonsingular.
