In this paper, for every one-dimensional formal group $F$ we formulate and
study a notion of vertex $F$-algebra and a notion of $\phi$-coordinated module
for a vertex $F$-algebra where $\phi$ is what we call an associate of $F$. In
the case that $F$ is the additive formal group, vertex $F$-algebras are exactly
ordinary vertex algebras. We give a canonical isomorphism between the category
of vertex $F$-algebras and the category of ordinary vertex algebras. Meanwhile,
for every formal group we completely determine its associates. We also study
$\phi$-coordinated modules for a general vertex $\Z$-graded algebra $V$ with
$\phi$ specialized to a particular associate of the additive formal group and
we give a canonical connection between $V$-modules and $\phi$-coordinate
modules for a vertex algebra obtained from $V$ by Zhu's change-of-variables
theorem.
