We compute semiclassically the two-point correlator of the marginal vertex
operators describing the rigid circular spinning string state with one large
spin and one windining number in AdS_5 and three large spins and three winding
numbers in S^5. The marginality condition and the conformal invariant
expression for the two-point correlator obtained by using an appropriate vertex
operator are shown to be associated with the diagonal and off-diagonal Virasoro
constraints respectively. We evaluate semiclassically the three-point
correlator of two heavy circular string vertex operators and one zero-momentum
dilaton vertex operator and discuss its relation with the derivative of the
dimension of the heavy circular string state with respect to the string
tension.
