A general random graph evolution mechanism is defined. The evolution is a
combination of the preferential attachment model and the interaction of N
vertices (N>=3). A vertex in the graph is characterized by its degree and its
weight. The weight of a given vertex is the number of the interactions of the
vertex. The asymptotic behaviour of the graph is studied. Scale-free properties
both for the degrees and the weights are proved. It turns out that any exponent
in (2,\infty) can be achieved. The proofs are based on discrete time martingale
theory.
