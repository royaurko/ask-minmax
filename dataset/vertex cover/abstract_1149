We provide related Dehn surgery descriptions for rational homology spheres
and a class of their regular finite cyclic covering spaces. As an application,
we use the surgery descriptions to relate the Casson invariants of the covering
spaces to that of the base space. Finally, we show that this places
restrictions on the number of finite and cyclic Dehn fillings of the knot
complements in the covering spaces beyone those imposed by
Culler-Gordon-Luecke-Shalen and Boyer-Zhang.
