Assuming the existence of the L-operators, we study the Hopf algebroid
structure of U_{q,p}(B_N^{(1)}). As an application, we derive the type I and II
vertex operators, which intertwine the U_{q,p}(B_N^{(1)})-modules of generic
level, by assuming some analytic properties of the L-operators. For the level-1
case, we construct their free field realizations and show that the results
satisfy the desired commutation relations with coefficients given by the
elliptic dynamical R-matrices of the B_N^{(1)} type.
