The potential of LC+HERA based gamma-p collider to probe WW-gamma vertex is
presented through the discussion of sensitivity to anomalous couplings and
p_{T} distribution of the final quark. The limits of -0.16<(kappa-1)<0.14,
 -0.30<lambda<0.30, at 95% C.L. can be reached with integrated luminosity
100pb^{-1} and they are competitive to projected future limits from other
colliders. The results are compared with corresponding ep collider using
Weizsacker-Williams Approximation.
