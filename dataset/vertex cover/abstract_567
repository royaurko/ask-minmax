A vertex operator approach for form factors of Belavin's
$(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$-symmetric model is constructed on the basis of
bosonization of vertex operators in the $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$ model and vertex-face
transformation. As simple application for $n=2$, we obtain expressions for
$2m$-point form factors related to the $\sigma^z$ and $\sigma^x$ operators in
the eight-vertex model.
