In the classical pure spinor worldsheet theory of AdS5xS5 there are some
vertex operators which do not correspond to any physical excitations. We study
their flat space limit. We find that the BRST operator of the worldsheet theory
in flat space-time can be nontrivially deformed without deforming the
worldsheet action. Some of these deformations describe the linear dilaton
background. But the deformation corresponding to the nonphysical vertex differs
from the linear dilaton in not being worldsheet parity even. The nonphysically
deformed worldsheet theory has nonzero beta-function at one loop. This means
that the classical Type IIB SUGRA backgrounds are not completely characterized
by requiring the BRST symmetry of the classical worldsheet theory; it is also
necessary to require the vanishing of the one-loop beta-function.
