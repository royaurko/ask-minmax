Let C be a complete non-singular irreducible curve of genus 4 over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We determine all possible
Weierstrass semigroups of ramification points on double covers of C which have
genus greater than 11. Moreover, we construct double covers with ramification
points whose Weierstrass semigroups are the possible ones.
