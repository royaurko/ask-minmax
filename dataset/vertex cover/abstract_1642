We give a technical result that implies a straightforward necessary and
sufficient conditions for a graph of groups with virtually cyclic edge groups
to be one ended. For arbitrary graphs of groups, we show that if their
fundamental group is not one-ended, then we can blow up vertex groups to graphs
of groups with simpler vertex and edge groups. As an application, we generalize
a theorem of Swarup to decompositions of virtually free groups.
