We calculate the interaction vertex of three BFKL states including the bare
triple BFKL Pomeron coupling and discuss its relation with the correlation
functions in two-dimensional conformal field theory. We construct the operator
algebra of the fields interpolating the BFKL states and show that in the
multi-color limit the vertex satisfies the constraints imposed by the conformal
bootstrap on the structure constants of the operator product expansion in
conformal field theory.
