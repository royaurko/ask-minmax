It is well-known that concentrators are sparse graphs of high connectivity,
which play a key role in the construction of switching networks; and any
semi-vertex transitive graph is isomorphic to a bi-coset graph. In this paper,
we prove that random bi-coset graphs are almost always concentrators, and
construct some examples of semi-vertex transitive concentrators.
