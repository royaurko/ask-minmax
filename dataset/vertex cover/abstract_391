We introduce the notions of boundary vertex, linear equivalence and effective
boundary vertex in the context of Viennot's heaps of pieces. We prove that in
the heap of a fully commutative element in a star reducible Coxeter group,
every boundary vertex is linearly equivalent to an effective boundary vertex.
Using this result, we establish Property W (in the sense of math.QA/0509363)
for star reducible Coxeter groups; this corrects a mistake in the latter paper.
