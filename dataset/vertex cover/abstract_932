We exactly evaluate the entanglement of a six vertex and a nine vertex graph
states which correspond to non ''two-colorable'' graphs. The upper bound of
entanglement for five vertices ring graph state is improved to 2.9275, less
than upper bound determined by LOCC. An upper bound of entanglement is proposed
based on the definition of graph state.
