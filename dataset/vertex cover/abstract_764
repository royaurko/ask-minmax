The Q matrix invented by Baxter in 1972 to solve the eight vertex model at
roots of unity exists for all values of N, the number of sites in the chain,
but only for a subset of roots of unity. We show in this paper that a new Q
matrix, which has recently been introduced and is non zero only for N even,
exists for all roots of unity. In addition we consider the relations between
all of the known Q matrices of the eight vertex model and conjecture functional
equations for them.
