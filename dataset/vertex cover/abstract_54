Tollefson described a variant of normal surface theory for 3-manifolds,
called Q-theory, where only the quadrilateral coordinates are used. Suppose $M$
is a triangulated, compact, irreducible, boundary-irreducible 3-manifold. In
Q-theory, if $M$ contains an essential surface, then the projective solution
space has an essential surface at a vertex. One interesting situation not
covered by this theorem is when $M$ is boundary reducible, e.g. $M$ is an
unknot complement. We prove that in this case $M$ has an essential disc at a
vertex of the Q-projective solution space.
