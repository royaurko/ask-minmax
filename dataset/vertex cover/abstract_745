The normalization condition for the relativistic three nucleon Bethe-Salpeter
and Gross bound state vertex functions is derived, for the first time, directly
from the three body wave equations. It is also shown that the relativistic
normalization condition for the two body Gross bound state vertex function is
identical to the requirement that the bound state charge be conserved, proving
that charge is automatically conserved by this equation.
