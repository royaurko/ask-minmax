We introduce a new exponential family of probability distributions, which can
be viewed as a multivariate generalization of the Inverse Gaussian
distribution. Considered as the random potential of a Schr\"odinger operator,
this exponential family is related to the random field that gives the mixing
measure of the Vertex Reinforced Jump Process, and hence to the mixing measure
of the Edge Reinforced Random Walk, the so-called magic formula. In particular,
it gives by direct computation the value of the normalizing constants of these
mixing measures, answering a question raised by Diaconis.
