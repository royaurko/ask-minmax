We review some ideas from a recent construction which introduced the notion
of vertex operators and form factors as vacuum expectation values of related
vertex operators in the space of fields. The vertex operators are constructed
explicitly in radial quantization. These ideas are explained at the
free-fermion point of the sine-Gordon theory.
