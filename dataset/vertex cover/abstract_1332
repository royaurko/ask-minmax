The unitarity triangle on the first quadrant in the $\rho -\eta$ plane is
discussed in the framework of the quark mass matrices in the NNI basis. If the
quark mass matrices of the up-type is the Fritzsch one and the down-type is the
one proposed by Branco et al., respectively, one gets the unitarity triangle
with the vertex on the first quadrant. This simple model may be a candidate of
the quark mass matrix ansatze, if the allowed region of the vertex of the
unitarity triangle is restricted in the first quadrant by future experiments.
