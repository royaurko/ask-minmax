We investigate the parameterized complexity of Vertex Cover parameterized by
the difference between the size of the optimal solution and the value of the
linear programming (LP) relaxation of the problem. By carefully analyzing the
change in the LP value in the branching steps, we argue that combining
previously known preprocessing rules with the most straightforward branching
algorithm yields an $O^*((2.618)^k)$ algorithm for the problem. Here $k$ is the
excess of the vertex cover size over the LP optimum, and we write $O^*(f(k))$
for a time complexity of the form $O(f(k)n^{O(1)})$, where $f (k)$ grows
exponentially with $k$. We proceed to show that a more sophisticated branching
algorithm achieves a runtime of $O^*(2.3146^k)$.
  Following this, using known and new reductions, we give $O^*(2.3146^k)$
algorithms for the parameterized versions of Above Guarantee Vertex Cover, Odd
Cycle Transversal, Split Vertex Deletion and Almost 2-SAT, and an
$O^*(1.5214^k)$ algorithm for Ko\"nig Vertex Deletion, Vertex Cover Param by
OCT and Vertex Cover Param by KVD. These algorithms significantly improve the
best known bounds for these problems. The most notable improvement is the new
bound for Odd Cycle Transversal - this is the first algorithm which beats the
dependence on $k$ of the seminal $O^*(3^k)$ algorithm of Reed, Smith and Vetta.
Finally, using our algorithm, we obtain a kernel for the standard
parameterization of Vertex Cover with at most $2k - c \log k$ vertices. Our
kernel is simpler than previously known kernels achieving the same size bound.
