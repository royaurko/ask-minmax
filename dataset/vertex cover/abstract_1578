We find all the spin-foams contributing in the first order of the vertex
expansion to the transition amplitude of the Bianchi-Rovelli-Vidotto Dipole
Cosmology model. Our algorithm is general and provides spin-foams of
arbitrarily given, fixed: boundary and, respectively, a number of internal
vertices. We use the recently introduced Operator Spin-Network Diagrams
framework.
