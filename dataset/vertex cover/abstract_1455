We consider the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions. We
choose the inhomogeneities as solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations. The
Bethe Ansatz equations have many solutions, so we can consider a wide variety
of inhomogeneities. For certain choices of the inhomogeneities we study arrow
correlation functions on the horizontal line going through the centre. In
particular we obtain a multiple integral representation for the emptiness
formation probability that generalizes the known formul\ae for XXZ
antiferromagnets.
