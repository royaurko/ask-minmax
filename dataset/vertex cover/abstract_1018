The electron-phonon vertex correction has a complex structure both in
momentum and frequency. We explain this structure on the basis of physical
considerations and we show how the vertex correction can be decomposed into two
terms with different physical origins. In particular, the first term describes
the lattice polarization induced by the electrons and it is essentially a
single-electron process whereas the second term is governed by the
particle-hole excitations due to the exchange part of the phonon-mediated
electron-electron interaction. We show that by weakening the influence of the
exchange interaction the vertex takes mostly positive values giving rise to an
enhanced effective coupling in the scattering with phonons. This weakening of
the exchange interaction can be obtained by lowering the density of the
electrons, or by considering only long-ranged (small q) electron-phonon
couplings. These findings permit to understand why in the High-Tc materials the
small carrier density and the long ranged electron-phonon interaction may play
a positive role in enhancing Tc.
