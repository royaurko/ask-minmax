We consider a surface link in the 4-space which can be presented by a simple
branched covering over the standard torus, which we call a torus-covering link.
Torus-covering links include spun $T^2$-knots and turned spun $T^2$-knots. In
this paper we braid a torus-covering link over the standard 2-sphere. This
gives an upper estimate of the braid index of a torus-covering link. In
particular we show that the turned spun $T^2$-knot of the torus $(2,\,p)$-knot
has the braid index four.
