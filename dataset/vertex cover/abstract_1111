Let $k$ be an integer. We prove a rough structure theorem for separations of
order at most $k$ in finite and infinite vertex transitive graphs. Let $G =
(V,E)$ be a vertex transitive graph, let $A \subseteq V$ be a finite vertex-set
with $|A| \le |V|/2$ and $|\{v \in V \setminus A : {$u \sim v$ for some $u \in
A$} \}|\le k$. We show that whenever the diameter of $G$ is at least
$31(k+1)^2$, either $|A| \le 2k^3+k^2$, or $G$ has a ring-like structure (with
bounded parameters), and $A$ is efficiently contained in an interval. This
theorem may be viewed as a rough characterization, generalizing an earlier
result of Tindell, and has applications to the study of product sets and
expansion in groups.
