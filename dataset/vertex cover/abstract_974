Covering relations are a topological tool for detecting periodic orbits,
symbolic dynamics and chaotic behavior for autonomous ODE. We extend the method
of the covering relations onto systems with a time dependent perturbation. As
an example we apply the method to non-autonomous perturbations of the
R\"{o}ssler equations to show that for small perturbation they posses symbolic
dynamics.
