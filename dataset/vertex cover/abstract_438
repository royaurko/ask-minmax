We include a generalized infinite class of quark-gluon vertex dressing
diagrams in a study of how dynamics beyond the ladder-rainbow truncation
influences the Bethe-Salpeter description of light quark pseudoscalar and
vector mesons. The diagrammatic specification of the vertex is mapped into a
corresponding specification of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel, which preserves
chiral symmetry. This study adopts the algebraic format afforded by the simple
interaction kernel used in previous work on this topic. The new feature of the
present work is that in every diagram summed for the vertex and the
corresponding Bethe-Salpeter kernel, each quark-gluon vertex is required to be
the self-consistent vertex solution. We also adopt from previous work the
effective accounting for the role of the explicitly non-Abelian three gluon
coupling in a global manner through one parameter determined from recent
lattice-QCD data for the vertex. With the more consistent vertex used here, the
error in ladder-rainbow truncation for vector mesons is never more than 10% as
the current quark mass is varied from the u/d region to the b region.
