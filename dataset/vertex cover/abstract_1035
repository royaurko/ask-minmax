A semi-perturbative calculation of the ghost-gluon vertex in Landau gauge
Yang-Mills theory in four and three Euclidean space-time dimensions is
presented. Non-perturbative gluon and ghost propagators are employed, which
have previously been calculated from a truncated set of Dyson--Schwinger
equations and which are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with
corresponding lattice results. Our results for the ghost-gluon vertex show only
relatively small deviations from the tree-level one in agreement with recent
lattice data. In particular, we do not see any sign for a singular behaviour of
the ghost-gluon vertex in the infrared.
