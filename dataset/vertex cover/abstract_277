The refined topological vertex formulation computes the refined topological
string partition function for non-compact toric Calabi-Yau threefolds which
engineer N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories. For geometries such as the local
P^2, which do not give rise to gauge theories, the refined topological vertex
alone is not sufficient for directly calculating the refined amplitudes. In
this paper, we extend the refined topological vertex formalism and propose a
complementary new vertex which, together with the refined topological vertex,
determines the refined amplitudes for all toric Calabi-Yau threefolds.
