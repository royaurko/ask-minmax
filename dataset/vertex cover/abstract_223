It is proved that any vertex operator algebra for which the image of the
Virasoro element in Zhu's algebra is algebraic over complex numbers is finitely
generated. In particular, any vertex operator algebra with a finite dimensional
Zhu's algebra is finitely generated. As a result, any rational vertex operator
algebra is finitely generated.
