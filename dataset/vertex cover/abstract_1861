During the runs of the PS 179 experiment at LEAR of CERN, we photographed an
event of antiproton-Ne absorption, with a complete pi+ -> mu+ ->e+ chain. From
the vertex of the reaction a very slow energy pi+ was emitted. The pi+ decays
into a mu+ and subsequently the mu+ decays into a positron. At the first decay
vertex a muon neutrino was emitted and at the second decay vertex an electron
neutrino and a muon antineutrino. Measuring the pion and muon tracks and
applying the momentum and energy conservation and using a classical statistical
interval estimator, we obtained an experimental upper limit for the muon
neutrino mass: m_nu < 2.2 MeV at a 90% confidence level. A statistical analysis
has been performed of the factors contributing to the square value of the
neutrino mass limit.
