We classify certain non-linear Lie conformal algebras with three generators,
which can be viewed as deformations of the current Lie conformal algebra of
sl_2. In doing so we discover an interesting 1-parameter family of non-linear
Lie conformal algebras R_{-1}^d and the corresponding freely generated vertex
algebras V_{-1}^d, which includes for d=1 the affine vertex algebra of sl_2 at
the critical level k=-2. We construct free-field realizations of the algebras
V_{-1}^d extending the Wakimoto realization of the affine vertex algebra of
sl_2 at the critical level, and we compute their Zhu algebras.
