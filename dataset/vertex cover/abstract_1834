We construct Witten-type string field theory vertices for a fermionic first
order system with conformal weights (0,1) in the operator formulation using
delta-function overlap conditions as well as the Neumann function method. The
identity, the reflector and the interaction vertex are treated in detail paying
attention to the zero mode conditions and the U(1) charge anomaly. The Neumann
coefficients for the interaction vertex are shown to be intimately connected
with the coefficients for bosons allowing a simple proof that the
reparametrization anomaly of the fermionic first order system cancels the
contribution of two real bosons. This agrees with their contribution c=-2 to
the central charge. The overlap equations for the interaction vertex are shown
to hold. Our results have applications in N=2 string field theory, Berkovits'
hybrid formalism for superstring field theory, the \eta\xi-system and the
twisted bc-system used in bosonic vacuum string field theory.
