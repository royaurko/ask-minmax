We show that the Migdal theorem is obviously violated in the high Tc cuprates
and the vertex correction should be included, in particular, in the gap
equation, in order to be consistent with the anomalously strong inelastic
scattering in the ``hot spots'', which is observed from the various normal
state experiments. The vertex correction is obtained by utilizing the
generalized Ward identity, which is shown to hold in the important scattering
channel for the pairing interaction in the high Tc cuprates. As a result, we
find a strong enhancement of Tc from the vertex correction despite of the
strong pair breaking effect due to the inelastic scattering.
