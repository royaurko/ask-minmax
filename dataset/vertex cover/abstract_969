We consider vertex-primitive digraphs having two vertices with almost equal
neighbourhoods (that is, the set of vertices that are neighbours of one but not
the other is small). We prove a structural result about such digraphs and then
apply it to answer a question of Ara\'ujo and Cameron about synchronising
groups.
