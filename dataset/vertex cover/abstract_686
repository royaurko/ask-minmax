This paper is devoted to the calculation of the quark-gluon-Reggeized quark
effective vertex in perturbative QCD in the next-to-leading order. The case of
QCD with massive quarks is considered. This vertex has a number of
applications, in particular, the result can be used for determination of the
next-to-leading correction to the massive Reggeized quark trajectory.
