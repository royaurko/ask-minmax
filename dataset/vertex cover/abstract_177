We investigate a general structure theory for a vertex operator algebra. We
discuss the center and blocks, the Jacobson radical and solvable radical and
local vertex operator algebras. The main consequence of our structure theory is
that if the vertex operator algebra satisfies some mild conditions then it is
necessarily semilocal, i.e. a direct sum of local vertex operator algebras.
