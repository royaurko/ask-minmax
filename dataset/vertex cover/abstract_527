We prove that the weak associativity for modules for vertex algebras are
equivalent to a residue formula for iterates of vertex operators, obtained
using the weak associativity and the lower truncation property of vertex
operators, together with a known formula expressing products of components of
vertex operators as linear combinations of iterates of components of vertex
operators. By requiring that these two formulas instead of the commutator
formula hold, we construct a functor $S$ from the category of modules for Zhu's
algebra of a vertex operator algebra $V$ to the category of
$\mathbb{N}$-gradable weak $V$-modules. We prove that $S$ has a universal
property and the functor $T$ of taking top levels of $\mathbb{N}$-gradable weak
$V$-modules is a left inverse of $S$. In particular, $S$ is equal to a functor
implicitly given by Zhu and explicitly constructed by Dong, Li and Mason and we
obtain a new construction without using relations corresponding to the
commutator formula. The hard part of this new construction is a technical
theorem stating roughly that in a module for Zhu's algebra, the relation
corresponding to the residue formula mentioned above can in fact be obtained
from the relations corresponding to the action of Zhu's algebra.
