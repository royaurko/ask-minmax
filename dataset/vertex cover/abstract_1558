We present an efficient and numerically stable algorithm for calculation of
two-particle response functions within the dynamical mean-field theory. The
technique is based on inferring the high frequency asymptotic behavior of the
irreducible vertex function from the local dynamical susceptibility. The
algorithm is tested on several examples. In all cases rapid convergence of the
vertex function towards its asymptotic form is observed.
