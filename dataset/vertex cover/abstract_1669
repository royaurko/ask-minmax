In a random graph with a spatial embedding, the probability of linking to a
particular vertex $v$ decreases with distance, but the rate of decrease may
depend on the particular vertex $v$, and on the direction in which the distance
increases. In this article, we consider the question when the embedding can be
chosen to be uniform, so the probability of a link between two vertices depends
only on the distance between them. We give necessary and sufficient conditions
for the existence of a uniform linear embedding (embedding into a
one-dimensional space) for spatial random graphs where the link probability can
attain only a finite number of values.
