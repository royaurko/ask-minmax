The electromagnetic interaction with quarks is investigated through a
relativistic, electromagnetic gauge-invariant treatment. Gluon dressing of the
quark-photon vertex and the quark self-energy functions is described by the
inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder approximation and the
Schwinger-Dyson equation in the rainbow approximation respectively. Results for
the calculation of the quark-photon vertex are presented in both the time-like
and space-like regions of photon momentum squared, however emphasis is placed
on the space-like region relevant to electron scattering. The treatment
presented here simultaneously addresses the role of dynamically generated
$q\bar{q}$ vector bound states and the approach to asymptotic behavior. The
resulting description is therefore applicable over the entire range of momentum
transfers available in electron scattering experiments. Input parameters are
limited to the model gluon two-point function, which is chosen to reflect
confinement and asymptotic freedom, and are largely constrained by the obtained
bound-state spectrum.
