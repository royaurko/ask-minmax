We describe the formalism, and present the results, for a triple-Regge
analysis of the available pp and p\bar{p} high-energy data which explicitly
accounts for absorptive corrections. In particular, we allow for the gap
survival probability, S^2, in single proton diffractive dissociation. Since for
pp scattering the value of S^2 is rather small, the triple-Pomeron vertex
obtained in this analysis is larger than that obtained in the old analyses
where the suppression caused by the absorptive corrections was implicitly
included in an effective vertex. We show that the bare triple-Pomeron coupling
that we extract from the pp and p\bar{p} data is consistent with that obtained
in a description of the gamma p -> J/psi + Y HERA data. The analyses of the
data prefer a zero slope, corresponding to the small size of the bare vertex,
giving the hope of a smooth matching to the perturbative QCD treatment of the
triple-Pomeron coupling.
