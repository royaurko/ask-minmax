One-loop off-shell contributions to the three-gluon vertex are calculated, in
arbitrary covariant gauge and in arbitrary space-time dimension, including
quark-loop contributions (with massless quarks). It is shown how one can get
the results for all on-shell limits of interest directly from the general
off-shell expression. The corresponding general expressions for the one-loop
ghost-gluon vertex are also obtained. They allow for a check of consistency
with the Ward--Slavnov--Taylor identity.
