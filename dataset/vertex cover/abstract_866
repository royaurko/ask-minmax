We study the chiral condensate, $<\bar\psi\psi>$, and various quark bilinear
vertex functions for domain wall fermions at different lattice scales, with
both the Wilson and DBW2 gauge actions, in both quenched and dynamical fermion
simulations. We use the vertex functions to calculate renormalization factors
within a non-perturbative scheme.
