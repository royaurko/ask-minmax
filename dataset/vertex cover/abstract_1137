We develop the theory of irregular conformal blocks of the Virasoro algebra.
In previous studies, expansions of irregular conformal blocks at regular
singular points were obtained as degeneration limits of regular conformal
blocks; however, such expansions at irregular singular points were not clearly
understood. This is because precise definitions of irregular vertex operators
had not been provided previously. In this paper, we present precise definitions
of irregular vertex operators of two types and we prove that one of our vertex
operators exists uniquely. Then, we define irregular conformal blocks with at
most two irregular singular points as expectation values of given irregular
vertex operators. Our definitions provide an understanding of expansions of
irregular conformal blocks and enable us to obtain expansions at irregular
singular points.
  As an application, we propose conjectural formulas of series expansions of
the tau functions of the fifth and fourth Painlev\'e equations, using
expansions of irregular conformal blocks at an irregular singular point.
