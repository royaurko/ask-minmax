We show a strict hierarchy among various edge and vertex expansion properties
of Markov chains. This gives easy proofs of a range of bounds, both classical
and new, on chi-square distance, spectral gap and mixing time. The 2-gradient
is then used to give an isoperimetric proof that a random walk on the grid
[k]^n mixes in time O*(k^2 n).
