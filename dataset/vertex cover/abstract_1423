We announce a new type of "Jacobi identity" for vertex operator algebras,
incorporating values of the Riemann zeta function at negative integers. Using
this we "explain" and generalize some recent work of S. Bloch's relating values
of the zeta function with the commutators of certain operators and Lie algebras
of differential operators.
