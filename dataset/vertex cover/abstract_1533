A range of first-passage percolation type models are believed to demonstrate
the related properties of sublinear variance and superdiffusivity. We show that
directed last-passage percolation with Gaussian vertex weights has a sublinear
variance property. We also consider other vertex weight distributions.
  Corresponding results are obtained for the ground state of the `directed
polymers in a random environment' model.
