The ALEPH Silicon Vertex Detector features an optical fibre laser system to
monitor its mechanical stability. The operating principle and the general
performance of the laser system are described. The experience obtained during
1997 and 1998 operations confirms the important role that such a system can
have with respect to the detector alignment requirements. In particular, the
laser system has been used to monitor short-term temperature-related effects
and long-term movements. These results and a description of the laser-based
alignment correction applied to the 1998 data are presented.
