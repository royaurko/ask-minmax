We derive an exact closed-form analytical expression for the distribution of
the cover time for a random walk over an arbitrary graph. In special case, we
derive simplified exact expressions for the distributions of cover time for a
complete graph, a cycle graph, and a path graph. An accurate approximation for
the cover time distribution, with computational complexity of O(2n), is also
presented. The approximation is numerically tested only for graphs with n<=1000
nodes.
