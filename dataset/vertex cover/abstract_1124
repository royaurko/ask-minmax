We report on the first self-consistent solution of the Dyson-Schwinger
equation (DSE) for the three-gluon vertex. Based on earlier results for the
propagators which match data from lattice Monte-Carlo simulations, we obtain
results for the three-gluon vertex that are in very good agreement with
available lattice data likewise. Feeding these results back into the propagator
DSEs leads to some changes especially in the gluon propagator. These changes
allow us to assess previously used models for the three-gluon vertex and to
systematically estimate the influence of neglected two-loop diagrams with
four-gluon interactions. In the final step, a full iterative solution to the
coupled DSEs of pure Landau gauge QCD without quarks is then obtained for the
first time in an extended truncation which now dynamically includes the
complete set of three-point vertex functions.
