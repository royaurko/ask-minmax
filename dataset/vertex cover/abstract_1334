The amplitude for 4 interacting reggeized gluons is studied in the
high-colour limit. The leading order amplitude is explicitly shown to reduce to
a pair of reggeons, i.e to a single BFKL pomeron. The next-to-leading order
diffractive amplitude is found to split into a double pomeron exchange and
triple pomeron contribution. The obtained three-pomeron vertex is different
from the originally proposed in [2].
