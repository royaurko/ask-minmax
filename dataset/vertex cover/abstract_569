We consider the Dirichlet Laplacian in a waveguide of uniform width and
infinite length which is ideally divided into three parts: a "vertex region",
compactly supported and with non zero curvature, and two "edge regions" which
are semi-infinite straight strips. We make the waveguide collapse onto a graph
by squeezing the edge regions to half-lines and the vertex region to a point.
In a setting in which the ratio between the width of the waveguide and the
longitudinal extension of the vertex region goes to zero, we prove the
convergence of the operator to a selfadjoint realization of the Laplacian on a
two edged graph. In the limit operator, the boundary conditions in the vertex
depend on the spectral properties of an effective one dimensional Hamiltonian
associated to the vertex region.
