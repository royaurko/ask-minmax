In this paper we prove that certain matrix elements of vertex operators of
deformed W-algebra satisfy Macdonald difference equations and form n!
-dimensional space of solutions. These solutions are the analogues of Harish
Chandra solutions with prescribed asymptotic behavior. We obtain formulas for
analytic continuation as a consequence of braiding properties of vertex
operators of deformed W-algebra.
