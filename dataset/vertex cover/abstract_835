We construct integral forms containing the conformal vector $\omega$ in
certain tensor powers of the Virasoro vertex operator algebra
$L(\frac{1}{2},0)$, and we construct integral forms in certain modules for
these algebras. When a triple of modules for a tensor power of
$L(\frac{1}{2},0)$ have integral forms, we classify which intertwining
operators among these modules respect the integral forms. As an application, we
explore how these results might be used to obtain integral forms in framed
vertex operator algebras.
