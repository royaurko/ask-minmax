We investigate use of transverse beam polarization in probing anomalous
coupling of a Higgs boson to a pair of vector bosons, at the International
Linear Collider (ILC). We consider the most general form of VVH (V = W/Z)
vertex consistent with Lorentz invariance and investigate its effects on the
process e+ e- --> f bar{f} H, f being a light fermion. Constructing observables
with definite CP and naive time reversal (tilde T) transformation properties,
we find that transverse beam polarization helps us to improve on the
sensitivity of one part of the anomalous ZZH coupling that is odd under CP.
Even more importantly it provides the possibility of discriminating from each
other, two terms in the general ZZH vertex, both of which are even under CP and
tilde T. Use of transverse beam polarization when combined with information
from unpolarized and linearly polarized beams therefore, allows one to have
completely independent probes of all the different parts of a general ZZH
vertex.
