We discuss the vertex function of two vector and one axial-vector operators
in the soft-wall holographic model of QCD. When one of the two vector currents
represents an on-shell soft photon, such a vertex is described by two structure
functions $w_L$ and $w_T$, which are usually calculated through triangular loop
diagrams. We evaluate these functions in the soft-wall model of holographic QCD
(HQCD) and compare the outcome to the QCD findings.
