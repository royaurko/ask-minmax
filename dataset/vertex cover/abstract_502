We show that the commutator subgroup G' of a classical knot group G need not
have subgroups of every finite index, but it will if G' has a surjective
homomorphism to the integers and we give an exact criterion for that to happen.
We also give an example of a smoothly knotted n-sphere in the (n+2)-sphere for
all n at least 2 whose infinite cyclic cover is not simply connected but has no
proper finite covers.
