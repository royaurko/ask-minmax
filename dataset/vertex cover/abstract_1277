Based on a recent exchange--correlation kernel developed within
Time--Dependent--Density--Functional Theory we derive a practical and general
expression for the three--point vertex function. We show that excitonic effects
in LiF strongly modifies the low--energy electron linewidths leading to linear
scaling with quasiparticle energy. We also prove that, in contrast to previous
results for the electron gas, simple metals and semiconductors, vertex
corrections in the self--energy and in the screening function do not compensate
each other.
