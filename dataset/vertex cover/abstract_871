The quark-antiquark contribution to the BFKL kernel is calculated. Using the
effective vertex for the $q\bar q$ pair production in the Reggeon-Reggeon
collision we find this contribution by integrating the square of this vertex
over relative transverse momenta and fractions of longitudinal momenta of
produced particles.
