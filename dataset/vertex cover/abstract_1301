Weak coupling expansion of a chiral gauge theory on a lattice is discussed in
the overlap formulation. We analyze the fermion propagator and the
fermion-fermion-gauge boson vertex in the one loop level. The chiral properties
of the propagator and vertex are correctly preserved without tuning the
parameters involved even after the one-loop renormalization, and the
ultraviolet divergent parts agree with the continuum theory. Our analysis,
together with the existing studies on the vacuum polarization and the gauge
boson n-point functions, completes the proof of the renormalizability of this
formulation to the one loop level.
