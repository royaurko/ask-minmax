In \cite{2012a}, Abdo and Dimitov defined the total irregularity of a graph
$G=(V,E)$ as
  \hskip3.3cm $\rm irr_{t}$$(G) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{u,v\in
V}|d_{G}(u)-d_{G}(v)|, $
  \noindent where $d_{G}(u)$ denotes the vertex degree of a vertex $u\in V$. In
this paper, we investigate the minimal total irregularity of the connected
graphs, determine the minimal, the second minimal, the third minimal total
irregularity of trees, unicyclic graphs, bicyclic graphs on $n$ vertices, and
propose an open problem for further research.
