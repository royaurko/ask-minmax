We compute the stable reduction of some Galois covers of the projective line
branched at three points. These covers are constructed using Hurwitz spaces
parameterizing metacyclic covers. The reduction is determined by a
hypergeometric differential equation. This generalizes the result of Deligne-
Rapoport on the reduction of the modular curve X(p).
