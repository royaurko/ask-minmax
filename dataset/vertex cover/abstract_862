Diagram series expansion for lattice models with a localized nonlinearity can
be renormalized so that diagram vertexes become irreducible vertex parts of
certain impurity model. Thus renormalized series converges well in the very
opposite cases of tight and weak binding and pretends to describe in a regular
way strong-correlated systems with localized interaction. Benchmark results for
the classical O(N) models on a cubic lattice are presented.
