We calculate the complete one-loop off-shell three-point scalar-photon vertex
in arbitrary gauge and dimension for Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics. Explicit
results are presented for the particular cases of dimensions 3 and 4 both for
massive and massless scalars. We then propose non-perturbative forms of this
vertex that coincide with the perturbative answer to order $e^2$.
