We extend our two component Pomeron model (GLMM) for soft high energy
scattering to single inclusive cross sections. We present a suitable
formulation which also includes the semi enhanced Pomeron-particle vertex
corrections. The available data on single inclusive density
$(1/\sigma_{in})d\sigma/dy$ in the c.m. energy range of 200-1800 GeV, including
the just published Alice Collaboration point at 900 GeV,and the CMS
collaboration measurements at 900 and 2360 GeV are well reproduced by our
model. We also present predictions covering the complete LHC energy range which
can be readily tested in the early low luminosity LHC runs. The results
presented in this communication provide additional support to our Pomeron model
approach.
