We investigate the possible regular solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter
equation for the fundamental $U_q[G_2]$ vertex model. We find four distinct
classes of reflection matrices such that half of them are diagonal while the
other half are non-diagonal. The latter are parameterized by two continuous
parameters but only one solution has all entries non-null. The non-diagonal
solutions do not reduce to diagonal ones at any special limit of the
free-parameters.
