We calculate the bulk contribution for the doubly degenerated largest
eigenvalue of the transfer matrix of the eight vertex model with an odd number
of lattice sites N in the disordered regime using the generic equation for
roots proposed by Fabricius and McCoy. We show as expected that in the
thermodynamic limit the result coincides with the one in the N even case.
