We continue the semiclassical analysis, started in a previous paper, of the
intertwiner sector of the flipped vertex spinfoam model. We use independently
both a semi-analytical and a purely numerical approach, finding the correct
behavior of wave packet propagation and physical expectation values. In the
end, we show preliminary results about correlation functions.
