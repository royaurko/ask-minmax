Covering a convex body by its homothets is a classical notion in discrete
geometry that has resulted in a number of interesting and long-standing
problems. Swanepoel [Mathematika 52 (2005), 47--52] introduced the covering
parameter of a convex body as a means of quantifying its covering properties.
In this paper, we introduce a relative of the covering parameter called
covering index, which turns out to have a number of nice properties.
Intuitively, the covering index measures how well a convex body can be covered
by a relatively small number of homothets having the same relatively small
homothety ratio. We show that the covering index is a lower semicontinuous
functional on the Banach-Mazur space of convex bodies and provides a useful
upper bound for well-studied quantities like the illumination number, the
illumination parameter, the vertex index and the covering parameter of a convex
body. We obtain upper bounds on the covering index and investigate its
optimizers. We show that the affine $d$-cubes minimize covering index in any
dimension $d$, while circular disks maximize it in the plane. Furthermore, we
show that the covering index satisfies a nice compatibility with the operations
of direct vector sum and vector sum. In fact, we obtain an exact formula for
the covering index of a direct vector sum of convex bodies that works in
infinitely many instances. This together with a monotonicity property can be
used to determine the covering index of infinitely many convex bodies.
