We calculate the top quark loop corrections to the Zbb vertex in the chiral
lagrangian of the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking theory. We use the
effective lagrangian based on coset space SU(2) X U(1) / U(1) with the gauge
interactions switched off, so these corrections are directly related to the
Physics associated with the heavy top quark and the mass generation in the
dynamical models.
