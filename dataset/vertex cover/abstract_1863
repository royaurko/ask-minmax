The dynamical content of rho-N-N and rho-N-Delta vertex functions is studied
with a mesonic model. A set of coupled integral equations satisfied by these
vertex functions were solved self-consistently. These soulutions indicate that
the dominant mesonic content arises from di-pion dynamics. With the
experimentally determined pion-baryon-baryon coupling constants and ranges as
input, the model predicts a g_{\rho NN} that agrees with the
meson-exchange-potential results. On the other hand, it predicts a smaller
f_{\rho N\Delta} and much softer form factors. Implications of the findings on
the use of phenomenological coupling constants in nuclear reaction studies are
discussed.
