We calculate the effects of vertex corrections, of non-constant density of
states and of a (self-consistently determined) phonon self-energy for the
Holstein model on a 3D cubic lattice. We replace vertex corrections with a
Coulomb pseudopotential, mu*, adjusted to give the same Tc, and repeat the
calculations, to see which effects are a distinct feature of vertex
corrections. This allows us to determine directly observable effects ofvertex
corrections on a variety of thermodynamic properties of superconductors. To
this end, we employ conserving approximations (in the local approximation) to
calculate the superconducting critical temperatures, isotope coefficients,
superconducting gaps, free-energy differences and thermodynamic critical fields
for a range of parameters. We find that the dressed value of lambda is
significantly larger than the bare value. While vertex corrections can cause
significant changes in all the above quantities (even whenthe bare
electron-phonon coupling is small), the changes can usually be well-modeled by
an appropriate Coulomb pseudopotential. The isotope coefficient proves to be
the quantity that most clearly shows effects of vertex corrections that can not
be mimicked by a mu*.
