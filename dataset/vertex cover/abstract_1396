The $S^N\R^8$ supersymmetric orbifold sigma model is expected to describe
the IR limit of the Matrix string theory. In the framework of the model the
type IIA string interaction is governed by a vertex which was recently proposed
by R.Dijkgraaf, E.Verlinde and H.Verlinde. By using this interaction vertex we
derive all four particle scattering amplitudes directly from the orbifold model
in the large $N$ limit.
