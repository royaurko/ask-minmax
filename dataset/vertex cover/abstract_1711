A flat cover is a collection of flats identifying the non-bases of a matroid.
We introduce the notion of cover complexity, the minimal size of such a flat
cover, as a measure for the complexity of a matroid, and present bounds on the
number of matroids on $n$ elements whose cover complexity is bounded. We apply
cover complexity to show that the class of matroids without an $N$-minor is
asymptotically small in case $N$ is one of the sparse paving matroids
$U_{2,k}$, $U_{3,6}$, $P_6$, $Q_6$, or $R_6$, thus confirming a few special
cases of a conjecture due to Mayhew, Newman, Welsh, and Whittle. On the other
hand, we show a lower bound on the number of matroids without $M(K_4)$-minor
which asymptoticaly matches the best known lower bound on the number of all
matroids, due to Knuth.
