Recently the quark-gluon vertex has been investigated in Landau gauge using a
combined Dyson-Schwinger and nPI effective action approach. We present here a
numerical analysis of a simpler system where the quarks have been replaced by
charged scalar fields. We solve the coupled system of Dyson-Schwinger equations
for the scalar propagator, the scalar-gluon vertex and the Yang-Mills
propagators in a truncation related to earlier studies. The calculations have
been performed for scalars both in the fundamental and the adjoint
representation. A clear suppression of the Abelian diagram is found in both
cases. Thus, within the used truncation the suppression of the Abelian diagram
predominantly happens dynamically and is to a high degree independent of the
colour structure. The numerical techniques developed here can directly be
applied to the fermionic case.
