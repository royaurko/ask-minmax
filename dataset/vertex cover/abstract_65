A graph $G$ is called normal if there exist two coverings, $\mathbb{C}$ and
$\mathbb{S}$ of its vertex set such that every member of $\mathbb{C}$ induces a
clique in $G$, every member of $\mathbb{S}$ induces an independent set in $G$
and $C \cap S \neq \emptyset$ for every $C \in \mathbb{C}$ and $S \in
\mathbb{S}$. It has been conjectured by De Simone and K\"orner in 1999 that a
graph $G$ is normal if $G$ does not contain $C_5$, $C_7$ and $\overline{C_7}$
as an induced subgraph. We disprove this conjecture.
