In this paper, we show that if we decompose a polygon into two smaller
polygons, then by comparing the number of extremal vertices in the original
polygon versus the sum of the two smaller polygons, we can gain at most two
globally extremal vertices in the smaller polygons, as well as at most two
locally extremal vertices. We then will derive two discrete Four-Vertex
Theorems from our results.
