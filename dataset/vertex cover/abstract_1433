This article examines the universal polytope $\CP$ (of type $\{5,3,5\}$)
whose facets are dodecahedra, and whose vertex figures are hemi-icosahedra. The
polytope is proven to be finite, and the structure of its group is identified.
This information is used to classifiy the quotients of the polytope. A total of
145 quotients are found, including 69 section regular polytopes with the same
facets and vertex figures as $\CP$.
