In this article, we construct explicitly certain moonshine type vertex
operator algebras generated by a set of Ising vectors $I$ such that
  (1) for any $e\neq f\in I$, the subVOA $\mathrm{VOA}(e,f)$ generated by $e$
and $f$ is isomorphic to either $U_{2B}$ or $U_{3C}$; and
  (2)the subgroup generated by the corresponding Miyamoto involutions
$\{\tau_e|\,e\in I\}$ is isomorphic to the Weyl group of a root system of type
$A_n$, $D_n$, $E_6$, $E_7$ or $E_8$.
  The structures of the corresponding vertex operator algebras and their Griess
algebras are also studied. In particular, the central charge of these vertex
operator algebras are determined.
