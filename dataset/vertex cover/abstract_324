Any variety of classical algebras has a so-called conformal counterpart. For
example one can consider Lie conformal or associative conformal algebras. Lie
conformal algebras are closely related to vertex algebras. We define free
objects in the categories of conformal and vertex algebras. In some cases we
can explicitly build their Groebner bases.
