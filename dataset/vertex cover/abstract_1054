The infrared behaviour of gluon and ghost propagators, ghost-gluon vertex and
three-gluon vertex is investigated for both the covariant Landau and the
non-covariant Coulomb gauge. Assuming infrared ghost dominance, we find a
unique infrared exponent in the d=4 Landau gauge, while in the d=3+1 Coulomb
gauge we find two different infrared exponents. We also show that a finite
dressing of the ghost-gluon vertex has no influence on the infrared exponents.
Finally, we determine the infrared behaviour of the three-gluon vertex
analytically and calculate it numerically at the symmetric point in the Coulomb
gauge.
