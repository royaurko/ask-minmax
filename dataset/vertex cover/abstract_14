We consider a modified random walk which uses unvisited edges whenever
possible, and makes a simple random walk otherwise. We call such a walk an
edge-process. We assume there is a rule A, which tells the walk which unvisited
edge to use whenever there is a choice. In the simplest case, A is a uniform
random choice over unvisited edges incident with the current walk position.
However we do not exclude arbitrary choices of rule A. For example, the rule
could be determined on-line by an adversary, or could vary from vertex to
vertex.
  For even degree expander graphs, of bounded maximum degree, we have the
following result. Let G be an n vertex even degree expander graph, for which
every vertex is in at least one vertex induced cycle of length L. Any
edge-process on G has cover time (n+ (n log n)/L). This result is independent
of the rule A used to select the order of the unvisited edges, which can be
chosen on-line by an adversary.
  As an example, With high probability, random r-regular graphs, (r at least 4,
even), are expanders for which L = Omega(log n). Thus, for almost all such
graphs, the vertex cover time of the edge-process is Theta(n). This improves
the vertex cover time of such graphs by a factor of log n, compared to the
Omega(n log n) cover time of any weighted random walk.
