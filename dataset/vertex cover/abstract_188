In this paper we introduce a notion of vertex Lie algebra U, in a way a
"half" of vertex algebra structure sufficient to construct the corresponding
local Lie algebra L(U) and a vertex algebra V(U). We show that we may consider
U as a subset of V(U) which generates V(U) and that the vertex Lie algebra
structure on U is induced by the vertex algebra structure on V(U). Moreover,
for any vertex algebra V a given homomorphism from U to V of vertex Lie
algebras extends uniquely to a homomorphism from V(U) to V of vertex algebras.
In the second part of paper we study under what conditions on structure
constants one can construct a vertex Lie algebra U by starting with a given
commutator formula for fields.
