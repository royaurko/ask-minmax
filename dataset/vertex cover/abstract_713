It has been suggested that matrix string theory and light-cone string field
theory are closely related. In this paper, we investigate the relation between
the twist field, which represents string interactions in matrix string theory,
and the three-string interaction vertex in light-cone string field theory
carefully. We find that the three-string interaction vertex can reproduce some
of the most important OPEs satisfied by the twist field.
