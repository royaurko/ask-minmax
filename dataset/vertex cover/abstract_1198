If a group $G$ is the union of proper subgroups $H_1, ..., H_k$, we say that
the collection $\{H_1, ...H_k \}$ is a cover of $G$, and the size of a minimal
cover (supposing one exists) is the covering number of $G$, denoted
$\sigma(G)$. Mar\'{o}ti showed that $\sigma(S_n) = 2^{n-1}$ for $n$ odd and
sufficiently large, and he also gave asymptotic bounds for $n$ even. In this
paper, we give an exact value for $\sigma(S_n)$ when $n$ is divisible by $6$
and show how determining the value of $\sigma(S_n)$ may be approached for other
even values of $n$.
