Given a nowheredense closed subset $X$ of a metrizable compact space $\tx$,
we characterize the dimension of $X$ in terms of the multiplicity of the
canonicals covers of the complementary of $X$, specially in some particular
cases, like when $\tx$ is the Hilbert cube or the finite dimensional cube and
$X$, a Z-set of $\tx$. In this process, we solve some questions in the
literature.
