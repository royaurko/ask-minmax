A p-typical cover of a connected scheme on which p=0 is a finite etale cover
whose monodromy group (i.e., the Galois group of its normal closure) is a
p-group. The geometry of such covers exhibits some unexpectedly pleasant
behaviors; building on work of Katz, we demonstrate some of these. These
include a criterion for when a morphism induces an isomorphism of the p-typical
quotients of the etale fundamental groups, and a decomposition theorem for
p-typical covers of polynomial rings over an algebraically closed field.
