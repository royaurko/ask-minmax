We combine radial velocities, proper motions, and low resolution abundances
for a sample of 315 K and M giants in the Baade's Window (l,b)=(0.9,-4)
Galactic bulge field. The velocity ellipsoid of stars with [Fe/H]>-0.5 dex
shows a vertex deviation in the plot of radial versus transverse velocity,
consistent with that expected from a population with orbits supporting a bar.
We demonstrate that the significance of this vertex deviation using
non-parametric rank correlation statistic is >99%. The velocity ellipsoid for
the metal poor ([FeH]<-0.5) part of the population shows no vertex deviation
and is consistent with an isotropic, oblate rotating population. We find no
evidence for kinematic subgroups, but there is a mild tendency for the vertical
velocity dispersion sigma_b to decrease with increasing metallicity.
