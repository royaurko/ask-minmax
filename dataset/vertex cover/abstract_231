We develop an orbifold theory for finite cyclic groups acting on holomorphic
vertex operator algebras. Then we show that Schellekens' classification of
holomorphic conformal field theories is a theorem on vertex algebras. Finally
we use our results to construct some new holomorphic vertex operator algebras
as lattice orbifolds.
