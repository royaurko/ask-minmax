We compute the quark-gluon vertex in quenched QCD, in the Landau gauge using
an off-shell mean-field O(a)-improved fermion action. The running coupling is
calculated in an `asymmetric' momentum subtraction scheme (MOM~). We obtain a
crude estimate for Lambda_MSbar=170+/-65 MeV, which is considerably lower than
other determinations of this quantity. However, substantial systematic errors
remain.
