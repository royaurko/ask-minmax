We construct a model for the quark-gluon vertex of Landau gauge QCD. This is
of twofold interest: on the one hand the quark-gluon interaction is at the
heart of quark confinement, on the other hand it is a central element in hadron
phenomenology based on QCD Greens functions. We employ the non-Abelian one-loop
diagram in perturbation theory, which is of order Nc. As a novelty we replace
the tree-level quark and gluon propagators in this diagram by their dressed
counterparts solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations. The Nc-suppressed Abelian
diagram is an order of magnitude smaller in various kinematics. We also study
the effect of ghost dressing factors on the vertex obtaining a construction in
good agreement with recent low-momentum lattice calculations.
