BTeV is a $B$-physics experiment that expects to begin collecting data at the
C0 interaction region of the Fermilab Tevatron in the year 2006. Its primary
goal is to achieve unprecedented levels of sensitivity in the study of CP
violation, mixing, and rare decays in $b$ and $c$ quark systems. In order to
realize this, it will employ a state-of-the-art first-level vertex trigger
(Level 1) that will look at every beam crossing to identify detached secondary
vertices that provide evidence for heavy quark decays. This talk will briefly
describe the BTeV detector and trigger, focus on the software and hardware
aspects of the Level 1 vertex trigger, and describe work currently being done
in these areas.
