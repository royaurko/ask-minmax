Every isometry $\sigma$ of a positive-definite even lattice $Q$ can be lifted
to an automorphism of the lattice vertex algebra $V_Q$. An important problem in
vertex algebra theory and conformal field theory is to classify the
representations of the $\sigma$-invariant subalgebra $V_Q^\sigma$ of $V_Q$,
known as an orbifold. In the case when $\sigma$ is an isometry of $Q$ of order
two, we classify the irreducible modules of the orbifold vertex algebra
$V_Q^\sigma$ and identify them as submodules of twisted or untwisted
$V_Q$-modules. The examples where $Q$ is a root lattice and $\sigma$ is a
Dynkin diagram automorphism are presented in detail.
