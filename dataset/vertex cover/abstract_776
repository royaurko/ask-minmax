We give an introduction to the Mathematica package Lambda, designed for
calculating $\lambda$-brackets in both vertex algebras, and in SUSY vertex
algebras. This is equivalent to calculating operator product expansions in
two-dimensional conformal field theory. The syntax of $\lambda$-brackets is
reviewed, and some simple examples are shown, both in component notation, and
in $N=1$ superfield notation.
