We study the one-loop sensitivity of the WWV (V=gamma, Z) vertex to the new
massive gauge bosons predicted by the minimal SU_L(3) X U_X(1) model, which
have unusual couplings to the standard model (SM) gauge bosons. A gauge-fixing
procedure covariant under the SU_L(2) X U_Y(1) group was introduced for these
new gauge bosons (dubbed bileptons) in order to generate gauge-invariant Green
functions. The similarities between this procedure and the nonconventional
quantization scheme of the background field method are discussed. It is found
that, for relatively light bileptons, with a mass ranging from 2m_W to 6m_W,
the radiative corrections to the form factors associated with the WWV vertex
can be of the same order of magnitude than the SM one. In the case of heavier
bileptons, their contribution is smaller by about one and two orders of
magnitude than their SM counterpart.
