Let $\Gamma$ be a finite connected $G$-vertex-transitive graph and let $v$ be
a vertex of $\Gamma$. If the permutation group induced by the action of the
vertex-stabiliser $G_v$ on the neighbourhood $\Gamma(v)$ is permutation
isomorphic to $L$, then $(\Gamma,G)$ is said to be locally-$L$. A permutation
group $L$ is graph-restrictive if there exists a constant $c(L)$ such that, for
every locally-$L$ pair $(\Gamma,G)$ and a vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, the
inequality $|G_v|\leq c(L)$ holds. We show that an intransitive group is
graph-restrictive if and only if it is semiregular.
