A covering of a group is a finite set of proper subgroups whose union is the
whole group. A covering is minimal if there is no covering of smaller
cardinality, and it is nilpotent if all its members are nilpotent subgroups. We
complete a proof that every group that has a nilpotent minimal covering is
solvable, starting from the previously known result that a minimal
counterexample is an almost simple finite group.
