It is well known that, in Landau gauge, the renormalization function of the
ghost-ghost-gluon vertex \widetilde{Z}_1(p^2) is finite and constant, at least
to all orders of perturbation theory. On the other hand, a direct
non-perturbative verification of this result using numerical simulations of
lattice QCD is still missing. Here we present a preliminary numerical study of
the ghost-ghost-gluon vertex and of its corresponding renormalization function
using Monte Carlo simulations in SU(2) lattice Landau gauge. Data were obtained
in 4 dimensions for lattice couplings beta = 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and lattice sides N
= 4, 8, 16.
