We compute the local Gromov-Witten invariants of the "closed vertex", that
is, a configuration of three rational curves meeting in a single triple point
in a Calabi-Yau threefold. The method is to express the local invariants of the
vertex in terms of ordinary Gromov-Witten invariants of a certain blowup of
CP^3 and then to compute those invariants via the geometry of the Cremona
transformation.
