Inspired by the Borcherds' work on ``$G$-vertex algebras,'' we formulate and
study an axiomatic counterpart of Borcherds' notion of $G$-vertex algebra for
the simplest nontrivial elementary vertex group, which we denote by $G_{1}$.
Specifically, we formulate a notion of axiomatic $G_{1}$-vertex algebra, prove
certain basic properties and give certain examples, where the notion of
axiomatic $G_{1}$-vertex algebra is a nonlocal generalization of the notion of
vertex algebra. We also show how to construct axiomatic $G_{1}$-vertex algebras
from a set of compatible $G_{1}$-vertex operators.
  The results of this paper were reported in June 2001, at the International
Conference on Lie Algebras in the Morningside center, Beijing, China, and were
reported on November 30, 2001, in the Quantum Mathematics Seminar, at
Rutgers-New Brunswick. We noticed that a paper of Bakalov and Kac appeared
today (math.QA/0204282) on noncommutative generalizations of vertex algebras,
which has certain overlaps with the current paper. On the other hand, most of
their results are orthogonal to the results of this paper.
