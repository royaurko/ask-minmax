The competition graph of a digraph $D$ is a (simple undirected) graph which
has the same vertex set as $D$ and has an edge between two distinct vertices
$x$ and $y$ if and only if there exists a vertex $v$ in $D$ such that $(x,v)$
and $(y,v)$ are arcs of $D$. For any graph $G$, $G$ together with sufficiently
many isolated vertices is the competition graph of some acyclic digraph. The
competition number $k(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of such
isolated vertices. Computing the competition number of a graph is an NP-hard
problem in general and has been one of the important research problems in the
study of competition graphs. Opsut [1982] showed that the competition number of
a graph $G$ is related to the edge clique cover number $\theta_E(G)$ of the
graph $G$ via $\theta_E(G)-|V(G)|+2 \leq k(G) \leq \theta_E(G)$. We first show
that for any positive integer $m$ satisfying $2 \leq m \leq |V(G)|$, there
exists a graph $G$ with $k(G)=\theta_E(G)-|V(G)|+m$ and characterize a graph
$G$ satisfying $k(G)=\theta_E(G)$. We then focus on what we call
\emph{competitively tight graphs} $G$ which satisfy the lower bound, i.e.,
$k(G)=\theta_E(G)-|V(G)|+2$. We completely characterize the competitively tight
graphs having at most two triangles. In addition, we provide a new upper bound
for the competition number of a graph from which we derive a sufficient
condition and a necessary condition for a graph to be competitively tight.
