Small covers were introduced by Davis and Januszkiewicz in 1991. We introduce
the notion of equilibrium triangulations for small covers. We study equilibrium
and vertex minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-equivariant triangulations of
$2$-dimensional small covers. We discuss vertex minimal equilibrium
triangulations of $\mathbb{RP}^3 \# \mathbb{RP}^3$, $S^1 \times \mathbb{RP}^2$
and a nontrivial $S^1$ bundle over $\mathbb{RP}^2$. We construct some nice
equilibrium triangulations of the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^n$ with
$2^n +n+1$ vertices. The main tool is the theory of small covers.
