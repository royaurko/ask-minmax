The n-point correlation functions introduced by Bloch and Okounkov have
already found several geometric connections and algebraic generalizations. In
this Note we formulate a q,t-deformation of this n-point function. The key
operator used in our formulation arises from the theory of Macdonald
polynomials and affords a vertex operator interpretation. We obtain closed
formulas for the n-point functions when n =1,2 in terms of the basic
hypergeometric functions. We further generalize the q,t-deformed n-point
function to more general vertex operators.
