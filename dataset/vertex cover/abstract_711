We calculate correlation functions for vertex operators with negative integer
exponentials of a periodic Liouville field, and derive the general case by
continuing them as distributions. The path-integral based conjectures of Dorn
and Otto prove to be conditionally valid only. We formulate integral
representations for the generic vertex operators and indicate structures which
are related to the Liouville S-matrix.
