We construct a spectral sequence that converges to the cohomology of the
chiral de Rham complex over a Calabi-Yau hypersurface and whose first term is a
vertex algebra closely related to the Landau-Ginburg orbifold. As an
application, we prove an explicit orbifold formula for the elliptic genus of
Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.
