We introduce two $K$-theories, one for vector bundles whose fibers are
modules of vertex operator algebras, another for vector bundles whose fibers
are modules of associative algebras. We verify the cohomological properties of
these $K$-theories, and construct a natural homomorphism from the VOA K-theory
to the associative algebra K-theory.
