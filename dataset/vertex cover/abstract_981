This paper presents the main results in my Ph.D. thesis. In what follows
several proofs of SCH are presented introducing a family of covering properties
which implies both SCH and the failure of various forms of square. These
covering properties are also applied to investigate models of strongly compact
cardinals or of strong forcing axioms like MM or PFA.
