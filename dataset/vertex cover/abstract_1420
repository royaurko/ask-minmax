Let $L_c$ be simple vertex operator superalgebra(SVOA) associated to the
vacuum representation of N=2 superconformal algebra with the central charge
$c$. Let $c_m = {3m}/{m+2}$.
  We classify all irreducible modules for the SVOA $L_{c_m}$.
  When $m$ is an integer we prove that the set of all unitary representations
of N=2 superconformal algebra with the central charge $c_m$ provides all
irreducible $L_{c_m}$-modules. When $m \notin {\N} $ and $m$ is an admissible
rational number we show that irreducible $L_{c_m}$-modules are parameterized
with the union of one finite set and union of finitely many rational curves.
