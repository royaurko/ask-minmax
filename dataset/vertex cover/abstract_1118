The flavour-changing quark-Higgs coupling does not arise at the tree level in
the Standard Model. It is, however, induced by one-loop effects. In this paper,
we present an exact calculation of the Higgs-penguin vertex in the
tHooft-Feynman gauge. Renormalization of the vertex is effected by a
prescription by Chia and Chong which gives an expression for the counter term
identical to that obtained by employing Ward-Takahashi identity. The on-shell
vertex function for the Higgs-penguin vertex is obtained, and its dependence on
Higgs mass is investigated. Our calculation is applied to the following
process: decays of Higgs boson into pseudoscalar meson pair of different
flavours: Kpi and BK. The coupling of pseudoscalar meson to quark is effected
through a gamma5 coupling. The decay rates are found to be very small.
