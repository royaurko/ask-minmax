We introduce the notion of N=1 supergeometric vertex operator superalgebra
motivated by the worldsheet geometry underlying genus-zero, two-dimensional,
holomorphic N=1 superconformal field theory. We then show, assuming the
convergence of certain projective factors, that the category of such objects is
isomorphic to the category of N=1 Neveu-Schwarz vertex operator superalgebras.
