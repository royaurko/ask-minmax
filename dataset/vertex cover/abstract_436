In this note we associate to each Frobenius algebra a vertex algebra, the
simplest example being the Virasoro vertex algebra. This construction is
analogous to the procedure which associates to a Lie algebra with an invariant
bilinear form the vacuum module over the corresponding Kac-Moody Lie algebra.
