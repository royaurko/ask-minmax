These lecture notes are intended to give a modest impulse to anyone willing
to start or pursue a journey into the theory of Vertex Algebras by reading one
of Kac's or Lepowsky-Li's books. Therefore, the primary goal is to provide
required tools and help being acquainted with the machinery which the whole
theory is based on. The exposition follows Kac's approach. Fundamental examples
relevant in Theoretical Physics are also discussed. No particular prerequisites
are assumed.
