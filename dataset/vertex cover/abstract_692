This paper is devoted to the calculation of the Reggeized quark-Reggeized
quark-gluon effective vertex in perturbative QCD in the next-to-leading order.
The case of QCD with massless quarks is considered and the correction is
obtained in the D->4 limit. This vertex appears in the quark Reggeization
theory, which next-to-leading order extension is now under construction.
