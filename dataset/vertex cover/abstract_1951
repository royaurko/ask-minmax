Let L be a Lie pseudoalgebra, a in L. We show that, if a generates a (finite)
solvable subalgebra S=<a>, then one may find a lifting a' in S of [a] in S/S'
such that <a'> is nilpotent. We then apply this result towards vertex algebras:
we show that every finite vertex algebra V admits a decomposition into a
semi-direct product V = U + N, where U is a subalgebra of V whose underlying
Lie conformal algebra U^lie is a nilpotent self-normalizing subalgebra of
V^lie, and N is a canonically determined ideal contained in the nilradical Nil
V.
