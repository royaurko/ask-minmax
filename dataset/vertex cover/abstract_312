We discuss the influence of boundary conditions on the continuum limit of the
six-vertex model by deriving a variational principle for the associated height
function with arbitrary fixed boundary conditions. We discuss its consequences
using the known phase diagram of the six-vertex model. In some particular cases
we compute explicitly the corresponding partial differential equations by means
of the Bethe Ansatz.
