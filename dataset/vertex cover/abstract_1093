In this paper, we extend the calculation of tensor vacuum susceptibility in
the rainbow-ladder approximation of the Dyson-Schwinger (DS) approach in
[Y.M.Shi, K.P.Wu, W.M.Sun, H.S.Zong, J.L.Ping, Phys. Lett. B $\bf{639}$, 248
(2006)] to that of employing the Ball-Chiu (BC) vertex. The dressing effect of
the quark-gluon vertex on the tensor vacuum susceptibility is investigated. Our
results show that compared with its rainbow-ladder approximation value, the
tensor vacuum susceptibility obtained in the BC vertex approximation is reduced
by about 10%. This shows that the dressing effect of the quark-gluon vertex is
not large in the calculation of the tensor vacuum susceptibility in the DS
approach.
