Using recent results of the contributor along with Vander Werf, we present the
classification and construction of mirror-twisted modules for N=2
supersymmetric vertex operator superalgebras of the form $V \otimes V$ for the
signed transposition mirror map automorphism. In particular, we show that the
category of such mirror-twisted sectors for $V\otimes V$ is isomorphic to the
category of N=1 Ramond sectors for $V$.
