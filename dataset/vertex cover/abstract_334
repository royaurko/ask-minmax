Let V be a simple vertex operator algebra and G a finite automorphism group.
We give a construction of intertwining operators for irreducible V^G-modules
which occur as submodules of irreducible V-modules by using intertwining
operators for V. We also determine some fusion rules for a vertex operator
algebra as an application.
