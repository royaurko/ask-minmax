A detector concept based on hybrid planar pixel-detector technology is under
development for the CLIC vertex detector. It comprises fast, low-power and
small-pitch readout ASICs implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology (CLICpix)
coupled to ultra-thin sensors via low-mass interconnects. The power dissipation
of the readout chips is reduced by means of power pulsing, allowing for a
cooling system based on forced gas flow. In this paper the CLIC vertex-detector
requirements are reviewed and the current status of R&D on sensors, readout and
detector integration is presented.
