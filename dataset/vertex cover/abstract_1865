In this two part series a chiral confining model of baryons is used to
describe low--lying negative parity resonances $N^*$, $\Delta^*$, $\Lambda^*$
and $\Sigma^*$ in the mean field approximation. A physical baryon in this model
consists of interacting valence quarks, mesons and a color and chiral singlet
hybrid field coexisting inside a dynamically generated confining region. This
first paper presents the quark contribution to the masses and wave functions of
negative parity baryons calculated with an effective spin--isospin dependent
instanton induced interaction. It does not include meson exchanges between
quarks. The three--quark wave functions are used to calculate meson--excited
baryon vertex functions to lowest order in meson--quark coupling. When the
baryons are on mass--shell each of these vertex functions is a product of a
coupling constant and a form factor. As examples, quark contributions to $N^*$
hadronic form factors as well as axial coupling constants are extracted from
the vertex functions and problems with the analytical behaviour of the model
form factors are discussed. The second paper will examine the mesonic
corrections to excited baryon properties in the heavy baryon and one--loop
approximations.
