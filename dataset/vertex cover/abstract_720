Let V be a simple vertex operator algebra and G a finite automorphism group.
Then there is a natural right G-action on the set of all inequivalent
irreducible V-modules. Let S be a finite set of inequivalent irreducible
V-modules which is closed under the action of G. There is a finite dimensional
semisimple associative algebra A_{\alpha}(G,S) for a suitable 2-cocycle \alpha
naturally determined by the G-action on S such that A_{\alpha}(G,S) and the
vertex operator algebra V^G form a dual pair on the sum of V-modules in S in
the sense of Howe. In particular, every irreducible V-module is completely
reducible V^G-module.
