We show that any complete $k$-partite graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, with $k \ge
3$, whose edges are two-coloured, can be covered with two vertex-disjoint
monochromatic paths of distinct colours. We prove this under the necessary
assumption that the largest partition class of $G$ contains at most $n/2$
vertices. This extends known results for complete and complete bipartite
graphs.
  Secondly, we show that in the same situation, all but $o(n)$ vertices of the
graph can be covered with two vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles of distinct
colours, if colourings close to a split colouring are excluded. From this we
derive that the whole graph, if large enough, may be covered with 14
vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles.
