The Kyoto group (Jimbo, Miwa, Nakayashikiet al.) showed that the partition
function and correlation funtions of the eight-vertex model in
antiferromagnetic phases can be calculated using simple analytical properties
of the $R$-matrix. We extend these methods to ferromagnetic and disordered
phases. We use Baxter's symmetries to obtain appropriate parametrizations of
the $R$-matrix and to substantiate the validity of the analytical approach for
these phases. These symmetries allow one to relate correlation functions in
different phases.
