In this article, we analyze the boundary behaviors of pure Yang-Mills
amplitudes under adjacent and non adjacent BCFW shifts in Feynman gauge. We
introduce reduced vertexes for Yang-Mills fields, prove that these reduced
vertexes are equivalent to the original vertexes as for the study of boundary
behaviors, which greatly simplifies our analysis of boundary behaviors.
Boundary behaviors for adjacent shifts are readily obtained using reduced
vertexes. Then we prove a theorem on permutation sum and use it to prove the
improved boundary behaviors for non-adjacent shifts. Based on the boundary
behaviors, we find that it is possible to generalize BCFW recursion relation to
calculate general tree level off shell amplitudes.
