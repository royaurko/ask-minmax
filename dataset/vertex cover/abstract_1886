Discrete analogs of extrema of curvature and generalizations of the
four-vertex theorem to the case of polygons and polyhedra are suggested and
developed. For smooth curves and polygonal lines in the plane, a formula
relating the number of extrema of curvature to the winding numbers of the
curves (polygonal lines) and their evolutes is obtained. Also are considered
higher-dimensional analogs of the four-vertex theorem for regular and shellable
triangulations.
