Minkowski sums cover a wide range of applications in many different fields
like algebra, morphing, robotics, mechanical CAD/CAM systems ... This paper
deals with sums of polytopes in a n dimensional space provided that both
H-representation and V-representation are available i.e. the polytopes are
described by both their half-spaces and vertices. The first method uses the
polytope normal fans and relies on the ability to intersect dual polyhedral
cones. Then we introduce another way of considering Minkowski sums of polytopes
based on the primal polyhedral cones attached to each vertex.
