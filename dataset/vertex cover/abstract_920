The exactly solvable four-vertex model on a square grid with the different
boundary conditions is considered. The application of the Algebraic Bethe
Ansatz method allows to calculate the partition function of the model. For the
fixed boundary conditions the connection of the scalar product of the state
vectors with the generating function of the column and row strict boxed plane
partitions is established. Tiling model on a periodic grid is discussed.
