The connection between Riemann surfaces with boundaries and the theory of
vertex operator algebras is discussed in the framework of conformal field
theories defined by Kontsevich and Segal and in the framework of their
generalizations in open string theory and boundary conformal field theory. We
present some results, problems, conjectures, their conceptual implications and
meanings in a program to construct these theories from representations of
vertex operator algebras.
