We present new results from the study of B decays at SLD: a measurement of
the inclusive double-charm branching fraction in B-hadron decays and a search
for the rare exclusive charmless decays B+ --> Rho0 Pi+(K+) and B+ --> K*0
Pi+(K+). Using a novel technique which consists of counting charged kaons
produced at the secondary (B) vertex and the tertiary (D) vertex, we measure
BR(B-->DDbarX) = 0.188 +- 0.025(stat) +- 0.059(syst). Another technique, based
on the comparison of the charge of the D vertex to the flavor of the B hadron
at production, yields a consistent result. In the search for rare exclusive B+
decays, no candidates were found and competitive branching ratio upper limits
are derived.
