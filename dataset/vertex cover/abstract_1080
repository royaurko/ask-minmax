We show a new class of embedding solutions of D5 brane, which wraps on $S^5$
in the AdS${}_5\times S^5$ space-time and contains fundamental strings as U(1)
flux to form a baryon vertex. The new solution given here is different from the
baryon vertex since it consists of two same side (north or south) poles of
$S^5$ as cusps, which are put on different points in our three dimensional
space. This implies that the same magnitude of electric displacement exists at
each cusp, but their orientations are opposite due to the flux number
conservation. This configuration is therefore regarded as a D5-$\bar{D5}$ bound
state, and we propose this as the vertex of a baryonium state, which is made of
a baryon and an anti-baryon. By attaching quarks and anti-quarks to the two
cusps of this vertex, it is possible to construct a realistic baryonium.
