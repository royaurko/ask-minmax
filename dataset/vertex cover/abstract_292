We investigate the semiclassical approach to the lensing of photons in a
spherically symmetric gravitational background, starting from Born level and
include in our analysis the radiative corrections obtained from the electroweak
theory for the graviton/photon/photon vertex. In this approach, the cross
section is related to the angular variation of the impact parameter ($b$),
which is then solved for $b$ as a function of the angle of deflection, and
measured in horizon units ($b_h\equiv b/(2 G M)$). Exact numerical solutions
for the angular deflection are presented. The numerical analysis shows that
perturbation theory in a weak background agrees with the classical Einstein
formula for the deflection already at distances of the order of $20$ horizon
units ($\sim 20\, b_h$) and it is optimal in the description both of very
strong and weak lensings. We show that the electroweak corrections to the cross
section are sizeable, becoming very significant for high energy gamma rays. Our
analysis covers in energy most of the photon spectrum, from the cosmic
microwave background up to very high energy gamma rays, and scatterings with
any value of the photon impact parameter. We also study the helicity-flip
photon amplitude, which is of $O(\alpha^2)$ in the weak coupling $\alpha$, and
its massless fermion limit, which involves the exchange of a conformal anomaly
pole. The corresponding cross section is proportional to the Born level result
and brings to a simple renormalization of Einsten's formula.
