We deal with a random graph model where at each step, a vertex is chosen
uniformly at random, and it is either duplicated or its edges are deleted.
Duplication has a given probability. We analyse the limit distribution of the
degree of a fixed vertex, and derive a.s. asymptotic bounds for the maximal
degree. The model shows a phase transition phenomenon with respect to the
probabilities of duplication and deletion.
