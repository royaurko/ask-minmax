BTeV is an approved forward collider experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron
dedicated to precision studies of CP violation, mixing, and rare decays of
beauty and charmed hadrons. The BTeV detector has been designed to achieve
these goals. Pixel detectors cover the interaction region and vertex
computation is included in the lowest level trigger.
