We give a representation--theoretic interpretation of recent discovered
coupled soliton equations using vertex operators construction of affinization
of not simple but quadratic Lie algebras. In this setup we are able to obtain
new integrable hierarchies coupled to each Drinfeld--Sokolov of $A$, $B$, $C$,
$D$ hierarchies and to construct their soliton solutions.
