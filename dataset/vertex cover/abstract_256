We derive perturbative constraints on the transverse part of the
fermion-boson vertex in massive QED3 through its one loop evaluation in an
arbitrary covariant gauge. Written in a particular form, these constraints
naturally lead us to the first non-perturbative construction of the vertex,
which is in complete agreement with its one loop expansion in all momentum
regimes. Without affecting its one-loop perturbative properties, we also
construct an effective vertex in such a way that the unknown functions defining
it have no dependence on the angle between the incoming and outgoing fermion
momenta. Such a vertex should be useful for the numerical study of dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking, leading to more reliable results.
