In this note we study `a la Baxter [1] the possible integrable manifolds of
the asymmetric eight-vertex model. As expected they occur when the Boltzmann
weights are either symmetric or satisfy the free-fermion condition but our
analysis clarify the reason both manifolds need to share a universal invariant.
We also show that the free-fermion condition implies three distinct classes of
integrable models.
