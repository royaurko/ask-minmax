We give a short introduction to generalized vertex algebras, using the notion
of polylocal fields. We construct a generalized vertex algebra associated to a
vector space h with a symmetric bilinear form. It contains as subalgebras all
lattice vertex algebras of rank equal to dim h and all irreducible
representations of these vertex algebras.
