The transverse symmetry transformations associated with the normal symmetry
transformations in gauge theories are introduced, which at first are used to
reproduce the transverse Ward-Takahashi identities in the Abelian theory QED.
Then the transverse symmetry transformations associated with the BRST symmetry
and chiral transformations in the non-Abelian theory QCD are used to derive the
transverse Slavnov-Taylor identities for the vector and axial-vector
quark-gluon vertices, respectively. Based on the set of normal and transverse
Slavnov-Taylor identities, an expression of the quark-gluon vertex function is
derived, which describes the constraints on the structure of the quark-gluon
vertex imposed from the underlying gauge symmetry of QCD alone. Its role in the
study of the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the quark propagator in QCD is
discussed.
