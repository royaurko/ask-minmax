The contributions to the electron-electron-photon vertex of two-loop
electroweak corrections are calculated. The relative correction to the
parity-violating asymmetry of M{\o}ller scattering for the case of 11 GeV
electron scattered off the electron at rest is found to be about -0.0034 and
should be taken into account at future experiment MOLLER at JLab.
