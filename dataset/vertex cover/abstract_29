In Part I we introduced the notion of enhanced vertex operator superalgebra,
and constructed an example which is self-dual, has rank 28, and whose full
symmetry group is a seven-fold cover of the sporadic simple group of Rudvalis.
In this article we construct a second enhanced vertex operator superalgebra
whose full automorphism group is a cyclic cover of the Rudvalis group. This new
example is self-dual and has rank -28. As in Part I, we can compute all the
McKay--Thompson series associated to the action of the Rudvalis group
explicitly. We observe that these series, when considered together with those
of Part I, satisfy a genus zero property.
