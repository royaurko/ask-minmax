It is known that $\Theta(\log n)$ chords must be added to an $n$-cycle to
produce a pancyclic graph; for vertex pancyclicity, where every vertex belongs
to a cycle of every length, $\Theta(n)$ chords are required. A possibly
`intermediate' variation is the following: given $k$, $1\leq k\leq n$, how many
chords must be added to ensure that there exist cycles of every length each of
which passes exactly $k$ chords? For fixed $k$, we establish a lower bound of
$\Omega\big(n^{1/k}\big)$ on the growth rate.
