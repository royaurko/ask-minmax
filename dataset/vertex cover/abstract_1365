We examine the sensitivity of $e \gamma$ colliders (based on $e^+ e^-$ linear
colliders of c.m. energy 500 GeV) to the anomalous couplings of the Higgs to
W-bosons via the process $e^- \gamma \longrightarrow \nu W H$. This has the
advantage over $e^+ e^-$ collider in being able to dissociate WWH vertex from
ZZH. We are able to construct several dynamical variables which may be used to
constrain vrious couplings in the WWH vertex.
