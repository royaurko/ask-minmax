The next-to-leading corrections to the jet vertex which is relevant for the
Mueller-Navelet jets production in hadronic collisions and for the forward jet
cross section in lepton-hadron collisions are presented in the context of a k_t
factorizazion formula which resums the leading and next-to-leading logarithms
of the energy. Both the quark- and gluon-initiated contribution are now
computed. This completes the framework for a full phenomenological analysis of
Mueller-Navelet jets in NL log(s) approximation. Forward jets phenomenology
still requires the NL photon impact factor.
