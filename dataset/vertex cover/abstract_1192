We introduce a new notion for geometric families called self-coverability and
show that homothets of convex polygons are self-coverable. As a corollary, we
obtain several results about coloring point sets such that any member of the
family with many points contains all colors. This is dual (and in some cases
equivalent) to the much investigated cover-decomposability problem.
