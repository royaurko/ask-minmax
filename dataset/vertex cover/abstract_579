Given a vertex-labeled graph, each vertex $v$ is attached with a label from a
set of labels. The vertex-label query desires the length of the shortest path
from the given vertex to the set of vertices with the given label. We show how
to construct an oracle if the given graph is planar, such that
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}n\log n)$ storing space is needed, and any vertex-label
query could be answered in $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log n\log \rho)$ time with
stretch $1+\epsilon$. $\rho$ is the radius of the given graph, which is half of
the diameter. For the case that $\rho = O(\log n)$, we construct an oracle that
achieves $O(\log n)$ query time, without changing the order of storing space.
