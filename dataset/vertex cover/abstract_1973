Switching about a vertex in a digraph means to reverse the direction of every
edge incident with that vertex. Bondy and Mercier introduced the problem of
whether a digraph can be reconstructed up to isomorphism from the multiset of
isomorphism types of digraphs obtained by switching about each vertex. Since
the largest known non-reconstructible oriented graphs have 8 vertices, it is
natural to ask whether there are any larger non-reconstructible graphs. In this
paper we continue the investigation of this question. We find that there are
exactly 44 non-reconstructible oriented graphs whose underlying undirected
graphs have maximum degree at most 2. We also determine the full set of
switching-stable oriented graphs, which are those graphs for which all
switchings return a digraph isomorphic to the original.
