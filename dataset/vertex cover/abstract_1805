We calculate the $F/D$ ratios of spin 1/2 baryon vertex for both the
non-relativistic quark model and the chiral soliton model with arbitrary number
of color degrees of freedom $N_c$ and examine the results in terms of the
consistency condition approach for the baryon vertices recently developed by
Dashen, Jenkins and Manohar from the viewpoint of QCD. We show that the $1/N_c$
corrections have two different origins, i.e. one is from the baryon states or
baryon wave functions and the other from the vertex operators. Although in the
limit of $N_c \to \infty$ the $F/D$ tends to 1/3 in all models, the $1/N_c$
expansion of $F/D$ ratio does not converge for $N_c=3$ in the chiral soliton
model in contrast to the non-relativistic quark model.
