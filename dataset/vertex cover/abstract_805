The form factor and the coupling constant in the $\eta_{b}BB^{\ast}$ vertex
are evaluated in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. The correlation
functions responsible for the vertex is evaluated considering contributions of
both $B$ and $B^{\ast}$ mesons as off-shell states. The form factors obtained
are different for the two cases, whereas the final results of the coupling
constant are compatible.
