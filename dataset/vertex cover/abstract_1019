We investigate the applicability of Migdal--Eliashberg (ME) theory by
revisiting Migdal's analysis within the dynamical mean-field theory framework.
First, we compute spectral functions, the quasi-particle weight, the self
energy, renormalised phonon frequency and resistivity curves of the half-filled
Holstein model. We demonstrate how ME theory has a phase-transition-like
instability at intermediate coupling, and how the Engelsberg--Schrieffer (ES)
picture is complicated by low-energy excitations from higher order diagrams
(demonstrating that ES theory is a very weak coupling approach). Through
consideration of the lowest-order vertex correction, we analyse the
applicability of ME theory close to this transition. We find a breakdown of the
theory in the intermediate coupling adiabatic limit due to a divergence in the
vertex function. The region of applicability is mapped out, and it is found
that ME theory is only reliable in the weak coupling adiabatic limit, raising
questions about the accuracy of recent analyses of cuprate superconductors
which do not include vertex corrections.
