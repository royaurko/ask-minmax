GRAPE-Dilepton is a Monte Carlo event generator for dilepton production in ep
collisions. The cross-section calculation is based on the exact matrix elements
in the electroweak theory at tree level. The dilepton productions via $\gamma
\gamma$, $\gamma Z^0$, $Z^0 Z^0$ collisions and via photon internal conversion
are taken into account. In addition, the effects of the $Z^0$ on/off-shell
production are also included. The relevant Feynman amplitudes are generated by
the automatic calculation system GRACE. The calculation of the proton vertex
covers the whole kinematical region. This generator has an interface to PYTHIA
and SOPHIA to obtain complete hadronic final states.
