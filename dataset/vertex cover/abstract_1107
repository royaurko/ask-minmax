We develop a general method of computing the contribution of the vertex
operators to the semi-classical correlation functions of heavy string states,
based on the state-operator correspondence and the integrable structure of the
system. Our method requires only the knowledge of the local behavior of the
saddle point configuration around each vertex insertion point and can be
applied to cases where the precise forms of the vertex operators are not known.
As an important application, we compute the contributions of the vertex
operators to the three-point functions of the large spin limit of the
Gubser-Klebanov-Polyakov (GKP) strings in $AdS_3$ spacetime, left unevaluated
in our previous work [arXiv:1110.3949] which initiated such a study. Combining
with the finite part of the action already computed previously and with the
newly evaluated divergent part of the action, we obtain finite three-point
functions with the expected dependence of the target space boundary coordinates
on the dilatation charge and the spin.
