This article is concerned with the convexity properties of universal covers
of projective varieties. We study the relation between the convexity properties
of the universal cover of X and the properties of the pullback map sending
vector bundles on X to vector bundles on its universal cover. Our approach
motivates a weakened version of the Shafarevich conjecture. We prove this
conjecture for projective varieties X whose pullback map identifies a
nontrivial extension of a negative vector bundle $V$ by the trivial line bundle
with the trivial extension. We prove the following pivotal result: if a
universal cover of a projective variety has no nonconstant holomorphic
functions then the pullback map of vector bundles is almost an imbedding. Our
methods also give a new proof of the vanishing of the first cohomology for
negative vector bundles $V$ over a compact complex manifold $X$ whose rank is
smaller than the dimension of X.
