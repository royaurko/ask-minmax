We show that the background field method (BFM) is a simple way of deriving
the same gauge-invariant results which are obtained by the pinch technique
(PT). For illustration we construct gauge-invariant self-energy and three-point
vertices for gluons at one-loop level by BFM and demonstrate that we get the
same results which were derived via PT. We also calculate the four-gluon vertex
in BFM and show that this vertex obeys the same Ward identity that was found
with PT.}
