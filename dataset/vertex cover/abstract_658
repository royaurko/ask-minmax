We show how the directed-loop Monte Carlo algorithm can be applied to study
vertex models. The algorithm is employed to calculate the arrow polarization in
the six-vertex model with the domain wall boundary conditions (DWBC). The model
exhibits spatially separated ordered and ``disordered'' regions. We show how
the boundary between these regions depends on parameters of the model. We give
some predictions on the behavior of the polarization in the thermodynamic limit
and discuss the relation to the Arctic Circle theorem.
