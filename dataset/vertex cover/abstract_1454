In this paper all seven-vertex type solutions of the coloured Yang-Baxter
equation dependent on spectral as well as coloured parameters are given. It is
proved that they are composed of five groups of basic solutions, two groups of
their degenerate forms up to five solution transformations. Moreover, all
solutions can be claasified into two types called Baxter type and free-fermion
type.
