Triple gauge boson vertex, which is inherent to the model of a dynamical
breaking of the electroweak symmetry, leads to an effective four-fermion
interaction of quarks. Calculation of the effective coupling constant in the
framework of the model results in agreement with recent information on
enhancement of inclusive high E_T jet cross section at \sqrt{s} = 1.8 TeV. Thus
this effect may be connected with triple gauge boson vertex with coupling
constant \lambda \approx 0.7, which will clearly manifest itself at the soon
forthcoming LEP II.
