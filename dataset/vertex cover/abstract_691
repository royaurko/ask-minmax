We analyse the momentum space triple Pomeron vertex in perturbative QCD. In
addition to the standard form of this vertex which is used in the context of
total cross-sections at high energies and in the QCD reggeon field theory,
there exists an alternative form which has to be used in the study of high-mass
diffraction. We review and analyse the relation between these two versions. We
discuss some implications for the BK-equation. In the second part of our paper
we extend this analysis to the Pomeron-Odderon-Odderon vertex.
