We study the growth of the order of torsion subgroups of the homology in a
tower of finite abelian coverings. In particular, we prove that it is
exponential for when the tower converges to the maximal free abelian cover of a
link complement when the first nonzero Alexander polynomial has positive
logarithmic Mahler measure.
