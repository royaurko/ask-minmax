We describe the two major components of CLEO III: the Silicon Vertex Detector
and the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH). The Silicon Vertex Detector is
a four layer barrel-style device which spans the radial distance from 2.5 cm to
10.1 cm and covers 93% of the solid angle. It is being constructed using
double-sided silicon sensors read out by front end electronics devices
especially designed for this application. The RICH system consists of LiF
radiators and multiwire proportional chambers containing a mixture of CH4 and
TEA gases. The radiators are both flat and "sawtooth." Results from a test beam
run of final CLEO III RICH modules will be presented, as well as test beam data
on sensors to be employed in the Silicon Vertex Tracker.
