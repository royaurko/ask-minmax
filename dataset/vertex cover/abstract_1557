We present evidence for the target space duality symmetry associated with
massive excited states of closed bosonic string. The evolution of string is
considered in ${\hat D}$ spacetime dimensions; out of which d spacial
dimensions are compactified on torus. The phase space Hamiltonian formulation
is adopted to unveil the T-duality symmetry from the worldsheet perspective.
The existence of this symmetry is verified for a few massive levels. A
systematic procedure is presented to study T-duality symmetry of vertex
operators for all massive levels of closed bosonic string. It is argued that
all vertex operators corresponding to excited massive states can be cast in an
O(d,d) invariant form where d is the number of compact dimensions.
