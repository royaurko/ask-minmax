A representation of the central extension of the unitary Lie algebra
coordinated with a skew Laurent polynomial ring is constructed using vertex
operators over an integral Z_2-lattice. The irreducible decomposition of the
representation is explicitly computed and described. As a by-product, some
fundamental representations of affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra of type $A_n^{(2)}$
are recovered by the new method.
