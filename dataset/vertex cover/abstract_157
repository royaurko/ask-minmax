We compute the number of finite dimensional irreducible modules for the
algebras quantizing Nakajima quiver varieties. We get a lower bound for all
quivers and vectors of framing and provide an exact count in the case when the
quiver is of finite type or is of affine type and the framing is the coordinate
vector at the extending vertex. The latter case precisely covers Etingof's
conjecture on the number of finite dimensional irreducible representations for
Symplectic reflection algebras associated to wreath-product groups. We use
several different techniques, the two principal ones are categorical Kac-Moody
actions and wall-crossing functors. We finish the paper outlining some future
directions of research.
