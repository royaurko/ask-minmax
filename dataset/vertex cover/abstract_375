We define a refined topological vertex which depends in addition on a
parameter, which physically corresponds to extending the self-dual graviphoton
field strength to a more general configuration. Using this refined topological
vertex we compute, using geometric engineering, a two-parameter (equivariant)
instanton expansion of gauge theories which reproduce the results of Nekrasov.
The refined vertex is also expected to be related to Khovanov knot invariants.
