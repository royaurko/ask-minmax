Let G be a group, let T be an (oriented) G-tree with finite edge stabilizers,
and let VT denote the vertex set of T. We show that, for each G-retract V' of
the G-set VT, there exists a G-tree whose edge stabilizers are finite and whose
vertex set is V'. This fact leads to various new consequences of the almost
stability theorem. We also give an example of a group G, a G-tree T and a
G-retract V' of VT such that no G-tree has vertex set V'.
