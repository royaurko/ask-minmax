A measurement of charm and beauty dijet photoproduction cross sections at the
ep collider HERA is presented. Events are selected with two or more jets of
transverse momentum $p_t^{jet}_{1(2)}>11(8)$ GeV in the central range of
pseudo-rapidity $-0.9<\eta^{jet}_{1(2)}<1.3$. The fractions of events
containing charm and beauty quarks are determined using a method based on the
impact parameter, in the transverse plane, of tracks to the primary vertex, as
measured by the H1 central vertex detector. Differential dijet cross sections
for charm and beauty, and their relative contributions to the flavour inclusive
dijet photoproduction cross section, are measured as a function of the
transverse momentum of the leading jet, the average pseudo-rapidity of the two
jets and the observable $x_{\gamma}^{obs}$. Taking into account the theoretical
uncertainties, the charm cross sections are consistent with a QCD calculation
in next-to-leading order, while the predicted cross sections for beauty
production are somewhat lower than the measurement.
