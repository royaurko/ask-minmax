We construct a surface of general type with canonical map of degree 12 which
factors as a triple cover and a bidouble cover of $\mathbb P^2$. We also show
the existence of a smooth surface with $q=0,$ $\chi=13$ and $K^2=9\chi$ such
that its canonical map is either of degree 3 onto a surface of general type or
of degree 9 onto a rational surface.
