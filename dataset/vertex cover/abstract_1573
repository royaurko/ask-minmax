We present the results of a search for neutralinos decaying at a significant
distance from their production point into charged hadrons and a high momentum
muon, forming displaced vertexes. The analysis was performed with 33 pb^-1 of
pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2010 at
sqrt{s}= 7 TeV. The poster will show some highlights of the analysis.
