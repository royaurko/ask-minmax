The description of electromagnetic interactions with hadrons from the quark
level requires knowledge of the underlying quark-gluon ingredients. I discuss
some properties of the quark-photon vertex and quark Compton vertex, along with
the role of electromagnetic gauge invariance and vector-meson dominance. A
simple parametrization for the quark-photon vertex is given.
