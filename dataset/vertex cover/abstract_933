Primary vertex finding for collider experiments is studied. The efficiency
and precision of finding interaction vertices can be improved by advanced
clustering and classification methods, such as agglomerative clustering with
fast pairwise nearest neighbor search, followed by Gaussian mixture model or
k-means clustering.
