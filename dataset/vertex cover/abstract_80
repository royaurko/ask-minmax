A graph is said to be a cover graph if it is the underlying graph of the
Hasse diagram of a finite partially ordered set. The direct product G X H of
graphs G and H is the graph having vertex set V(G) X V(H) and edge set E(G X H)
= {(g_i,h_s)(g_j,h_t): g_ig_j belongs to E(G) and h_sh_t belongs to E(H)}. We
prove that the direct product M_m(G) X M_n(H) of the generalized Mycielskians
of G and H is a cover graph if and only if G or H is bipartite.
