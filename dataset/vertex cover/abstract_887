We review aspects of quantisation of the 11-dimensional supermembrane world
volume theory. We explicitly construct vertex operators for the massless states
and study interactions of supermembranes. The open supermembrane and its vertex
operators are discussed. We show how our results have direct applications to
Matrix theory by appropriate regularisation of the supermembrane.
