A fast second level trigger has been developed for the ARGUS experiment which
recognizes tracks originating from the interaction region. The processor
compares the hits in the ARGUS Micro Vertex Drift Chamber to 245760 masks
stored in random access memories. The masks which are fully defined in three
dimensions are able to reject tracks originating in the wall of the narrow
beampipe of 10.5\,mm radius.
