We present a classification of transitive vertex algebroids on a smooth
variety X carried out in the spirit of Bressler's classification of Courant
algebroids. In particular, we compute the class of the stack of transitive
vertex algebroids. We define deformations of sheaves of twisted chiral
differential operators introduced in \cite{AChM} and use the classification
result to describe and classify such deformations. As a particular case, we
obtain a localization of Wakimoto modules at non-critical level on flag
manifolds.
