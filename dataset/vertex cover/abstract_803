We study the supersymmetric Wilson loop as introduced by Caron-Huot, which
attaches to lightlike polygons certain edge and vertex operators, whose shape
is determined by supersymmetry constraints. We state explicit formulas for the
vertex operators to all orders in the Gra{\ss}mann expansion, thus filling a
gap in the literature. This is achieved by deriving a recursion formula out of
the supersymmetry constraints.
