We present results of numerical solutions of Schwinger-Dyson equations for
the finite-temperature quark and electron propagators. It is shown that both
strongly coupled QED and QCD undergo a chiral symmetry restoring phase
transition as the temperature is increased. We go beyond the bare vertex or
"rainbow" approximation by applying the finite-temperature Ward-Takahashi
identity to constrain the non-perturbative vertex function.
