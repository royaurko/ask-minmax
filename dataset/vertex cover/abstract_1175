We investigate the Galois coverings of weakly shod algebras. For a weakly
shod algebra not quasi-tilted of canonical type, we establish a correspondence
between its Galois coverings and the Galois coverings of its connecting
component. As a consequence, we show that a weakly shod algebra is simply
connected if and only if its first Hochschild cohomology group vanishes.
