This is the first in a series of papers where we study logarithmic
intertwining operators for various vertex subalgebras of Heisenberg vertex
operator algebras. In this paper we examine logarithmic intertwining operators
associated with rank one Heisenberg vertex operator algebra $M(1)_a$, of
central charge $1-12a^2$. We classify these operators in terms of {\em depth}
and provide explicit constructions in all cases. Furthermore, for $a=0$ we
focus on the vertex operator subalgebra L(1,0) of $M(1)_0$ and obtain
logarithmic intertwining operators among indecomposable Virasoro algebra
modules. In particular, we construct explicitly a family of {\em hidden}
logarithmic intertwining operators, i.e., those that operate among two ordinary
and one genuine logarithmic L(1,0)-module.
