We summarise results for the running coupling from the four-gluon vertex in
Landau gauge, SU($N_c$) Yang-Mills theory as given by a combination of dressing
functions of the vertex and the gluon propagator. These functions have been
determined numerically from the corresponding set of Dyson-Schwinger equations.
In the infrared we obtain a nontrivial infrared fixed point which is three
orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding one in the coupling of the
ghost-gluon vertex.
