DEPFET active pixel sensors are a well-developed technology for vertex
detectors at future colliders. Extensive test beam campaigns have proven the
excellent performance of these devices, and their radiation hardness has been
thoroughly tested. For the Belle-II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider, a new
vertex detector based on DEPFET technology is being developed, using sensors
thinned down to 75 \mu m. We give an overview over recent results with test
devices using ILC pixel geometries as well as the concepts and challenges for
the Belle-II pixel vertex tracker and discuss how the R&D for the ILC VXD can
take advantage of these developments.
