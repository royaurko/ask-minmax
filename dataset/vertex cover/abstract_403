Fine pixel CCD (FPCCD) is one of the candidate sensor technologies for the
vertex detector used for experiments at the International Linear Collider
(ILC). A vertex detector system for the International Large Detector (ILD)
using FPCCD sensors has been designed. We report on the R&D status of FPCCD
sensors, as well as the vertex detector design for ILD.
