A regular vertex operator algebra is a vertex operator algebra such that any
weak module (without grading) is a direct sum of ordinary irreducible modules.
In this paper we give several sufficient conditions under which a rational
vertex operator algebra is regular. We prove that the moonshine module vertex
operator algebra $V^{\natural},$ the vertex operator algebras $L(l,0)$
associated with the integrable representations of affine algebras of level $l,$
the vertex operator algebras $L(c_{p,q},0)$ associated with irreducible highest
weight representations for the discrete series of the Virasoro algebra and the
vertex operator algebras $V_L$ associated with positive definite even lattices
$L$ are regular. Our result for $L(l,0)$ implies that any restricted integrable
module of level $l$ for the corresponding affine Lie algebra is a direct sum of
irreducible highest weight integrable modules. The space $V_L$ in general is a
vertex algebra if $L$ is not positive definite. In this case we establish the
complete reducibility of any weak module.
