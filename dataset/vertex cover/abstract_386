The shadow V' of a self-dual vertex operator superalgebra V is defined as the
direct sum of the irreducible modules of its even vertex operator subalgebra
$V_{(0)}$ not contained in $V=V_{(0)}+V_{(1)}$. We describe the self-dual
``very nice'' unitary rational vertex operator superalgebras V of rank c whose
shadows have the largest possible minimal weights c/8 or c/8-1. The results are
analogous to and imply the corresponding results for self-dual binary codes and
lattices.
