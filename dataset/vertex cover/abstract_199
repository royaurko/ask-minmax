The notion of vertex operator coalgebra is presented which corresponds to the
family of correlation functions of one string propagating in space-time
splitting into n strings in conformal field theory. This notion is in some
sense dual to the notion of vertex operator algebra. We prove that any vertex
operator algebra equipped with a non-degenerate, Virasoro preserving, bilinear
form gives rise to a corresponding vertex operator coalgebra.
