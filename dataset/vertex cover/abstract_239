Given a sphere of radius $r>1$ in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, we
study the coverings of this sphere with unit spheres. Our goal is to design a
covering of the lowest covering density, which defines the average number of
unit spheres covering a point in a bigger sphere. For growing $n,$ we obtain
the covering density of $(n\ln n)/2.$ This new upper bound is half the order
$n\ln n$ established in the classic Rogers bound.
