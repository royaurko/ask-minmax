We derive lower bounds for the size of simplicial covers of simplotopes,
which are products of simplices. These also serve as lower bounds for
triangulations of such polytopes, including triangulations with interior
vertices. We establish that a minimal triangulation of a product of two
simplices is given by a vertex triangulation, i.e., one without interior
vertices. For products of more than two simplices, we produce bounds for
products of segments and triangles. Our analysis yields linear programs that
arise from considerations of covering exterior faces and exploiting the product
structure of these polytopes. Aside from cubes, these are the first known lower
bounds for triangulations of simplotopes with three or more factors. We also
construct a minimal triangulation for the product of a triangle and a square,
and compare it to our lower bound.
