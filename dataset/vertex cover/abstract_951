We prove a sharpened version of a conjecture of Dong-Mason about lattice
subalgebras of a strongly regular vertex operator algebra $V$, and give some
applications. These include the existence of a canonical conformal subVOA
$W\otimes G\otimes Z \subseteq V$, and a generalization of the theory of
minimal models.
