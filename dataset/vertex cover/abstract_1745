We study a new embedding solutions of D5 brane in an asymptotic
AdS${}_5\times S^5$ space-time, which is dual to a confining $SU(N_c)$ gauge
theory. The D5 brane is wrapped on $S^5$ as in the case of the vertex of
holographic baryon. However, the solution given here is different from the
usual baryon vertex in the point that it couples to $k$-anti-quarks and $N_c+k$
quarks on the opposite two points of $S^5$, the north and south poles,
respectively. The total quark number of this state is preserved as $N_c$ when
minus one is assigned to anti-quark, then it forms a color singlet like the
baryon. However, this includes anti-quarks and quarks, whose number is larger
than that of the baryon. When we set as $N_c=3$, we find the so called penta
and hepta-quark states. We study the dynamical properties of these states by
solving the vertex and string configurations for such states. The mass spectra
of these states and the tension of the stretched vertex are estimated, and they
are compared with that of the baryon.
