With the help of the Drinfeld twist or factorizing F-matrix for the
eight-vertex SOS model, we obtain the explicit determinant expression of the
partition function of the eight-vertex model with a generic non-diagonal
reflecting end and domain wall boundary condition. Our result shows that,
contrary to the eight-vertex model without a reflection end, the partition
function can be expressed as a single determinant.
