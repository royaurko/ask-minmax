The cover time of a graph is a celebrated example of a parameter that is easy
to approximate using a randomized algorithm, but for which no constant factor
deterministic polynomial time approximation is known. A breakthrough due to
Kahn, Kim, Lovasz and Vu yielded a (log log n)^2 polynomial time approximation.
We refine this upper bound, and show that the resulting bound is sharp and
explicitly computable in random graphs. Cooper and Frieze showed that the cover
time of the largest component of the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,c/n) in the
supercritical regime with c>1 fixed, is asymptotic to f(c) n \log^2 n, where
f(c) tends to 1 as c tends to 1. However, our new bound implies that the cover
time for the critical Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,1/n) has order n, and shows
how the cover time evolves from the critical window to the supercritical phase.
Our general estimate also yields the order of the cover time for a variety of
other concrete graphs, including critical percolation clusters on the Hamming
hypercube {0,1}^n, on high-girth expanders, and on tori Z_n^d for fixed large
d. For the graphs we consider, our results show that the blanket time,
introduced by Winkler and Zuckerman, is within a constant factor of the cover
time. Finally, we prove that for any connected graph, adding an edge can
increase the cover time by at most a factor of 4.
