Twisted modules for N=2 supersymmetric vertex operator superalgebras are
classified for the vertex operator superalgebra automorphisms which are lifts
of a finite automorphism of the N=2 Neveu-Schwarz Lie superalgebra
representation. These include the Ramond-twisted sectors and mirror-twisted
sectors for N=2 vertex operator superalgebras, as well as twisted modules
related to more general "spectral flow" representations of the N=2
Neveu-Schwarz algebra. We present the construct of twisted modules for free N=2
vertex operator superalgebras for all of the N=2 Neveu-Schwarz Lie superalgebra
automorphisms of finite order. We show how to extend these to lattice N=2
vertex operator superalgebras. As a consequence, we also construct the
Ramond-twisted sectors for free and lattice N=1 supersymmetric vertex operator
superalgebras. We show that the lifting of the mirror automorphism for the N=2
Neveu-Schwarz algebra to an N=2 vertex operator superalgebra is not unique and
that different mirror map vertex operator superalgebra automorphisms of an N=2
vertex operator superalgebra can lead to non-isomorphic categories of
mirror-twisted modules, as in the case of free and lattice N=2 vertex operator
superalgebras.
