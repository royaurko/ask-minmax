We estimate the correction to the Zbb-bar vertex arising from the exchanges
of the sideways extended technicolor (ETC) boson and the flavor-diagonal ETC
boson in the multiscale walking technicolor model. The obtained result is too
large to explain the present data. However, if we introduce a new self-
interaction for the top quark to induce the top quark condensate serving as the
origin of the large top quark mass, the corrected R_b=Gamma_b/Gamma_h can be
consistent with the recent LEP data. The corresponding correction to
R_c=Gamma_c/Gamma_h is shown to be negligibly small.
