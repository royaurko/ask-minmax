Let $V$ be a simple vertex operator algebra which admits the continuous,
faithful action of a compact Lie group $G$ of automorphisms. We establish a
Schur-Weyl type duality between the unitary, irreducible modules for $G$ and
the irreducible modules for $V^G$ which are contained in $V$ where $V^G$ is the
space of $G$-invariants of $V.$ We also prove a concomitant Galois
correspondence between vertex operator subalgebras of $V$ which contain $V^G$
and closed Lie subgroups of $G$ in the case that $G$ is abelian.
