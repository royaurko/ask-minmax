The response of a correlated nuclear system to an external field is
discussed. The Bethe-Salpeter equation for the dressed vertex is solved. The
kernel of the integral equation for the vertex is chosen consistently with the
approximation for the self-energy. This guarantees the fulfillment of the f-sum
rule for the response function.
