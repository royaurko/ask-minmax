Triple systems are closely related to Yang-Baxter symmetries. Utilizing a
non-parameter-dependent triple product, we derive the BCS interaction. The
enlargement of the notion of symmetry leads in some sense to a regular vertex
function. The connection to the effect of running coupling constants is
outlined, which leads to the recently discussed anisotropic effective local
interactions. Furthermore, a discussion of the physical nature of q-symmetries
is given.
