We introduce and study a semigroup structure on the set of irreducible
components of the Hurwitz space of marked coverings of a complex projective
curve with given Galois group of the coverings and fixed ramification type. As
application, we give new conditions on the ramification type that are
sufficient for irreducibility of the Hurwitz spaces, suggest some bounds on the
number of irreducibility components under certain more general conditions, and
show that the number of irreducible components coincides with the number of
topological classes of the coverings if the number of brunch points is big
enough.
