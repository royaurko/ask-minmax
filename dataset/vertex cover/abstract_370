We calculate 3-point correlation functions of Delta-BMN operators with 3
scalar impurites in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory. We use these results to
test the pp-wave/SYM duality correspondence of the vertex--correlator type.
This correspondence relates the coefficients of 3-point correlators of
Delta-BMN operators in gauge theory to the 3-string vertex in lightcone string
field theory in the pp-wave background. We verify the vertex--correlator
duality equation of hep-th/0301036 at the 3 scalar impurites level for
supergravity and for string modes.
