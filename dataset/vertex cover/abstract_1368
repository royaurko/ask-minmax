We derive an expression in closed form for the action of a finite element of
the Virasoro Group on generalized vertex operators. This complements earlier
results giving an algorithm to compute the action of a finite string of
generators of the Virasoro Algebra on generalized vertex operators. The main
new idea is to use a first order formalism to represent the infinitesimal group
element as a loop variable. To obtain a finite group element it is necessary to
thicken the loop to a band of finite thickness. This technique makes the
calculation very simple.
