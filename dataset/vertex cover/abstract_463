This is the third part of the revised versions of the notes of three
consecutive expository lectures given by Chongying Dong, Haisheng Li and Yi-Zhi
Huang in the conference on Monster and vertex operator algebras at the Research
Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Kyoto, September 4-9, 1994. In this part,
we discuss an $S_{3}$-symmetry of the Jacobi identity, construct the
contragredient module for a module for a vertex operator algebra and apply
these to the construction of the vertex operator map for the moonshine module.
We review the notions of intertwining operator, fusion rule and Verlinde
algebra. We also describe briefly the geometric interpretation of vertex
operator algebras. We end the exposition with an explanation of the role of
vertex operator algebras in conformal field theories.
