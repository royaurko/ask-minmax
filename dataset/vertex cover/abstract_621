In this paper we extend previous studies of selection principles for families
of open covers of sets of real numbers to also include families of countable
Borel covers.
  The main results of the paper could be summarized as follows:
  1. Some of the classes which were different for open covers are equal for
Borel covers -- Section 1;
  2. Some Borel classes coincide with classes that have been studied under a
different guise by other contributors -- Section 4.
