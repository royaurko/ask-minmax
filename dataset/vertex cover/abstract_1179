There are several theoretical indications that the energy region covered by
the proposed NICA accelerator in Dubna is an extremely interesting one. We
present a review of data obtained in relativistic heavy ion collisions and show
that there is a gap around 10 GeV where more and better precise measurements
are needed. The theoretical interpretation can only be clarified by covering
this energy region. In particular the strangeness content needs to be
determined, data covering the full phase space ($4 \pi$) would be very helpful
to establish the thermal parameters of a possible phase transition.
