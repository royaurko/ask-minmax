We introduce several associative algebras and series of vector spaces
associated to these algebras. Using lattice vertex operators, we obtain
dimension and character formulae for these spaces. In particular, we a series
of representations of symmetric groups which turn out to be isomorphic to
parking function modules. We also construct series of vector spaces whose
dimensions are Catalan numbers and Fuss--Catalan numbers respectively.
Conjecturally, these spaces are related to spaces of global sections of vector
bundles on (zero fibres of) Hilbert schemes and representations of rational
Cherednik algebras.
