We define stacks of uniform cyclic covers of Brauer-Severi schemes, proving
that they can be realized as quotient stacks of open subsets of
representations, and compute the Picard group for the open substacks
parametrizing smooth uniform cyclic covers. Moreover, we give an analogous
description for stacks parametrizing triple cyclic covers of Brauer-Severi
schemes of rank 1, which are not necessarily uniform, and give a presentation
of the Picard group for substacks corresponding to smooth triple cyclic covers.
