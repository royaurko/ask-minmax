We show that trace functions on modules of topological N=2 super vertex
algebras give rise to conformal blocks on elliptic supercurves. We show that
they satisfy a system of linear partial differential equations with respect to
the modular parameters of the supercurves. Under some finiteness condition on
the vertex algebra these differential equations can be interpreted as a
connection on the vector bundle of conformal blocks. We show that this
connection is equivariant with respect to a natural action of the Jacobi
modular group on the modular parameters and the trace functions. In the
appendix we prove the convergence of the trace functions.
