We consider a class of weak modules for vertex operator algebras that we call
logarithmic modules. We also construct nontrivial examples of intertwining
operators between certain logarithmic modules for the Virasoro vertex operator
algebra. At the end we speculate about some possible logarithmic intertwiners
at the level $c=0$.
