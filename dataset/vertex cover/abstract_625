This paper continues the results of "Domination Cover Pebbling: Graph
Families." An almost sharp bound for the domination cover pebbling (DCP) number
for graphs G with specified diameter has been computed. For graphs of diameter
two, a bound for the ratio between the cover pebbling number of G and the DCP
number of G has been computed. A variant of domination cover pebbling, called
subversion DCP is introducted, and preliminary results are discussed.
