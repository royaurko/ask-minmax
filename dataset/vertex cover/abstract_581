The quark-gluon vertex in Landau gauge QCD is investigated in the
Dyson-Schwinger approach. The aim is to obtain a fully self-consistent solution
of the quark propagator and the quark-gluon vertex Dyson-Schwinger equation
(DSE) in the vacuum using the gluon propagator as input from other
calculations. The truncation scheme used in an earlier study is systematically
improved and the first decisive step towards a full solution is presented.
First results for the quark propagator with a fully dressed quark-gluon vertex
in a truncation that incorporates all twelve vertex tensor-structures are
shown.
