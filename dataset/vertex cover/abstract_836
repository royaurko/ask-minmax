We prove that for every graph, any vertex subset $S$, and given integers
$k,\ell$: there are $k$ disjoint cycles of length at least $\ell$ that each
contain at least one vertex from $S$, or a vertex set of size $O(\ell \cdot k
\log k)$ that meets all such cycles. This generalises previous results of
Fiorini and Hendrickx and of Pontecorvi and Wollan.
  In addition, we describe an algorithm for our main result that runs in $O(k
\log k \cdot s^2 \cdot (f(\ell) \cdot n+m))$ time, where $s$ denotes the
cardinality of $S$.
