Inclusive charm and beauty cross sections are measured in e-p and e+p neutral
current collisions at HERA in the kinematic region of photon virtuality
5<Q^2<2000 GeV^2 and Bjorken scaling variable 0.0002<x<0.05. The data were
collected with the H1 detector in the years 2006 and 2007 corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 189 pb^-1. The numbers of charm and beauty events are
determined using variables reconstructed by the H1 vertex detector including
the impact parameter of tracks to the primary vertex and the position of the
secondary vertex. The measurements are combined with previous data and compared
to QCD predictions.
