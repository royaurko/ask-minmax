The results of Coulomb gauge and Landau gauge lattice QCD simulation do not
agree completely with continuum theory. There are indications that the ghost
propagator in the infrared region is not purely color diagonal as in high
energy region. After presenting lattice simulation of configurations produced
with Kogut-Susskind fermion (MILC collaboration) and those with domain wall
fermion (RBC/UKQCD collaboration), I investigate in triple gluon vertex and the
ghost-gluon-ghost vertex how the square of the color antisymmetric ghost
contributes. Then the effect of the vertex correction to the gluon propagator
and the ghost propagator is investigated.
  Recent Dyson-Schwinger equation analysis suggests the ghost dressing function
$G(0)=$ finite and no infrared enhancement or $\alpha_G=0$. But the ghost
propagator renormalized by the loop containing a product of color antisymmetric
ghost is expected to behave as $< c\bar c>_r =-\frac{G(q^2)}{q^2}$ with
$G(q^2)\propto q^{-2(1+\alpha_G)}$ with $\alpha_G = 0.5$, if the fixed point
scenario is valid. I interpret the $\alpha_G=0$ solution should contain a
vertex correction. The infrared exponent of our lattice Landau gauge gluon
propagator of the RBC/UKQCD is $\kappa=\alpha_G=-0.5$ and that of MILC is about
-0.7.
  The implication for the Kugo-Ojima color confinement criterion, QCD effective
coupling and the Slavnov identity are given.
