Semi-Equivelar maps are generalizations of Archimedean Solids (as are
equivelar maps of the Platonic solids) to the surfaces other than $2-$Sphere.
We classify some semi equivelar maps on surface of Euler characteristic -1 and
show that none of these are vertex transitive. We establish existence of
12-covered triangulations for this surface. We further construct double cover
of these maps to show existence of semi-equivelar maps on the surface of double
torus. We also construct several semi-equivelar maps on the surfaces of Euler
characteristics -8 and -10 and on non-orientable surface of Euler
characteristics -2.
