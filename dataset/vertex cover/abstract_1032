The divergences appearing in the 3+1 dimensional fermion-loop calculations
are often regulated by smearing the vertices in a covariant manner. Performing
a parallel light-front calculation, we corroborate the similarity between the
vertex-smearing-technique and the Pauli-Villars regularization. In the
light-front calculation of the electromagnetic meson current, we find that the
persistent end-point singularity that appears in the case of point vertices is
removed even if the smeared-vertex is taken to the limit of the point-vertex.
Recapitulating the current conservation, we substantiate the finiteness of both
valence and non-valence contributions in all components of the current with the
regularized bound-state vertex. However, we stress that each contribution,
valence or non-valence, depends on the reference-frame even though the sum is
always frame-independent. The numerical taxonomy of each contribution including
the instantaneous contribution and the zero-mode contribution is presented in
the $\pi$, $K$, and $D$-meson form factors.
