We consider inclusive hadroproduction of jets, prompt photons, b-jets, and
D-mesons in the quasi-multi-Regge-kinematics approach based on the hypothesis
of gluon and quark Reggeization in t-channel exchanges at high energies. The
data taken by the CDF and D0 Collaborations at the Fermilab Tevatron are well
described without adjusting parameters. We find the main contribution to
inclusive jet production to be the scattering of two Reggeized gluons,
described by the effective Reggeon-Reggeon-gluon vertex, and to b-jet and
D-meson production --- the scattering of a Reggeized gluon and a Reggeized
quark to an ordinary quark, being expressed in terms of the
Reggeon-Reggeon-quark vertex. The main contribution to prompt photon production
arises from Reggeized quark-Reggeized antiquark annihilation, which is
described by the effective Reggeon-Reggeon-photon vertex. Our analysis is based
on the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription for unintegrated gluon and quark
distribution functions using as input the Martin-Roberts-Stirling-Thorne
collinear parton distribution functions of the proton.
