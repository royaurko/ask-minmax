It can be shown that any symmetric $(0,1)$-matrix $A$ with $\tr A = 0$ can be
interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a simple, finite graph. The square of an
adjacency matrix $A^2=(s_{ij})$ has the property that $s_{ij}$ represents the
number of walks of length two from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. With this
information, the motivating question behind this paper was to determine what
conditions on a matrix $S$ are needed to have $S=A(G)^2$ for some graph $G$.
Structural results imposed by the matrix $S$ include detecting bipartiteness or
connectedness and counting four cycles. Row and column sums are examined as
well as the problem of multiple nonisomorphic graphs with the same adjacency
matrix squared.
