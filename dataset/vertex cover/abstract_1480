We show that the vertex algebra W{1+ \infty} with central charge -1 is
isomorphic to a tensor product of the simple W_3 algebra with central charge -2
and a Heisenberg vertex algebra generated by a free bosonic field. We construct
a family of irreducible modules of the W_3 algebra with central charge -2 in
terms of free fields and calculate the full character formulas of these modules
with respect to the full Cartan subalgebra of the W_3 algebra.
