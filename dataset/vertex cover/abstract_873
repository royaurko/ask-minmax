A recent form of the Slavnov-Taylor identity for the ghost-gluon vertex of
QCD is compared with perturbative results. It is found that this identity,
derived assuming ghost-ghost scattering can be neglected, is not consistent
with perturbation theory. A new identity is derived at the one-loop
perturbative level.
