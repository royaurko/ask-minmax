The LCFIVertex software, developed by the Linear Collider Flavour
Identification (LCFI) collaboration and providing tools for vertexing, flavour
tagging and quark charge determination for low-mass vertex detectors of high
point resolution is presented. Particular emphasis is given to code extensions
since the first release in April 2007. A recently developed new vertex finder,
ZVMST, and its performance at sqrt(s) = 91.2 GeV are described in more detail.
