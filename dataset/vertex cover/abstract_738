This article is a continuation of math.QA/0603633 Given a strongly conformal
SUSY vertex algebra V and a supercurve X we construct a vector bundle V_X on X,
the fiber of which, is isomorphic to V. Moreover, the state-field
correspondence of V canonically gives rise to (local) sections of these vector
bundles. We also define chiral algebras on any supercurve X, and show that the
vector bundle V_X, corresponding to a SUSY vertex algebra, carries the
structure of a chiral algebra.
