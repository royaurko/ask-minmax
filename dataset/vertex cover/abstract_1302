We demonstrate the feasibility of computing alpha_s from the lattice
three-gluon vertex in the Landau gauge. Data from 16^4 and 24^4 quenched
lattices at beta=6.0 are presented. Our main result is that 2-loop asymptotic
scaling is observed for momenta in the range 1.8-2.3 Gev, where lattice
artifacts appear to be under control.
