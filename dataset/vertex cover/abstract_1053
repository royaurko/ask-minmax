The method of bosonization is extended to the case when a dissipationless
point-like defect is present in space-time. Introducing the chiral components
of a massless scalar field, interacting with the defect in two dimensions, we
construct the associated vertex operators. The main features of the
corresponding vertex algebra are established. As an application of this
framework we solve the massless Thirring model with defect. We also construct
the vertex representation of the sl(2) Kac-Moody algebra, describing the
complex interplay between the left and right sectors due to the interaction
with the defect. The Sugawara form of the energy-momentum tensor is also
explored.
