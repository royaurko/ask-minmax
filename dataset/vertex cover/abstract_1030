Dong, Munczek and Roberts have shown how the full 3-point vertex that appears
in the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion propagator can be expressed in
terms of a constrained function $W_1$ in massless quenched QED. However, this
analysis involved two key assumptions: that the fermion anomalous dimension
vanishes in the Landau gauge and that the transverse vertex has a simplified
dependence on momenta. Here we remove these assumptions and find the general
form for a new constrained function $U_1$ that ensures the multiplicative
renormalizability of the fermion propagator non-perturbatively. We then study
the restriction imposed on $U_1$ by recent perturbative calculations of the
vertex and compute its leading logarithmic expansion. Since $U_1$ should reduce
to this expansion in the weak coupling regime, this should serve as a guide to
its non-perturbative construction. We comment on the perturbative realization
of the constraints on $U_1$.
