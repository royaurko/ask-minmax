We study the cover time of a random graph chosen uniformly at random from the
set of graphs with vertex set $[n]$ and degree sequence
$\mathbf{d}=(d_i)_{i=1}^n$. In a previous work, the asymptotic cover time was
obtained under a number of assumptions on $\mathbf{d}$, the most significant
being that $d_i\geq 3$ for all $i$. Here we replace this assumption by $d_i\geq
2$. As a corollary, we establish the asymptotic cover time for the 2-core of
the emerging giant component of $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$.
