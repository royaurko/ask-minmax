This article is dedicated to an opportunity of concentrating elastic waves in
the iron and water cones on the square of the cone vertex of the order of one
square centimeter. The square of the base of the cone is equal to one square
meter, its height one meter. The calculations assume that the cone hexogen
network lying in the cone basis explodes during the time of one microsecond and
causes an explosive wave converging to the vertex of the cone. It is shown that
this explosive wave can accelerate the body having a mass of three grams to
speed five kilometers per second.
