We discuss restrictions on the existence of the diffusion pole in the
translationally invariant diagrammatic treatment of disordered electron
systems. We use the Bethe-Salpeter equations for the two-particle vertex in the
electron-hole and the electron-electron scattering channels and derive for
systems with time reversal symmetry a nonlinear integral equation the
two-particle irreducible vertices from both channels must obey. We use this
equation to test the existence of the diffusion pole in the two-particle
vertex. We find that a singularity of the diffusion pole can exist only if it
is integrable, that is only in the metallic phase in dimensions $d>2$.
