The equitable coloring problem, introduced by Meyer in 1973, has received
considerable attention and research. Recently, Wu, Zhang and Li introduced the
concept of equitable (t,k)-tree-coloring, which can be regarded as a
generalization of proper equitable t-coloring. The exact value of strong
equitable vertex k-arboricity of complete equipartition bipartite graph K_{n,n}
was studied by Wu, Zhang and Li. In this paper, we obtain an upper bound of
strong equitable vertex arboricity of complete bipartite graph K_{n,n+\ell} \
(1\leq \ell\leq n), that is, {va_2}^\equiv(K_{n,n+\ell})\leq
2\left\lfloor{\frac{n+\ell+1}{3}}\right\rfloor. Moreover, the bound is sharp.
Wu, Zhang and Li also obtained a sufficient and necessary condition on an
equitable (q, \infty)-tree coloring of a complete equipartition bipartite
graph. We obtain a sufficient and necessary condition on an equitable (q,
\infty)-tree coloring of a complete equipartition tripartite graph in this
paper. For connected graph G of order n, we show that 1\leq
{va_k}^\equiv(G)\leq \lceil n/2 \rceil. Furthermore, graphs with
{va_k}^\equiv(G)=1,\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil are characterized, respectively. We
also obtain the Nordhaus-Gaddum type results of strong equitable vertex
k-arboricity.
