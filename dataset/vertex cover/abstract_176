It is proved that for a vector space W, any set of parafermion-like vertex
operators on W in a certain canonical way generates a generalized vertex
algebra in the sense of [DL2] with W as a natural module. This result
generalizes a result of [Li2]. As an application, generalized vertex algebras
are constructed from Lepowsky-Wilson's Z-algebras of any nonzero level.
