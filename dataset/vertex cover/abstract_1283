At the free-fermion point, the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary
conditions (DWBC) can be related to the Aztec diamond, a domino tiling problem.
We study the mapping on the level of complete statistics for general domains
and boundary conditions. This is obtained by associating to both models a set
of non-intersecting lines in the Lindstroem-Gessel-Viennot (LGV) scheme. One of
the consequence for DWBC is that the boundaries of the ordered phases are
described by the Airy process in the thermodynamic limit.
