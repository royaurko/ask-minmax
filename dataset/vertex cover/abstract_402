This brief note is devoted to a study of genuine non-perturbative corrections
to the Landau gauge ghost-gluon vertex in terms of the non-vanishing
dimension-two gluon condensate. We pay special attention to the kinematical
limit which the bare vertex takes for its tree-level expression at any
perturbative order, according to the well-known Taylor theorem. Based on our
OPE analysis, we also present a simple model for the vertex, in acceptable
agreement with lattice data.
