In a paper published twelve years ago, the contributor gave a criterion to
determine whether there is a fiber preserving branched covering between two
given Seifert manifolds, which relies on the special case when the manifolds
considered are Seifert fibered solid tori. Here we give an explicit
construction of branched covering of a Seifert fibered solid torus by another
when their Seifert invariants satisfy certain relation.
