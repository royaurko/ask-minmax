In this paper, a random graph process {G(t)}_{t\geq 1}$ is studied and its
degree sequence is analyzed. Let {W_t}_{t\geq 1} be an i.i.d. sequence. The
graph process is defined so that, at each integer time t, a new vertex, with
W_t edges attached to it, is added to the graph. The new edges added at time t
are then preferentially connected to older vertices, i.e., conditionally on
G(t-1), the probability that a given edge is connected to vertex i is
proportional to d_i(t-1)+\delta, where d_i(t-1) is the degree of vertex i at
time t-1, independently of the other edges. The main result is that the
asymptotical degree sequence for this process is a power law with exponent
\tau=\min{\tau_{W}, \tau_{P}}, where \tau_{W} is the power-law exponent of the
initial degrees {W_t}_{t\geq 1} and $\tau_{P} the exponent predicted by pure
preferential attachment. This result extends previous work by Cooper and
Frieze, which is surveyed.
