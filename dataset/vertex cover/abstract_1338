We discuss the non-decoupling effects on the loop-induced $H^\pm W^\mp Z^0$
vertex in the general two Higgs-doublet model. The decay process $H^\pm \to
W^\pm Z^0$ is analyzed at one-loop level and possible enhancement of the decay
width is explored. We find that a novel enhancement can be realized by the
Higgs non-decoupling effects with large mass difference between charged and
CP-odd Higgs bosons. The branching ratio of the process can be a few % $\sim$
10%. Therefore the decay mode may be detectable at LHC or future $e^+e^-$
linear colliders (LC's).
