In 1982 Thomassen asked whether there exists an integer f(k,t) such that
every strongly f(k,t)-connected tournament T admits a partition of its vertex
set into t vertex classes V_1,...,V_t such that for all i the subtournament
T[V_i] induced on T by V_i is strongly k-connected. Our main result implies an
affirmative answer to this question. In particular we show that f(k,t) = O(k^7
t^4) suffices. As another application of our main result we give an affirmative
answer to a question of Song as to whether, for any integer t, there exists an
integer h(t) such that every strongly h(t)-connected tournament has a 1-factor
consisting of t vertex-disjoint cycles of prescribed lengths. We show that h(t)
= O(t^5) suffices.
