This paper describes D-brane probes of theories arising in abelian gauged
linear sigma models (GLSMs) describing branched double covers and
noncommutative resolutions thereof, via nonperturbative effects rather than as
the critical locus of a superpotential. As these theories can be described as
IR limits of Landau-Ginzburg models, technically this paper is an exercise in
utilizing (sheafy) matrix factorizations. For Landau-Ginzburg models which are
believed to flow in the IR to smooth branched double covers, our D-brane probes
recover the structure of the branched double cover (and flat nontrivial B
fields), verifying previous results. In addition to smooth branched double
covers, the same class of Landau-Ginzburg models is also believed to sometimes
flow to `noncommutative resolutions' of singular spaces. These noncommutative
resolutions are abstract conformal field theories without a global geometric
description, but D-brane probes perceive them as non-Kahler small resolutions
of a singular Calabi-Yau. We conjecture that such non-Kahler small resolutions
are typical in D-brane probes of such theories.
