A $(v,k,\lambda)$-covering is a pair $(V, \mathcal{B})$, where $V$ is a
$v$-set of points and $\mathcal{B}$ is a collection of $k$-subsets of $V$
(called blocks), such that every unordered pair of points in $V$ is contained
in at least $\lambda$ blocks in $\mathcal{B}$. The excess of such a covering is
the multigraph on vertex set $V$ in which the edge between vertices $x$ and $y$
has multiplicity $r_{xy}-\lambda$, where $r_{xy}$ is the number of blocks which
contain the pair $\{x,y\}$. A covering is symmetric if it has the same number
of blocks as points. Bryant et al.(2011) adapted the determinant related
arguments used in the proof of the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla theorem to establish the
nonexistence of certain symmetric coverings with $2$-regular excesses. Here, we
adapt the arguments related to rational congruence of matrices and show that
they imply the nonexistence of some cyclic symmetric coverings and of various
symmetric coverings with specified excesses.
