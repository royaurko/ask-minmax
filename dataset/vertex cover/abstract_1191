Viale introduced covering matrices in his proof that SCH follows from PFA. In
the course of the proof amd subsequent work with Sharon, he isolated two
reflection principles, CP and S, which, under certain circumstances, are
satisfied by all covering matrices of a certain shape. Using square sequences,
we construct covering matrices for which CP and S fail. This leads naturally to
an investigation of square principles intermediate between $\square_{\kappa}$
and $\square(\kappa^+)$ for a regular cardinal $\kappa$. We provide a detailed
picture of the implications between these square principles.
