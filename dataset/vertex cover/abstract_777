In this paper, we study the residue codes of extremal Type II Z_4-codes of
length 24 and their relations to the famous moonshine vertex operator algebra.
The main result is a complete classification of all residue codes of extremal
Type II Z_4-codes of length 24. Some corresponding results associated to the
moonshine vertex operator algebra are also discussed.
