We study a simple random walk on an n-dimensional hypercube. For any starting
position we find the probability of hitting vertex a before hitting vertex b,
whenever a and b share the same edge. This generalizes the model in Doyle, P.,
and Snell, J., "Random Walks and Electric Networks", Mathematical Association
of America, 1984 (see Exercise 1.3.7 there).
