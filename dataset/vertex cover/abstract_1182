We study the model theory of covers of groups definable in o-minimal
structures. This includes the case of covers of compact real Lie groups. In
particular we study categoricity questions, pointing out some notable
differences with the case of covers of complex algebraic groups studied by
Zilber and his students. We also discuss from a model-theoretic point of view
the following question, related to "Milnor's conjecture": is a finite central
extension (as an abstract group) of a compact Lie group also a topological
extension?
