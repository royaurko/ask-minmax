We quantize the $SU(n)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model in terms of left and right
chiral variables choosing an appropriate gauge and we compare our results with
the results that have been previously obtained in the algebraic treatment of
the problem. The algebra of the chiral vertex operators in the fundamental
representation is verified by solving appropriate Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equations.
