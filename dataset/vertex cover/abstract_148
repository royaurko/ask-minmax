The cross section of diffractive deep-inelastic scattering ep \rightarrow eXp
is measured, where the system X contains at least two jets and the leading
final state proton is detected in the H1 Forward Proton Spectrometer. The
measurement is performed for fractional proton longitudinal momentum loss xIP <
0.1 and covers the range 0.1 < |t| < 0.7 GeV2 in squared four-momentum transfer
at the proton vertex and 4 < Q2 < 110 GeV2 in photon virtuality. The
differential cross sections extrapolated to |t| < 1 GeV2 are in agreement with
next-toleading order QCD predictions based on diffractive parton distribution
functions extracted from measurements of inclusive and dijet cross sections in
diffractive deep-inelastic scattering. The data are also compared with leading
order Monte Carlo models.
