The so-called diluted-random-cluster model may be viewed as a random-cluster
representation of the Blume--Capel model. It has three parameters, a vertex
parameter $a$, an edge parameter $p$, and a cluster weighting factor $q$.
Stochastic comparisons of measures are developed for the `vertex marginal' when
$q\in[1,2]$, and the `edge marginal' when $q\in[1,\oo)$. Taken in conjunction
with arguments used earlier for the random-cluster model, these permit a
rigorous study of part of the phase diagram of the Blume--Capel model.
