We investigate the vertex operators of the supergravity multiplet in
IIB(IKKT) matrix model by calculating the disk amplitudes, exploiting the
technique of conformal field theory. The vertex operators of IIB matrix model
are given as the coupling of a closed string and open strings which are
introduced by the existence of D(-1)-branes. We consider the most generic
couplings which involve both the bosonic and fermionic open strings. Our
results are consistent with the previous results based on supersymmetry. We
thus confirm the structure of the IIB matrix model vertex operators from the
first principle.
