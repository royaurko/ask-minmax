We classify irreducible $\sigma$-twisted modules for the N=1 super triplet
vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{SW}(m)$ introduced recently [Adamovic
D., Milas A., Comm. Math. Phys., to appear, arXiv:0712.0379]. Irreducible
graded dimensions of $\sigma$-twisted modules are also determined. These
results, combined with our previous work in the untwisted case, show that the
$SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-closure of the space spanned by irreducible characters,
irreducible supercharacters and $\sigma$-twisted irreducible characters is
$(9m+3)$-dimensional. We present strong evidence that this is also the (full)
space of generalized characters for $\mathcal{SW}(m)$. We are also able to
relate irreducible $\mathcal{SW}(m)$ characters to characters for the triplet
vertex algebra $\mathcal{W}(2m+1)$, studied in [Adamovic D., Milas A., Adv.
Math. 217 (2008), 2664-2699, arXiv:0707.1857].
