A set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is a dominating set in $G$ if every
vertex outside of $S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex belonging to $S$. A
domination parameter of $G$ is related to those sets of vertices of a graph
satisfying some domination property together with other conditions on the
vertices of $G$. Here, we investigate several domination related parameters in
rooted product graphs.
