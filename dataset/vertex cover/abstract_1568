In this work we use the algebraic Bethe ansatz to derive the general scalar
product in the six-vertex model for generic Boltzmann weights. We performed
this calculation using only the unitarity property, the Yang-Baxter algebra and
the Yang-Baxter equation. We have derived a recurrence relation for the scalar
product. The solution of this relation was written in terms of the domain wall
partition functions. By its turn, these partition functions were also obtained
for generic Boltzmann weights, which provided us with an explicit expression
for the general scalar product.
