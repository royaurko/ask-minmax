A rainbow graph is a graph that admits a vertex-coloring such that every
color appears exactly once in the neighborhood of each vertex. We investigate
some properties of rainbow graphs. In particular, we show that there is a
bijection between the isomorphism classes of n-rainbow graphs on 2n vertices
and the switching classes of graphs on n vertices.
