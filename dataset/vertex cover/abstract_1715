We use a rigidity argument to prove the existence of two related degree
twenty-eight covers of the projective plane with Galois group SU3(3).2 = G2(2).
Constructing corresponding two-parameter polynomials directly from the defining
group-theoretic data seems beyond feasablity. Instead we provide two
independent constructions of these polynomials, one from 3-division points on
covers of the projective line studied by Deligne and Mostow, and one from
2-division points of genus three curves studied by Shioda. We explain how one
of the covers also arises as a 2-division polynomial for a family of G2 motives
in the classification of Dettweiler and Reiter. We conclude by specializing our
two covers to get interesting three-point covers and number fields which would
be hard to construct directly.
