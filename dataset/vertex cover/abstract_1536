We study the susceptibility, i.e., the mean cluster size, in random graphs
with given vertex degrees. We show, under weak assumptions, that the
susceptibility converges to the expected cluster size in the corresponding
branching process. In the supercritical case, a corresponding result holds for
the modified susceptibility ignoring the giant component and the expected size
of a finite cluster in the branching process; this is proved using a duality
theorem.
  The critical behaviour is studied. Examples are given where the critical
exponents differ on the subcritical and supercritical sides.
