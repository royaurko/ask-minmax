We calculate the corrections to the three-gluon decay widths $\Gamma_{3g}$ of
$c\bar c$ and $b \bar b$ quarkonia due to the finite extension of the $Q\bar
Q\to 3g$ vertex function. The widths computed with zero range vertex are
reduced by a factor $\gamma$ where $\gamma=0.31$ for the $J/\psi$ and
$\gamma=0.69$ for the $\Upsilon$. These large corrections necessitate a
redetermination of the values $\alpha_s(\mu)$ extracted from $\Gamma_{3g}$. We
find $\alpha_s(m_c)=0.28\pm.01$ and $\alpha_s(m_b)=0.20\pm.01$.
