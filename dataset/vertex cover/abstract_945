For certain vertex operator algebras (e.g., lattice type) and given finite
group of automorphisms, we prove existence of a positive definite integral form
invariant under the group. Applications include an integral form in the
Moonshine VOA which is invariant under the Monster, and examples in other
lattice type VOAs.
