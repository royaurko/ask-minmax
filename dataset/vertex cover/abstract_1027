We perform a study the quark-gluon vertex function with a quenched Wilson
gauge action and a variety of fermion actions. These include the domain wall
fermion action (with exponentially accurate chiral symmetry) and the Wilson
clover action both with the non-perturbatively improved clover coefficient as
well as with a number of different values for this coefficient. We find that
the domain wall vertex function behaves very well in the large momentum
transfer region. The off-shell vertex function for the on-shell improved clover
class of actions does not behave as well as the domain wall case and,
surprisingly, shows only a weak dependence on the clover coefficient $c_{SW}$
for all components of its Dirac decomposition and across all momenta. Including
off-shell improvement rotations for the clover fields can make this action
yield results consistent with those from the domain wall approach, as well as
helping to determine the off-shell improved coefficient $c_q^\prime$.
