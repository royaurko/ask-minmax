We investigate the noisy Burgers equation (Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation in
1+1 dimensions) using the dynamical renormalization group (to two--loop order)
and mode--coupling techniques. The roughness and dynamic exponent are fixed by
Galilean invariance and a fluctuation--dissipation theorem. The fact that there
are no singular two--loop contributions to the two--point vertex functions
supports the mode--coupling approach, which can be understood as a
self--consistent one--loop theory where vertex corrections are neglected.
Therefore, the numerical solution of the mode coupling equations yields very
accurate results for the scaling functions. In addition, finite--size effects
can be studied. Furthermore, the results from exact Ward identities, as well as
from second--order perturbation theory permit the quantitative evaluation of
the vertex corrections, and thus provide a quantitative test for the
mode--coupling approach. It is found that the vertex corrections themselves are
of the order one. Surprisingly, however, their effect on the correlation
function is substantially smaller.
