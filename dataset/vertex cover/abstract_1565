We compute the motivic Donaldson-Thomas theory of the resolved conifold, in
all chambers of the space of stability conditions of the corresponding quiver.
The answer is a product formula whose terms depend on the position of the
stability vector, generalizing known results for the corresponding numerical
invariants. Our formulae imply in particular a motivic form of the DT/PT
correspondence for the resolved conifold. The answer for the motivic PT series
is in full agreement with the prediction of the refined topological vertex
formalism.
