Generalizing some of our earlier work, we prove natural presentations of the
principal subspaces of the level one standard modules for the untwisted affine
Lie algebras of types A, D and E, and also of certain related spaces. As a
consequence, we obtain a canonical complete set of recursions (q-difference
equations) for the (multi-)graded dimensions of these spaces, and we derive
their graded dimensions. Our methods are based on intertwining operators in
vertex operator algebra theory.
