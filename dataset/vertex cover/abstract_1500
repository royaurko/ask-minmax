In this talk we report on recent calculation of high energy baryon scattering
amplitudes in QCD. Elastic baryon impact factors for two, three and four gluons
are presented and their energy evolution is described that incorporates
unitarity corrections. We find that the baryon couples directly to the BFKL
Pomeron, to the BKP odderon and to a new state, a three-gluon BKP Pomeron. The
new state may decay into four gluons with a new 3 -> 4 transition vertex. This
vertex defines the transition amplitude of the three-gluon BKP Pomeron state
into two BFKL Pomerons.
