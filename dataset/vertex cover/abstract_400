An unfolding of a polyhedron along its edges is called a vertex unfolding if
adjacent faces are allowed to be connected at not only an edge but also a
vertex. Demaine et al showed that every triangulated polyhedron has a vertex
unfolding. We extend this result to a tight polyhedron, where a polyhedron is
tight if all non-triangular faces are mutually non-adjacent parallelograms.
