We calculated the strong form factor and coupling constant for the $J/\psi
D^* D^*$ vertex in a QCD sum rule calculation. We performed a double Borel sum
rule for the three point correlation function of vertex considering both
$J/\psi$ and $D^*$ mesons off--shell. The form factors obtained are very
different, but they give the same coupling constant.
