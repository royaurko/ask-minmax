We give an iterative method to realize general Jack functions from Jack
functions of rectangular shapes. We first show some cases of Stanley's
conjecture on positivity of the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, and then
use this method to give a new realization of Jack functions. We also show in
general that vectors of products of Jack vertex operators form a basis of
symmetric functions. In particular this gives a new proof of linear
independence for the rectangular and marked rectangular Jack vertex operators.
Thirdly a generalized Frobenius formula for Jack functions was given and was
used to give new evaluation of Dyson integrals and even powers of Vandermonde
determinant.
