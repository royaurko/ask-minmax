We consider holographic three-point functions for operators dual to short
string states at strong coupling in N=4 super Yang-Mills. We treat the states
as point-like as they come in from the boundary but as strings in the
interaction region in the bulk. The interaction position is determined by
saddle point, which is equivalent to conservation of the canonical momentum for
the interacting particles, and leads to conservation of their conformal
charges. We further show that for large dimensions the rms size of the
interaction region is small compared to the radius of curvature of the AdS
space, but still large compared to the string Compton wave-length. Hence, one
can approximate the string vertex operators as flat-space vertex operators with
a definite momentum, which depends on the conformal and R-charges of the
operator. We then argue that the string vertex operator dual to a primary
operator is chosen by satisfying a twisted version of Q^L=Q^R, up to spurious
terms. This leads to a unique choice for a scalar vertex operator with the
appropriate charges at the first massive level. We then comment on some
features of the corresponding three-point functions, including the application
of these results to Konishi operators.
