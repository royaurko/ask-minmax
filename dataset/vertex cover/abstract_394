The Four-Vertex Theorem has been of interest ever since a discrete version
appeared in 1813 due to Cauchy. Up until now, there have been many different
versions of this theorem, both for discrete cases and smooth cases. In 2004, an
approach relating the discrete Four-Vertex Theorem to the evolute was
published, and here we will give an overview of this paper. We then will define
the notion of the decomposition of polygons, and derive some new results about
how this notion affects various types of extremality. We will see that from our
fresh results we can easily derive discrete Four-Vertex Theorems.
