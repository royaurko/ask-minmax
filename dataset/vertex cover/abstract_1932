We consider the vertex function of two vector and one axial-vector currents
using the soft-wall holographic model of QCD with the Chern-Simons term. Two
structure functions $w_L$ and $w_T$ describe such a vertex in the special case
in which one of the two vector currents corresponds to an on-shell soft photon.
We briefly review the QCD results for these functions, obtained from triangular
loop diagrams with quarks having mass $m_q=0$ or $m_q \neq 0$, we compute $w_L$
and $w_T$ in the soft-wall model and compare the outcome to the QCD findings.
We also calculate and discuss the two-point $\Pi_{VV}-\Pi_{AA}$ correlation
function, together with a few low-energy constants, which turn out to be close
to the QCD results.
