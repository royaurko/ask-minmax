We develop the real vertex formalism for the computation of the topological
string partition function with D-branes and O-planes at the fixed point locus
of an anti-holomorphic involution acting non-trivially on the toric diagram of
any local toric Calabi-Yau manifold. Our results cover in particular the real
vertex with non-trivial fixed leg. We give a careful derivation of the relevant
ingredients using duality with Chern-Simons theory on orbifolds. We show that
the real vertex can also be interpreted in terms of a statistical model of
symmetric crystal melting. Using this latter connection, we also assess the
constant map contribution in Calabi-Yau orientifold models. We find that there
are no perturbative contributions beyond one-loop, but a non-trivial sum over
non-perturbative sectors, which we compare with the non-perturbative
contribution to the closed string expansion.
