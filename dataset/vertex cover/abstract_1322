We show that the flavor-diagonal gauge boson of the extended technicolor
theory contributes with opposite sign to the standard model correction for the
$Zbb$ vertex. This mechanism can naturally explain the deviation of the LEP
result from the standard model prediction for the partial width $\Gamma(Z
\rightarrow b{\bar b})$. A smaller value of the QCD coupling, $\alpha_s(m_Z)
\simeq 0.115$, is then preferred by the $\Gamma(Z \rightarrow \mbox{hadron})$
data, which is consistent with both the recent Lattice-QCD estimate and the
Particle Data Group average.
