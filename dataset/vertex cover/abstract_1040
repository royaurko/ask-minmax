Vertex operator algebras are mathematically rigorous objects corresponding to
chiral algebras in conformal field theory. Operads are mathematical devices to
describe operations, that is, $n$-ary operations for all $n$ greater than or
equal to $0$, not just binary products. In this paper, a reformulation of the
notion of vertex operator algebra in terms of operads is presented. This
reformulation shows that the rich geometric structure revealed in the study of
conformal field theory and the rich algebraic structure of the theory of vertex
operator algebras share a precise common foundation in basic operations
associated with a certain kind of (two-dimensional) ``complex'' geometric
object, in the sense in which classical algebraic structures (groups, algebras,
Lie algebras and the like) are always implicitly based on (one-dimensional)
``real'' geometric objects. In effect, the standard analogy between
point-particle theory and string theory is being shown to manifest itself at a
more fundamental mathematical level.
