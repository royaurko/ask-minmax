We give a new construction of functors from the category of modules for the
associative algebras $A_n(V)$ and $A_g(V)$ associated with a vertex operator
algebra $V$, defined by Dong, Li and Mason, to the category of admissible
$V$-modules and admissible twisted $V$-modules, respectively, using the method
developed in the joint work \cite{HY1} with Y.-Z. Huang. The functors were
first constructed by Dong, Li and Mason, but the importance of the new method,
as in \cite{HY1}, is that we can apply the method to study objects without the
commutator formula in the representation theory of vertex operator algebras.
