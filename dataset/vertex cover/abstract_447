Let M be a Riemannian manifold. For p in M, the tensor algebra of the
negative part of the (complex) affinization of the tangent space of M at p has
a natural structure of a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra. These
meromorphic open-string vertex algebras form a vector bundle over M with a
connection. We construct a sheaf \mathcal{V} of meromorphic open-string vertex
algebras on the sheaf of parallel sections of this vector bundle. Using
covariant derivatives, we construct representations on the spaces of complex
smooth functions of the algebras of parallel tensor fields. These
representations are used to construct a sheaf \mathcal{W} of left
\mathcal{V}-modules generated by the sheaf of smooth functions. In particular,
we obtain a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra V_{M} of the global sections
on M of the sheaf \mathcal{V} and a left V_{M}-module W_{M} of the global
sections on M of the sheaf \mathcal{W}. By the definitions of meromorphic
open-string vertex algebra and left module, we obtain, among many other
properties, operator product expansion for vertex operators. We also show that
the Laplacian on M is in fact a component of a vertex operator for the left
V_{M}-module W_{M} restricted to the space of smooth functions.
