In 1914 Lebesgue defined a "universal covering" to be a convex subset of the
plane that contains an isometric copy of any subset of diameter 1. His
challenge of finding a universal covering with the least possible area has been
addressed by various mathematicians: Pal, Sprague and Hansen have each created
a smaller universal covering by removing regions from those known before.
However, Hansen's last reduction was microsopic: he claimed to remove an area
of $6 \cdot 10^{-18}$, but we show that he actually removed an area of just $8
\cdot 10^{-21}$. In the following, with the help of Greg Egan, we find a new,
smaller universal covering with area less than $0.8441153$. This reduces the
area of the previous best universal covering by a whopping $2.2 \cdot 10^{-5}$.
