For every odd p \geq 3, we investigate representation theory of the vertex
algebra WW_{2,p} associated to (2,p) minimal models for the Virasoro algebras.
We demonstrate that vertex algebras WW_{2,p} are C_2--cofinite and irrational.
Complete classification of irreducible representations for WW_{2,3} is
obtained, while the classification for p \geq 5 is subject to certain constant
term identities. These identities can be viewed as "logarithmic deformations"
of Dyson and Selberg constant term identities, and are of independent interest.
