We consider the problem of finding quasiperiodicities in a Fibonacci string.
A factor u of a string y is a cover of y if every letter of y falls within some
occurrence of u in y. A string v is a seed of y, if it is a cover of a
superstring of y. A left seed of a string y is a prefix of y that it is a cover
of a superstring of y. Similarly a right seed of a string y is a suffix of y
that it is a cover of a superstring of y. In this paper, we present some
interesting results regarding quasiperiodicities in Fibonacci strings, we
identify all covers, left/right seeds and seeds of a Fibonacci string and all
covers of a circular Fibonacci string.
