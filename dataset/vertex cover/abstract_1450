The main motivation here is a question: whether any polyhedron which can be
subdivided into convex pieces without adding a vertex, and which has the same
vertices as a convex polyhedron, is infinitesimally rigid. We prove that it is
indeed the case for two classes of polyhedra: those obtained from a convex
polyhedron by ``denting'' at most two edges at a common vertex, and suspensions
with a natural subdivision.
