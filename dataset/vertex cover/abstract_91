We classify all unmixed monomial ideals I of codimension 2 which are
generically a complete intersection and which have the property that the
symbolic power algebra A(I) is standard graded. We give a lower bound for the
highest degree of a generator of A(I) in the case that I is a modi?cation of
the vertex cover ideal of a bipartite graph, and show that this highest degree
can be any given number. We furthermore give an upper bound for the highest
degree of a generator of the integral closure of A(I) in the case that I is a
monomial ideal which is generically a complete intersection.
