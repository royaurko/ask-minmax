We give a group-theoretic description of the parity of a pull-back of a theta
characteristic under a branched covering. It involves lifting monodromy of the
covering to the semidirect product of the symmetric and Clifford groups, known
as the Sergeev group. As an application, we enumerate torus coverings with
respect to their ramification and parity and, in particular, show that the
corresponding all-degree generating functions are quasimodular forms.
