We examine some recent work of Phillip Griffith on \'etale covers and fibered
products from the point of view of tight closure theory. While it is known that
cyclic covers of Gorenstein rings with rational singularities are
Cohen-Macaulay, we show this is not true in general in the absence of the
Gorenstein hypothesis. Specifically, we show that the canonical cover of a
$\mathbb Q$-Gorenstein ring with rational singularities need not be
Cohen-Macaulay.
