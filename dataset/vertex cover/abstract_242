After giving some definitions for vertex operator SUPERalgebras and their
modules, we construct an associative algebra corresponding to any vertex
operator superalgebra, such that the representations of the vertex operator
algebra are in one-to-one correspondence with those of the corresponding
associative algebra. A way is presented to decribe the fusion rules for the
vertex operator superalgebras via modules of the associative algebra. The above
are generalizations of Zhu's constructions for vertex operator algebras. Then
we deal in detail with vertex operator superalgebras corresponding to
Neveu-Schwarz algebras, super affine Kac-Moody algebras, and free fermions. We
use the machinery established above to find the rationality conditions,
classify the representations and compute the fusion rules. In the appendix, we
present explicit formulas for singular vectors and defining relations for the
integrable representations of super affine algebras. These formulas are not
only crucial for the theory of the corresponding vertex operator superalgebras
and their representations, but also of independent interest.
