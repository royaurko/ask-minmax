Eigenvalues of the commuting family of transfer matrices are expected to obey
the $T$-system, a set of functional relation, proposed recently. Here we obtain
the solution to the $T$-system for $C^{(1)}_2$ vertex models. They are
compatible with the analytic Bethe ansatz and Yang-Baxterize the classical
characters.
