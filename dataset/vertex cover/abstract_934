In this paper we extend the method of loop vertex expansion to interactions
with degree higher than 4. As an example we provide through this expansion an
explicit proof that the free energy of Phi^2k scalar theory in zero dimension
is Borel-Le Roy summable of order k-1. We detail the computations in the case
of a Phi^6 interaction.
