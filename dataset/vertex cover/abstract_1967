We show that the expected time for a smart "cop" to catch a drunk "robber" on
an $n$-vertex graph is at most $n + {\rm o}(n)$. More precisely, let $G$ be a
simple, connected, undirected graph with distinguished points $u$ and $v$ among
its $n$ vertices. A cop begins at $u$ and a robber at $v$; they move
alternately from vertex to adjacent vertex. The robber moves randomly,
according to a simple random walk on $G$; the cop sees all and moves as she
wishes, with the object of "capturing" the robber---that is, occupying the same
vertex---in least expected time. We show that the cop succeeds in expected time
no more than $n + {\rm o}(n)$. Since there are graphs in which capture time is
at least $n - o(n)$, this is roughly best possible. We note also that no
function of the diameter can be a bound on capture time.
