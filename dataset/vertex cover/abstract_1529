We investigate, within N=4 SYM, the high energy behavior in the triple Regge
limit of a six point correlator of R-currents. Using the leading logarithmic
approximation, we sum all diagrams whose color lines fit onto the surface of a
sphere. We find three distinct classes of graphs, and one of them contains the
triple Pomeron vertex known from QCD. We present results which, within the
AdS/CFT correspondence, can be compared with scattering amplitudes in the dual
string theory.
