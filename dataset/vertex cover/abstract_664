ALEPH and DELPHI were the first experiments operating a silicon vertex
detector at LEP. During the past 10 years of data taking the DELPHI Silicon
Tracker was upgraded three times to follow the different tracking requirements
for LEP 1 and LEP 2 as well as to improve the tracking performance. Several
steps in the development of the pattern recognition software were done in order
to understand and fully exploit the silicon tracker information. This article
gives an overview of the final algorithms and concepts of the track
reconstruction using the Silicon Tracker in DELPHI.
