We define complexes of vector bundles on products of moduli spaces of framed
rank r torsion-free sheaves on the complex projective plane. The top
non-vanishing Chern classes of the cohomology of these complexes yield actions
of the r-colored Heisenberg and Clifford algebras on the equivariant cohomology
of the moduli spaces. In this way we obtain a geometric realization of the
boson-fermion correspondence and related vertex operators.
