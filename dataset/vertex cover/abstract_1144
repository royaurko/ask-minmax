The precision measurements envisaged at the International Linear Collider
(ILC) depend on excellent instrumentation and reconstruction software. The
correct identification of heavy flavour jets, placing unprecedented
requirements on the quality of the vertex detector, will be central for the ILC
programme. This paper describes the LCFIVertex software, which provides tools
for vertex finding and for identification of the flavour and charge of the
leading hadron in heavy flavour jets. These tools are essential for the ongoing
optimisation of the vertex detector design for linear colliders such as the
ILC. The paper describes the algorithms implemented in the LCFIVertex package,
as well as the scope of the code and its performance for a typical vertex
detector design.
