We consider the extension of the Heisenberg vertex operator algebra by all
its irreducible modules. We give an elementary construction for the
intertwining vertex operators and show that they satisfy a complex parametrized
generalized vertex operator algebra. We illustrate some of our results with the
example of integral lattice vertex operator superalgebras.
