We study the superconducting instabilities of singlet and triplet pairing in
a two-dimensional Hubbard model on the basis of the third-order perturbation
theory (TOPT). We investigate the effect of the vertex correction that is given
by TOPT, comparing with the study with only the second-order effective
interaction. In our results, a stable p-wave pairing state spreads from low to
intermediate electron density. A dx2-y2-wave pairing is dominant for the high
density near a half-filling. It is shown that the vertex correction plays an
essential role in making the p-wave pairing state dominant.
