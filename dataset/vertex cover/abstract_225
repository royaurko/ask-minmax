We study a variant of the standard random intersection graph model
($G(n,m,F,H)$) in which random weights are assigned to both vertex types in the
bipartite structure. Under certain assumptions on the distributions of these
weights, the degree of a vertex is shown to depend on the weight of that
particular vertex and on the distribution of the weights of the other vertex
type.
