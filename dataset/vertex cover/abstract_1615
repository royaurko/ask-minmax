We use the sixteen vertex model to describe bi-dimensional artificial spin
ice (ASI). We find excellent agreement between vertex densities in fifteen
differently grown samples and the predictions of the model. Our results
demonstrate that the samples are in usual thermal equilibrium away from a
critical point separating a disordered and an anti-ferromagnetic phase in the
model. The second-order phase transition that we predict suggests that the
spatial arrangement of vertices in near-critical ASI should be studied in more
detail in order to verify whether they show the expected space and time
long-range correlations.
