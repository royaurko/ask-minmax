In [Linear rank-width of distance-hereditary graphs. WG'14], we presented a
characterization of the linear rank-width of distance-hereditary graphs, from
which we derived an algorithm to compute it in polynomial time. In this paper,
we investigate structural properties of distance-hereditary graphs based on
this characterization.
  First, we prove that for a fixed tree $T$, every distance-hereditary graph of
large linear rank-width contains a vertex-minor isomorphic to $T$. We prove
this in a more general setting, that it is also true for graphs whose prime
induced subgraphs have bounded linear rank-width, where prime graphs are graphs
with no vertex partition $(A, B)$ with $|A|, |B|\ge 2$ such that the set of
edges joining $A$ and $B$ induces a complete bipartite graph.
  For a class $\Phi$ of graphs closed under taking vertex-minors, a graph $G$
is called a vertex-minor obstruction for $\Phi$ if $G\notin \Phi$ but all of
its proper vertex-minors are contained in $\Phi$. We provide, for each $k\ge
2$, a set of distance-hereditary graphs that contains all distance-hereditary
vertex-minor obstructions for graphs of linear rank-width at most $k$. Also, we
give a simpler way to obtain the known vertex-minor obstructions for graphs of
linear rank-width at most $1$.
