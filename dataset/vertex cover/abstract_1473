The software of track reconstruction of the vertex chamber of BESII-VCJULI
was studied when it was transplanted from the HP-Unix platform to PC-Linux. The
problems of distinct dictionary storage and precision treatment in these two
different platforms were found and settled in the modified software. Then the
obvious differences of the candidate track number in an event and some track
parameters caused by them were reduced from 74% to 0.02% and from 5% to 0.5%,
respectively. As a result, the quality of the track finding was greatly
improved and the CPU time saved.
