We compute the last missing piece of the two-loop ${\cal O}(\alpha \alpha_s)$
corrections to $\gamma t \bar{t}$ vertex at the $t \bar{t}$ threshold due to
the exchange of a $W$ boson and a gluon. This contribution constitutes a
building block of the top quark threshold production cross section at electron
positron colliders.
