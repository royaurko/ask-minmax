This is the first part of the revised versions of the notes of three
consecutive expository lectures given by Chongying Dong, Haisheng Li and Yi-Zhi
Huang in the conference on Monster and vertex operator algebras at the Research
Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Kyoto, September 4-9, 1994. In this part we
review the definitions of vertex operator algebras and twisted modules, and
discuss examples.
