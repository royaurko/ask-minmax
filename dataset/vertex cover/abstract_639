We introduce the concept of a covering of a graded pointed Hopf algebra. The
theory developed shows that coverings of a bosonized Nichols algebra can be
concretely expressed by biproducts using a quotient of the universal coalgebra
covering group of the Nichols algebra. If there are enough quadratic relations,
the universal coalgebra covering is given by the bosonization by the enveloping
group of the underlying rack.
