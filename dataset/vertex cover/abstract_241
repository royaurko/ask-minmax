In this paper we consider completed coverings that are branched coverings in
the sense of Fox. For completed coverings between PL manifolds we give a
characterization of the existence of a monodromy representation and the
existence of a locally compact monodromy representation. These results stem
from a characterization for the discreteness of a completed normal covering. We
also show that completed coverings admitting a monodromy representations are
discrete and that the image of the branch set is closed.
