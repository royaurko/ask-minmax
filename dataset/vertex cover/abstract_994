It is well known that in an exact covering system in $\mathbb{Z}$, the
biggest modulus must be repeated. Very recently, Kim gave an analogous result
for certain quadratic fields, and Kim also conjectured that it must hold in any
algebraic number field. In this paper, we prove Kim's conjecture. In other
words, we prove that exact covering systems in any algebraic number field must
have repeated moduli.
