We discuss the axioms for vertex algebras and their modules, using formal
calculus. Following certain standard treatments, we take the Jacobi identity as
our main axiom and we recall weak commutativity and weak associativity. We
derive a third, companion property that we call "weak skew-associativity." This
third property in some sense completes an $\mathcal{S}_{3}$-symmetry of the
axioms, which is related to the known $\mathcal{S}_{3}$-symmetry of the Jacobi
identity. We do not initially require a vacuum vector, which is analogous to
not requiring an identity element in ring theory. In this more general setting,
one still has a property, occasionally used in standard treatments, which is
closely related to skew-symmetry, which we call "vacuum-free skew-symmetry." We
show how certain combinations of these properties are equivalent to the Jacobi
identity for both vacuum-free vertex algebras and their modules. We then
specialize to the case with a vacuum vector and obtain further replacement
axioms. In particular, in the final section we derive our main result, which
says that, in the presence of certain minor axioms, the Jacobi identity for a
module is equivalent to either weak associativity or weak skew-associativity.
The first part of this result has previously appeared and been used to show the
(nontrivial) equivalence of representations of and modules for a vertex
algebra. Many but not all of our results appear in standard treatments; some of
our arguments are different from the usual ones.
