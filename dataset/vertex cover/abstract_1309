The recent CLEO results on on radiative $b$-quark decays are used to derive
constraints on anomalous $WW\gamma$ couplings. These constraints are compared
with expectations from $p\bar p\rightarrow e^\pm p\llap/_T\gamma+X$ at the
Tevatron. The usefulness of exclusive radiative $B$ meson decay channels in
probing the $WW\gamma$ vertex is largely limited by present theoretical
uncertainties in the calculation of hadronic matrix elements.
