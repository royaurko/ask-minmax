The vertex PI index is a distance--based molecular structure descriptor, that
recently found numerous chemical applications. In order to increase diversity
of this topological index for bipartite graphs, we introduce weighted version
defined as $PI_w (G) = \sum_{e = uv \in E} (deg (u) + deg (v)) (n_u (e) + n_v
(e))$, where $deg (u)$ denotes the vertex degree of $u$ and $n_u (e)$ denotes
the number of vertices of $G$ whose distance to the vertex $u$ is smaller than
the distance to the vertex $v$. We establish basic properties of $PI_w (G)$,
and prove various lower and upper bounds. In particular, the path $P_n$ has
minimal, while the complete tripartite graph $K_{n/3, n/3, n/3}$ has maximal
weighed vertex $PI$ index among graphs with $n$ vertices. We also compute exact
expressions for the weighted vertex PI index of the Cartesian product of
graphs. Finally we present modifications of two inequalities and open new
perspectives for the future research.
