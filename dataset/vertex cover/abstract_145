The cross section for the diffractive deep-inelastic scattering process ep ->
e X p is measured, with the leading final state proton detected in the H1
Forward Proton Spectrometer. The data sample covers the range x_pom<0.1 in
fractional proton longitudinal momentum loss, 0.1 < |t| < 0.7 GeV^2 in squared
four-momentum transfer at the proton vertex and 4 < Q^2 < 700 GeV^2 in photon
virtuality. The cross section is measured four-fold differentially in t, x_pom,
Q^2 and beta=x/x_pom, where x is the Bjorken scaling variable. The t and x_pom
dependences are interpreted in terms of an effective pomeron trajectory and a
sub-leading exchange. The data are compared to perturbative QCD predictions at
next-to-leading order based on diffractive parton distribution functions
previously extracted from complementary measurements of inclusive diffractive
deep-inelastic scattering. The ratio of the diffractive to the inclusive ep
cross section is studied as a function of Q^2, beta and x_pom.
