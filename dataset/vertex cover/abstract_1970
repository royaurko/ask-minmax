We apply a recently introduced hybridization-flow functional renormalization
group scheme for Anderson-like impurity models as an impurity solver in a
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach to lattice Hubbard models. We
present how this scheme is capable of reproducing metallic and insulating
solutions of the lattice model. Our setup also offers a numerically rather
inexpensive method to calculate two-particle correlation functions. For the
paramagnetic Hubbard-model on the Bethe lattice in infinite dimensions we
calculate the local two-particle-vertex for the metallic and the insulating
phase. Then we go to a two-site cluster-DMFT-scheme for the two-dimensional
Hubbard-model that includes short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations and
obtain the local and non-local two-particle-vertex-functions. We discuss the
rich frequency structures of these vertices and compare with the vertex in the
single-site solution.
