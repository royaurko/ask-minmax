In this work we obtain hierarchies of partial differential equations
describing on-shell scalar products for two types of six-vertex models. More
precisely, six-vertex models with two different boundary conditions are
considered: the case with boundary twists and the case with open boundary
conditions. Solutions and properties of our partial differential equations are
also discussed.
