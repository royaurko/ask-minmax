Stan Wagon asked the following in 2000. Is every zonohedron face 3-colorable
when viewed as a planar map? An equivalent question, under a different guise,
is the following: is the arrangement graph of great circles on the sphere
always vertex 3-colorable? (The arrangement graph has a vertex for each
intersection point, and an edge for each arc directly connecting two
intersection points.) Assume that no three circles meet at a point, so that
this arrangement graph is 4-regular. In this note we have shown that all
arrangement graphs defined as above are 3-colorable.
