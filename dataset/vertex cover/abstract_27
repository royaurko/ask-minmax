This survey is devoted to problems and results concerning covering the
vertices of edge colored graphs or hypergraphs with monochromatic paths, cycles
and other objects. It is an expanded version of the talk with the same title at
the Seventh Cracow Conference on Graph Theory, held in Rytro in September
14-19, 2014.
