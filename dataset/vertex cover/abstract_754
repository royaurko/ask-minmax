Let $L(-{1/2}(l+1),0)$ be the simple vertex operator algebra associated to an
affine Lie algebra of type $A_{l}^{(1)}$ with the lowest admissible
half-integer level $-{1/2}(l+1)$, for even l. We study the category of weak
modules for that vertex operator algebra which are in category $\cal{O}$ as
modules for the associated affine Lie algebra. We classify irreducible objects
in that category and prove semisimplicity of that category.
