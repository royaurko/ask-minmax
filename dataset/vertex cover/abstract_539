In the perturbative QCD approach single and double inclusive cross-sections
for gluon production off the nucleus are studied from the relevant reggeized
gluon diagrams. Various terms corresponding to emission of gluons from the
triple Pomeron vertex are found. Among them the term derived by Kovchegov and
Tuchin emerges as a result of transition from the diffractive to effective
high-energy vertex. However it does not exhaust all the vertex contributions to
the inclusive cross-section. In the double inclusive cross-section a
contribution violating naive AGK rules is found, in which one gluon is emitted
from the vertex and the other from one of the Pomerons below the vertex. But
then this contribution is subdominant at high energies and taking it into
account seems to be questionable.
