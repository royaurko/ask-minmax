The impact of the incoherent electron-positron pairs from beamstrahlung on
the occupancy of the vertex detector (VXD) for the International Large Detector
concept (ILD) has been studied, based on the standard ILD simulation tools. The
occupancy was evaluated for two substantially different sensor technology in
order to estimate the importance of the latter. The influence of an anti-DID
field removing backscattered electrons has also been studied.
