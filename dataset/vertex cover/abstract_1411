We show that Calabi-Yau crystals generate certain Chern-Simons knot
invariants, with Lagrangian brane insertions generating the unknot and Hopf
link invariants. Further, we make the connection of the crystal brane
amplitudes to the topological vertex formulation explicit and show that the
crystal naturally resums the corresponding topological vertex amplitudes. We
also discuss the conifold and double wall crystal model in this context. The
results suggest that the free energy associated to the crystal brane amplitudes
can be simply expressed as a target space Gopakumar-Vafa expansion.
