As a first step towards the computation of the NLO corrections to the photon
impact factor in the $\gamma^*\gamma^* \to \gamma^* \gamma^*$ scattering
process, we calculate the one loop corrections to the coupling of the reggeized
gluon to the $\gamma^*\to q\bar{q}$ vertex. We list the results for the Feynman
diagrams which contribute: all loop integrations are carried out, and the
results are presented in the helicity basis of photon, quark, and antiquark.
