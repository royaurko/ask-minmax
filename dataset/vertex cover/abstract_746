We present a consistent calculation of half-off-shell form factors in the
pion-nucleon vertex and the nucleon self-energy. Numerical results are
presented. Near the on-shell point the pion-nucleon vertex is dominated by the
pseudovector coupling, while at large nucleon invariant masses we find a
sizable pseudoscalar admixture.
