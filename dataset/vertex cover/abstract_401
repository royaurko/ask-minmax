Over the past few years we have developed, in collaboration with the SARNOFF
Corporation, a design of a Monolithic CMOS Pixel Detector for ILC Vertex
Detectors. The unique feature of this design is that each hit is accompanied by
a time tag with sufficient precision to assign each hit to a particular bunch
crossing of the ILC (thus the name Chronopixel). This reduces the occupancy
even in the innermost Vertex Detector layer to negligible levels, allowing a
robust Vertex Detector even in the case that the backgrounds in the ILC are
higher than presently estimated.
