In this paper, we initiate the study of the interplay between $k$-graphs and
the Yang-Baxter equation. For this, we provide two very different perspectives.
One one hand, we show that the set of all set-theoretic solutions of the
Yang-Baxter equation is a special class of single-vertex $k$-graphs. As a
consequence, we construct an infinite family of large solutions of the
Yang-Baxter equation from an arbitrarily given one. On the other hand, we prove
that all single-vertex $k$-graphs are YB-semigroups of square-free, involutive
solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Other various connections are also
investigated.
