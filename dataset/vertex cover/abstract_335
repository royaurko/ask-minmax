It is proved that a vertex operator algebra is isomorphic to the moonshine
VOA of Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman if it satisfies certain conditions. Our two
main theorems establish a weak version of the FLM uniqueness conjecture for the
moonshine vertex operator algebra. We believe that these are the first such
results.
