The exact bosonic Neumann matrices of the cubic vertex in plane-wave
light-cone string field theory are derived using the contour integration
techniques developed in our earlier paper. This simplifies the original
derivation of the vertex. In particular, the Neumann matrices are written in
terms of \mu-deformed Gamma-functions, thus casting them into a form that
elegantly generalizes the well-known flat-space solution. The asymptotics of
the \mu-deformed Gamma-functions allow one to determine the large-\mu behaviour
of the Neumann matrices including exponential corrections. We provide an
explicit expression for the first exponential correction and make a conjecture
for the subsequent exponential correction terms.
