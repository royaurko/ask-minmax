By a covering of a group G we mean an epimorphism from a group F to G.
Introducing the notion of strong covering as a covering pi:F-->G such that
every automorphism of G is a projection via pi of an automorphism of F, the
main aim of this paper is to characterise double coverings which are strong.
This is done in details for metacyclic groups, rotary platonic groups and some
finite simple groups.
