It is shown that nonzero orbital momentum in the vertex of secondary
interaction in the triangle graph leads to a more clear picture corresponding
to the moving complex singularity compared with the case of constant vertex.
The peak in the distribution of the final particles invariant mass becomes
narrower and its shift with momentum transfer more distinct. It opens the
possibility to observe this picture experimentally.
