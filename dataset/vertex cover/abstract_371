The tensionless string theory with perimeter action has pure massless
spectrum of higher-spin gauge fields. The multiplicity of these massless states
grows linearly. It is therefore much less compared with the standard string
theory and is larger compared with the field theory models of the Yang-Mills
type. It is important to define nontrivial interaction between infinite amount
of massless particles of the perimeter string theory. The appropriate vertex
operators were defined recently and I study the lowest order vertex operators
and the corresponding scattering amplitudes in tree approximation. I emphasize
the special importance of the vertex operator for fixed helicity states.
