We study the family of vertex algebras associated with vertex algebroids,
constructed by Gorbounov, Malikov, and Schechtman. As the main result, we
classify all the (graded) simple modules for such vertex algebras and we show
that the equivalence classes of graded simple modules one-to-one correspond to
the equivalence classes of simple modules for the Lie algebroids associated
with the vertex algebroids. To achieve our goal, we construct and exploit a Lie
algebra from a given vertex algebroid.
