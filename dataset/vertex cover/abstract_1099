We study the solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated to nineteen
vertex models invariant by the parity-time symmetry from the perspective of
algebraic geometry. We determine the form of the algebraic curves constraining
the respective Boltzmann weights and found that they possess a universal
structure. This allows us to classify the integrable manifolds in four
different families reproducing three known models besides uncovering a novel
nineteen vertex model in a unified way. The introduction of the spectral
parameter on the weights is made via the parameterization of the fundamental
algebraic curve which is a conic. The diagonalization of the transfer matrix of
the new vertex model and its thermodynamic limit properties are discussed. We
point out a connection between the form of the main curve and the nature of the
excitations of the corresponding spin-1 chains.
