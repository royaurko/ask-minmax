This paper has been withdrawn by the contributor, due to the fact that the main
result in it has already been obtained in [1] for any c < e, see also [2] and
[3].
 Moreover the formula which gives the minimal vertex-cover in a tree
 (see the abstract) has already been derived in [4]. I thank M. Bauer, O.
Golinelli, F. Ricci-Tersenghi, G. Semerjian and M. Weigt for having brought to
my attention [1] and M.B. and O.G. for [4].
