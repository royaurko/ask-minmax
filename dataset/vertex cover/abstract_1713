This paper presents three novel approaches of text steganography. The first
approach uses the theme of missing letter puzzle where each character of
message is hidden by missing one or more letters in a word of cover. The
average Jaro score was found to be 0.95 indicating closer similarity between
cover and stego file. The second approach hides a message in a wordlist where
ASCII value of embedded character determines length and starting letter of a
word. The third approach conceals a message, without degrading cover, by using
start and end letter of words of the cover. For enhancing the security of
secret message, the message is scrambled using one-time pad scheme before being
concealed and cipher text is then concealed in cover. We also present an
empirical comparison of the proposed approaches with some of the popular text
steganographic approaches and show that our approaches outperform the existing
approaches.
