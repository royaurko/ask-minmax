In 1993, Schellekens obtained a list of possible 71 Lie algebras of
holomorphic vertex operator algebras with central charge 24. However, not all
cases are known to exist. The aim of this article is to construct new
holomorphic vertex operator algebras using the theory of framed vertex operator
algebras and to determine the Lie algebra structures of their weight one
subspaces. In particular, we study holomorphic framed vertex operator algebras
associated to subcodes of the triply even codes $\RM(1,4)^3$ and
$\RM(1,4)\oplus \EuD(d_{16}^+)$ of length 48. These vertex operator algebras
correspond to the holomorphic simple current extensions of the lattice type
vertex operator algebras $(V_{\sqrt{2}E_8}^+)^{\otimes 3}$ and
$V_{\sqrt{2}E_8}^+\otimes V_{\sqrt{2}D_{16}^+}^+$. We determine such extensions
using a quadratic space structure on the set of all irreducible modules $R(W)$
of $W$ when $W= (V_{\sqrt{2}E_8}^+)^{\otimes 3}$ or $V_{\sqrt{2}E_8}^+\otimes
V_{\sqrt{2}D_{16}^+}^+$. As our main results, we construct seven new
holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 in Schellekens' list
and obtain a complete list of all Lie algebra structures associated to the
weight one subspaces of holomorphic framed vertex operator algebras of central
charge 24.
