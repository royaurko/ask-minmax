We studied the Adler-Bardeen-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in the context of a finite
chiral quark model known as the Spectral Quark Model. Within this model, we
obtain the general non-local form of the axial vertex compatible with a non
vanishing axial coupling, in the chiral limit. The triangle anomaly is computed
and we show that the obtained dependence of the axial vertex with the spectral
mass is necessary to ensure both finiteness and the correct violation of the
chiral Ward-Takahashi identity.
