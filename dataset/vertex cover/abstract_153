We construct an infinite series of simply transitive irreducible lattices in
PGL_2(F_q((t))) \times PGL_2(F_q((t))) by means of a quaternion algebra over
F_q(t). The lattices depend on an odd prime power q = p^r and a parameter \tau\
in F_q^* different from 1, and are the fundamental group of a square complex
with just one vertex and universal covering T_{q+1} \times T_{q+1}, a product
of trees with constant valency q + 1.
  Our lattices give rise via non-archimedian uniformization to smooth
projective surfaces of general type over F_q((t)) with ample canonical class,
Chern ratio (c_1)^2/c_2 = 2, trivial Albanese variety and non-reduced Picard
scheme. For q = 3, the Zariski-Euler characteristic attains its minimal value
\chi = 1: the surface is a non-classical fake quadric.
