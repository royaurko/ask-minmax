We discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of the Schwinger proper-time method of
calculating Green functions in gauge theories. Instead of calculating Feynman
diagrams, we solve the corresponding Dyson-Schwinger equations. We express the
solutions in terms of vertex operators, which consist of the zero modes of the
vertex operators appearing in string theories. We show how color decomposition
arises in this formalism at tree level. At the one-loop level, we arrive at
expressions similar to those obtained in the background gauge. In both cases,
no special gauge-fixing procedure is needed.
