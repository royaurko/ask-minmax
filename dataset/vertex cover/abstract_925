The graded reflection equation is investigated for the
$U_{q}[sl(r|2m)^{(2)}]$ vertex model. We have found four classes of diagonal
solutions and twelve classes of non-diagonal ones. The number of free
parameters for some solutions depends on the number of bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom considered.
