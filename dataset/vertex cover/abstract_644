Knowledge reduction of dynamic covering information systems involves with the
time in practical situations. In this paper, we provide incremental approaches
to computing the type-1 and type-2 characteristic matrices of dynamic coverings
because of varying attribute values. Then we present incremental algorithms of
constructing the second and sixth approximations of sets by using
characteristic matrices. We employ experimental results to illustrate that the
incremental approaches are e?ective to calculate approximations of sets in
dynamic covering information systems. Finally, we perform knowledge reduction
of dynamic covering information systems with the incremental approaches.
