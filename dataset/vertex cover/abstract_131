We present an exact analysis of two conductor-insulator transitions in the
random graph model. The average connectivity is related to the concentration of
impurities. The adjacency matrix of a large random graph is used as a hopping
Hamiltonian. Its spectrum has a delta peak at zero energy. Our analysis is
based on an explicit expression for the height of this peak, and a detailed
description of the localized eigenvectors and of their contribution to the
peak. Starting from the low connectivity (high impurity density) regime, one
encounters an insulator-conductor transition for average connectivity
1.421529... and a conductor-insulator transition for average connectivity
3.154985.... We explain the spectral singularity at average connectivity
e=2.718281... and relate it to another enumerative problem in random graph
theory, the minimal vertex cover problem.
