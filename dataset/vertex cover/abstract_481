This is a survey of various results about spectral covers and their
relationship to Higgs bundles. To a G-principal Higgs bundle on a variety S
corresponds a cameral cover \widetilde{S} of S (a W-Galois cover, where W is
the Weyl group of G) together with a sheaf on \widetilde{S} which in simple
cases is a line bundle, and is W-equivariant up to certain twists and shifts.
Various other types of spectral covers, depending on the choice of a
representation or weight of G, arise as associated objects of \widetilde{S}. We
focus on the decomposition of the Picards of these spectral covers into Pryms
(this includes various well-known Prym identities as special cases) and on the
interpretation, in the spirit of Hitchin's abelianization program, of a
distinguished Prym component as parameter space for higgs bundles.
