Based purely on symmetry considerations, we derive the following result: in
momentum space, the coefficient of the cubic interaction vertex for a spin
$\lambda$ field is equal to the corresponding Yang-Mills (spin 1) coefficient,
raised to the power $\lambda$. This result is valid for all $\lambda$ for
Lagrangians that contain a cubic interaction vertex of the form
$\lambda$-$\lambda$-$\lambda$, in four-dimensional flat spacetime. For
$\lambda=3$, we present an additional derivation of this result.
