Semi-Equivelar maps are generalizations of Archimedean solids to the surfaces
other than 2-sphere. In earlier work a complete classification of
semi-equivelar map of type $(3^5, 4)$ on the surface of Euler characteristic -1
was given. In the meantime Karabas an Nedela classified vertex transitive
semi-equivelar maps on the double torus. In this article we study the types of
semi-equivelar maps on double torus that are also available on the surface of
Euler characteristic -1. We classify them and show that none of them are vertex
transitive.
