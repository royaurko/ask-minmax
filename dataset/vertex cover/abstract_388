We clarify the relation between the vertex operators in type IIB matrix model
and superstring. Green-Schwarz light-cone closed superstring theory is obtained
from IIB matrix model on two dimensional noncommutative backgrounds.
Superstring vertex operators should be reproduced from those of IIB matrix
model through this connection. Indeed, we confirm that supergravity vertex
operators in IIB matrix model on the two dimensional backgrounds reduce to
those in superstring theory. Noncommutativity plays an important role in our
identification. Through this correspondence, we can reproduce superstring
scattering amplitudes from IIB matrix model.
