We consider within QCD collinear factorization the process p+p to jet + jet
+X, where two forward high-$p_T$ jets are produced with a large separation in
rapidity $\Delta y$ (Mueller-Navelet jets). In this case the (calculable) hard
part of the reaction receives large higher-order corrections $\sim \alpha^n_s
(\Delta y)^n$, which can be accounted for in the BFKL approach. In particular,
we calculate in the next-to-leading order the impact factor (vertex) for the
production of a forward high-$p_T$ jet, in the approximation of small aperture
of the jet cone in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle plane. The final
expression for the vertex turns out to be simple and easy to implement in
numerical calculations.
