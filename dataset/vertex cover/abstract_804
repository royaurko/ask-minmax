We calculate in the next-to-leading order the impact factor (vertex) for the
production of a forward high-$p_T$ jet, in the approximation of small aperture
of the jet cone in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle plane. The final
expression for the vertex turns out to be simple and easy to implement in
numerical calculations.
