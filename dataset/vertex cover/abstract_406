Devadoss asked: (1) can every polygon be convexified so that no internal
visibility (between vertices) is lost in the process? Moreover, (2) does such a
convexification exist, in which exactly one vertex is moved at a time (that is,
using {\em single-vertex moves})? We prove the redundancy of the "single-vertex
moves" condition: an affirmative answer to (1) implies an affirmative answer to
(2). Since Aichholzer et al. recently proved (1), this settles (2).
