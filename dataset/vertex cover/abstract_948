A regular approach to studying the Lax type integrability of the AKNS
hierarchy of nonlinear Lax type integrable dynamical systems in the vertex
operator representation is devised. The relationship with the Lie-algebraic
integrability scheme is analyzed, the connection with the tau-function
representation is briefly discussed.
