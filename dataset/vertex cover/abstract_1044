By using the intertwiner and face-vertex correpondence relation, we obtain
the Bethe ansatz equation of eight vertex model with open boundary condtitions
in the framework of algebraic Bethe ansatz method. The open boundary condition
under consideration is the general solution of the reflection equation for
eight vertex model with only one restriction on the free parameters of the
right side reflecting boundary matrix. The reflecting boundary matrices used in
this paper thus may have off-diagonal elements. Our construction can also be
used for the Bethe ansatz of SOS model with reflection boundaries.
