Generalized preferential attachment is defined as the tendency of a vertex to
acquire new links in the future with respect to a particular vertex property.
Understanding which properties influence link acquisition tendency (LAT) gives
us a predictive power to estimate the future growth of network and insight
about the actual dynamics governing the complex networks. In this study, we
explore the effect of age and degree on LAT by analyzing data collected from a
new complex-network growth dataset. We found that LAT and degree of a vertex
are linearly correlated in accordance with previous studies. Interestingly, the
relation between LAT and age of a vertex is found to be in conflict with the
known models of network growth. We identified three different periods in the
network's lifetime where the relation between age and LAT is strongly positive,
almost stationary and negative correspondingly.
