Special covers are metacyclic covers of the projective line, with Galois
group of order pm, which have a specific type of bad reduction to
characteristic p. Such covers arise in the study of the arithmetic of Galois
covers of the projective line with three branch points. Our results provide a
classification of all special covers in terms of certain lifting data in
characteristic p.
