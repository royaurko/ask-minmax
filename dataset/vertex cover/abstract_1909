We study the effect of adding lower dimensional brane charges to the 't Hooft
monopole, di-baryon and baryon vertex configurations in $AdS_4 \times
\mathbb{P}^3$. We show that these configurations capture the background fluxes
in a way that depends on the induced charges, and therefore, require additional
fundamental strings in order to cancel the worldvolume tadpoles. The study of
the dynamics reveals that the charges must lie inside some interval in order to
find well defined configurations, a situation familiar from the baryon vertex
in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ with charges. For the baryon vertex and the di-baryon the
number of fundamental strings must also lie inside an allowed interval. Our
configurations are sensitive to the flat $B$-field recently suggested in the
literature. We make some comments on its possible role. We also discuss how
these configurations are modified in the presence of a non-zero Romans mass.
