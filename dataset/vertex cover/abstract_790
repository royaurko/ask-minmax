We analyze correlation functions of Wilson loop observables and local vertex
operators within the strong-coupling regime of the AdS/CFT correspondence. When
the local operator corresponds to a light string state with finite conserved
charges the correlation function can be evaluated in the semiclassical
approximation of large string tension, where the contribution from the light
vertex can be neglected. We consider the cases where the Wilson loops are
described by two concentric surfaces and the local vertices are the
superconformal chiral primary scalar or a singlet massive scalar operator.
