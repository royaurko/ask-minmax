Possible mechanisms for gluon confinement in Yang-Mills theory in covariant
gauges are discussed briefly. Implications for the infrared behavior of the
Green's functions are outlined. Results for the gluon and Faddeev-Popov ghost
propagators from Dyson-Schwinger studies and lattice calculations are
presented. The importance of the ghost-gluon vertex in these studies is
discussed. Numerical results for a non-perturbatively constructed ghost-gluon
vertex in four and three space-time dimensions are presented.
