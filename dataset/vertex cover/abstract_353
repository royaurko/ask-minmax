We study simplicial action of groups on one vertex Kan complexes. We show
that every semi-direct product of the fundamental group of an one vertex Kan
complex with a finite group can be simplicially realized. We also calculate the
cohomology of the fixed point set of a finite $p-$group action on an one vertex
aspherical Kan complex.
