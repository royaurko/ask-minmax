The spectrum of linearized excitations of the Type IIB SUGRA on AdS5xS5
contains both unitary and non-unitary representations. Among the non-unitary,
some are finite-dimensional. We explicitly construct the pure spinor vertex
operators for a family of such finite-dimensional representations. The
construction can also be applied to infinite-dimensional representations,
including unitary, although it becomes in this case somewhat less explicit.
