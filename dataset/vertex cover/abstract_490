In this note we improve our upper bound given earlier by showing that every
9-fold covering of a point set in the space by finitely many translates of an
octant decomposes into two coverings, and our lower bound by a construction for
a 4-fold covering that does not decompose into two coverings. We also prove
that certain dynamic interval coloring problems are equivalent to the above
question. The same bounds also hold for coverings of points in $\R^2$ by
finitely many homothets or translates of a triangle.
