Any line bundle $\cl $ on a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$ with $\deg \cl \ge
2g+1$ is normally generated, i.e., $\varphi_\cl (C)\subseteq \mathbb P H^0
(C,\cl)$ is projectively normal. However, it has known that more various line
bundles of degree $d$ failing to be normally generated appear on multiple
coverings of genus $g$ as $d$ becomes smaller than $2g+1$.
  Thus, investigating the normal generation of line bundles on multiple
coverings can be an effective approach to the normal generation. In this paper,
we obtain conditions for line bundles on multiple coverings being normally
generated or not, respectively.
