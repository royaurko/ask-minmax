Within the solid-on-solid (SOS) approximation, we carry out a calculation of
the orientational dependence of the step stiffness on a square lattice with
nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions. At low temperature our result
reduces to a simple, transparent expression. The effect of the strongest trio
(three-site, non pairwise) interaction can easily be incorporated by modifying
the interpretation of the two pairwise energies. The work is motivated by a
calculation based on nearest neighbors that underestimates the stiffness by a
factor of 4 in directions away from close-packed directions, and a subsequent
estimate of the stiffness in the two high-symmetry directions alone that
suggested that inclusion of next-nearest-neighbor attractions could fully
explain the discrepancy. As in these earlier papers, the discussion focuses on
Cu(001).
