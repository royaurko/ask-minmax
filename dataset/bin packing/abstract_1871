We develop a new halo-independent strategy for analyzing emerging DM hints,
utilizing the method of extended maximum likelihood. This approach does not
require the binning of events, making it uniquely suited to the analysis of
emerging DM direct detection hints. It determines a preferred envelope, at a
given confidence level, for the DM velocity integral which best fits the data
using all available information and can be used even in the case of a single
anomalous scattering event. All of the halo-independent information from a
direct detection result may then be presented in a single plot, allowing simple
comparisons between multiple experiments. This results in the halo-independent
analogue of the usual mass and cross-section plots found in typical direct
detection analyses, where limit curves may be compared with best-fit regions in
halo-space. The method is straightforward to implement, using
already-established techniques, and its utility is demonstrated through the
first unbinned halo-independent comparison of the three anomalous events
observed in the CDMS-Si detector with recent limits from the LUX experiment.
