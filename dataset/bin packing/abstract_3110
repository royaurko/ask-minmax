FeSe with the PbO structure is a key member of the family of new high-$T_c$
iron pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors, as while it possesses the basic
layered structural motif of edge-sharing distorted FeSe$_4$ tetrahedra, it
lacks interleaved ion spacers or charge-reservoir layers. We find that
application of hydrostatic pressure first rapidly increases $T_c$ which attains
a broad maximum of 37 K at $\sim$7 GPa (this is one of the highest $T_c$ ever
reported for a binary solid) before decreasing to 6 K upon further compression
to $\sim$14 GPa. Complementary synchrotron X-ray diffraction at 16 K was used
to measure the low-temperature isothermal compressibility of $\alpha$-FeSe,
revealing an extremely soft solid with a bulk modulus, $K_0$ = 30.7(1.1) GPa
and strong bonding anisotropy between inter- and intra-layer directions that
transforms to the more densely packed $\beta$-polymorph above $\sim$9 GPa. The
non-monotonic $T_c$($P$) behavior of FeSe coincides with drastic anomalies in
the pressure evolution of the interlayer spacing, pointing to the key role of
this structural feature in modulating the electronic properties.
