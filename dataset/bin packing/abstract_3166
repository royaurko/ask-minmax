MICE is an experiment with a section of an ionization cooling channel and a
muon beam. The muons will be produced by the decay of pions from a target
dipping into the ISIS proton beam at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). The
channel includes liquid-hydrogen absorbers providing transverse and
longitudinal momentum loss and high-gradient radiofrequency (RF) cavities for
longitudinal reacceleration, all packed into a solenoidal magnetic channel.
MICE will reduce the beam transverse emittance by about 10% for muon momenta
between 140 and 240 MeV/c. Time-of-flight (TOF) counters, a threshold Cherenkov
counter, and a calorimeter will identify background electrons and pions.
Spectrometers before and after the cooling section will measure the beam
transmission and input and output emittances with an absolute precision of
0.1%.
