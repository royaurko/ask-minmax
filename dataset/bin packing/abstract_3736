The Halpha gas kinematics of twenty-one representative barred spiral galaxies
belonging to the BHaBAR sample is presented. The galaxies were observed with
FaNTOmM, a Fabry-Perot integral-field spectrometer, on three different
telescopes. The 3D data cubes were processed through a robust pipeline with the
aim of providing the most homogeneous and accurate dataset possible useful for
further analysis. The data cubes were spatially binned to a constant
signal-to-noise ratio, typically around 7. Maps of the monochromatic Halpha
emission line and of the velocity field were generated and the kinematical
parameters were derived for the whole sample using tilted-ring models. The
photometrical and kinematical parameters (position angle of the major axis,
inclination, systemic velocity and kinematical centre) are in relative good
agreement, except maybe for the later-type spirals.
