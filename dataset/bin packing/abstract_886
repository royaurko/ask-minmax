Twisted and rope-like assemblies of filamentous molecules are common and
vital structural elements in cells and tissue of living organisms. We study the
intrinsic frustration occurring in these materials between the two-dimensional
organization of filaments in cross section and out-of-plane interfilament twist
in bundles. Using non-linear continuum elasticity theory of columnar materials,
we study the favorable coupling of twist-induced stresses to the presence of
edge dislocations in the lattice packing of bundles, which leads to a
restructuring of the ground-state order of these materials at intermediate
twist. The stability of dislocations increases as both the degree of twist and
lateral bundle size grow. We show that in ground states of large bundles,
multiple dislocations pile up into linear arrays, radial grain boundaries,
whose number and length grows with bundle twist, giving rise to a rich class of
"polycrystalline" packings.
