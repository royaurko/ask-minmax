In this paper, we analytically calculate the quasinormal modes of scalar,
vector, tensor, and spinor perturbations of the warped dS$_3$ black hole. There
are two horizons for the warped dS$_3$ black hole, namely, the black hole
horizon $r_b$ and the cosmological horizon $r_c$. In the calculation, we impose
the ingoing boundary condition at the black hole horizon and the outgoing
boundary condition at the cosmological horizon. We also investigate the hidden
conformal symmetry of the warped dS$_3$ black hole in the region between the
black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon $r_b<r<r_c$. We use the hidden
conformal symmetry to construct the quasinormal modes in an algebraic way and
find that the results agree with the analytically ones. It turns out that the
frequencies of the quasinormal modes could be identified with the poles in the
thermal boundary-boundary correlators.
