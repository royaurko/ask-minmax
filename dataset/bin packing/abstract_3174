Folding a sheet of paper along a curve can lead to structures seen in
decorative art and utilitarian packing boxes. Here we present a theory for the
simplest such structure: an annular circular strip that is folded along a
central circular curve to form a three-dimensional buckled structure driven by
geometrical frustration. We quantify this shape in terms of the radius of the
circle, the dihedral angle of the fold and the mechanical properties of the
sheet of paper and the fold itself. When the sheet is isometrically deformed
everywhere except along the fold itself, stiff folds result in creases with
constant curvature and oscillatory torsion. However, relatively softer folds
inherit the broken symmetry of the buckled shape with oscillatory curvature and
torsion. Our asymptotic analysis of the isometrically deformed state is
corroborated by numerical simulations which allow us to generalize our analysis
to study multiply folded structures.
