Volunteered geographic information (VGI), one of the most important types of
user-generated web content, has been emerging as a new phenomenon. VGI is
contributed by numerous volunteers and supported by web 2.0 technologies. This
chapter discusses how VGI provides new perspectives for computational
geography, a transformed geography based on the use of data-intensive computing
and simulations to uncover the underlying mechanisms behind geographic forms
and processes. We provide several exemplars of computational geography using
OpenStreetMap data and GPS traces to investigate the scaling of geographic
space and its implications for human mobility patterns. We illustrate that the
field of geography is experiencing a dramatic change and that geoinformatics
and computational geography deserve to be clearly distinguished, with the
former being a study of engineering and the latter being a science.
