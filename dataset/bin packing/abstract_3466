Fractal globule state is widely believed to be the best known model to
describe the chromatin packing in the eucaryotic nuclei. Here we provide a
scaling theory and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) computer simulation for
the thermal motion of monomers in the fractal globule state. We show this
motion to be subdiffusive described by $\langle X^2 (t)\rangle \sim
t^{\alpha_F}$ with $\alpha_F$ close to 0.4. We also suggest a novel way to
construct a fractal globule state in computer simulation, and provide
simulation evidence supporting the conjecture that different initial
entanglement-free states of a polymer chain converge as they are thermally
annealed.
