This paper presents the results of a rheological study of thermotropic
nematic colloids aggregated into cellular structures. Small sterically
stabilised PMMA particles dispersed in a liquid crystal matrix densely pack on
cell interfaces, but reversibly mix with the matrix when the system is heated
above Tni. We obtain a remarkably high elastic modulus, G'~10^5 Pa, which is a
nearly linear function of particle concentration. A characteristic yield stress
is required to disrupt the continuity of cellular structure and liquify the
response. The colloid aggregation in a ``poor nematic'' MBBA has the same
cellular morphology as in the ``good nematic'' 5CB, but the elastic strength is
at least an order of magnitude lower. These findings are supported by
theoretical arguments based on the high surface tension interfaces of a
foam-like cellular system, taking into account the local melting of nematic
liquid and the depletion locking of packed particles on interfaces.
