In this paper we study the Rotor Model of Martins and Nienhuis. After
introducing spectral parameters, a combined use of integrability, polynomiality
of the ground state wave function and a mapping into the fully-packed
O(1)-model allows us to determine the sum rule and a family of maximally nested
components for different boundary conditions. We see in this way the appearance
of 3-enumerations of Alternating Sign Matrices.
