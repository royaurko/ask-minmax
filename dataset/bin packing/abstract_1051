We provide a method to correct the observed azimuthal anisotropy in heavy-ion
collisions for the event plane resolution in a wide centrality bin. This new
procedure is especially useful for rare particles, such as $\Omega$ baryons and
$J/\psi$ mesons, which are difficult to measure in small intervals of
centrality. Based on a Monte Carlo calculation with simulated $v_2$ and
multiplicity, we show that some of the commonly used methods have a bias of up
to 15%.
