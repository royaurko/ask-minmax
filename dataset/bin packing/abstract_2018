We consider the dimer-monomer problem for the rectangular lattice. By mapping
the problem into one of close-packed dimers on an extended lattice, we rederive
the Tzeng-Wu solution for a single monomer on the boundary by evaluating a
Pfaffian. We also clarify the mathematical content of the Tzeng-Wu solution by
identifying it as the product of the nonzero eigenvalues of the Kasteleyn
matrix.
