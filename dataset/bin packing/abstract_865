Static packings of frictional rigid particles are investigated by means of
discrete element simulations. We explore the ensemble of allowed force
realizations in the space of contact forces for a given packing structure. We
estimate the extent of force indeterminacy with different methods. The
indeterminacy exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the interparticle friction
coefficient. We verify directly that larger force-indeterminacy is accompanied
by a more robust behavior against local perturbations. We also investigate the
local indeterminacy of individual contact forces. The probability distribution
of local indeterminacy changes its shape depending on friction. We find that
local indeterminacy tends to be larger on force chains for intermediate
friction. This correlation disappears in the large friction limit.
