This paper studies the two-user Causal Cognitive Interference Channel (CCIC),
where two transmitters aim to communicate independent messages to two different
receivers via a common channel. One source, referred to as the cognitive, is
capable of overhearing the other source, referred to as the primary, through a
noisy in-band link and thus can assist in sending the primary's data. Two novel
outer bounds of the type $2R_p+R_c$ and $R_p+2R_c$ are derived for the class of
injective semi-deterministic CCICs where the noises at the different
source-destination pairs are independent. An achievable rate region is derived
based on Gelfand-Pinsker binning, superposition coding and simultaneous
decoding at the receivers.
  The lower and outer bounds are then specialized to the practically relevant
Gaussian noise case. The contributors of this paper recently characterized to within
a constant gap the capacity of the symmetric Gaussian CCIC in (a) the strong
interference regime, and (b) for a subset of the weak interference regime when
the cooperation link is larger than a given threshold. This work characterizes
to within a constant gap the capacity for the symmetric Gaussian CCIC in the
regime that was still open. In particular, it is shown that the novel outer
bounds are necessary to characterize the capacity to within a constant gap when
the cooperation link is weaker than the direct links, that is, in this regime
unilateral cooperation leaves some system resources underutilized.
