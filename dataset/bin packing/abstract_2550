It is a common sense to apply the VFC (view frustum culling) of spatial
object to bounding cube of the object in 3D graphics. The accuracy of VFC can
not be guaranteed even in cube rotated three-dimensionally. In this paper is
proposed a method which is able to carry out more precise and fast VFC of any
spatial object in the image domain of cube by an analytic mapping, and is
demonstrated the effect of the method for terrain block on global surface.
