We present a measurement of direct photon pair production cross sections
using 4.2 fb-1 of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
proton-antiproton Collider. We measure single differential cross sections as a
function of the diphoton mass, the transverse momentum of the diphoton system,
the azimuthal angle between the photons, and the polar scattering angle of the
photons, as well as the double differential cross sections considering the last
three kinematic variables in three diphoton mass bins. The results are compared
with different perturbative QCD predictions and event generators.
