The aim of this contribution is to analyze to some extent the reflectivity of
the family of organic salts known as the Bechgaard salts. The reflectivity will
be calculated using a well known theoretical framework,and results for the
electrical conductivity and susceptibility of these materials. The result
obtained for the reflectivity is a non-linear expression depending on various
material parameters within the Hubbard model. The position of the region where
the reflectivity tends to zero will also be determined as a function of model
parameters. A possibility of extending the results to 2D systems is briefly
mentioned.
