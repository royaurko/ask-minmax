PGA (ProGram Algebra) is an algebra of programs which concerns programs in
their simplest form: sequences of instructions. Molecular dynamics is a simple
model of computation developed in the setting of PGA, which bears on the use of
dynamic data structures in programming. We consider the programming of an
interpreter for a program notation that is close to existing assembly languages
using PGA with the primitives of molecular dynamics as basic instructions. It
happens that, although primarily meant for explaining programming language
features relating to the use of dynamic data structures, the collection of
primitives of molecular dynamics in itself is suited to our programming wants.
