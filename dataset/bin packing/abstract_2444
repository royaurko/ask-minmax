We examine the derivation of the spin-orbit force from the Skyrme model. We
find substantial agreement with phenomenological potentials. We show that a
systematic and simultaneous treatment of all components of the kinetic energy
introduces a minus sign relative to previous calculations for the iso-spin
independent part of the interaction. We also explain the smallness of the
iso-spin dependent part of the spin-orbit potential.
