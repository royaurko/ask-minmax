Developing an accurate scoring function is essential for successfully
predicting protein structures. In this study, we developed a statistical
potential function, called OPUS-Beta, for energetically evaluating beta-sheet
contact pattern (the entire residue-residue beta-contacts of a protein)
independent of the atomic coordinate information. The OPUS-Beta potential
contains five terms, i.e., a self-packing term, a pairwise inter-strand packing
term, a pairwise intra-strand packing term, a lattice term and a
hydrogen-bonding term. The results show that, in recognizing the native
beta-contact pattern from decoys, OPUS-Beta potential outperforms the existing
methods in literature, especially in combination with a method using
2D-recursive neural networks (about 5% and 23% improvements in top-1 and top-5
selections). We expect OPUS-Beta potential to be useful in beta-sheet modeling
for proteins.
