We consider some of the issues surrounding the formation and evolution of
Q-balls in the MSSM and its extensions. The ratio of the baryon number packed
into Q-balls to that outside, f_{B}, plays a fundamental role in determining
the relationship of dark matter to the baryon number in the Universe at
present. The final value of f_{B} will depend upon the details of the formation
of Q-balls from the collapse of the Affleck-Dine condensate and upon the
subsequent evolution of the ensemble of Q-balls. We discuss the implications
for neutralino dark matter in the gravity-mediated scenario and show that a
light neutralino is necessary in most cases to account for the baryon to dark
matter ratio, with an NMSSM singlino LSP of mass m_{\chi} \lae 20 \GeV being a
favoured candidate.
