The knowledge of the spectral state of a black hole is essential for the
interpretation of data from black holes in terms of their emission models.
Based on pointed observations of Cyg X-1 with the Rossi X-ray timing Explorer
(RXTE) that are used to classify simultaneous RXTE-ASM observations, we develop
a scheme based on RXTE -ASM colors and count rates that can be used to classify
all observations of this canonical black hole that were performed between 1996
and 2011. We show that a simple count rate criterion, as used previously, leads
to a significantly higher fraction of misclassified observations. This scheme
enables us to classify single INTEGRAL-IBIS science windows and to obtain
summed spectra for the soft, intermediate and hard state with low contamination
by other states.
