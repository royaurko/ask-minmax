We present a Monte Carlo method for the direct evaluation of the difference
between the free energies of two crystal structures. The method is built on a
lattice-switch transformation that maps a configuration of one structure onto a
candidate configuration of the other by `switching' one set of lattice vectors
for the other, while keeping the displacements with respect to the lattice
sites constant. The sampling of the displacement configurations is biased,
multicanonically, to favor paths leading to `gateway' arrangements for which
the Monte Carlo switch to the candidate configuration will be accepted. The
configurations of both structures can then be efficiently sampled in a single
process, and the difference between their free energies evaluated from their
measured probabilities. We explore and exploit the method in the context of
extensive studies of systems of hard spheres. We show that the efficiency of
the method is controlled by the extent to which the switch conserves correlated
microstructure. We also show how, microscopically, the procedure works: the
system finds gateway arrangements which fulfill the sampling bias
intelligently. We establish, with high precision, the differences between the
free energies of the two close packed structures (fcc and hcp) in both the
constant density and the constant pressure ensembles.
