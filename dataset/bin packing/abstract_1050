The local magnetic moment of Ti:ZnO is calculated from first principles by
using the corrected-band-gap scheme (CBGS). The results shows that the system
is magnetic with the magnetization of 0.699 $\mu_B$ per dopant. The origin of
the local magnetic moment is considered to be the impurity band partially
occupied by the donor electrons in the conduction band. Further, the impacts of
applying Hubbard U to Ti-d orbital on the magnetic moment have been
investigated.
