We consider nonparametric maximum-likelihood estimation of a log-concave
density in case of interval-censored, right-censored and binned data. We allow
for the possibility of a subprobability density with an additional mass at
$+\infty$, which is estimated simultaneously. The existence of the estimator is
proved under mild conditions and various theoretical aspects are given, such as
certain shape and consistency properties. An EM algorithm is proposed for the
approximate computation of the estimator and its performance is illustrated in
two examples.
