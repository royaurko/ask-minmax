The solution of QCD equations for generating functions of multiplicity
distributions reveals new peculiar features of cumulant moments oscillating as
functions of their rank. This prediction is supported by experimental data on
$e^{+}e^{-}, hh, AA$ collisions. Evolution of the moments at smaller phase
space bins leads to intermittency and fractality. The experimentally defined
truncated generating functions possess zeros in the complex plane of the
auxiliary variable recalling Lee-Yang zeros in statistical mechanics.
