Neutral pions with p_T = 1 - 8 GeV/c have been measured for 9 different
centrality classes in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV by the PHENIX
experiment at RHIC. The pi^0 multiplicity in central reactions is significantly
below the binary collision scaled yields from both peripheral Au+Au and pp
reactions. The observed suppression sets in for the 50-70% centrality class and
increases with p_T and centrality. For the most central bin, the deficit
amounts to a factor ~2.5 at p_T ~ 2 GeV/c gradually increasing to a factor ~6
at p_T ~ 8 GeV/c.
