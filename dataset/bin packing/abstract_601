The improved method of intermittent data analysis is proposed. It exploits,
in addition to the standard density moments, the information on the bin-bin
correlations, observed in the data and expressed in terms of the density
correlators. The improving recovering corrections are implemented into the data
analysis in the form of the recursive algorithm, and tested in the framework of
multiplicative cascading models.
