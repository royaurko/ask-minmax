12 W~UMa-type systems were observed at 3.6 cm with a goal to compare their
radio luminosities with those of non-contact, rapidly rotating, late-type
stars. Only 3 systems, all of spectral type K, have been detected. The
detections and (low) upper limits for remaining systems confirm the strong
under-luminosity of W~UMa-type systems. VW~Cep, which was been detected several
times before, has been analyzed in terms of the temporal cumulative flux
distribution. Apparently, VW~Cep spends most of the time in radio quiescence
with flare-like events taking less than 20\% of time.
