Dependence of structural self-organization of granular materials on
preparation and grain parameters is key to predictive modelling. We study 60
different mechanically equilibrated polydisperse disc packs, generated
numerically by two protocols. We show that, for same-variance disc size
distributions (DSDs): 1. the mean coordination number of rattler-free packs vs.
the packing fraction is a function independent of initial conditions, friction
and the DSD: 2. all quadron volume and cell order distributions collapse to
universal forms, also independent of the above. We conclude that, contrary to
common wisdom, equilibrated granular structures are determined mainly by the
packing protocol and higher moments of the DSD.
