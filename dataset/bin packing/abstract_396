We bound several quantities related to the packing density of the patterns
1(L+1)L...2. These bounds sharpen results of B\'ona, Sagan, and Vatter and give
a new proof of the packing density of these patterns, originally computed by
Stromquist in the case L=2 and by Price for larger L. We end with comments and
conjectures.
