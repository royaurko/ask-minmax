We investigate the stability of a new warped black string with nontrivial
topologies in five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime. After studying the
linear gravitational perturbation, we find that this black string is unstable
when the Kaluza-Klein mass falls in a certain range and the instability exists
for all topological spacetimes.
