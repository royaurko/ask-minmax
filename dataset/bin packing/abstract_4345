The Dark Energy Survey (DES) has recently completed the Science Verification
phase (SV), collecting data over 150 sq. deg. of sky. In this work we analyze
to what extent it is beneficial to supplement the analysis of DES data with CMB
lensing data. We provide forecasts for both DES-SV and for the full survey
covering 5000 sq. deg. We show that data presently available from DES-SV and
SPT-SZ would allow a ~ 8% measurement of the linear galaxy bias in three out of
four redshift bins. We further show that a joint analysis of cosmic shear,
galaxy density and CMB lensing data allows to break the degeneracy between the
shear multiplicative bias, the linear galaxy bias and the normalization of the
matter power spectrum. We show that these observables can thus be self
calibrated to the percent or sub-percent level, depending on the quality of
available data, fraction of overlap of the footprints and priors included in
the analysis.
