The EGRET results for gamma ray intensities in and near the Galactic Plane
have been analysed in some detail. Attention has been concentrated on energies
above 1 GeV and the individual intensities in a $4^{\circ}$ longitude bin have
been determined and compared with the large scale mean found from a nine-degree
polynomial fit. Comparison has been made of the observed standard deviation for
the ratio of these intensities with that expected from variants of our model.
The basic model adopts cosmic ray origin from supernova remnants, the particles
then diffusing through the Galaxy with our usual `anomalous diffusion'. The
variants involve the clustering of SN, a frequency distribution for supernova
explosion energies, and 'normal', rather than 'anomalous' diffusion.
  It is found that for supernovae of unique energy, and our usual anomalous
diffusion, clustering is necessary, particularly in the Inner Galaxy. An
alternative, and preferred, situation is to adopt the model with a frequency
distribution of supernova energies. The results for the Outer Galaxy are such
that no clustering is required.
  If their explosion energies are distributed then supernovae can be the origin
of UHECR.
