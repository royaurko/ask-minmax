We have studied the effect of ageing within the miscibility gap on the
electric, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a non-stoichiometric Heusler
Cu-Al-Mn shape-memory alloy, which undergoes a martensitic transition from a
$bcc$-based ($\beta$-phase) towards a close-packed structure ($M$-phase).
Negative magnetoresistance which shows an almost linear dependence on the
square of magnetization with different slopes in the $M$- and $\beta$-phases,
was observed. This magnetoresistive effect has been associated with the
existence of Mn-rich clusters with the Cu$_2$AlMn-structure. The effect of an
applied magnetic field on the martensitic transition has also been studied. The
entropy change between the $\beta$- and $M$-phases shows negligible dependence
on the magnetic field but it decreases significantly with annealing time within
the miscibility gap. Such a decrease is due to the increasing amount of
Cu$_2$MnAl-rich domains that do not transform martensitically.
