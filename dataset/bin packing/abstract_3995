Anomalous diffusion in liquids and the solid-liquid phase transition
(melting) are studied in two-dimensional Yukawa systems. The self-intermediate
scattering function (self-ISF), calculated from simulation data, exhibits a
temporal decay, or relaxation, with a characteristic relaxation time. This
decay is found to be useful for distinguishing normal and anomalous diffusion
in a liquid, and for identifying the solid-liquid phase transition. For
liquids, a scaling of the relaxation time with length scale is found. For the
solid-liquid phase transition, the shape of the self-ISF curve is found to be a
sensitive indicator of phase. Friction has a significant effect on the timing
of relaxation, but not the melting point.
