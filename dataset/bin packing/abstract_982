Based on the Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups $H_{EL}^{(2k-1)}({\cal M}^{2n})
(1 \leqslant k\leqslant n)$ on symplectic manifold $({\cal M}^{2n}, \omega)$,
their properties and a kind of classification of vector fields on the manifold,
we generalize Liouville's theorem in classical mechanics to two sequences, the
symplectic(-like) and the Hamiltonian-(like) Liouville's theorems. This also
generalizes Noether's theorem, since the sequence of symplectic(-like)
Liouville's theorems link to the cohomology directly.
