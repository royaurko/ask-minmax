Globular cluster systems (GCSs) are vital tools for investigating the violent
star formation histories of their host galaxies. This violence could e.g. have
been triggered by galaxy interactions or mergers. The basic observational
properties of a GCS are its luminosity function and color distributions (number
of clusters per luminosity resp. color bin). A large number of observed GCSs
show bimodal color distributions, which, by comparison with evolutionary
synthesis (ES) models, can be translated into bimodality in metallicity and/or
age. An additional uncertainty comes into play when one considers extinction
within the host galaxy. These effects can be disentangled either by obtaining
spectroscopic data for the clusters or by imaging observations in at least four
passbands. This allows us then to discriminate between various formation
scenarios of GCSs, e.g. the merger scenario by Ashman & Zepf and the
multi-phase collapse model by Forbes et. al.. Young and metal-rich star cluster
populations are seen to form in interacting and merging galaxies. We analyse
multi-wavelength broad-band observations of these young cluster systems
provided by the ASTROVIRTEL project.
