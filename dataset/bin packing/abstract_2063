We prove conjectures of the third contributor [L. Tevlin, Proc. FPSAC'07, Tianjin]
on two new bases of noncommutative symmetric functions: the transition matrices
from the ribbon basis have nonnegative integral coefficients. This is done by
means of two composition-valued statistics on permutations and packed words,
which generalize the combinatorics of Genocchi numbers.
