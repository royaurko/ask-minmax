We present a Bell-state analyzer for time-bin qubits allowing the detection
of three out of four Bell-states with linear optics, two detectors and no
auxiliary photons. The theoretical success rate of this scheme is 50%. A
teleportation experiment was performed to demonstrate its functionality. We
also present a teleportation experiment with a Fidelity larger than the cloning
limit of F=5/6.
