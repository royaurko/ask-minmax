Fix an integral Soddy sphere packing P. Let K be the set of all curvatures in
P. A number n is called represented if n is in K, that is, if there is a sphere
in P with curvature equal to n. A number n is called admissible if it is
everywhere locally represented, meaning that n is in K(mod q) for all q. It is
shown that every sufficiently large admissible number is represented.
