We propose a small extenion of the minimal gauge mediation through the
combination of extended gauge mediation and conformal sequestering. We show
that the focus point supersymmetry can be realized naturally, and the
?ne-tuning is signifcantly reduced compared to the minimal gauge mediation and
extended gauge mediation without focus point. The Higgs boson mass is around
125 GeV, the gauginos remain light, and the gluino is likely to be detected at
the next run of the LHC. However, the multi-TeV squarks is out of the reach of
the LHC. The numerical calculation for ?netuning shows that this model remains
natural.
