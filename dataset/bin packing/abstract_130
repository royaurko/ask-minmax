Given a finite connected graph $G$, place a bin at each vertex. Two bins are
called a pair if they share an edge of $G$. At discrete times, a ball is added
to each pair of bins. In a pair of bins, one of the bins gets the ball with
probability proportional to its current number of balls. Previous works proved
that when $G$ is not balanced bipartite, the proportion of balls in the bins
converges to a point $w(G)$ almost surely.
  We prove almost sure convergence for balanced bipartite graphs: the possible
limit is either a single point $w(G)$ or a closed interval $\mathcal J(G)$.
