Given distinct points $p_1,\cdots,p_r$ of the projective plane $P^2$ and a
positive integer $m$, the homogeneous ideal defining the fat point subscheme
$Z=m(p_1+\cdots+p_r)$ is the symbolic power $I^{(m)}$ of the homogeneous ideal
$I$ defining the smooth union of the $r$ points $p_1,\ldots,p_r$. If
$p_1,\ldots,p_r$ are sufficiently general, it is known that the maximal rank
conjecture holds for $I$; i.e., for every $d$ the multiplication map
$I_1\otimes I_d\to I_{(d+1)}$ on homogeneous components has maximal rank
(meaning the map is either injective or surjective). One easily sees this fails
for symbolic powers of ideals defining general points; this preprint relates
the failure to the occurrence of (in Nagata's terminology) uniform abnormal
curves, and, for $r<10$, takes complete account of the failure, thereby
completely determining the modules in a minimal free resolution of $I^{(m)}$
when $r<10$. It is also conjectured that maximal rank holds if $r>9$. Assuming
this and a previous conjecture of the contributor, one can completely determine the
modules in a minimal free resolution of $I^{(m)}$ for any $r>0$ general points
and any $m>0$.

addition to plainTeX textfile and dvi versions of this preprint, a Macintosh
(stuffed and bin hexed) executable and a C source textfile program which output
the (conjectural for $r>9$) modules in a minimal free resolution of $I^{(m)}$
for any $r>0$ general plane points and any $m>0$. Web visitors can also run a
