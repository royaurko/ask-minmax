The current generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs),
including the H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS telescope arrays, have made
substantial contributions to our knowledge about the structure and composition
of the highly relativistic jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this
paper, we discuss some of the outstanding scientific questions and give a
qualitative overview of AGN related science topics which will be explored with
the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). CTA is expected to further
constrain the structure and make-up of jets, and thus, to constrain models of
jet formation, acceleration, and collimation. Furthermore, being the brightest
well-established extragalactic sources of TeV {\gamma}- rays, AGNs can be used
to probe the EBL, intergalactic magnetic fields, and the validity of the
Lorentz Invariance principle at high photon energies.
