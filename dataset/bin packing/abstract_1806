The development of a continuum-bins scheme of discretization for three-body
projectiles is necessary for studies of reactions of Borromean nuclei such as
6He within the continuum-discretized coupled-channels approach. Such a
procedure, for constructing bin states on selected continuum energy intervals,
is formulated and applied for the first time to reactions of a three-body
projectile. The continuum representation uses the eigenchannel expansion of the
three-body S-matrix. The method is applied to the challenging case of the 6He +
208Pb reaction at 22 MeV, where an accurate treatment of both the Coulomb and
the nuclear interactions with the target is necessary.
