NLO corrections to jet cross sections in DIS at HERA are studied, with
particular emphasis on the two jet final state. High jet transverse momenta are
a good criterion for the applicability of fixed order perturbation theory. A
``natural'' scale choice is the average $k_T^B$ of the jets in the Breit frame,
which suggest analyzing the data in different $<k_T^B>$ intervalls.
