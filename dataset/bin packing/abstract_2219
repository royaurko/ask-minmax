We study scaling properties of the honeycomb fully packed loop ensemble
associated with a lozenge tiling model of rough surface, when the latter is
driven out of equilibrium by Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) type dynamics. We show
numerically that conformal invariance and signatures of critical percolation
appear in the stationary KPZ state. In terms of the two-component Coulomb gas
description of the Edwards-Wilkinson stationary state, our finding is
understood as the invariance of one component under the effect of the
non-linear KPZ term. On the other hand, we show a breaking of conformal
invariance when the level lines of the other component are considered.
