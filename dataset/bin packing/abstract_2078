The cream layer is a complex heterogeneous material of biological origin
which forms spontaneously at the air-milk interface. Here, it is studied the
crumpling of a single cream layer packing under its own weight at room
temperature in three-dimensional space. The structure obtained in these
circumstances has low volume fraction and anomalous fractal dimensions. Direct
means and noninvasive NMR imaging technique are used to investigate the
internal and external structure of these systems.
