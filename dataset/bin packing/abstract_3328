Motivated by recent experiments\cite{BA}\cite{BB}, we study quasi 2D
ferromagnetic condensates with various aspect ratios. We find that in zero
magnetic field, dipolar energy generates a local energy minimum with all the
spins lie in the 2D plane forming a row of {\em circular} spin textures with
{\em alternating} orientation, corresponding to a packing of vortices of {\em
identical} vorticity in different spin components. In a large magnetic field,
the system can fall into a long lived dynamical state consisting of an array of
elliptic and hyperbolic Mermin-Ho spin textures, while the true equilibrium is
an uniaxial spin density wave with a single wave-vector along the magnetic
field, and a wavelength similar to the characteristic length of the long lived
vortex array state.
