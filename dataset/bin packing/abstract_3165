The paper contains an application of the generalized lattice model to
multicomponent systems with internal degrees of freedom. The short-range
inter-atomic repulsions and smooth long-range parts of the inter-atomic
potentials are considered separately by means of packing condition and in
effective field approximation, respectively. The dependence of the inter-atomic
potentials on the internal degrees of freedoms (such as atomic electric and/or
magnetic momentum) taken into account. The Helmholtz free energy functional in
the generalized lattice model is reduced to the
Ginzburg-Landau-Cahn-Hilliard-like form. The connection between the
inter-atomic potentials characteristics and the parameters of the GLCH-like
functional is obtained. Equations for both equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium
states in condensed systems are derived. It is shown that equilibrium
distribution of the fast internal degrees of freedom by frozen space
distribution of the components obeys to the Schroedinger-like equation.
