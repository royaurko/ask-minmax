Beam tail effect of multi-bunches will influence the electron beam
performances in high intensity thermionic RF gun. Beam dynamic calculations
that illustrate the working states of single and multi-pulse fed-in of
performance-enhanced EC-ITC (External Cathode Independent Tunable Cavity) RF
gun for FEL (Free Electron Laser) injector are performed to estimate extracted
bunch properties. By using both Parmela and homemade MATLAB codes, the effects
of single beam tail as well as interactions of multi-pulses are analyzed, where
ring-based electron algorithm is adopted to calculated RF fields and space
charge field. Furthermore, the procedure of unexpected deviated-energy
particles mixed with effective bunch head is described by MATLAB code as well.
As a result, performance-enhanced EC-ITC RF gun is proved to have the
capability to extract continual stable bunches which are suitable for high
requirement THz-FEL.
