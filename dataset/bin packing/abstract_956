We have studied the uncertainty on the determination of the dark energy
equation of state due to a non-vanishing spatial curvature by considering some
fundamental observables. We discussed the sensitivity of these observables to
the value and redshift history of the equation of state and the spatial
curvature and investigated whether these different observables are
complementary and can help to reduce the cosmic confusion.
