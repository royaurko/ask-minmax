Using an organometallic precursor, TiO2 coatings were fabricated on surfaces
of quartz, zircon and rutile sands. X ray Diffraction, X ray Fluorescence, UV
Vis spectroscopy and surface area measurement were used to characterise support
materials. The phase composition and morphology of the coatings were
characterised by laser Raman spectroscopy and SEM respectively. A packed bed
reactor was used to study the inactivation of Escherichia coli in recirculating
water by the supported photocatalysts. It was found that the sand grains were
well coated with a homogenous layer of TiO2 and coatings were well adhered,
exhibiting a mixed anatase rutile composition after firing at 850C.
Photocatalytic activity was highest in coatings applied to quartz sand,
although sterilisation of the recirculating water was not achieved with any of
the materials investigated. The advantages of quartz as a TiO2 photocatalyst
support material are likely a result of this materials higher purity and
optical transmittance. Potential enhancement through Si doping cannot be ruled
out.
