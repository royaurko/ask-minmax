We use inelastic neutron scattering and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to
investigate the chemical short range order (CSRO), visible through prepeaks in
the structure factors, and its relation to self diffusion in Al-Ni melts. As a
function of composition at 1795K Ni self diffusion coefficients from experiment
and simulation exhibit a non-linear dependence with a pronounced increase on
the Al-rich side. This comes along with a change in CSRO with increasing Al
content that is related to a more dense packing of the atoms in Ni-rich Al-Ni
systems.
