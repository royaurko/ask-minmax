We compute the dynamic structure factors of a dense binary liquid mixture.
These describe dynamics on molecular length scales, where structural relaxation
is important. We find that the presence of a few large particles in a dense
fluid of small particles slows down the dynamics considerably. We also observe
a deep narrowing of the spectrum for a disordered mixture composed of a nearly
equal packing of the two species. In contrast, a few small particles diffuse
easily in the background of a dense fluid of large particles. We expect our
results to describe neutron scattering from a dense mixture.
