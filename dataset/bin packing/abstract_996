We present VUV observations of transitions between doubly excited sextet
states in O3+, F4+ and Ne5+. Spectra were produced by collisions of an oxygen,
uorine and neon beam with a nitrogen gas jet target. Prepared beam-gas
experiment yields new and explicit information on doubly core-excited ions.
Some observed lines were assigned to the 1s2s2p3 6S-1s2p33s, 3d 6P
electric-dipole transitions in O3+, F4+ and Ne5+. Three lines have been
reassigned. Present data are the first explicit measurements on transitions
between sextet states in boronlike ions by beam-gas spectroscopy.
