We present experimental measurements of penetration depths for the impact of
spheres into wetted granular media. We observe that the penetration depth in
the liquid saturated case scales with projectile density, size, and drop height
in a fashion consistent with the scaling observed in the dry case, but that
penetration depths into saturated packings tend to be smaller. This result
suggests that, for the range of impact energies observed, the stopping force is
set by static contact forces between grains within the bed, and that the
presence of liquid serves, primarily, to enhance these contact forces. The
enhancement to the stopping force has a complicated dependence on liquid
fraction, accompanied by a change in the drop-height dependence, that must be
the consequence of accompanying changes in the conformation of the liquid phase
in the interstices.
