Analytical solutions are obtained to the nonlinear equations describing
neutrino oscillations when explicit neutrino-antineutrino asymmetries are
present. Such a system occurs in the early Universe if neutrinos have a
non-zero chemical potential. Solutions to the equations lead to a new type of
coherent behavior governed by two modes. These bimodal solutions provide new
insights into dense neutrino gases and into neutrino oscillations in the early
Universe, thereby allowing one to surmise the flavor behavior of neutrinos with
a non-zero chemical potential.
