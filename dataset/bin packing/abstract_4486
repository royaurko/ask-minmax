We propose a spatial diffuseness feature for deep neural network (DNN)-based
automatic speech recognition to improve recognition accuracy in reverberant and
noisy environments. The feature is computed in real-time from multiple
microphone signals without requiring knowledge or estimation of the direction
of arrival, and represents the relative amount of diffuse noise in each time
and frequency bin. It is shown that using the diffuseness feature as an
additional input to a DNN-based acoustic model leads to a reduced word error
rate for the REVERB challenge corpus, both compared to logmelspec features
extracted from noisy signals, and features enhanced by spectral subtraction.
