Electronic transport properties of monolayer graphene with extreme physical
bending up to 90o angle are studied using ab Initio first-principle
calculations. The importance of key structural parameters including step
height, curvature radius and bending angle are discussed how they modify the
transport properties of the deformed graphene sheet comparing to the
corresponding flat ones. The local density of state reveals that energy state
modification caused by the physical bending is highly localized. It is observed
that the transport properties of bent graphene with a wide range of geometrical
configurations are insensitive to the structural deformation in the low-energy
transmission spectra, even in the extreme case of bending. The results support
that graphene, with its superb electromechanical robustness, could serve as a
viable material platform in a spectrum of applications such as photovoltaics,
flexible electronics, OLED, and 3D electronic chips.
