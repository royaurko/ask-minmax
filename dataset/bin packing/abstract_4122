In this article, we show that a four-dimensional Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black
hole could be described by two different holographic two-dimensional conformal
field theories. The first description, in view of the angular momentum, has
been well discussed in (arXiv:1006.0157). The other alternative dual picture,
however, is somehow overlooked. This new description, in view of the charge,
provides another holographic correspondence. This picture again is supported
not only by the match of the macroscopic entropy with the counting of
microscopic degrees of freedom via the Cardy formula and also by the agreement
on the real-time correlator in the superradiant scattering.
