We compare relativistic transport model calculations to recent data on the
sideward flow of neutral strange K^0_s mesons for Au+Au collisions at 6 AGeV. A
soft nuclear equation of state is found to describe very well the positive
proton flow data measured in the same experiment. In the absence of kaon
potential, the K^0 flow pattern is similar to that of protons. The kaon flow
becomes negative if a repulsive kaon potential determined from the impulse
approximation is introduced. However, this potential underestimates the data
which exhibits larger antiflow. An excellent agreement with the data is
obtained when a relativistic scalar-vector kaon potential, that has stronger
density dependence, is used. We further find that the transverse momentum
dependence of directed and elliptic flow is quite sensitive to the kaon
potential in dense matter.
