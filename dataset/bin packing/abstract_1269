We develop a Coulomb gas description of the critical fluctuations in the
fully packed loop model on the honeycomb lattice. We identify the complete
operator spectrum of this model in terms of electric and magnetic {\em
vector}-charges, and we calculate the scaling dimensions of these operators
exactly. We also study the geometrical properties of loops in this model, and
we derive exact results for the fractal dimension and the loop size
distribution function. A review of the many different representations of this
model that have recently appeared in the literature, is given.
