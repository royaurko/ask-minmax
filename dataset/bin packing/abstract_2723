We study the higher spin black holes in a truncated version of higher spin
gravity in $AdS_3$. This theory contains only finite number of even spins
s=2,4,...,2N. We mainly focus on the simplest case, so-called (Type I and II)
spin ${\tilde 4}$ gravity, which contains only spin 2 and spin 4 fields. This
spin ${\tilde 4}$ gravity is as simple as spin 3 gravity, thus provides another
example to test various ideas on higher spin gravity. We find that the
asymptotical symmetry of this spin ${\tilde 4}$ gravity is a classical
W(2,4)-symmetry. Moreover, we study the black hole solution with pure spin 4
hair and discuss its thermodynamics. One important feature of this black hole
is that its entropy could be written in compact forms. Furthermore, we
investigate a $G_2$ generated higher spin gravity. This higher spin gravity
only contains spin 2 and spin 6 fields which makes it different from other
kinds of higher spin gravity. We find the corresponding black hole with spin 6
hair, and discuss its thermodynamics analytically. It turns out that the black
holes with spin 4 or spin 6 hair constructed in this paper are the only black
holes with single higher spin hair, besides the spin 3 black hole found in
