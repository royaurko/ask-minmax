Packing and vehicle routing problems play an important role in the area of
supply chain management. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear knapsack
problem that occurs when packing items along a fixed route and taking into
account travel time. We investigate constrained and unconstrained versions of
the problem and show that both are NP-hard. In order to solve the problems, we
provide a pre-processing scheme as well as exact and approximate mixed integer
programming (MIP) solutions. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
the MIP solutions and in particular point out that the approximate MIP approach
often leads to near optimal results within far less computation time than the
exact approach.
