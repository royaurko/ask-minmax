We analyze the infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for
10micron < lambda(rest) < 100micron for ~600 galaxies at z~0.7 in the extended
Chandra Deep Field South by stacking their Spitzer 24, 70 and 160micron images.
We place interesting constraints on the average IR SED shape in two bins: the
brightest 25% of z~0.7 galaxies detected at 24micron, and the remaining 75% of
individually-detected galaxies. Galaxies without individual detections at
24micron were not well-detected at 70micron and 160micron even through
stacking. We find that the average IR SEDs of z~0.7 star-forming galaxies fall
within the diversity of z~0 templates. While dust obscuration Lir/Luv seems to
be only a function of star formation rate (SFR; ~ Lir+Luv), not of redshift,
the dust temperature of star-forming galaxies (with SFR ~ 10 solar mass per
year) at a given IR luminosity was lower at z~0.7 than today. We suggest an
interpretation of this phenomenology in terms of dust geometry: intensely
star-forming galaxies at z~0 are typically interacting, and host dense
centrally-concentrated bursts of star formation and warm dust temperatures. At
z~0.7, the bulk of intensely star-forming galaxies are relatively undisturbed
spirals and irregulars, and we postulate that they have large amounts of
widespread lower-density star formation, yielding lower dust temperatures for a
given IR luminosity. We recommend what IR SEDs are most suitable for modeling
intermediate redshift galaxies with different SFRs.
