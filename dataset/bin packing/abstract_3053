It is shown how traditional development of theories of fluids based upon the
concept of physical clustering can be adapted to an alternative local
clustering definition. The alternative definition can preserve a detailed
valence description of the interactions between a solution species and its
near-neighbors, i.e., cooperativity and saturation of coordination for strong
association. These clusters remain finite even for condensed phases. The
simplest theory to which these developments lead is analogous to quasi-chemical
theories of cooperative phenomena. The present quasi-chemical theories require
additional consideration of packing issues because they don't impose lattice
discretizations on the continuous problem. These quasi-chemical theories do not
require pair decomposable interaction potential energy models. Since
calculations may be required only for moderately sized clusters, we suggest
that these quasi-chemical theories could be implemented with computational
tools of current electronic structure theory. This can avoid an intermediate
step of approximate force field generation.
