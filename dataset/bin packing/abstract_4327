We study the holographic non-relativistic fermions in the presence of bulk
dipole coupling in charged dilatonic black hole background. We explore the
nontrivial effects of the bulk dipole coupling, the fermion charge as well as
the dilaton field on the flat band, the Fermi surface and the emergence of the
gap by investigating the spectral function of the non-relativistic fermion
system. In particular, we find that the presence of the flat band in the
non-relativistic case will suppress the Fermi momentum. Besides, we observe
that the effect of the dipole coupling in the dilaton gravity is more explicit.
Finally, we consider the non-relativistic fermions at nonzero temperature. A
phase transition from insulator to a conducting state is observed as the
fermion system becomes hotter.
