We compute the renormalization of the complete CKM matrix in the MSbar scheme
and perform a renormalization group analysis of the CKM parameters. The
calculation is simplified by studying only the Higgs sector, which for the
\beta-function of the CKM matrix is at one loop the same as in the full
Standard Model. The renormalization group flow including QCD corrections can be
computed analytically using the hierarchy of the CKM parameters and the large
mass differences between the quarks. While the evolution of the Cabibbo angle
is tiny V_{ub} and V_{cb} increase sizably. We compare our results with the
ones in the full Standard Model.
