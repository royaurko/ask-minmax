We present new results regarding the companion mass-ratio distribution (CMRD)
of stars, as a follow-up of our previous work. We used a
maximum-likelihood-estimation method to re-derive the field CMRD power law
avoiding dependence on the arbitrary binning. We also considered two new
surveys of multiples in the field for solar-type stars and M dwarfs to test the
universality of the CMRD. We found no significant differences in the CMRD for M
dwarfs and solar-type stars compared with previous results over the common mass
ratio and separation range. The new best-fit power law of the CMRD in the
field, combining two previous sets of data, is $dN/dq \propto q^{\beta}$, with
$\beta=0.25\pm0.29$.
