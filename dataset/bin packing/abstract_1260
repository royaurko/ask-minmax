A classical theorem of Minkowski and Hlawka states that there exists a
lattice in R^n with packing density at least 2^{1-n}. Buser and Sarnak proved
the analogue of this result in the context of complex abelian varieties. Here
we give an improvement of this analogue; this shows a conjecture of Muetzel.
