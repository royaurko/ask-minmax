Collections of time- and frequency-shifts of suitably chosen generators
(Alltop or random vectors) proved successful for many applications in sparse
recovery and related fields. It was shown in \cite{xia2005achieving} that
taking a characteristic function of a difference set as a generator, and
considering only the frequency shifts, gives an equaingular tight frame for the
subspace they span. In this paper, we investigate the system of all $N^2$ time-
and frequency-shifts of a difference set in dimension $N$ via the mutual
coherence, and compare numerically its sparse recovery effectiveness with
Alltop and random generators. We further view this Gabor system as a fusion
frame, show that it is optimally sparse, and moreover an equidistant tight
fusion frame, i.e. it is an optimal Grassmannian packing.
