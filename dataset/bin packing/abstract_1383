A free-energy functional that contains both the symmetry conserved and
symmetry broken parts of the direct pair correlation function has been used to
investigate the freezing of a system of hard spheres into crystalline and
amorphous structures. The freezing parameters for fluid-crystal transition have
been found to be in very good agreement with the results found from
simulations. We considered amorphous structures found from the molecular
dynamics simulations at packing fractions $\eta$ lower than the glass close
packing fraction $\eta_{J}$ and investigated their stability compared to that
of a homogeneous fluid. The existence of free-energy minimum corresponding to a
density distribution of overlapping Gaussians centered around an amorphous
lattice depicts the deeply supercooled state with a heterogeneous density
profile.
