A Hamiltonian cycle of a graph is a closed path that visits every vertex once
and only once. It serves as a model of a compact polymer on a lattice. I study
the number of Hamiltonian cycles, or equivalently the entropy of a compact
polymer, on various lattices that are not homogeneous but with a sublattice
structure. Estimates for the number are obtained by two methods. One is the
saddle point approximation for a field theoretic representation. The other is
the numerical diagonalization of the transfer matrix of a fully packed loop
model in the zero fugacity limit. In the latter method, several scaling
exponents are also obtained.
