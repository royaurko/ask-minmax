We use a series of molecular dynamics simulations, and analytical theory, to
demonstrate that a system of hard spheres confined to a narrow cylindrical
channel exhibits a continuous phase transition from an isotropic fluid at low
densities, to an orientationally ordered, but translationally disordered,
helical fluid at high densities. The ordered fluid phase contains small
sections of helix separated by topological defects that change the direction of
the twist, altering the local chirailty. The defects break up the translational
order, but the fluid develops long range orientational order. An analysis of
the particle packings show that the length separation between defects controls
the geometrical properties of the helical sections, including the orientation,
and that pairs of defects experience a weak, but long range attraction
resulting from entropic free volumes effects. These collective long range
interactions overcome the restrictions on quasi-one-dimensional transitions,
even though the particle-particle interaction is short ranged.
