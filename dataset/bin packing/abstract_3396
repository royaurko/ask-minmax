Bounds on the reliability function for the discrete memoryless relay channel
are derived using the method of types. Two achievable error exponents are
derived based on partial decode-forward and compress-forward which are
well-known superposition block-Markov coding schemes. The derivations require
combinations of the techniques involved in the proofs of
Csisz\'ar-K\"orner-Marton's packing lemma for the error exponent of channel
coding and Marton's type covering lemma for the error exponent of source coding
with a fidelity criterion. The decode-forward error exponent is evaluated on
Sato's relay channel. From this example, it is noted that to obtain the fastest
possible decay in the error probability for a fixed effective coding rate, one
ought to optimize the number of blocks in the block-Markov coding scheme
assuming the blocklength within each block is large. An upper bound on the
reliability function is also derived using ideas from Haroutunian's lower bound
on the error probability for point-to-point channel coding with feedback.
