We investigate charmonium production in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC beam energy
$E_{\text {lab}}$=2.76 A TeV at fixed-target experiment ($\sqrt
{s_{\text{NN}}}$=72 GeV). In the frame of a transport approach including cold
and hot nuclear matter effects on charmonium evolution, we focus on the
anti-shadowing effect on the nuclear modification factors $R_{AA}$ and $r_{AA}$
for the $J/\psi$ yield and transverse momentum. The yield is more suppressed at
less forward rapidity ($y_\text{lab}\simeq$2) than that at very forward
rapidity ($y_\text{lab}\simeq$4) due to the shadowing and anti-shadowing in
different rapidity bins.
