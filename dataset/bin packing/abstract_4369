We present new estimates on the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy of a
type-II superconductor in an applied magnetic field varying between the second
and third critical fields. In this regime, superconductivity is restricted to a
thin layer along the boundary of the sample. We provide new energy lower
bounds, proving that the Ginzburg-Landau energy is determined to leading order
by the minimization of a simplified 1D functional in the direction
perpendicular to the boundary. Estimates relating the density of the
Ginzburg-Landau order parameter to that of the 1D problem follow. In the
particular case of a disc sample, a refinement of our method leads to a
pointwise estimate on the Ginzburg-Landau order parameter, thereby proving a
strong form of uniformity of the surface superconductivity layer, related to a
conjecture by Xing-Bin Pan.
