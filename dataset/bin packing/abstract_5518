We discuss the design, operation, and performance of a vacuum setup
constructed for use in zero (or reduced) gravity conditions to initiate
collisions of fragile millimeter-sized particles at low velocity and
temperature. Such particles are typically found in many astronomical settings
and in regions of planet formation. The instrument has participated in four
parabolic flight campaigns to date, operating for a total of 2.4 hours in
reduced gravity conditions and successfully recording over 300 separate
collisions of loosely packed dust aggregates and ice samples. The imparted
particle velocities achieved range from 0.03-0.28 m s^-1 and a high-speed,
high-resolution camera captures the events at 107 frames per second from two
viewing angles separated by either 48.8 or 60.0 degrees. The particles can be
stored inside the experiment vacuum chamber at temperatures of 80-300 K for
several uninterrupted hours using a built-in thermal accumulation system. The
copper structure allows cooling down to cryogenic temperatures before
commencement of the experiments. Throughout the parabolic flight campaigns,
add-ons and modifications have been made, illustrating the instrument
flexibility in the study of small particle collisions.
