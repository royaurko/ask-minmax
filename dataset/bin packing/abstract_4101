Three-receiver broadcast channel (BC) is of interest due to its information
theoretical differences with two receiver one. In this paper, we derive
achievable rate regions for two classes of 3-receiver BC with side information
available at the transmitter, Multilevel BC and 3-receiver less noisy BC, by
using superposition coding, Gel'fand-Pinsker binning scheme and Nair-El Gamal
indirect decoding. Our rate region for multilevel BC subsumes the Steinberg
rate region for 2-receiver degraded BC with side information as its special
case. We also find the capacity region of 3-receiver less noisy BC when side
information is available both at the transmitter and at the receivers.
