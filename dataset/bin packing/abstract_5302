We present a mathematical method to statistically decouple the effects of
unknown inclination angles on the mass distribution of exoplanets that have
been discovered using radial-velocity techniques. The method is based on the
distribution of the product of two random variables. Thus, if one assumes a
true mass distribution, the method makes it possible to recover the observed
distribution. We compare our prediction with available radial-velocity data.
Assuming the true mass function is described by a power-law, the minimum mass
function that we recover proves a good fit to the observed distribution at both
mass ends. In particular, it provides an alternative explanation for the
observed low-mass decline, usually explained as sample incompleteness. In
addition, the peak observed near the the low-mass end arises naturally in the
predicted distribution as a consequence of imposing a low-mass cutoff in the
true-distribution. If the low-mass bins below 0.02 M_J are complete, then the
mass distribution in this regime is heavily affected by the small fraction of
lowly inclined interlopers that are actually more massive companions. Finally,
we also present evidence that the exoplanet mass distribution changes form
towards low-mass, implying that a single power law may not adequately describe
the sample population.
