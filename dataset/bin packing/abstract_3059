Recent studies of DNA sequence of letters A, C, G and T exhibit the inverse
power law form frequency spectrum. Inverse power-law form of the power spectra
of fractal space-time fluctuations is generic to the dynamical systems in
nature and is identified as self-organized criticality. In this study it is
shown that the power spectra of the frequency distributions of bases C+G in the
Human chromosome X DNA exhibit self-organized criticality. DNA is a
quasicrystal possessing maximum packing efficiency in a hierarchy of spirals or
loops. Self-organized criticality implies that non-coding introns may not be
redundant, but serve to organize the effective functioning of the coding exons
in the DNA molecule as a complete unit.
