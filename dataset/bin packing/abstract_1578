A coupled array of $N$ identical cavities, each of which contains a
five-level atom is investigated. The results show that the atoms via the
exchange of virtual photons can be effectively equal to spin 1 Heisenberg model
under certain conditions. By tuning the laser fields, the parameters of the
effective Hamiltonian can be controlled individually.
