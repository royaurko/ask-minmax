We studied the massive scalar wave propagation in the background of
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole by using numerical simulations. We learned
that the value $Mm$ plays an important role in determining the properties of
the relaxation of the perturbation. For $Mm << 1$ the relaxation process
depends only on the field parameter and does not depend on the spacetime
parameters. For $Mm >> 1$, the dependence of the relaxation on the black hole
parameters appears. The bigger mass of the black hole, the faster the
perturbation decays. The difference of the relaxation process caused by the
black hole charge $Q$ has also been exhibited.
