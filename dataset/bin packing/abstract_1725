We investigate the complexity of integration and derivative for multivariate
polynomials in the standard computation model. The integration is in the unit
cube $[0,1]^d$ for a multivariate polynomial, which has format $f(x_1,\cdots,
x_d)=p_1(x_1,\cdots, x_d)p_2(x_1,\cdots, x_d)\cdots p_k(x_1,\cdots, x_d)$,
where each $p_i(x_1,\cdots, x_d)=\sum_{j=1}^d q_j(x_j)$ with all single
variable polynomials $q_j(x_j)$ of degree at most two and constant
coefficients. We show that there is no any factor polynomial time approximation
for the integration $\int_{[0,1]^d}f(x_1,\cdots,x_d)d_{x_1}\cdots d_{x_d}$
unless $P=NP$. For the complexity of multivariate derivative, we consider the
functions with the format $f(x_1,\cdots, x_d)=p_1(x_1,\cdots,
x_d)p_2(x_1,\cdots, x_d)\cdots p_k(x_1,\cdots, x_d),$ where each
$p_i(x_1,\cdots, x_d)$ is of degree at most $2$ and $0,1$ coefficients. We also
show that unless $P=NP$, there is no any factor polynomial time approximation
to its derivative ${\partial f^{(d)}(x_1,\cdots, x_d)\over \partial x_1\cdots
\partial x_d}$ at the origin point $(x_1,\cdots, x_d)=(0,\cdots,0)$. Our
results show that the derivative may not be easier than the integration in high
dimension. We also give some tractable cases of high dimension integration and
derivative.
