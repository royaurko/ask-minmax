We decorate the square lattice with two species of polygons under the
constraint that every lattice edge is covered by only one polygon and every
vertex is visited by both types of polygons. We end up with a 24 vertex model
which is known in the literature as the fully packed double loop model. In the
particular case in which the fugacities of the polygons are the same, the model
admits an exact solution. The solution is obtained using coordinate Bethe
ansatz and provides a closed expression for the free energy. In particular we
find the free energy of the four colorings model and the double Hamiltonian
walk and recover the known entropy of the Ice model. When both fugacities are
set equal to two the model undergoes an infinite order phase transition.
