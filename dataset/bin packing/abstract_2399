Three-loop QCD corrections to the vector current correlator are considered.
The large momentum procedure is applied in order to evaluate mass corrections
up to order $(m^2/q^2)^6$. The inclusion of the first seven terms to the ratio
$R=\sigma(e^+e^- \to hadrons)/\sigma(e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-)$ leads to reliable
predictions from the high energy region down to relatively close to threshold.
