A powerful mathematical method for front instability analysis that was
recently developed in the field of nonlinear dynamics is applied to the 1+1
(spatial and time) dimensional Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. From the
essential spectrum of the LLG equation, it is shown that the famous Walker
rigid body propagating domain wall (DW) is not stable against the spin wave
emission. In the low field region only stern spin waves are emitted while both
stern and bow waves are generated under high fields. By using the properties of
the absolute spectrum of the LLG equation, it is concluded that in a high
enough field, but below the Walker breakdown field, the Walker solution could
be convective/absolute unstable if the transverse magnetic anisotropy is larger
than a critical value, corresponding to a significant modification of the DW
profile and DW propagating speed. Since the Walker solution of 1+1 dimensional
LLG equation can be realized in experiments, our results could be also used to
test the mathematical method in a controlled manner.
