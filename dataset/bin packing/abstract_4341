We investigated the dependence of spectral lag on energy band based on 28
bright GRBs detected by the SPI and IBIS/ISGRI instruments on the INTEGRAL
observatory. It is found that for simple structured bursts or well separated
pulses of multi-pulse bursts the spectral lag can be approximated by the
relation t=Alog(E), where A is a positive parameter, which correlates with
pulse duration. We have not found any negative lag in simple structured bursts
or in well separated pulses. While investigating the time profile of the whole
burst negative lag may appear due to different spectral parameters of the
pulses.
