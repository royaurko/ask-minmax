The Cold Spot on the Cosmic Microwave Background could arise due to a
supervoid at low redshift through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We imaged
the region with MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope and present
galaxy counts in photometric redshift bins. We rule out the existence of a
100Mpc radius spherical supervoid with underdensity delta=-0.3 at 0.5<z<0.9 at
high significance. The data are consistent with an underdensity at low
redshift, but the fluctuations are within the range of cosmic variance and the
low density areas are not contiguous on the sky. Thus, we find no strong
evidence for a supervoid. We cannot resolve voids smaller than 50Mpc radius;
however, these can only make a minor contribution to the CMB temperature
decrement.
