With the early afterglow localizations of gamma-ray burst positions made by
Swift, the clear delimitation of the prompt phase and the afterglow is not so
obvious any more. It is important to see weather the two phases have the same
origin or they stem from different parts of the progenitor system. We will
combine the two kinds of gamma-ray burst data from the Swift-XRT instrument
(windowed timing and photon counting modes) and from BAT. A thorough desription
of the applied procedure is given. We apply various binning techniques to the
different data: Bayes blocks, exponential binning and signal-to-noise type of
binning. We present a handful of flux curves and some possible applications.
