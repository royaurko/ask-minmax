The electrical properties of a two-dimensional packing of metallic beads are
studied. Small mechanical perturbations of the packing leads to giant
electrical fluctuations. Fluctuations are found to be non-gaussian and seem to
belong to Levy stable distributions. Anticorrelations have been also found for
the sign of these fluctuations.
