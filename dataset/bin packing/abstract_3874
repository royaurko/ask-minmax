We have reexamined the holographic dark energy model by considering the
spatial curvature. We have refined the model parameter and observed that the
holographic dark energy model does not behave as phantom model. Comparing the
holographic dark energy model to the supernova observation alone, we found that
the closed universe is favored. Combining with the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, we obtained the reasonable value of the spatial
curvature of our universe.
