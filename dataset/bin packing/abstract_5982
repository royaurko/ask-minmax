New data on the polarization observables T, P, and H for the reaction $\gamma
p \to p\pi^0$ are reported. The results are extracted from azimuthal
asymmetries when a transversely polarized butanol target and a linearly
polarized photon beam are used. The data were taken at the Bonn electron
stretcher accelerator ELSA using the CBELSA/TAPS detector. These and earlier
data are used to perform a truncated energy-independent partial wave analysis
in sliced-energy bins. This energy-independent analysis is compared to the
results from energy-dependent partial wave analyses.
