We present an experimental study of the deformation inside a granular
material that is progressively tilted. We investigate the deformation before
the avalanche with a spatially resolved Diffusive Wave Spectroscopy setup. At
the beginning of the inclination process, we first observe localized and
isolated events in the bulk, with a density which decreases with the depth. As
the angle of inclination increases, series of micro-failures occur periodically
in the bulk, and finally a granular avalanche takes place. The micro-failures
are observed only when the tilt angles are larger than a threshold angle much
smaller than the granular avalanche angle. We have characterized the density of
reorganizations and the localization of micro-failures. We have also explored
the effect of the nature of the grains, the relative humidity conditions and
the packing fraction of the sample. We discuss those observations in the
framework of the plasticity of granular matter. Micro-failures may then be
viewed as the result of the accumulation of numerous plastic events.
