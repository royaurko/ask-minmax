We derive uncertainty relation inequalities according to the mutually
unbiased measurements. Based on the calculation of the index of coincidence of
probability distribution given by $d+1$ MUMs on any density operator $\rho$ in
$\mathbb{C}^{d}$, both state-dependent and state-independent forms of lower
entropic bounds are given. Furthermore, we formulate uncertainty relations for
MUMs in terms of R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies.
