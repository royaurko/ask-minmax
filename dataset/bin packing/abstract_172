The transition from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) granular
packings is studied using large-scale discrete element computer simulations. We
focus on vertical stress profiles and examine how they change with
dimensionality from 2D to 3D. We compare results for packings in 2D, quasi-2D
packings between flat plates, and 3D packings. Analysis of these packings
suggests that the Janssen theory does not fully describe these packings,
especially at the top of the piles, where a hydrostatic-like region of vertical
stress is visible in all cases. We find that the interior of the packing is far
from incipient failure, while in general, the forces at the walls are close to
incipient failure.
