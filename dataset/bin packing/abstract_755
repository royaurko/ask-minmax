The channel size distribution in hard sphere systems, based on the local
neighbor correlation of four particle positions, is investigated for all volume
fractions up to jamming. For each particle, all three particle combinations of
neighbors define channels, which are relevant for the concept of caging. The
analysis of the channel size distribution is shown to be very useful in
distinguishing between gaseous, liquid, partially and fully crystallized, and
glassy (random) jammed states. A common microstructural feature of four
coplanar particles is observed in crystalline and glassy jammed states,
suggesting the presence of "hidden" two-dimensional order in three-dimensional
random close packings.
