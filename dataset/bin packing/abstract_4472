We consider a holographic fermionic system in which the fermions are
interacting with a U(1) gauge field in the presence of a dilaton field in a
gravity bulk of a charged black hole with hyperscaling violation. Using both
analytical and numerical methods, we investigate the properties of the infrared
and ultaviolet Green's functions of the holographic fermionic system. Studying
the spectral functions of the system, we find that as the hyperscaling
violation exponent is varied, the fermionic system possesses Fermi, non-Fermi,
marginal-Fermi and log-oscillating liquid phases. Various liquid phases of the
fermionic system with hyperscaling violation are also generated with the
variation of the fermionic mass. We also explore the properties of the flat
band and the Fermi surface of the non-relativistic fermionic fixed point dual
to the hyperscaling violation gravity.
