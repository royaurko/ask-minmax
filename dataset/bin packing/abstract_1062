We study general models for holographic superconductors in
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We find that different values of Gauss-Bonnet
correction term and model parameters can determine the order of phase
transitions and critical exponents of second-order phase transitions. Moreover
we find that the size and strength of the conductivity coherence peak can be
controlled. The ratios $\omega_g/Tc$ for various model parameters have also
been examined.
