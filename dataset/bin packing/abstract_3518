Disks moving in a narrow channel have many features in common with the glassy
behavior of hard spheres in three dimensions. In this paper we study the caging
behavior of the disks which sets in at characteristic packing fraction
$\phi_d$. Four-point overlap functions similar to those studied when
investigating dynamical heterogeneities have been determined from event driven
molecular dynamics simulations and the time dependent dynamical length scale
extracted. It increases with time and on the equilibration time scale is
proportional to the static length scale associated with the zigzag ordering in
the system, which grows rapidly above $\phi_d$. The structural features
responsible for the onset of caging and the glassy behavior are easy to
identify as they show up in the structure factor, which we have determined
exactly from the transfer matrix approach.
