We report observations of type III radio bursts at decimeter wavelengths
(type IIIdm bursts) -- signatures of suprathermal electron beams propagating in
the low corona -- using the new technique of radio dynamic imaging spectroscopy
provided by the recently upgraded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). For
the first time, type IIIdm bursts were imaged with high time and frequency
resolution over a broad frequency band, allowing electron beam trajectories in
the corona to be deduced. Together with simultaneous hard X-ray (HXR) and
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, we show these beams emanate from an
energy release site located in the low corona at a height below ~15 Mm, and
propagate along a bundle of discrete magnetic loops upward into the corona. Our
observations enable direct measurements of the plasma density along the
magnetic loops, and allow us to constrain the diameter of these loops to be
less than 100 km. These over-dense and ultra-thin loops reveal the
fundamentally fibrous structure of the Sun's corona. The impulsive nature of
the electron beams, their accessibility to different magnetic field lines, and
the detailed structure of the magnetic release site revealed by the radio
observations indicate that the localized energy release is highly fragmentary
in time and space, supporting a bursty reconnection model that involves
secondary magnetic structures for magnetic energy release and particle
acceleration.
