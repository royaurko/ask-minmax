We investigate the validity the generalized second law of thermodynamics in a
general braneworld model with curvature correction terms on the brane and in
the bulk, respectively. Employing the derived entropy expression associated
with the apparent horizon, we examine the time evolution of the total entropy,
including the derived entropy of the apparent horizon and the entropy of the
matter fields inside the apparent horizon. We show that the generalized second
law of thermodynamics is fulfilled on the 3-brane embedded in the 5D spacetime
with curvature corrections.
