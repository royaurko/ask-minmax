Using fast off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations with experimentally accessible
fluctuations, we report the first systematic study unambiguously quantifying
the shift of the order-disorder transition (ODT) $\chi^*$ of symmetric diblock
copolymers from the mean-field prediction $\chi^*_{\rm MF}$. Our simulations
are performed in a canonical ensemble with variable box lengths to eliminate
the restriction of periodic boundary conditions on the lamellar period. Exactly
the same model system (Hamiltonian) is used in both our simulations and
mean-field theory; the ODT shift is therefore due to the
fluctuations/correlations neglected by the latter. While $\chi^* / \chi^*_{\rm
MF} - 1 \propto \bar{\mathcal{N}}^{-k}$ is found with $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$
denoting the invariant degree of polymerization, $k$ decreases around the
$\bar{\mathcal{N}}$-value corresponding to the close packing of polymer
segments as hard spheres, indicating the short-range correlation effects.
