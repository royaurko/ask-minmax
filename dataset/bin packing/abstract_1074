In this paper we study fast iterative solvers for the large sparse linear
systems resulting from the stochastic Galerkin discretization of stochastic
partial differential equations. A block triangular preconditioner is introduced
and applied to the Krylov subspace methods, including the generalized minimum
residual method and the generalized preconditioned conjugate gradient method.
This preconditioner utilizes the special structures of the stochastic Galerkin
matrices to achieve high efficiency. Spectral bounds for the preconditioned
matrix are provided for convergence analysis. The preconditioner system can be
solved approximately by geometric multigrid V-cycle. Numerical results indicate
that the block triangular preconditioner has better performance than the
traditional block diagonal preconditioner for stochastic problems with large
variance.
