The effect of dipolar interactions in hexagonal arrays of Ni nanowires has
been investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations combined with a scaling
technique, which allows the investigation of the internal structure of the
wires. A strong dependence of the coercivity and remanence on the distance
between wires has been observed. At intermediate packing densities the
coercivity exhibits a maximum, higher than the non-interacting value. This
behavior, experimentally observed, has been explained on grounds of the
interwire dipolar interactions. Also, different reversal modes of the
magnetization have been identified.
