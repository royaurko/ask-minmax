We propose a scheme to engineer Schr\"{o}dinger-cat states of propagating
optical pulses. Multi-dimensional and multi-partite cat states can be generated
simply by reflecting coherent optical pulses successively from a single-atom
cavity. The influences of various sources of noise, including the atomic
spontaneous emission and the pulse shape distortion, are characterized through
detailed numerical simulation, which demonstrates practicality of this scheme
within the reach of current experimental technology.
