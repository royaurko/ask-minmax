We prove a lower bound on the eigenvalues $\lambda_k$, $k\in\mathbb{N}$, of
the Dirichlet Laplacian of a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of
volume $V$: $$ \lambda_k \geq C_n\bigg( \delta\frac{k}{V}\bigg)^{2/n} $$ where
$\delta$ is a constant that measures how efficiently $\Omega$ can be packed
into $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $C_n$ is the constant found in Weyl's law.
  If $\delta^{2/n} > n/(n+2)$, this bound is stronger than the eigenvalue bound
proven by Li and Yau in 1983. For example, in the case of convex planar
domains, we have for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $$ \lambda_k \geq \frac{2\sqrt{3}\pi
k}{V}. $$
