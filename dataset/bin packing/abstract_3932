The question of how to validate and interpret correctly the waiting time
probability density functions (WT-PDFs) from single molecule data is addressed.
It is shown by simulation that when a stretched exponential WT-PDF, with a
stretched exponent alfa and a time scale parameter tau, generates the off
periods of a two-state trajectory, a reliable recovery of the input WT-PDF from
the trajectory is obtained even when the bin size used to define the
trajectory, dt, is much larger than the parameter tau. This holds true as long
as the first moment of the WT-PDF is much larger than dt. Our results validate
the results in an earlier study of the activity of single Lipase B molecules
and disprove recent related critique.
