When a ball is dropped in fine, very loose sand, a splash and subsequently a
jet are ob- served above the bed, followed by a granular eruption. To directly
and quantitatively determine what happens inside the sand bed, high-speed X-ray
tomography measurements are carried out in a custom-made setup that allows for
imaging of a large sand bed at atmospheric pressures. Herewith we show that the
jet originates from the pinch-off point created by the collapse of the air
cavity formed behind the penetrating ball.Subsequently we measure how the
entrapped air bubble rises through the sand and show that this is consistent
with bubbles rising in continuously fluidized beds. Finally, we measure the
packing fraction variation throughout the bed. From this we show that there is
(i) a compressed area of sand in front of and next to the ball while the ball
is moving down, (ii) a strongly compacted region at the pinch-off height after
the cavity collapse; and (iii) a relatively loosely packed center in the wake
of the rising bubble.
