The genuine twist-3 quark-gluon contributions to the Generalized Parton
Distributions (GPDs) are estimated in the model of the instanton vacuum. These
twist-3 effects are found to be parametrically suppressed relative to the
``kinematical'' twist-3 ones due to the small packing fraction of the instanton
vacuum. We derive exact sum rules for the twist-3 GPDs.
