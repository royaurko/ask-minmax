Consider the equations of Navier-Stokes in $\R^3$ in the rotational setting,
i.e. with Coriolis force. It is shown that this set of equations admits a
unique, global mild solution provided the initial data is small with respect to
the norm the Fourier-Besov space $\dot{FB}_{p,r}^{2-3/p}(\R^3)$, where $p \in
(1,\infty]$ and $r \in [1,\infty]$.
  In the two-dimensional setting, a unique, global mild solution to this set of
equations exists for {\em non-small} initial data $u_0 \in L^p_\sigma(\R^2)$
for $p \in [2,\infty)$.
