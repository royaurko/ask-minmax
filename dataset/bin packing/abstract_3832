DISASTER++ is a C++ class library for the calculation of (1+1) and
(2+1)-jet-like quantities in deeply inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering for
one-photon exchange in next-to-leading-order QCD perturbation theory. The
calculation is based on the subtraction formalism. The user has access to an
event record such that an arbitrary set of infrared-safe observables can be
calculated in a single run. Compared to other existing universal programs, the
full dependence on the number of flavours and on the renormalization and
factorization scales is made explicit. An interface class providing a simple
interface from C++ to existing FORTRAN programs is available. In a preliminary
study DISASTER++ is compared to two other programs for various bins of the
lepton variables $x_B$ and $y$, where a particular emphasis is put on different
behaviours for $\xi \to 1$ of the parton densities $f(\xi)$. We find good
agreement of DISASTER++ and DISENT (Version 0.1). The comparison of DISASTER++
and MEPJET (Version 2.0) leads to several discrepancies.
