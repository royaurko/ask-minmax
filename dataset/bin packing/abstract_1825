We propose an action to describe high spin topologically massive gravity with
a negative cosmological constant. With the frame-like fields and spin
connections being combined into two gauge fields, the action includes two gauge
field Chern-Simons actions with different levels, and also a linear term
proportional to the difference of the gauge field strengths. Such linear term
play the role of imposing the torsion free conditions for high spin fields. We
discuss the gauge symmetry of this action and study the fluctuations around the
AdS$_3$ vacuum. We show how to relate the the fluctuations of the gauge field
to the Frondal fields, using the gauge symmetry. For the gauge group
$SL(n,R)\times SL(n,R)$, we find that the fluctuations of all high spin fields
up to spin $n$ satisfy third order differential equations, and hence there
generically exist massive traceless and trace mode for every spin.
