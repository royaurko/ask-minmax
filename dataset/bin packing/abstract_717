We experimentally probe the vicinity of the jamming point J, located at a
density $\phi$ corresponding to random close packing ($\phi_{rcp} = 0.842$), in
two dimensional, bidisperse packings of foam bubbles. We vary the density of
the foam layer and extract geometrical measures by image analysis. We confirm
the predicted scaling of the average contact number Z with $\phi$ and compare
the distribution of local contact numbers to a simple model. We further
establish that the distribution of areas $p(A)$ strongly depends on $\phi$.
Finally, we find that the distribution of contact forces $p(f)$ systematically
varies with density.
