We study the impact of systematic errors on planned weak lensing surveys and
compute the requirements on their contributions so that they are not a dominant
source of the cosmological parameter error budget. The generic types of error
we consider are multiplicative and additive errors in measurements of shear, as
well as photometric redshift errors. In general, more powerful surveys have
stronger systematic requirements. For example, for a SNAP-type survey the
multiplicative error in shear needs to be smaller than 1%(fsky/0.025)^{-1/2} of
the mean shear in any given redshift bin, while the centroids of photometric
redshift bins need to be known to better than 0.003(fsky/0.025)^{-1/2}. With
about a factor of two degradation in cosmological parameter errors, future
surveys can enter a self-calibration regime, where the mean systematic biases
are self-consistently determined from the survey and only higher-order moments
of the systematics contribute. Interestingly, once the power spectrum
measurements are combined with the bispectrum, the self-calibration regime in
the variation of the equation of state of dark energy w_a is attained with only
a 20-30% error degradation.
