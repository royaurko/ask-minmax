We propose the description of the granular matter which is based on
distribution of dry friction coefficients. Using such a concept and a simple
one-dimensional packing of grains we solve the silo problem. The friction
coefficients at contacts are determined both by geometry of packing
configuration and the stress distribution in a medium. Within such an approach
the Janssen coefficient is determined and its dependence on the
particle-particle and boundary-particle friction coefficients is obtained. Also
we investigate the conditions for the appearance of the maximum in the pressure
distribution with the depth with overweight on top. As an outcome of our work
we propose the general framework to the description of the granular matter as a
continual medium which is characterized by the field of the dry friction
tensor.
