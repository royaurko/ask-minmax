We study sequential programs that are instruction sequences with direct and
indirect jump instructions. The intuition is that indirect jump instructions
are jump instructions where the position of the instruction to jump to is the
content of some memory cell. We consider several kinds of indirect jump
instructions. For each kind, we define the meaning of programs with indirect
jump instructions of that kind by means of a translation into programs without
indirect jump instructions. For each kind, the intended behaviour of a program
with indirect jump instructions of that kind under execution is the behaviour
of the translated program under execution on interaction with some memory
device.
