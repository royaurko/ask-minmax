We study the spin photogalvanic effect in two-dimensional electron system
with structure inversion asymmetry by means of the solution of semiconductor
optical Bloch equations. It is shown that a linearly polarized light may inject
a pure spin current in spin-splitting conduction bands due to Rashba spin-orbit
coupling, while a circularly polarized light may inject spin-dependent
photocurrent. We establish an explicit relation between the photocurrent by
oblique incidence of a circularly polarized light and the pure spin current by
normal incidence of a linearly polarized light such that we can deduce the
amplitude of spin current from the measured spin photocurrent experimentally.
This method may provide a source of spin current to study spin transport in
semiconductors quantitatively.
