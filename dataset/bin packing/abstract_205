Colloidal particles absorbed at the interface of a liquid droplet arrange
into unique packings during slow evaporation (Manoharan et al. Science 301 pp
483-487). We present a numerical and theoretical analysis of the packing
selection problem. The selection of a unique packing arises almost entirely
from geometrical constraints during the drying.
