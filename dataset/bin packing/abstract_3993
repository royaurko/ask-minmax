The complex wave representation (CWR) converts unsigned 2D distance
transforms into their corresponding wave functions. Here, the distance
transform S(X) appears as the phase of the wave function
\phi(X)---specifically, \phi(X)=exp(iS(X)/\tau where \tau is a free parameter.
In this work, we prove a novel result using the higher-order stationary phase
approximation: we show convergence of the normalized power spectrum (squared
magnitude of the Fourier transform) of the wave function to the density
function of the distance transform gradients as the free parameter \tau-->0. In
colloquial terms, spatial frequencies are gradient histogram bins. Since the
distance transform gradients have only orientation information (as their
magnitudes are identically equal to one almost everywhere), as \tau-->0, the 2D
Fourier transform values mainly lie on the unit circle in the spatial frequency
domain. The proof of the result involves standard integration techniques and
requires proper ordering of limits. Our mathematical relation indicates that
the CWR of distance transforms is an intriguing, new representation.
