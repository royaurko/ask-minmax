We have used the dynamically constrained phase space coalescence model to
investigate the centrality dependence of light (anti)nuclei and
(anti)hypertriton production based on the $6.2\times 10^7$ hadronic final
states generated by the PACIAE model in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=200$ GeV in $|y| <1$ and $p_T<5$ acceptances. It turned out
that the yields of light (anti)nuclei and (anti)hypertriton strongly depend on
the centrality, i.e. their yields decrease rapidly with the increase of
centrality bins; but their yield ratios are independent on centrality. These
theoretical results are consistent with the STAR and PHENIX data. Furthermore,
centrality distribution of $d$ ($\bar d$), $^3{He}$ ($^3{\bar{He}}$) and
$_{\bar\Lambda}^3H$ ($\bar{_{\bar\Lambda}^3H}$) follows Gaussian distributions.
This means that light (anti)nuclei and (anti)hypertriton are primarily produced
in the central collisions.
