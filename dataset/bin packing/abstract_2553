We show that the shuffle algebras for polylogarithms and regularized MZVs in
the sense of Ihara, Kaneko and Zagier are both free commutative nonunitary
Rota-Baxter algebras with one generator. We apply these results to show that
the full sets of shuffle relations of polylogarithms and regularized MZVs are
derived by a single series. We also take this approach to study the extended
double shuffle relations of MZVs by comparing these shuffle relations with the
quasi-shuffle relations of the regularized MZVs in our previous approach of
MZVs by renormalization.
