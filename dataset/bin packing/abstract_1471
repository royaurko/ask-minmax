We study some structural properties of Construction-A lattices obtained from
low density parity check (LDPC) codes over prime fields. Such lattices are
called low density Construction-A (LDA) lattices, and permit low-complexity
belief propagation decoding for transmission over Gaussian channels. It has
been shown that LDA lattices achieve the capacity of the power constrained AWGN
channel with closest lattice-point decoding, and simulations suggested that
they perform well under belief propagation decoding. We continue this line of
work, and prove that these lattices are good for packing and mean squared error
(MSE) quantization, and that their duals are good for packing. With this, we
can conclude that codes constructed using nested LDA lattices can achieve the
capacity of the AWGN channel, the capacity of the dirty paper channel, the
rates guaranteed by the compute-and-forward protocol, and the best known rates
for bidirectional relaying with perfect secrecy.
