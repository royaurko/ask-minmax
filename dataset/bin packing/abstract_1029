We study the quasinormal modes of scalar perturbation in the background of
five-dimensional charged Kaluza-Klein black holes with squashed horizons
immersed in the G\"{o}del universe. Besides the influence due to the
compactness of the extra dimension, we disclose the cosmological rotational
effect in the wave dynamics. The wave behavior affected by the G\"{o}del
parameter provides an interesting insight into the G\"{o}del universe.
