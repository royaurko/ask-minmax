The effects of different levels of maltose on feed pellet water stability and
nutrient leaching were studied. Five treatments, including control with three
replicates with setup (0.0, 20, 25, 30 and 35%). Pellet leaching rates were
used to indicate pellet water stability. The results show that the presence of
maltose in the diets significantly improved pellet water stability (p<0.05),
but the leaching rates of the feed (35% maltose) observed higher than other
feeds. Increased maltose resulted in the corresponding decrease in pellet
stability. The protein leaching rate of control feed and feed (20% maltose) was
significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the rates of other diets The lipid leaching
rate of control feed was lower than the rates of other diets, while the feed
(35% maltose) was more leaching rate. It improved feeds water stability is one
important reason why maltose enhances fish growth.
