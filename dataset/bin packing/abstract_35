We consider a memory allocation problem that can be modeled as a version of
bin packing where items may be split, but each bin may contain at most two
(parts of) items. A 3/2-approximation algorithm and an NP-hardness proof for
this problem was given by Chung et al. We give a simpler 3/2-approximation
algorithm for it which is in fact an online algorithm. This algorithm also has
good performance for the more general case where each bin may contain at most k
parts of items. We show that this general case is also strongly NP-hard.
Additionally, we give an efficient 7/5-approximation algorithm.
