Even the most sensitive cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiments
have signal to noise ratios <=5, so that an accurate determination of the
properties of the cosmological signal requires a careful assessment of the
experimental noise. Most of the experiments combine simultaneous multi-channel
observations in which the presence of correlated noise is likely. This case is
common for ground-based experiments in which an important fraction of the noise
could be atmospheric in origin. Here, the way to compute and determine the
effects produced by this correlated noise is discussed; in particular, the
paper considers the Tenerife experiments (three radiometers at 10, 15 and 33
GHz with two independent receivers each) showing how this effect has been
taking into account properly in the more recent analysis of these data. It will
be demonstrated that for each of the three radiometers of these experiments,
the atmospheric noise is equivalent to a Gaussian noise common to both channels
with a coherence time smaller than the binning time, the net effect being an
enhancement of the error-bars in the stacked scan as compared with the
estimation for the case of pure uncorrelated noise. As expected from the
spectral index of the atmosphere, the effect is more important at higher
frequencies. The formalism is generalized and applied to the general case of
simultaneous multi-channel observations.
