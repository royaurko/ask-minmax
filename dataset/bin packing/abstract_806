We study the phenomenon of internal avalanching within the context of
recently introduced lattice models of granular media. The avalanche is produced
by pulling out a grain at the base of the packing and studying how many grains
have to rearrange before the packing is once more stable. We find that the
avalanches are long-ranged, decaying as a power-law. We study the distriution
of avalanches as a function of the density of the packing and find that the
avalanche distribution is a very sensitive structural probe of the system.
