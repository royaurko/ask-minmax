To probe the effects of hydrogel particle additives on the water-accessible
pore structure of sandy soils, we introduce a custom pressure plate method in
which the volume of water expelled from a wet granular packing is measured as a
function of applied pressure. Using a capillary bundle model, we show that the
differential change in retained water per pressure increment is directly
related to the cumulative cross-sectional area distribution $f(r)$ of the
water-accessible pores with radii less than $r$. This is validated by
measurements of water expelled from a model sandy soil composed of 2 mm
diameter glass beads. In particular, the expelled water is found to depend
dramatically on sample height and that analysis using the capillary bundle
model gives the same pore size distribution for all samples. The distribution
is found to be approximately log-normal, and the total cross-sectional area
fraction of the accessible pore space is found to be $f_0=0.34$. We then report
on how the pore distribution and total water-accessible area fraction are
affected by superabsorbent hydrogel particle additives, uniformly mixed into a
fixed-height sample at varying concentrations. Under both fixed volume and free
swelling conditions, the total area fraction of water-accessible pore space in
a packing decreases exponentially as the gel concentration increases. The size
distribution of the pores is significantly modified by the swollen hydrogel
particles, such that large pores are clogged while small pores are formed.
