Mobility of taxol inside microtubules was investigated using fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) on flow-aligned bundles. Bundles were made
of microtubules with either GMPCPP or GTP at the exchangeable site on the
tubulin dimer. Recovery times were sensitive to bundle thickness and packing,
indicating that taxol molecules are able to move laterally through the bundle.
The density of open binding sites along a microtubule was varied by controlling
the concentration of taxol in solution for GMPCPP samples. With > 63% sites
occupied, recovery times were independent of taxol concentration and,
therefore, inversely proportional to the microscopic dissociation rate,
k_{off}. It was found that 10*k_{off} (GMPCPP) ~ k_{off} (GTP), consistent
with, but not fully accounting for, the difference in equilibrium constants for
taxol on GMPCPP and GTP microtubules. With < 63% sites occupied, recovery times
decreased as ~ [Tax]^{-1/5} for both types of microtubules. We conclude that
the diffusion of taxol along the microtubule interior is hindered by rebinding
events when open sites are within ~7 nm of each other.
