We present the first interferometric observation of a zebra-pattern radio
burst with simultaneous high spectral (~ 1 MHz) and high time (20 ms)
resolution. The Frequency-Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR) Subsystem Testbed
(FST) and the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA) were used in parallel to observe
the X1.5 flare on 14 December 2006. By using OVSA to calibrate the FST the
source position of the zebra pattern can be located on the solar disk. With the
help of multi-wavelength observations and a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)
extrapolation, the zebra source is explored in relation to the magnetic field
configuration. New constraints are placed on the source size and position as a
function of frequency and time. We conclude that the zebra burst is consistent
with a double-plasma resonance (DPR) model in which the radio emission occurs
in resonance layers where the upper hybrid frequency is harmonically related to
the electron cyclotron frequency in a coronal magnetic loop.
