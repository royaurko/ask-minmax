The effective linear and third-order nonlinear optical properties of metallic
colloidal crystal immersed in a graded-index host fluid are investigated
theoretically. The local electric fields are extracted self-consistently based
on the layer-to-layer interactions, which are readily given by the Lekner
summation method. The resultant optical absorption and nonlinearity enhancement
show a series of sharp peaks, which merge in a broadened resonant band. The
sharp peaks become a continuous band for increasing packing density and number
of layers. We believe that the sharp peaks arise from the in-plane dipolar
interactions and the surface plasmon resonance, whereas the continuous band is
due to the presence of the gradient in the host refractive index. These results
have not been observed in homogeneous and randomly-dispersed colloids, and thus
would be of great interest in optical nanomaterial engineering.
