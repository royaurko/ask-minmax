Periodic control systems used in spacecrafts and automotives are usually
period-driven and can be decomposed into different modes with each mode
representing a system state observed from outside. Such systems may also
involve intensive computing in their modes. Despite the fact that such control
systems are widely used in the above-mentioned safety-critical embedded
domains, there is lack of domain-specific formal modelling languages for such
systems in the relevant industry. To address this problem, we propose a formal
visual modeling framework called MDM as a concise and precise way to specify
and analyze such systems. To capture the temporal properties of periodic
control systems, we provide, along with MDM, a property specification language
based on interval logic for the description of concrete temporal requirements
the engineers are concerned with. The statistical model checking technique can
then be used to verify the MDM models against desired properties. To
demonstrate the viability of our approach, we have applied our modelling
framework to some real life case studies from industry and helped detect two
design defects for some spacecraft control systems.
