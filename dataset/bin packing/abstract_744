To elucidate the structure of assembly configuration spaces, the EASAL
software combines classical concepts, such as stratifications of semialgebraic
sets, with recent algorithms for efficiently realizing geometric constraint
systems, and theoretical advances concerning convex parametrization: in
contrast to folding configuration spaces, most regions of assembly and packing
configurations admit a convex parametrization. This allows for a novel,
efficient and intuitive representation of configuration spaces so that the
corresponding atlas can be efficiently generated and sampled. This paper
describes the approach, theory, structure and algorithms underlying EASAL and
outlines its use for generating atlases of dimeric assemblies of the AAV2 coat
protein, and alpha helix packing in transmembrane proteins.
