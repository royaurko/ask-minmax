We develop two further numerical tests of parton cascade models: the ideal
gas equation of state and the collision frequency tests. The equation of state
test checks the initial momentum distribution generator and free expansion
dynamics in periodic inhomogeneous geometries. The collision rate test is
sensitive to spatial inhomogeneities and the collision algorithm. These tests
are applied to the recently developed ZPC parton cascade model. The tests
helped uncover unphysical correlations induced by one of the commonly used
random number generators and showed the necessity of particle subdivisions for
convergence to the exact analytic limit.
