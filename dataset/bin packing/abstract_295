The Andreev-Thurston theorem states that for any triangulation of a closed
orientable surface \Sigma_g of genus g which is covered by a simple graph in
the universal cover, there exists a unique metric of curvature 1, 0 or -1 on
the surface depending on whether g=0, 1 or \ge 2 such that the surface with
this metric admits a circle packing with combinatorics given by the
triangulation. Furthermore, the circle packing is essentially rigid, that is,
unique up to conformal automorphisms of the surface isotopic to the identity.
In this paper, we consider projective structures on the surface \Sigma_g where
circle packings are also defined. We show that the space of projective
structures on a surface of genus g \ge 2 which admits a circle packing by one
circle is homeomorphic to R^{6g-6} and furthermore that the circle packing is
rigid on such surfaces.
