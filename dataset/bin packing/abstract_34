The Bin Packing Problem is one of the most important optimization problems.
In recent years, due to its NP-hard nature, several approximation algorithms
have been presented. It is proved that the best algorithm for the Bin Packing
Problem has the approximation ratio 3/2 and the time order O(n), unless P=NP.
In this paper, first, a 3/2-approximation algorithm is presented, then a
modification to FFD algorithm is proposed to decrease time order to linear.
Finally, these suggested approximation algorithms are compared with some other
approximation algorithms. The experimental results show the suggested
algorithms perform efficiently. In summary, the main goal of the research is
presenting methods which not only enjoy the best theoretical criteria, but also
perform considerably efficient in practice.
