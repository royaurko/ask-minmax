We investigate local supersymmetry-breaking vacua in s-confining theories
with gauge group $Sp(2N)$. By adapting the general recipe developed by Shadmi
and Shirman, we construct a realistic model based on dynamics of SQCD coupled
with singlets which allows a spontaneously broken supersymmetry. Since the
chiral superfields in model have R-charges R=0 and R=2 only, the tedious
computations of Coleman-Weinberg potential can be greatly alleviated from the
lesson of David Shih. We observe that the pseudomoduli fields are stabilized at
the origin of moduli space at one-loop order with calculability being
preserved.
