We investigate the dynamic fracture of a close-packed monolayer of particles,
or particle raft, floating at a liquid-gas interface induced by the localised
addition of surfactant. Unusually for a two-dimensional solid, our experiments
show that the speed of crack propagation here is not affected by the elastic
properties of the raft. Instead it is controlled by the rate at which
surfactant is advected to the crack tip by means of the induced Marangoni
flows. Further, the velocity of propagation is not constant in time and the
length of the crack scales as $t^{3/4}$. More broadly, this surfactant induced
rupture of interfacial rafts suggests ways to manipulate them for applications.
