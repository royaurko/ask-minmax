Using self-consistent field and density-functional theories, we first
investigate colloidal self-assembling of colloid/polymer films confined between
two soft surfaces grafted by polymers. With the increase of colloidal
concentrations, the film undergoes a series of transitions from disordered
liquid $\to$ sparse square $\to$ hexagonal (or mixed square-hexagonal) $\to$
dense square $\to$ cylindric structures in plane, which results from the
competition between the entropic elasticity of polymer brushes and the steric
packing effect of colloidal particles. A phase diagram displays the stable
regions of different in-layer ordering structures as the colloidal
concentration is varied and layering transitions as the polymer-grafted density
is decreased. Our results show a new control mechanism to stabilize the
ordering of structures within the films.
