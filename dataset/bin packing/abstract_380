The packing chromatic number $\pcn(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer
$k$ such that its set of vertices $V(G)$ can be partitioned into $k$ disjoint
subsets $V\_1$, \ldots, $V\_k$, in such a way that every two distinct vertices
in $V\_i$ are at distance greater than $i$ in $G$ for every $i$, $1\le i\le k$.
For a given integer $p \ge 1$, the generalized corona $G\odot pK\_1$ of a graph
$G$ is the graph obtained from $G$ by adding $p$ degree-one neighbors to every
vertex of $G$. In this paper, we determine the packing chromatic number of
generalized coronae of paths and cycles. Moreover, by considering digraphs and
the (weak) directed distance between vertices, we get a natural extension of
the notion of packing coloring to digraphs. We then determine the packing
chromatic number of orientations of generalized coronae of paths and cycles.
