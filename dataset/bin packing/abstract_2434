We have studied the wave dynamics and the energy absorption problem for the
scalar field as well as the brane-localized gravitational field in the
background of a braneworld black hole. Comparing our results with the
four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, we have observed the signature of
the extra dimension in the energy absorption spectrum.
