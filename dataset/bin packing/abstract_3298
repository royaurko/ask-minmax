We describe how the powerful "Divide and Concur" algorithm for constraint
satisfaction can be derived as a special case of a message-passing version of
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for convex
optimization, and introduce an improved message-passing algorithm based on
ADMM/DC by introducing three distinct weights for messages, with "certain" and
"no opinion" weights, as well as the standard weight used in ADMM/DC. The
"certain" messages allow our improved algorithm to implement constraint
propagation as a special case, while the "no opinion" messages speed
convergence for some problems by making the algorithm focus only on active
constraints. We describe how our three-weight version of ADMM/DC can give
greatly improved performance for non-convex problems such as circle packing and
solving large Sudoku puzzles, while retaining the exact performance of ADMM for
convex problems. We also describe the advantages of our algorithm compared to
other message-passing algorithms based upon belief propagation.
