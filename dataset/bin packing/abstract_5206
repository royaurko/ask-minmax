In this paper we examine the percentage of type 1 AGN which require the
inclusion of a soft excess component and/or significant cold absorption in the
modelling of their X-ray spectra obtained by XMM-Newton. We do this by
simulating spectra which mimic typical spectral shapes in order to find the
maximum detectability expected at different count levels. We then apply a
correction to the observed percentages found for the Scott et al. (2011) sample
of 761 sources. We estimate the true percentage of AGN with a soft excess
component to be 75+/-23%, suggesting that soft excesses are ubiquitous in the
X-ray spectra of type 1 AGN. By carrying out joint fits on groups of low count
spectra in narrow z bins in which additional spectral components were not
originally detected, we show that the soft excess feature is recovered with a
mean temperature kT and blackbody to power-law normalisation ratio consistent
with those of components detected in individual high count spectra. Cold
absorption with nH values broadly consistent with those reported in individual
spectra are also recovered. We suggest such intrinsic cold absorption is found
in a minimum of ~5% of type 1 AGN and may be present in up to ~10%.
