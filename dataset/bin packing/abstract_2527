The longitudinal viscosity $\eta_l$ is obtained for a two-dimensional (2D)
liquid using a Green-Kubo method with a molecular dynamics simulation. The
interparticle potential used has the Debye-H\"{u}ckel or Yukawa form, which
models a 2D dusty plasma. The longitudinal $\eta_l$ and shear $\eta_s$
viscosities are found to have values that match very closely, with only
negligible differences for the entire range of temperatures that is considered.
The bulk viscosity $\eta_b$ is determined to be either negligibly small or not
a meaningful transport coefficient, for a 2D Yukawa liquid.
