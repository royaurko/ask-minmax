We show that a system of hard discs confined to a narrow channel exhibits a
fragile-strong fluid crossover located at the maximum of the isobaric heat
capacity and that the relaxation times for different channel widths fall onto a
single master curve when rescaled by the relaxation times and temperatures of
the crossover. Calculations of the configurational entropy and the inherent
structure equation of state find that the crossover is related to properties of
the jamming landscape for the model but that the Adams-Gibbs relation does not
predict the relaxation behavior. We also show that a facilitated dynamics
description of the system, where kinetically excited regions are identified
with local packing arrangements of the discs, successfully describes the
fragile-strong crossover.
