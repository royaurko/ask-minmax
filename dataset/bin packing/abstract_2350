Bayesian Blocks is a new time series algorithm for detecting localized
structures (spikes or shots), revealing pulse shapes, and generally
characterizing intensity variations. It maps raw counting data into a maximum
likelihood piecewise constant representation of the underlying signal. This
bin-free method imposes no lower limit on measurable time scales. Applied to
BATSE TTE data, it reveals the shortest know burst structure -- a spike
superimposed on the main burst in GRB 920229 = Trigger 1453, with rise and
decay timescales ~ few 100 microseconds.
