Indium gallium nitride films with nanocolumnar microstructure were deposited
with varying indium content and substrate temperatures using plasma-enhanced
evaporation on amorphous SiO2 substrates. FESEM and XRD results are presented,
showing that more crystalline nanocolumnar microstructures can be engineered at
lower indium compositions. Nanocolumn diameter and packing factor (void
fraction) was found to be highly dependent on substrate temperature, with
thinner and more closely packed nanocolumns observed at lower substrate
temperatures.
