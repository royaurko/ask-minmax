Event-by-event fluctuations in the spatial patterns in charged particles
generated in Pb--Pb collisions at the center-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{S_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV are studied within A MultiPhase Transport
(AMPT) model. The spatial patterns of the particles generated in the ($\eta,
\phi$) space for $|\eta| \le 0.8$ are studied using the methodology of
intermittency and erraticity analysis. We find negative intermittency for
charged particles generated in a range of $p_{\rm{T}}$ windows. This result
contrasts sharply from what is expected for a quark-gluon plasma undergoing
hadronization by a second-order phase transition. Appropriate scaling behavior
is examined, resulting in definitive scaling exponent $\nu_{-}$. Event-by-event
fluctuations in the spatial patterns quantified by an index, named erraticity
index are determined for different $p_{\rm{T}}$ bins $\leq 1$ GeV/c, for AMPT
model. This is the first time that the intermittency and erraticity indices are
determined for any model at such high energies. The results presented here can
be used for comparison with the fluctuation properties of the experimental data
and hence can help the development of a wider scope of understanding of
validity of the particle production process by AMPT at these energies on the
one hand, and of the true nature of the real data on the other.
