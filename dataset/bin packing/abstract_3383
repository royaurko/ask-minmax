The formation process and composition of the acrylonitrile/urea inclusion
compounds (AN/UIC) with different aging times and AN/urea molar feed ratios are
studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).
It is suggested that DSC could be one of the helpful methods to determine the
guest/host ratio and the heat of decomposition. Meanwhile, the guest/host ratio
and heat of deformation are obtained, which are 1.17 and 5361.53 J/mol,
respectively. It is suggested AN molecules included in urea canal lattice may
be packed flat against each other. It is found that the formation of AN/UIC
depends on the aging time. XRD results reveal that once AN molecules enter urea
lattice, AN/UIC are formed, which possess the final structure. When AN
molecules are sufficient, the length of AN molecular arrays in urea canals
increases as aging time prolonging until urea tunnels are saturated by AN.
