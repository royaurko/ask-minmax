Using a refractive index matching method, we investigate the trajectories of
particles in a three dimensional granular packing submitted to cyclic shear
deformation. The particle motion observed during compaction is not diffusive
but exhibits transient cage effect, similar to the one observed in colloidal
glasses. We precisely study the statistics of the step size between two
successive cycles and observe that it is proportional to the shear amplitude.
The link between the microscopic observations and the macroscopic evolution of
the volume fraction during compaction is discussed.
