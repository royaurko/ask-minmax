We present X-ray spatial and spectral analysis of the Chandra data from the
central 400 kpc (H0 = 50 km/s/Mpc) of the cluster of galaxies Abell 1795. The
plasma temperature rises outwards by a factor of 3, whereas the iron abundance
decreases by a factor of 4. The spatial distribution of Oxygen, Neon, Sulphur,
Silicon and Iron shows that supernovae Type Ia dominate the metal enrichment
process of the cluster plasma within the inner 150 kpc. Resolving both the gas
density and temperature in 9 radial bins, we recover the gravitational mass
density profile and show that it flattens within 100 kpc as rho_DM \propto
r^{-0.6} with a power law index flatter than -1 at >3 sigma level. The observed
motion of the central galaxy and the presence of excesses and deficits along
the North-South direction in the brightness distribution indicate that the
central cluster region is not relaxed. In the absence of any non-gravitational
heating source, the data from the inner ~200 kpc indicate the presence of a
cooling flow with an integrated mass deposition rate of about 100 Msun/yr. Over
the same cluster region, the observed rate of 74 Msun/yr is consistent with the
recent XMM Reflection Grating Spectrometer limit of 150 Msun/yr.
