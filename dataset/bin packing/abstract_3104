We investigate a model of transportation networks with nonlinear elements
which may represent local shortage of resources. Frustrations arise from
competition for resources. When the initial resources are uniform, different
regimes with discrete fractions of satisfied nodes are observed, resembling the
Devil's staircase. We demonstrate how functional recursions are converted to
simple recursions of probabilities. Behavior similar to those in the vertex
cover or close packing problems are found. When the initial resources are
bimodally distributed, increases in the fraction of rich nodes induce a glassy
transition, entering an algorithmically hard regime.
