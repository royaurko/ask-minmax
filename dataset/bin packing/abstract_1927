A modification to the absolute magnitude calibration for W~UMa-type systems,
taking into account differences in metal abundances, is derived on the basis of
contact binary systems recently discovered in metal-poor clusters. A
preliminary estimate of the magnitude of the metallicity-dependent term for the
$(B-V)$-based calibration is $\Delta M_V = -(0.3 \pm 0.1) \times [Fe/H]$. The
calibration based on the $(V-I_C)$ color is expected to be less sensitive with
the correction term $\approx -(0.12\pm 0.05) \times [Fe/H]$.
