Disordered packings of soft grains are fragile mechanical systems that loose
rigidity upon lowering the external pressure towards zero. At zero pressure, we
find that any infinitesimal strain-impulse propagates initially as a non-linear
solitary wave progressively attenuated by disorder. We demonstrate that the
particle fluctuations generated by the solitary-wave decay, can be viewed as a
granular analogue of temperature. Their presence is manifested by two emergent
macroscopic properties absent in the unperturbed granular packing: a finite
pressure that scales with the injected energy (akin to a granular temperature)
and an anomalous viscosity that arises even when the microscopic mechanisms of
energy dissipation are negligible. Consistent with the interpretation of this
state as a fluid-like thermalized state, the shear modulus remains zero.
Further, we follow in detail the attenuation of the initial solitary wave
identifying two distinct regimes : an initial exponential decay, followed by a
longer power law decay and suggest simple models to explain these two regimes.
