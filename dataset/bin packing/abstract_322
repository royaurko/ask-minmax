Let M be a closed symplectic manifold of volume V. We say that M admits an
unobstructed symplectic packing by balls if any collection of symplectic balls
(of possibly different radii) of total volume less than V admits a symplectic
embedding to M. In 1994 McDuff and Polterovich proved that symplectic packings
of Kahler manifolds can be characterized in terms of Kahler cones of their
blow-ups. When M is a Kahler manifold which is not a union of its proper
subvarieties (such a manifold is called Campana simple) these Kahler cones can
be described explicitly using the Demailly and Paun structure theorem. We prove
that any Campana simple Kahler manifold, as well as any manifold which is a
limit of Campana simple manifolds in a smooth deformation, admits an
unobstructed symplectic packing by balls. This is used to show that all
even-dimensional tori equipped with Kahler symplectic forms and all hyperkahler
manifolds of maximal holonomy admit unobstructed symplectic packings by balls.
This generalizes a previous result by Latschev-McDuff-Schlenk. We also consider
symplectic packings by other shapes and show, using Ratner's orbit closure
theorem, that any even-dimensional torus equipped with a Kahler form whose
cohomology class is not proportional to a rational one admits a full symplectic
packing by any number of equal polydisks (and, in particular, by any number of
equal cubes).
