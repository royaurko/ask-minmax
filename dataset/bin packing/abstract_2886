A simple planar model for an orientational ordering of threefold molecules on
a triangular lattice modelling a close-packed (111) plane of fullerite is
considered. The system has 3-sublattice ordered ground state which includes 3
different molecular orientations. There exist 6 kinds of orientational domains,
which are related with a permutation or a mirror symmetry. Interdomain walls
are found to be rather narrow.
  The model molecules have two-well orientational potential profiles, which are
slightly effected by a presence of a straight domain wall. The reason is a
stronger correlation between neighbour molecules in triangular lattice versus
previously considered square lattice
  A considerable reduction (up to one order) of orientational interwell
potential barrier is found in the core regions of essentially two-dimentional
potential defects, such as a three-domain boundary or a kink in the domain
wall. For ultimately uncorrelated nearest neighbours the height of the
interwell barrier can be reduced even by a factor of 100.
