We study the properties of heavy fermions in the vector-like representation
of the electro-weak gauge group $SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y$ with Yukawa couplings to
the standard model Higgs boson. Applying the renormalization group analysis, we
discuss the effects of heavy fermions to the vacuum stability bound and the
triviality bound on the mass of the Higgs boson. We also discuss the
interesting possibility that the Higgs particle is composed of the top quark
and heavy fermions. The bound on the composite Higgs mass is estimated using
the method of Bardeen, Hill and Lindner, 150GeV$\leq m_H\leq$ 450GeV.
