Given a symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrix $A$, for any index $k$, one
can define an automorphism associated with $A,$ of the field $\mathbf{Q}(u_1,
>..., u_n)$ of rational functions of $n$ independent indeterminates $u_1,...,
u_n.$ It is an isomorphism between two cluster algebras associated to the
matrix $A$ (see section 4 for precise meaning). When $A$ is of finite type,
these isomorphisms behave nicely, they are compatible with the BGP-reflection
functors of cluster categories defined in [Z1, Z2] if we identify the
indecomposable objects in the categories with cluster variables of the
corresponding cluster algebras, and they are also compatible with the
"truncated simple reflections" defined in [FZ2, FZ3]. Using the construction of
preprojective or preinjective modules of hereditary algebras by Dlab-Ringel
[DR] and the Coxeter automorphisms (i.e., a product of these isomorphisms), we
construct infinitely many cluster variables for cluster algebras of infinite
type and all cluster variables for finite types.
