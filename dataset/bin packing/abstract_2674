In this paper, we study the CFT duals for extreme black holes in the
stretched horizon formalism. We consider the extremal RN, Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS,
as well as the higher dimensional Kerr-AdS-dS black holes. In all these cases,
we reproduce the well-established CFT duals. Actually we show that for
stationary extreme black holes, the stretched horizon formalism always gives
rise to the same dual CFT pictures as the ones suggested by ASG of
corresponding near horizon geometries. Furthermore, we propose new CFT duals
for 4D Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS and higher dimensional Kerr-AdS-dS black holes. We
find that every dual CFT is defined with respect to a rotation in certain
angular direction, along which the translation defines a U(1) Killing symmetry.
In the presence of two sets of U(1) symmetry, the novel CFT duals are generated
by the modular group $SL(2,\mb Z)$, and for $n$ sets of U(1) symmetry there are
general CFT duals generated by T-duality group $SL(n,\mb Z)$.
