We have found a way to analyze Edwards' density of states for static granular
packings in the special case of round, rigid, frictionless grains assuming
constant coordination number. It obtains the most entropic density of single
grain states, which predicts several observables including the distribution of
contact forces. We compare these results against empirical data obtained in
dynamic simulations of granular packings. The agreement is quite good, helping
validate the use of statistical mechanics methods in granular physics. The
differences between theory and empirics are mainly related to the coordination
number, and when the empirical data are sorted by that number we obtain several
insights that suggest an underlying elegance in the density of states.
