We describe a new family of icosahedral structures for lead clusters. In
general, structures in this family contain a Mackay icosahedral core with a
reconstructed two-shell outer-layer. This family includes the anti-Mackay
icosahedra, which have have a Mackay icosahedral core but with most of the
surface atoms in hexagonal close-packed positions. Using a many-body glue
potential for lead, we identify two icosahedral structures in this family which
have the lowest energies of any known structure in the size range from 900 to
15000 lead atoms. We show that these structures are stabilized by a feature of
the many-body glue part of the interatomic potential.
