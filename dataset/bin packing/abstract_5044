A novel simulation model of cloud microphysics is developed, which is named
Super-Droplet Method (SDM). SDM enables accurate calculation of cloud
microphysics with reasonable cost in computation. A simple SDM for warm rain,
which incorporates sedimentation, condensation/evaporation, stochastic
coalescence, is developed. The methodology to couple SDM and a non-hydrostatic
model is also developed. It is confirmed that the result of our Monte Carlo
scheme for the coalescence of super-droplets agrees fairly well with the
solution of stochastic coalescence equation. A preliminary simulation of a
shallow maritime cumulus formation initiated by a warm bubble is presented to
demonstrate the practicality of SDM. Further discussions are devoted for the
extension and the computational efficiency of SDM to incorporate various
properties of clouds, such as, several types of ice crystals, several sorts of
soluble/insoluble CCNs, their chemical reactions, electrification, and the
breakup of droplets. It is suggested that the computational cost of SDM becomes
lower than spectral (bin) method when the number of attributes $d$ becomes
larger than some critical value, which may be $2\sim4$.
