It is shown that discrete analogs of z^c and log(z) have the same asymptotic
behavior as their smooth counterparts. These discrete maps are described in
terms of special solutions of discrete Painleve-II equations, asymptotics of
these solutions providing the behaviour of discrete z^c and log(z) at infinity.
