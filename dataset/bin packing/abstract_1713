We extend the weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling method to perform rigorous
statistical sampling for systems at steady state. The straightforward
steady-state implementation of WE is directly practical for simple landscapes,
but not when significant metastable intermediates states are present. We
therefore develop an enhanced WE scheme, building on existing ideas, which
accelerates attainment of steady state in complex systems. We apply both WE
approaches to several model systems confirming their correctness and efficiency
by comparison with brute-force results. The enhanced version is significantly
faster than the brute force and straightforward WE for systems with WE bins
that accurately reflect the reaction coordinate(s). The new WE methods can also
be applied to equilibrium sampling, since equilibrium is a steady state.
