Chrysotile asbestos is formed by densely packed bundles of multiwall hollow
nanotubes. Each wall in the nanotubes is a cylindrically wrapped layer of $Mg_3
Si_2 O_5 (OH)_4$. We show by experiment and theory that the infrared spectrum
of chrysotile presents multiple plasmon resonances in the Si-O stretching
bands. These collective charge excitations are universal features of the
nanotubes that are obtained by cylindrically wrapping an anisotropic material.
The multiple plasmons can be observed if the width of the resonances is
sufficiently small as in chrysotile.
