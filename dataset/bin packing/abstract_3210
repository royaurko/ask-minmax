Shannon gave a lower bound in 1959 on the binary rate of spherical codes of
given minimum Euclidean distance $\rho$. Using nonconstructive codes over a
finite alphabet, we give a lower bound that is weaker but very close for small
values of $\rho$. The construction is based on the Yaglom map combined with
some finite sphere packings obtained from nonconstructive codes for the
Euclidean metric. Concatenating geometric codes meeting the TVZ bound with a
Lee metric BCH code over $GF(p),$ we obtain spherical codes that are polynomial
time constructible. Their parameters outperform those obtained by Lachaud and
Stern in 1994. At very high rate they are above 98 per cent of the Shannon
bound.
