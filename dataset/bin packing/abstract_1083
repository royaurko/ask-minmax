We studied the signatures of an electroweak SU(2) lepton triplet which
contains a doubly charged heavy lepton. The most interesting and easily
detected final states are originating from the doubly charged lepton pair and
single production, that we analyzed at a center of mass energy of 14 TeV. We
propose useful kinematic cuts to reduce the backgrounds and computed the
integrated luminosity needed to discover or exclude the doubly charged leptons
for various masses.
