We analyse the entropy properties in the proton-proton 1800 GeV events from
the PYTHIA/JETSET Monte Carlo generator following a recent proposal concerning
the measurement of entropy in multiparticle systems. The dependence on the
number of bins and on the size of the phase-space region is investigated. Our
results may serve as a reference sample for experimental data from
hadron-hadron and heavy ion collisions.
