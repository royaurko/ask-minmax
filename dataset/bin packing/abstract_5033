We study worldsheet and spacetime properties of the p-p' (p < p') open string
system with constant B_{ij} field viewed from the Dp' brane. The description of
this system in terms of the CFT with spin and twist fields leads us to consider
the renormal ordering procedure from the SL(2,R) invariant vacuum to the
oscillator vacuum. We compute the attendant two distinct superspace two-point
functions as well as their difference (the subtracted two-point function).
These bring us an integral (Koba-Nielsen) representation for the multiparticle
tree scattering amplitudes consisting of N-2 vectors and two tachyons. We
evaluate them explicitly for the N=3,4 cases. Several novel features are
observed which include a momentum dependent multiplicative factor to each
external vector leg and the emergence of a symplectic tensor multiplying the
polarization vectors. In the zero slope limit, the principal parts of the
amplitudes translate into a noncommutative field theory in p'+1 dimensions in
which a scalar field decaying exponentially in (p'-p) dimensions and a
noncommutative U(1) gauge field interact via the minimal coupling and a new
interaction. A large number of nearly massless states noted before are shown to
propagate in the t-channel.
