We find analytic models that can perfectly transfer, without state
initializati$ or remote collaboration, arbitrary functions in two- and
three-dimensional interacting bosonic and fermionic networks. We elaborate on a
possible implementation of state transfer through bosonic or fermionic atoms
trapped in optical lattices. A significant finding is that the state of a spin
qubit can be perfectly transferred through a fermionic system. Families of
Hamiltonians, both linear and nonlinear, are described which are related to the
linear Boson model and that enable the perfect transfer of arbitrary functions.
This includes entangled states such as decoherence-free subsystems enabling
noise protection of the transferred state.
