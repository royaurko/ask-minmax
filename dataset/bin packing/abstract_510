The structure and stresses of static granular packs in cylindrical containers
are studied using large-scale discrete element molecular dynamics simulations
in three dimensions. We generate packings by both pouring and sedimentation and
examine how the final state depends on the method of construction. The vertical
stress becomes depth-independent for deep piles and we compare these stress
depth-profiles to the classical Janssen theory. The majority of the tangential
forces for particle-wall contacts are found to be close to the Coulomb failure
criterion, in agreement with the theory of Janssen, while particle-particle
contacts in the bulk are far from the Coulomb criterion. In addition, we show
that a linear hydrostatic-like region at the top of the packings unexplained by
the Janssen theory arises because most of the particle-wall tangential forces
in this region are far from the Coulomb yield criterion. The distributions of
particle-particle and particle-wall contact forces $P(f)$ exhibit
exponential-like decay at large forces in agreement with previous studies.
