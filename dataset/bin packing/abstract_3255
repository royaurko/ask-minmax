Foreman and Lomer proposed in 1957 a method of estimating the harmonic forces
between parallel planes of atoms of primitive cubic crystals by Fourier
transforming the squared frequencies of phonons propagating along principal
directions. A generalized form of this theorem is derived in this paper and it
is shown that it is more appropriate to apply the method to certain
combinations of the phonon dispersion relations rather than to individual
dispersion relations themselves. Further, it is also shown how the method may
be extended to the non-primitive hexagonal close packed and diamond lattices.
Explicit, exact and general relations in terms of atomic force constants are
found for deviations from the Blackman sum rule which itself is shown to be
derived from the generalized Foreman-Lomer theorem.
