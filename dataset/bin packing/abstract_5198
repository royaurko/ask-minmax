The detection of powerful near-infrared emission in high redshift (z>5)
quasars demonstrates that very hot dust is present close to the active nucleus
also in the very early universe. A number of high-redshift objects even show
significant excess emission in the rest frame NIR over more local AGN spectral
energy distribution (SED) templates. In order to test if this is a result of
the very high luminosities and redshifts, we construct mean SEDs from the
latest SDSS quasar catalogue in combination with MIR data from the WISE
preliminary data release for several redshift and luminosity bins. Comparing
these mean SEDs with a large sample of z>5 quasars we could not identify any
significant trends of the NIR spectral slope with luminosity or redshift in the
regime 2.5 < z < 6 and 10^45 < nuL_nu(1350AA) < 10^47 erg/s. In addition to the
NIR regime, our combined Herschel and Spitzer photometry provides full infrared
SED coverage of the same sample of z>5 quasars. These observations reveal
strong FIR emission (L_FIR > 10^13 L_sun) in seven objects, possibly indicating
star-formation rates of several thousand solar masses per year. The FIR excess
emission has unusally high temperatures (T ~ 65 K) which is in contrast to the
temperature typically expected from studies at lower redshift (T ~ 45 K). These
objects are currently being investigated in more detail.
