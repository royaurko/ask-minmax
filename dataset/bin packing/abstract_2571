A sum of observations derived by a simple random sampling design from a
population of independent random variables is studied. A procedure finding a
general term of Edgeworth asymptotic expansion is presented. The Lindeberg
condition of asymptotic normality, Berry-Esseen bound, Edgeworth asymptotic
expansions under weakened conditions and Cramer type large deviation results
are derived.
