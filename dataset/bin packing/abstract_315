We enumerate and classify nearly all of the possible mechanically stable (MS)
packings of bidipserse mixtures of frictionless disks in small sheared systems.
We find that MS packings form continuous geometrical families, where each
family is defined by its particular network of particle contacts. We also
monitor the dynamics of MS packings along geometrical families by applying
quasistatic simple shear strain at zero pressure. For small numbers of
particles (N < 16), we find that the dynamics is deterministic and highly
contracting. That is, if the system is initialized in a MS packing at a given
shear strain, it will quickly lock into a periodic orbit at subsequent shear
strain, and therefore sample only a very small fraction of the possible MS
packings in steady state. In studies with N>16, we observe an increase in the
period and random splittings of the trajectories caused by bifurcations in
configuration space. We argue that the ratio of the splitting and contraction
rates in large systems will determine the distribution of MS-packing
geometrical families visited in steady-state. This work is part of our
long-term research program to develop a master-equation formalism to describe
macroscopic slowly driven granular systems in terms of collections of small
subsystems.
