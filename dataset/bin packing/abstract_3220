Metallic cantilever in high vacuum atomic force microscope has been used as
anode for field emission experiments from densely packed vertically aligned
multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The high spatial resolution provided by the
scanning probe technique allowed precise setting of the tip-sample distance in
the submicron region. The dimension of the probe (curvature radius below 50nm)
allowed to measure current contribution from sample areas smaller than 1um^2.
The study of long-term stability evidenced that on these small areas the field
emission current remains stable (within 10% fluctuations) several hours (at
least up to 72 hours) at current intensities between 10-5A and 10-8A.
Improvement of the current stability has been observed after performing
long-time Joule heating conditioning to completely remove possible adsorbates
on the nanotubes.
