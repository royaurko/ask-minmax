During four years, systematic observations have been conducted in drift scan
mode with the Bordeaux automated meridian circle in the declination band [+11 ;
+18]. The resulting astrometric catalog includes about 2 300 000 stars down to
the magnitude limit V_M=16.3. Nearly all stars (96%) have been observed at
least 6 times, the catalog being complete down to V_M=15.4. The median internal
standard error in position is about 35 mas in the V_M magnitude range [11 ;
15], which degrades to about 50 mas when the faintest stars are considered.
M2000 provides also one band photometry with a median internal standard error
of 0.04 mag. Comparisons with the Hipparcos and bright part of Tycho-2 catalogs
have enabled to estimate external errors in position to be lower than 40 mas.
In this zone and at epoch 1998, the faint part of Tycho-2 is found to have an
accuracy of 116 mas in alpha instead of 82 mas deduced from the model-based
standard errors given in the catalog.
