To establish the Higgs mechanism sui generis experimentally, the self-energy
potential of the Higgs field must be reconstructed. This task requires the
measurement of the trilinear and quadrilinear self-couplings, as predicted, for
instance, in the Standard Model or in supersymmetric theories. The couplings
can be probed in multiple Higgs production at high-luminosity e^+e^- linear
colliders. Complementing earlier studies to develop a coherent picture of the
trilinear couplings, we have analyzed the production of pairs of neutral Higgs
bosons in all relevant channels of double Higgs-strahlung, associated multiple
Higgs production and WW/ZZ fusion to Higgs pairs.
