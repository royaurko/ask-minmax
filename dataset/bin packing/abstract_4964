We extend the study of the nuclei of 3CR objects as seen with the HST to
higher redshift FR II radio sources (0.4<z<0.6). Our results reflect what has
been found for FR II of lower redshift. The position of the nuclei on the plane
formed by optical and radio luminosities is related to their optical spectral
classification: the nuclei of both high and low excitation galaxies lie on the
correlation found for FRI sources, while broad-lined objects have a significant
optical excess. The nuclear properties of these sources are better understood
when considering the equivalent width of the [OIII] emission line with respect
to their optical luminosities. Even in the range of redshift considered here,
low excitation galaxies show peculiar nuclear properties, more similar to those
observed in FR I. This confirms that not all FRII are unified with quasars. Our
findings have important implications for the FRII-quasar unification scheme: by
reconsidering the classification of all 3CR radio galaxies with z<1 in the
light of their nuclear properties, we derive the opening angle of the obscuring
torus for different redshift bins. We find that the covering factor of the
obscuring structure decreases as redshift increases (theta ~ 44 deg for z<0.3
to theta ~ 56 deg for 0.5<z<1). We argue that this behavior may be interpreted
in the framework of the receding torus model, in which the opening angle of the
torus increases as the luminosity of the accretion disk around the central
black hole increases.
