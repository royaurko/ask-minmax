A relation between the average length of loops and their free energy is
obtained for a variety of O(n)-type models on two-dimensional lattices, by
extending to finite temperatures a calculation due to Kast. We show that the
(number) averaged loop length L stays finite for all non-zero fugacities n, and
in particular it does not diverge upon entering the critical regime n -> 2+.
Fully packed loop (FPL) models with n=2 seem to obey the simple relation L = 3
L_min, where L_min is the smallest loop length allowed by the underlying
lattice. We demonstrate this analytically for the FPL model on the honeycomb
lattice and for the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice, and based on
numerical estimates obtained from a transfer matrix method we conjecture that
this is also true for the two-flavour FPL model on the square lattice. We
present in addition numerical results for the average loop length on the three
critical branches (compact, dense and dilute) of the O(n) model on the
honeycomb lattice, and discuss the limit n -> 0. Contact is made with the
predictions for the distribution of loop lengths obtained by conformal
invariance methods.
