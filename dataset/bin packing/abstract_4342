We consider effects of the Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) on oscillations of
the high energy atmospheric neutrinos. The \nu_\mu-oscillograms are constructed
and their dependence on the NSI strength parameters \epsilon_{\alpha \beta}
studied. We computed zenith angle distributions of the \nu_\mu-events in the
presence of NSI in different energy regions. The distributions are confronted
with the IceCube-79 (high energy sample) and the DeepCore (low energy sample)
data and constraints on the strength parameters |\epsilon_{\mu \tau}| < 6x10^-3
and |\epsilon_{\mu\mu}-\epsilon_{\tau\tau}| < 3x10^-2 (90% C.L.) have been
obtained. Future measurements of the zenith angle distributions by DeepCore in
smaller energy bins will allow to improve the bounds by factor 2 - 3. We
discuss the signatures of NSI in zenith angle and energy distributions of
events which allow to discriminate them from the effects of sterile neutrinos.
