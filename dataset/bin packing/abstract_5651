Using galaxy clusters from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey, we study how the
distribution of galaxies along the colour-magnitude relation has evolved since
z~0.8. While red-sequence galaxies in all these clusters are well described by
an old, passively evolving population, we confirm our previous finding of a
significant evolution in their luminosity distribution as a function of
redshift. When compared to galaxy clusters in the local Universe, the high
redshift EDisCS clusters exhibit a significant "deficit" of faint red galaxies.
Combining clusters in three different redshift bins, and defining as `faint'
all galaxies in the range 0.4 > L/L* > 0.1, we find a clear decrease in the
luminous-to-faint ratio of red galaxies from z~0.8 to z~0.4. The amount of such
a decrease appears to be in qualitative agreement with predictions of a model
where the blue bright galaxies that populate the colour-magnitude diagram of
high redshift clusters, have their star formation suppressed by the hostile
cluster environment. Although model results need to be interpreted with
caution, our findings clearly indicate that the red-sequence population of
high-redshift clusters does not contain all progenitors of nearby red-sequence
cluster galaxies. A significant fraction of these must have moved onto the
red-sequence below z~0.8.
