This paper presents a parallel genetic algorithm for three dimensional bin
packing with heterogeneous bins using Hadoop Map-Reduce framework. The most
common three dimensional bin packing problem which packs given set of boxes
into minimum number of equal sized bins is proven to be NP Hard. The variation
of three dimensional bin packing problem that allows heterogeneous bin sizes
and rotation of boxes is computationally more harder than common three
dimensional bin packing problem. The proposed Map-Reduce implementation helps
to run the genetic algorithm for three dimensional bin packing with
heterogeneous bins on multiple machines parallely and computes the solution in
relatively short time.
