Nowadays most of the malware applications are either packed or protected.
This techniques are applied especially to evade signature based detectors and
also to complicate the job of reverse engineers or security analysts. The time
one must spend on unpacking or decrypting malware layers is often very long and
in fact remains the most complicated task in the overall process of malware
analysis. In this report contributor proposes MmmBop as a relatively new concept of
using dynamic binary instrumentation techniques for unpacking and bypassing
detection by self-modifying and highly aggressive packed binary code. MmmBop is
able to deal with most of the known and unknown packing algorithms and it is
also suitable to successfully bypass most of currently used anti-reversing
tricks. This framework does not depend on any other 3rd party software and it
is developed entirely in user mode (ring3). MmmBop supports the IA-32
architecture and it is targeted for Microsoft Windows XP, some of the further
deliberations will be referring directly to this operating system.
