In is paper we compare two models with central Au-Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. The first model is a minijet model which assumes that
around $\sim$50 minijets are produced in back-to-back pairs and have an altered
fragmentation functions. It is also assumed that the fragments are transparent
and escape the collision zone and are detected. The second model is a glasma
flux tube model which leads to flux tubes on the surface of a radial expanding
fireball driven by interacting flux tubes near the center of the fireball
through plasma instabilities. This internal fireball becomes an opaque hydro
fluid which pushes the surface flux tubes outward. Around $\sim$12 surface flux
tubes remain and fragment with $\sim$1/2 the produced particles escaping the
collision zone and are detected. Both models can reproduce two particle angular
correlations in the different $p_{t1}$ $p_{t2}$ bins. We also compare the two
models for three additional effects: meson baryon ratios; the long range
nearside correlation called the ridge; and the so-called mach cone effect when
applied to three particle angular correlations.
