We have performed a detailed study of the zenith angle dependence of the
regeneration factor and distributions of events at SNO and SK for different
solutions of the solar neutrino problem. In particular, we discuss oscillatory
behaviour and the synchronization effect in the distribution for the LMA
solution, the parametric peak for the LOW solution, etc.. Physical
interpretation of the effects is given. We suggest a new binning of events
which emphasizes distinctive features of zenith angle distributions for the
different solutions. We also find the correlations between the integrated
day-night asymmetry and the rates of events in different zenith angle bins.
Study of these correlations strengthens the identification power of the
analysis.
