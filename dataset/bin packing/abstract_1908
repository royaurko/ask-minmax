We study statistics dependence of the probability distributions and the means
of measured moments of conserved quantities, respectively. The required
statistics of all interested moments and their products are estimated based on
a simple simulation. We also explain why the measured moments are
underestimated when the statistics are insufficient.With the statistics at
RHIC/BES, the second and third order moments can be reliably obtained based on
the method of Centrality bin width correction (CBWC), which can not be applied
for the fourth order moments at low energy. With planning statistics at
RHIC/BES II, and improved CBWC method, $\kappa\sigma^2$ in a finer centrality
bin scale should be measurable. This will help us to understand the current
observation of energy and centrality dependence of high-order moments.
