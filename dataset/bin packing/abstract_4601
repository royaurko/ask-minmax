Intensity mapping of neutral hydrogen (HI) is a promising observational probe
of cosmology and large-scale structure. We present wide field simulations of HI
intensity maps based on N-body simulations, the halo model, and a
phenomenological prescription for assigning HI mass to halos. The simulations
span a redshift range of 0.35 < z < 0.9 in redshift bins of width $\Delta z
\approx 0.05$ and cover a quarter of the sky at an angular resolution of about
7'. We use the simulated intensity maps to study the impact of non-linear
effects on the angular clustering of HI. We apply and compare several
estimators for the angular power spectrum and its covariance. We verify that
they agree with analytic predictions on large scales and study the validity of
approximations based on Gaussian random fields, particularly in the context of
the covariance. We discuss how our results and the simulated maps can be useful
for planning and interpreting future HI intensity mapping surveys.
