We demonstrate that our gradient density estimator---corresponding to
estimating the density function of the derivatives in one dimension---obtained
from a finite sample set of size $N$ using the method of stationary phase
converges at the rate of $O(1/N)$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. For a thrice
differentiable function $S$, the density function of its derivative $s =
S^{\prime}$ is obtained via a random variable transformation of a uniformly
distributed random variable defined on a closed, bounded interval $\Omega =
[0,L] \subset\mathbb{R}$ using $s$ as the transformation function. Given $N$
\emph{i.i.d.} samples of $S$ we prove that the integral of the scaled, discrete
power spectrum of $\phi=\exp\left(\frac{iS}{\tau}\right)$ increasingly
approximates the integral of the density function of $s$ over an arbitrarily
small interval $\mathcal{N}_{\alpha}$ at the rate of $O(1/N)$. In addition to
its fast computability in $O(N \log N)$, our framework for obtaining the
density does not involve any parameter selection like the number of histogram
bins, width of the histogram bins, width of the kernel parameter, number of
mixture components etc. as required by other widely applied methods like
histogramming and Parzen windows.
