We present methods for efficient characterization of an optical coherent
state $|\alpha\rangle$. We choose measurement settings adaptively and
stochastically, based on data while it is collected. Our algorithm divides the
estimation in two distinct steps: (i) Before the first detection of vacuum
state, the probability of choosing a measurement setting is proportional to
detecting vacuum with the setting, which makes using too similar measurement
settings twice unlikely and (ii) after the first detection of vacuum, we focus
measurements in the region where vacuum is most likely to be detected. In step
(i) [(ii)] the detection of vacuum (a photon) has a significantly larger effect
on the shape of the posterior probability distribution of $\alpha$. Compared to
nonadaptive schemes, our method makes the number of measurement shots required
to achieve certain level of accuracy smaller approximately by a factor
proportional to the area describing the initial uncertainty of $\alpha$ in
phase space. While this algorithm is not directly robust against readout
errors, we make it such by introducing repeated measurements in the step (i).
