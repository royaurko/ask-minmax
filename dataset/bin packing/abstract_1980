We consider close-packed dimers, or perfect matchings, on two-dimensional
regular lattices. We review known results and derive new expressions for the
free energy, entropy, and the molecular freedom of dimers for a number of
lattices including the simple-quartic (4^4), honeycomb (6^3), triangular (3^6),
kagome (3.6.3.6), 3-12 (3.12^2) and its dual [3.12^2], and 4-8 (4.8^2) and its
dual Union Jack [4.8^2] Archimedean tilings. The occurrence and nature of phase
transitions are also analyzed and discussed.
