In a realistic three-dimensional setup, we simulate the slow deformation of
idealized granular media composed of spheres undergoing an axisymmetric
triaxial shear test. We follow the self-organization of the spontaneous strain
localization process leading to a shear band and demonstrate the existence of a
critical packing density inside this failure zone. The asymptotic criticality
arising from the dynamic equilibrium of dilation and compaction is found to be
restricted to the shear band, while the density outside of it keeps the memory
of the initial packing. The critical density of the shear band depends on
friction (and grain geometry) and in the limit of infinite friction it defines
a specific packing state, namely the \emph{dynamic random loose packing}.
