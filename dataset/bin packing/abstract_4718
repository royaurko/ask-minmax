Fluctuations of the local volume fraction within granular materials have
previously been observed to decrease as the system approaches jamming. We
experimentally examine the role of boundary conditions and inter-particle
friction $\mu$ on this relationship for a dense granular material of bidisperse
particles driven under either constant volume or constant pressure. Using a
radical Vorono\"i tessellation, we find the variance of the local volume
fraction $\phi$ monotonically decreases as the system becomes more dense,
independent of boundary condition and $\mu$. We examine the universality and
origins of this trend using experiments and the recent granocentric model
\cite{Clusel-2009-GMR,Corwin-2010-MRP}, modified to draw particle locations
from an arbitrary distribution ${\cal P}(s)$ of neighbor distances $s$. The
mean and variance of the observed ${\cal P}(s)$ are described by a single
length scale controlled by $\bar \phi$. Through the granocentric model, we
observe that diverse functional forms of ${\cal P}(s)$ all produce the trend of
decreasing fluctuations, but only the experimentally-observed ${\cal P}(s)$
provides quantitative agreement with the measured $\phi$ fluctuations. Thus, we
find that both ${\cal P}(s)$ and ${\cal P}(\phi)$ encode similar information
about the ensemble of observed packings, and are connected to each other by the
local granocentric model.
