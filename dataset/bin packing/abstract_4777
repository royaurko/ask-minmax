We consider a freely guided photonic blade (FGPB) which is a centrifugally
stretched sheet of photonic sail membrane that can be tilted by changing the
centre of mass or by other means. The FGPB can be installed at the tip of each
main tether of an electric solar wind sail (E-sail) so that one can actively
manage the tethers to avoid their mutual collisions and to modify the spin rate
of the sail if needed. This enables a more scalable and modular E-sail than the
baseline approach where auxiliary tethers are used for collision avoidance. For
purely photonic sail applications one can remove the tethers and increase the
size of the blades to obtain a novel variant of the heliogyro that can have a
significantly higher packing density than the traditional heliogyro. For
satellite deorbiting in low Earth orbit (LEO) conditions, analogous designs
exist where the E-sail effect is replaced by the negative polarity plasma brake
effect and the photonic pressure by atmospheric drag. We conclude that the FGPB
appears to be an enabling technique for diverse applications. We also outline a
way of demonstrating it on ground and in LEO at low cost.
