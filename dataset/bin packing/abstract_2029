We simulate the Ising model on dynamical quadrangulations using a
generalization of the flip move for triangulations with two aims: firstly, as a
confirmation of the universality of the KPZ/DDK exponents of the Ising phase
transition, worthwhile in view of some recent surprises with other sorts of
dynamical lattices; secondly, to investigate the transition of the Ising
antiferromagnet on a dynamical loosely packed (bipartite) lattice. In the
latter case we show that it is still possible to define a staggered
magnetization and observe the antiferromagnetic analogue of the transition.
