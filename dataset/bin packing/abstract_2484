This paper introduces a novel concept of self-forensics to complement the
standard autonomic self-CHOP properties of the self-managed systems, to be
specified in the Forensic Lucid language. We argue that self-forensics, with
the forensics taken out of the cybercrime domain, is applicable to
"self-dissection" for the purpose of verification of autonomous software and
hardware systems of flight-critical systems for automated incident and anomaly
analysis and event reconstruction by the engineering teams in a variety of
incident scenarios during design and testing as well as actual flight data.
