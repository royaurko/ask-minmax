We have measured the 3.6 micron cluster luminosity function (LF) using a
sample of 123 galaxy clusters selected from the 4 degree^2 Spitzer First Look
Survey (FLS). The clusters were selected on the basis of their R - 3.6 micron
colors using the cluster red-sequence technique of Gladders & Yee (2000). The
binned LFs are well-fit by a Schechter function at all redshifts. However, we
note two interesting trends. Firstly, the evolution of Mstar with redshift is
consistent with models that form galaxies in a single-burst of star-formation
at z > 2.0, and evolve passively thereafter. Secondly, the faint-end slope of
the LF appears to become shallower at higher redshift. We conclude that the
most massive galaxies were formed in the cluster at high redshift (z > 2),
while lower-mass galaxies have subsequently been accreted from the field at
lower redshift (z ~ 0.5). These results are consistent with the ``downsizing''
picture seen in previous cluster studies using smaller samples.
