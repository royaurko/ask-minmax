We describe the contact network of granular packings by a frustrated lattice
gas that contains steric frustration as essential ingredient. Two transitions
are identified, a spin glass transition at the onset of Reynolds dilatancy and
at lower densities a percolation transition. We describe the correlation
functions that give rise to the singularities and propose some dynamical
experiments.
