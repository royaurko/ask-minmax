Let M be a symplectic-toric manifold of dimension at least four. This paper
investigates the so called symplectic ball packing problem in the toral
equivariant setting. We show that the set of toric symplectic ball packings of
M admits the structure of a convex polytope. Previous work of the first contributor
shows that up to equivalence, only CP^1 x CP^1 and CP^2 admit density one
packings when n=2 and only CP^n admits density one packings when n>2. In
contrast, we show that for a fixed n>=2 and each r in (0, 1), there are
uncountably many inequivalent 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds with a
maximal toric packing of density r. This result follows from a general analysis
of how the densities of maximal packings change while varying a given
symplectic-toric manifold through a family of symplectic-toric manifolds that
are equivariantly diffeomorphic but not equivariantly symplectomorphic.
