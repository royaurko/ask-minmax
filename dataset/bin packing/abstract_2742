This paper presents polar coding schemes for the 2-user discrete memoryless
broadcast channel (DM-BC) which achieve Marton's region with both common and
private messages. This is the best achievable rate region known to date, and it
is tight for all classes of 2-user DM-BCs whose capacity regions are known. To
accomplish this task, we first construct polar codes for both the superposition
as well as the binning strategy. By combining these two schemes, we obtain
Marton's region with private messages only. Finally, we show how to handle the
case of common information. The proposed coding schemes possess the usual
advantages of polar codes, i.e., they have low encoding and decoding complexity
and a super-polynomial decay rate of the error probability.
  We follow the lead of Goela, Abbe, and Gastpar, who recently introduced polar
codes emulating the superposition and binning schemes. In order to align the
polar indices, for both schemes, their solution involves some degradedness
constraints that are assumed to hold between the auxiliary random variables and
the channel outputs. To remove these constraints, we consider the transmission
of $k$ blocks and employ a chaining construction that guarantees the proper
alignment of the polarized indices. The techniques described in this work are
quite general, and they can be adopted to many other multi-terminal scenarios
whenever there polar indices need to be aligned.
