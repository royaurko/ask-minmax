We consider the estimation of covariance and correlation matrices for
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian observations with slowly decaying temporal
dependence that is bounded by certain polynomial decay rate. For generalized
thresholding estimators, convergence rates are obtained and properties of
sparsistency and sign-consistency are established. An intuitive
cross-validation method is proposed for the thresholding parameter selection,
which shows good performance in simulations. Convergence rates are also
obtained for banding method if the covaraince or correlation matrix is
bandable. The considered temporal dependence is allowed to be long-range so
with longer memory than those in the current literature, which has particular
implications in analyzing resting-state fMRI data for brain connectivity
studies.
