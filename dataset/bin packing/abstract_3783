Based on the observations that there exists an analogy between the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om-anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black holes and the van der
Waals-Maxwell liquid-gas system, in which a correspondence of variables is
$(\phi, q) \leftrightarrow (V,P)$, we study the Ruppeiner geometry, defined as
Hessian matrix of black hole entropy with respect to the internal energy (not
the mass) of black hole and electric potential (angular velocity), for the RN,
Kerr and RN-AdS black holes. It is found that the geometry is curved and the
scalar curvature goes to negative infinity at the Davies' phase transition
point for the RN and Kerr black holes.
 Our result for the RN-AdS black holes is also in good agreement with the one
about phase transition and its critical behavior in the literature.
