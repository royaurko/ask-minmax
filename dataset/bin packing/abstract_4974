We present a Chandra study of 38 X-ray luminous clusters of galaxies in the
ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample (BCS) that lie at z~0.15-0.4. We find that the
majority of clusters at moderate redshift generally have smooth, relaxed
morphologies with some evidence for mild substructure perhaps indicative of
recent minor merger activity. Using spatially-resolved spectral analyses, cool
cores appear to still be common at these redshifts. At a radius of 50 kpc, we
find that at least 55 per cent of the clusters in our sample exhibit signs of
mild cooling [t(cool)<10 Gyr], while in the central bin at least 34 per cent
demonstrate signs of strong cooling [t(cool)<2 Gyr]. These percentages are
nearly identical to those found for luminous, low-redshift clusters of
galaxies, suggesting little evolution in cluster cores since z~0.4 and that
heating and cooling mechanisms may already have stabilised by this epoch.
Comparing the central cooling times to central Halpha emission in BCS clusters,
we find a strong correspondence between the detection of Halpha and central
cooling time. (Abridged)
