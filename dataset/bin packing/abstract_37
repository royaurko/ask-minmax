In the recent paper \cite{BDT10} we introduced a new problem that we call Bin
Packing/Covering with Delivery, or BP/CD for short. Mainly we mean under this
expression that we look for not only a good, but a "good and fast" packing or
covering. In that paper we mainly dealt with only one possible online BP/CD
model, and proposed a new method that we call the Evolution of Algorithms. In
case of such methods a neighborhood structure is defined among algorithms, and
using a metaheuristic (for example simulated annealing) in some sense the best
algorithm is chosen to solve the problem. Now we turn to investigate the
offline case. We define several ways to treat such a BP/CD problem, although we
investigate only one of them here. For the analysis, a novel view on "offline
optimum" is introduced, which appears to be relevant concerning all problems
where a final solution is ordering-dependent. We prove that if the item sizes
are not allowed to be arbitrarily close to zero, then an optimal offline
solution can be found in polynomial time. On the other hand, for unrestricted
problem instances, no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve an approximation
ratio better than 6/7 if $P\ne NP$.
