We present a Monte Carlo model for degradation of 1-10,000 eV electrons in an
atmosphere of methane. The electron impact cross sections for CH4 are compiled
and analytical representations of these cross sections are used as input to the
model.model.Yield spectra, which provides information about the number of
inelastic events that have taken place in each energy bin, is used to calculate
the yield (or population) of various inelastic processes. The numerical yield
spectra, obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations, is represented
analytically, thus generating the Analytical Yield Spectra (AYS). AYS is
employed to obtain the mean energy per ion pair and efficiencies of various
inelastic processes.Mean energy per ion pair for neutral CH4 is found to be 26
(27.8) eV at 10 (0.1) keV. Efficiency calculation showed that ionization is the
dominant process at energies >50 eV, for which more than 50% of the incident
electron energy is used. Above 25 eV, dissociation has an efficiency of 27%.
Below 10 eV, vibrational excitation dominates. Contribution of emission is
around 1.2% at 10 keV. Efficiency of attachment process is 0.1% at 8 eV and
efficiency falls down to negligibly small values at energies greater than 15
eV. The efficiencies can be used to calculate volume production rate in
planetary atmospheres by folding with electron production rate and integrating
over energy
