We perform a determination of the strong coupling constant using the latest
ATLAS inclusive jet cross section data, from proton-proton collisions at
sqrt{s}=7 TeV, and their full information on the bin-to-bin correlations.
Several procedures for combining the statistical information from the different
data inputs are studied and compared. The theoretical prediction is obtained
using NLO QCD, and it also includes non-perturbative corrections. Our
determination uses inputs with transverse momenta between 45 and 600 GeV, the
running of the strong coupling being also tested in this range. Good agreement
is observed when comparing our result with the world average at the Z-boson
scale, as well as with the most recent results from the Tevatron.
