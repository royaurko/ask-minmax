For a type-II superconductor, when the applied magnetic field is higher than
the lower critical value Hc1, the magnetic flux will penetrate into the
superconductor and form quantized vortices, which usually are arranged in an
Abrikosov lattice. For the newly discovered iron pnictide superconductors,
previous measurements have shown that, in electron-doped BaFe2As2, the vortices
form a highly disordered structure. In addition, the density of states (DOS)
within the vortex cores1 do not exhibit the Andreev bound states in
conventional superconductors. In this Letter, we report the observation of a
triangular vortex lattice and the Andreev bound states in hole-doped BaFe2As2
by using a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Detailed study
of the vortex cores reveals that the spectrum of the Andreev bound states
inside the vortex core exhibits a distinct spatial evolution: at the center of
the vortex core, it appears as a single peak at 0.5 mV below the Fermi-energy;
away from the core center, it gradually evolves into two sub-peaks and they
eventually fade out. The drastic differences between the vortex cores of the
electron-doped and hole-doped counterparts are illusive to the pairing
mechanism of the iron pnictide superconductors.
