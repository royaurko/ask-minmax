We report a computer simulation study of an electroneutral mixture of
oppositely charged oblate ellipsoids of revolution with aspect ratio A = 1/3.
In contrast to hard or soft repulsive ellipsoids, which are purely nematic,
this system exhibits a smectic-A phase in which charges of equal sign are
counterintuitively packed in layers perpendicular to the nematic director.
