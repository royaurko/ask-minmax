In this paper we provide an achievable rate region for the discrete
memoryless multiple access channel with correlated state information known
non-causally at the encoders using a random binning technique. This result is a
generalization of the random binning technique used by Gel'fand and Pinsker for
the problem with non-causal channel state information at the encoder in point
to point communication.
