We observed the appearance of capillary bridges in a granular medium
consisting of glass beads after adding small amounts of liquid. We found the
initial bridge formation depending on the bead roughness. Furthermore we
obtained a statistics for the average number of bridges for randomly packed
beads in dependence of the liquid content and were able to find an explanation
therefore based on recent models and former experimental data.
