A codebook based limited feedback strategy is a practical way to obtain
partial channel state information at the transmitter in a precoded
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. Conventional codebook
designs use Grassmannian packing, equiangular frames, vector quantization, or
Fourier based constructions. While the capacity and error rate performance of
conventional codebook constructions have been extensively investigated,
constructing these codebooks is notoriously difficult relying on techniques
such as nonlinear search or iterative algorithms. Further, the resulting
codebooks may not have a systematic structure to facilitate storage of the
codebook and low search complexity. In this paper, we propose a new systematic
codebook design based on Kerdock codes and mutually unbiased bases. The
proposed Kerdock codebook consists of multiple mutually unbiased unitary bases
matrices with quaternary entries and the identity matrix. We propose to derive
the beamforming and precoding codebooks from this base codebook, eliminating
the requirement to store multiple codebooks. The propose structure requires
little memory to store and, as we show, the quaternary structure facilitates
codeword search. We derive the chordal distance for two antenna and four
antenna codebooks, showing that the proposed codebooks compare favorably with
prior designs. Monte Carlo simulations are used to compare achievable rates and
error rates for different codebooks sizes.
