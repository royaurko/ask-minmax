Forward-backward correlations of charged-particle multiplicities in symmetric
bins in pseudorapidity (eta) are studied in order to gain insight into the
underlying correlation structure of particle production in Au+Au collisions.
The PHOBOS detector is used to measure integrated multiplicities in bins
defined within eta<3, centered at eta and covering an interval Delta-eta. The
variance (sigma^2_C) of a suitably defined forward-backward asymmetry variable
is calculated as a function of eta, Delta-eta, and centrality. It is found to
be sensitive to short range correlations, and the concept of ``clustering'' is
used to interpret comparisons to phenomenological models.
