The chapter is devoted to chemical uniqueness of graphene. In view of
molecular theory, the latter is a consequence of benzenoid packing of carbon
atoms, based on three neighbors to each carbon atom leaving the atom fourth
valence electron (the odd one) on its own. Due to rather large C-C distances,
the odd electrons of graphene molecules are correlated whereupon the molecules
are radicalized and molecular chemistry of graphene is the chemistry of
dangling bonds. The chapter presents the description of the
molecular-theory-dangling-bond view on graphene molecule hydrogenation and
oxidation. Specific peculiarities of the graphene molecular chemistry related
to size-dependent topochemical features are discussed, as well
