The structure of spherical micelles of the diblock copolymer
poly(styrene-block-acrylic acid) in water was investigated with small angle
neutron scattering (SANS) and contrast matching. We have monitored
inter-micelle correlation and the extension of the polyelectrolyte chains in
the coronal layer through the overlap concentration. Irrespective of ionic
strength, the corona shrinks with increasing packing fraction. Furthermore, at
high charge and minimal screening conditions, the corona layers interpenetrate
once the volume fraction exceeds the critical value 0.53.
