The ALICE experiment has measured quarkonia production in pp and Pb-Pb
collisions at the CERN LHC, in the rapidity ranges |y|<0.9 and 2.5<y<4.
Quarkonia are considered to be a sensitive probe of deconfinement, and a
detailed differential study of their yields can give important information on
the properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. In this paper, we
will mainly discuss the centrality dependence of the J/psi nuclear modification
factors, as well as their p_T and y dependence in bins of centrality, which
will be then compared to theoretical models. Preliminary results on the J/psi
elliptic flow and on psi(2S) production will also be shown.
