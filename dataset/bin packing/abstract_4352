Claims by the DAMA (DArk MAtter) collaboration to have detected an annually
varying signal consistent with models of dark matter appear to be at variance
with results from other dark-matter searches. To further understand the DAMA
results, we have carried out an independent analysis of DAMA data reconstructed
from published figures. In addition to reexamining the Lomb-Scargle and
chi-square analyses previously carried out by the DAMA collaboration, we carry
out two new likelihood analyses and a new chi-square analysis, focusing
attention on the treatment of experimental errors and binning. We confirm the
existence of an annual oscillation, with a maximum in early June, but at a
lower significance level than previously reported.
