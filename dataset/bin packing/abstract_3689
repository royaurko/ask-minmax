If $\gamma$-ray bursts are at cosmological distances, then not only their
constituent pulses but also the intervals between pulses should be
time-dilated. Unlike time-dilation measures of pulse emission, intervals would
appear to require negligible correction for redshift of narrower temporal
structure from higher energy into the band of observation. However, stretching
of pulse intervals is inherently difficult to measure without incurring a
timescale-dependent bias since, as time profiles are stretched, more structure
can appear near the limit of resolution. This problem is compounded in dimmer
bursts because identification of significant structures becomes more
problematic. We attempt to minimize brightness bias by equalizing
signal-to-noise (s/n) level of all bursts. We analyze wavelet-denoised burst
profiles binned to several resolutions, identifying significant fluctuations
between pulse structures and interjacent valleys. When bursts are ranked by
peak flux, an interval time-dilation signature is evident, but its magnitude
and significance are dependent upon temporal resolution and s/n level.
