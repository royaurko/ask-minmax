The polarisation of prompt $\psi(2S)$ mesons is measured by performing an
angular analysis of $\psi(2S)\rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ decays using
proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0
fb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV.
The polarisation is measured in bins of transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}$ and
rapidity $y$ in the kinematic region $3.5<p_\mathrm{T}<15$ GeV$/c$ and
$2.0<y<4.5$, and is compared to theoretical models. No significant polarisation
is observed.
