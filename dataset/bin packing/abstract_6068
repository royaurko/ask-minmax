Spin-averaged asymmetries in the azimuthal distributions of positive and
negative hadrons produced in deep inelastic scattering were measured using the
CERN SPS muon beam at $160$ GeV/c and a $^6$LiD target. The amplitudes of the
three azimuthal modulations $\cos\phi_h$, $\cos2\phi_h$ and $\sin\phi_h$ were
obtained binning the data separately in each of the relevant kinematic
variables $x$, $z$ or $p_T^{\,h}$ and binning in a three-dimensional grid of
these three variables. The amplitudes of the $\cos \phi_h$ and $\cos 2\phi_h$
modulations show strong kinematic dependencies both for positive and negative
hadrons.
