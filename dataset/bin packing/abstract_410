We determine the form of the complex shear modulus $G^*$ in soft sphere
packings near jamming. Viscoelastic response at finite frequency is closely
tied to a packing's intrinsic relaxational modes, which are distinct from the
vibrational modes of undamped packings. We demonstrate and explain the
appearance of an anomalous excess of slowly relaxing modes near jamming,
reflected in a diverging relaxational density of states. From the density of
states, we derive the dependence of $G^*$ on frequency and distance to the
jamming transition, which is confirmed by numerics.
