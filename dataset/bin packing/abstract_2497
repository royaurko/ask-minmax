In this paper, we study the M-brane description of the Wilson-Polyakov
surfaces in six-dimensional (2, 0) field theory at finite temperature. We
investigate the membrane solution dual to a straight Wilons-Polyakov surface
and compute the interaction potential between two parallel straight strings by
using AdS/CFT correspondence. Furthermore we discuss the M5-brane solutions
dual to various Wilson-Polyakov surfaces. Finally we obtain an universal result
about M5-brane solutions in generic backgrounds.
