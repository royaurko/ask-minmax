We determine to within a constant factor the threshold for the property that
two random k-uniform hypergraphs with edge probability p have an edge-disjoint
packing into the same vertex set. More generally, we allow the hypergraphs to
have different densities. In the graph case, we prove a stronger result, on
packing a random graph with a fixed graph.
