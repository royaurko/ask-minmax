We have observed the optical pulse profile of PSR B0656+14 in 10 phase bins
at a high signal-to-noise ratio, and have measured the linear polarization
profile over 30% of the pulsar period with some significance. The pulse profile
is double-peaked, with a bridge of emission between the two peaks, similar to
gamma-ray profiles observed in other pulsars. There is no detectable unpulsed
flux, to a 1-sigma limit of 16% of the pulse-averaged flux. The emission in the
bridge is highly (~ 100%) polarized, with a position angle sweep in excellent
agreement with the prediction of the Rotating Vector Model as determined from
radio polarization observations. We are able to account for the gross features
of the optical light curve (i.e., the phase separation of the peaks) using both
polar cap and outer gap models. Using the polar cap model, we are also able to
estimate the height of the optical emission regions.
