In this dissertation, we tackle the problem of describing the equations of
the Rees algebra of I for I =(J,y), with J being of linear type. Throughout,
such ideals are referred to as ideals of almost-linear type.
  In Theorem A, we give a full description of the equations of Rees algebras of
ideals of the form I = (J,y), with J satisfying an homological vanishing
condition. Theorem A permits us to recover and extend well-known results about
families of ideals of almost-linear type due to W.V. Vasconcelos, S. Huckaba,
N.V. Trung, W. Heinzer and M.-K. Kim, among others.
  In Theorem B, we prove that the injectivity of a single component of the
canonical morphism from the symmetric algebra of I to the Rees algebra of I,
propagates downwards, provided I is of almost-linear type. In particular, this
result gives a partial answer to a question posed by A.B. Tchernev.
  Packs of examples are introduced in each section, illustrating the scope and
applications of each of the results presented. The contributor also gives a
collection of computations and examples which motivate ongoing and future
research.
