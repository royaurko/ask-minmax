In the study of deterministic distributed algorithms it is commonly assumed
that each node has a unique $O(\log n)$-bit identifier. We prove that for a
general class of graph problems, local algorithms (constant-time distributed
algorithms) do not need such identifiers: a port numbering and orientation is
sufficient.
  Our result holds for so-called simple PO-checkable graph optimisation
problems; this includes many classical packing and covering problems such as
vertex covers, edge covers, matchings, independent sets, dominating sets, and
edge dominating sets. We focus on the case of bounded-degree graphs and show
that if a local algorithm finds a constant-factor approximation of a simple
PO-checkable graph problem with the help of unique identifiers, then the same
approximation ratio can be achieved on anonymous networks.
  As a corollary of our result and by prior work, we derive a tight lower bound
on the local approximability of the minimum edge dominating set problem.
  Our main technical tool is an algebraic construction of homogeneously ordered
graphs: We say that a graph is $(\alpha,r)$-homogeneous if its nodes are
linearly ordered so that an $\alpha$ fraction of nodes have pairwise isomorphic
radius-$r$ neighbourhoods. We show that there exists a finite
$(\alpha,r)$-homogeneous $2k$-regular graph of girth at least $g$ for any
$\alpha < 1$ and any $r$, $k$, and $g$.
