We study the elastic scattering of atomic argon by electron in the presence
of a bichromatic laser field in the second Born approximation. The target atom
is approximated by a simple screening potential and the continuum states of the
impinging and emitting electrons are described as Volkov states. We evaluate
the S-matrix elements numerically. The dependence of differential cross section
on the relative phase between the two laser components is presented. The
results obtained in the first and second Born approximation are compared and
analysed.
