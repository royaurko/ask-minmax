To describe structural peculiarities in inhomogeneous media caused by the
tendency to the close packing of atoms a formalism based on the using of the
Riemann geometry methods (which were successfully applied lately to the
description of structures of quasicrystals and glasses) is developed. Basing on
this formalism we find in particular the criterion of stability of precipitates
of the Frank-Kasper phases in metallic systems. The nature of the ''rhenium
effect'' in W-Re alloys is discussed.
