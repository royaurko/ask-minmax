We study discrete alloy-type random Schr\"odinger operators on
$\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. Wegner estimates are bounds on the average number of
eigenvalues in an energy interval of finite box restrictions of these types of
operators. If the single site potential is compactly supported and the
distribution of the coupling constant is of bounded variation a Wegner estimate
holds. The bound is polynomial in the volume of the box and thus applicable as
an ingredient for a localisation proof via multiscale analysis.
