We investigate the capacity of a multiple access channel with cooperating
encoders where partial state information is known to each encoder and full
state information is known to the decoder. The cooperation between the encoders
has a two-fold purpose: to generate empirical state coordination between the
encoders, and to share information about the private messages that each encoder
has. For two-way cooperation, this two-fold purpose is achieved by
double-binning, where the first layer of binning is used to generate the state
coordination similarly to the two-way source coding, and the second layer of
binning is used to transmit information about the private messages. The
complete result provides the framework and perspective for addressing a complex
level of cooperation that mixes states and messages in an optimal way.
