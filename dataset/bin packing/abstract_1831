We consider extensions of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric model (NMSSM) in
which the observed neutrino masses are generated through a TeV scale inverse
seesaw mechanism. The new particles associated with this mechanism can have
sizable couplings to the Higgs field which can yield a large contribution to
the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson. With this new contribution, a 126
GeV Higgs is possible along with order of 200 GeV masses for the stop quarks
for a broad range of \tan\beta. The Higgs production and decay in the diphoton
channel can be enhanced due to this new contribution. It is also possible to
solve the little hierarchy problem in this model without invoking a maximal
value for the NMSSM trilinear coupling and without severe restrictions on the
value of \tan\beta.
