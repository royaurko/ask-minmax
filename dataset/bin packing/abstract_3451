Fashion discounters face the problem of ordering the right amount of pieces
in each size of a product. The product is ordered in pre-packs containing a
certain size-mix of a product. For this so-called lot-type design problem, a
stochastic mixed integer linear programm was developed, in which price cuts
serve as recourse action for oversupply. Our goal is to answer the question,
whether the resulting supply strategy leads to a supply that is significantly
more consistent with the demand for sizes compared to the original manual
planning. Since the total profit is influenced by too many factors unrelated to
sizes (like the popularity of the product, the weather or a changing economic
situation), we suggest a comparison method which excludes many outer effects by
construction. We apply the method to a real-world field study: The improvements
in the size distributions of the supply are significant.
