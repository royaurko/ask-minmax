Azimuthal anisotropies of reconstructed jets [$v_{n}^{jet} (n=2, 3)$] have
been investigated in Pb+Pb collisions at the center of mass energy
$\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV within a framework of a multiphase transport
(AMPT) model. The $v_{2}^{jet}$ is in good agreement with the recent ATLAS
data. However, the $v_{3}^{jet}$ shows a smaller magnitude than $v_{2}^{jet}$,
and approaches zero at a larger transverse momentum. It is attributed to the
path-length dependence in which the jet energy loss fraction depends on the
azimuthal angles with respect to different orders of event planes. The ratio
$v_{n}^{jet}/\varepsilon_{n}$ increases from peripheral to noncentral
collisions, and $v_{n}^{jet}$ increases with the initial spatial asymmetry
($\varepsilon_{n}$) for a given centrality bin. These behaviors indicate that
the $v_{n}^{jet}$ is produced by the strong interactions between jet and the
partonic medium with different initial geometry shapes. Therefore, azimuthal
anisotropies of reconstructed jet are proposed as a good probe to study the
initial spatial fluctuations, which are expected to provide constraints on the
path-length dependence of jet quenching models.
