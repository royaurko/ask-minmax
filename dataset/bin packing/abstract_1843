To meet requirements of high performance THz-FEL (Free Electron Laser), a
compact scheme of FEL injector was proposed. Thermionic cathode was chosen to
emit electrons instead of photo-cathode with complex structure and high cost.
The effective bunch charge was improved to ~200pC by adopting enhanced EC-ITC
(External Cathode Independently Tunable Cells) RF gun to extract micro-bunches,
and back bombardment effects were almost eliminated as well. Constant gradient
accelerator structures were designed to improve energy to ~14MeV, while
focusing system was applied for emittance suppressing and bunch state
maintenance. Physical design and beam dynamics of key components for FEL
injector were analyzed. Furthermore, start-to-end simulations with multi-pulses
were performed by using homemade MATLAB and Parmela. The results show that
continual high brightness electron bunches with low energy spread and emittance
could be obtained stably.
