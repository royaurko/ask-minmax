Frame dependence of parton cascade results is studied for different schemes
of doing cascade simulations. We show that different schemes do not always
agree and results may have strong frame dependence. When the interaction range
is on the order of mean free path and the collisions are done in the two
particle center of mass frame, the results are not sensitive to the global
frame that the collisions are ordered. Effects of different differential cross
sections are also discussed.
