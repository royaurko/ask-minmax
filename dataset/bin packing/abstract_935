We consider the problem of solving packing/covering LPs online, when the
columns of the constraint matrix are presented in random order. This problem
has received much attention: the main open question is to figure out how large
the right-hand sides of the LPs have to be (compared to the entries on the
left-hand side of the constraint) to get $(1+\epsilon)$-approximations online?
It is known that the RHS has to be $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2} \log m)$ times the
left-hand sides, where $m$ is the number of constraints.
  In this paper we give a primal-dual algorithm to achieve this bound for all
packing LPs, and also for a class of mixed packing/covering LPs. Our algorithms
construct dual solutions using a regret-minimizing online learning algorithm in
a black-box fashion, and use them to construct primal solutions. The
adversarial guarantee that holds for the constructed duals help us to take care
of most of the correlations that arise in the algorithm; the remaining
correlations are handled via martingale concentration and maximal inequalities.
These ideas lead to conceptually simple and modular algorithms, which we hope
will be useful in other contexts.
