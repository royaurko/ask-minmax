The event-by-event analysis of heavy ions collisions is becoming possible
with advent of large acceptance detectors: it can provide dynamical information
which cannot be obtained from inclusive spectra. We identify some observables
which can be related to standard thermodynamical fluctuations and therefore may
provide information about properties of hadronic matter at the freeze-out
stage. Among those are fluctuations of ``apparent temperature'' (the $p_t$
slope), as well as the population of different bins of the pion momentum
distribution.
