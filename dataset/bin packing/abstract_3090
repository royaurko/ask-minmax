Due to the non-linearity of Hertzian contacts, the speed of sound in granular
matter increases with pressure. Under gravity, the non-linear elastic
description predicts that acoustic propagation is only possible through surface
modes, called Rayleigh-Hertz modes and guided by the index gradient. Here we
directly evidence these modes in a controlled laboratory experiment and use
them to probe the elastic properties of a granular packing under vanishing
confining pressure. The shape and the dispersion relation of both transverse
and sagittal modes are compared to the prediction of non-linear elasticity that
includes finite size effects. This allows to test the existence of a shear
stiffness anomaly close to the jamming transition.
