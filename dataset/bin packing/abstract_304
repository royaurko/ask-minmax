We introduce a new method from number fields and codes to construct dense
packings in the Euclidean spaces. Via the canonical $\mathbb{Q}$-embedding of
arbitrary number field $K$ into $\mathbb{R}^{[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$, both the prime
ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ and its residue field $\kappa$ can be embedded as discrete
subsets in $\mathbb{R}^{[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$. Thus we can concatenate the embedding
image of the Cartesian product of $n$ copies of $\mathfrak{p}$ together with
the image of a length $n$ code over $\kappa$. This concatenation leads to a
packing in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$. Moreover, we extend
the single concatenation to multiple concatenation to obtain dense packings and
asymptotically good packing families. For instance, with the help of \Magma{},
we construct one $256$-dimension packing denser than the Barnes-Wall lattice
BW$_{256}$.
