Although the existence of 13-atom icosahedral clusters in one-component
close-packed undercooled liquids was predicted more than half a century ago by
Frank, the existence of such icosahedral clusters is less clear in liquid
alloys. We study the lowest-energy structures of 13-atom AxB13-x Lennard-Jones
binary clusters using the modified space-fixed genetic algorithm and the
artificial Lennard-Jones potential designed by Kob and Andersen. Curiously, the
lowest-energy structures are non-icosahedral for almost all compositions. The
role played by the icosahedral cluster in a binary glass is questionable.
