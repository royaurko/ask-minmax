Twilight/night sky images are often used for flat-fielding CCD images, but
the brightness gradient in twilight/night sky causes problems of accurate
flat-field correction in astronomical images for wide-field telescopes. Using
data from the Antarctic Survey Telescope (AST3), we found that when the sky
brightness gradient is minimum and stable, there is still a gradient of 1%
across AST3's field-of-view of 4.3 square degrees. We tested various approaches
to remove the varying gradients in individual flat-field images. Our final
optimal method can reduce the spatially dependent errors caused by the gradient
to the negligible level. We also suggest a guideline of flat-fielding using
twilight/night sky images for wide-field robotic autonomous telescopes.
