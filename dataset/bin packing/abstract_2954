A model assuming incremental plastic isotropic response has been recently
proposed to model the deformation of isotropic packing of grains, in the
small-strain range. It is used here on over-consolidated remould clay, to
interpret the small-strain range behaviour obtained in [1,2] on Bangkok clay.
The data published in [1,2] at constant volume are also used here to measure
the size of the domain of validity in the (q/(M'p), p/po) plane, where po is
the over-consolidation isotropic pressure, p is the mean stress and q the
deviatoric stress, q . So, it is shown that the model works also for clay. This
enlarges the application domain of model [3,4] to soft clay with OCR larger
than 1.2 to 1.5. Pacs # : 45.70.-n ; 62.20.Fe ; 83.80.Fg, 83.80.Hj
