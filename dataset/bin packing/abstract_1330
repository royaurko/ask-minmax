This paper determines values of intersection exponents between packs of
planar Brownian motions in the half-plane and in the plane that were not
derived in our first two papers. For instance, it is proven that the exponent
$\xi (3,3)$ describing the asymptotic decay of the probability of
non-intersection between two packs of three independent planar Brownian motions
each is $(73-2 \sqrt {73}) / 12$. More generally, the values of $\xi (w_1,
>..., w_k)$ and $\tx (w_1', ..., w_k')$ are determined for all $ k \ge 2$,
$w_1, w_2\ge 1$, $w_3, ...,w_k\in[0,\infty)$ and all
$w_1',...,w_k'\in[0,\infty)$. The proof relies on the results derived in our
first two papers and applies the same general methods. We first find the
two-sided exponents for the stochastic Loewner evolution processes in a
half-plane, from which the Brownian intersection exponents are determined via a
universality argument.
