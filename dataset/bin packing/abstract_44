All real time tasks which are termed as critical tasks by nature have to
complete its execution before its deadline, even in presence of faults. The
most popularly used real time task assignment algorithms are First Fit (FF),
Best Fit (BF), Bin Packing (BP).The common task scheduling algorithms are Rate
Monotonic (RM), Earliest Deadline First (EDF) etc.All the current approaches
deal with either fault tolerance or criticality in real time. In this paper we
have proposed an integrated approach with a new algorithm, called SASA (Sorting
And Sequential Assignment) which maps the real time task assignment with task
schedule and fault tolerance
