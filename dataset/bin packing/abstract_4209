After our first discovery of superconductivity (SC) with $T_C$=3.7 K in
TlNi$_2$Se$_2$, we grew successfully a series of TlNi$_2$Se$_{2-x}$S$_x$ (0.0
$\leq$ x $\leq$2.0) single crystals. The measurements of resistivity,
susceptibility and specific heat were carried out. We found that SC with
$T_C$=2.3 K also emerges in TlNi$_2$S$_2$ crystal, which appears to involve
heavy electrons with an effective mass $m^*$=13$\sim$25 $m_b$, as inferred from
the normal state electronic specific heat and the upper critical field,
$H_{C2}(T)$. It was found that the $T_C$ and superconducting volume fraction in
TlNi$_2$Se$_{2-x}$S$_x$ crystals changes with the disorder degree induced by
the partial substitution of S for Se, which is characterized by the residual
resistivity ratio (\textit{RRR}). The effect of the disorder on SC may provide
some information for understanding the mechanism of SC in this new
Ni-chalcogenide system.
