Several remote sensing software packages are used to the explicit purpose of
analyzing and visualizing remotely sensed data, with the developing of remote
sensing sensor technologies from last ten years. Accord-ing to literature, the
remote sensing is still the lack of software tools for effective information
extraction from remote sensing data. So, this paper provides a state-of-art of
multi-sensor image fusion technologies as well as review on the quality
evaluation of the single image or fused images in the commercial remote sensing
pack-ages. It also introduces program (ALwassaiProcess) developed for image
fusion and classification.
