We report extensive numerical simulations in the {\it glass} region for a
simple model of short-ranged attractive colloids, the square well model. We
investigate the behavior of the density autocorrelation function and of the
static structure factor in the region of temperatures and packing fractions
where a glass-glass transition is expected according to theoretical
predictions. We strengthen our observations by studying both waiting time and
history dependence of the numerical results. We provide evidence supporting the
possibility that activated bond-breaking processes destabilize the attractive
glass, preventing the full observation of a sharp glass-glass kinetic
transition.
