This paper introduces the use of cable dynamics models as a means to explore
the mechanics of DNA on long-length scales. It is on these length scales that
DNA forms twisted and curved three-dimensional shapes known as supercoils and
loops. These long-length scale DNA structures have a pronounced influence on
the functions of this molecule within the cell including the packing of DNA in
the cell nucleus, transcription, replication and gene repair. We provide a
short background to the mechanics of DNA and suggest the logical connection to
the mechanics of a low tension cable. A computational model is then summarized
and example results are presented for DNA supercoiling and looping.
