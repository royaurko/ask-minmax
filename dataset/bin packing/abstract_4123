Weak selection, which means a phenotype is slightly advantageous over
another, is an important limiting case in evolutionary biology. Recently it has
been introduced into evolutionary game theory. In evolutionary game dynamics,
the probability to be imitated or to reproduce depends on the performance in a
game. The influence of the game on the stochastic dynamics in finite
populations is governed by the intensity of selection. In many models of both
unstructured and structured populations, a key assumption allowing analytical
calculations is weak selection, which means that all individuals perform
approximately equally well. In the weak selection limit many different
microscopic evolutionary models have the same or similar properties. How
universal is weak selection for those microscopic evolutionary processes? We
answer this question by investigating the fixation probability and the average
fixation time not only up to linear, but also up to higher orders in selection
intensity. We find universal higher order expansions, which allow a rescaling
of the selection intensity. With this, we can identify specific models which
violate (linear) weak selection results, such as the one--third rule of
coordination games in finite but large populations.
