The problem of close-packed dimers on the honeycomb lattice was solved by
Kasteleyn in 1963. Here we extend the solution to include interactions between
neighboring dimers in two spatial lattice directions. The solution is obtained
by using the method of Bethe ansatz and by converting the dimer problem into a
five-vertex problem. The complete phase diagram is obtained and it is found
that a new frozen phase, in which the attracting dimers prevail, arises when
the interaction is attractive. For repulsive dimer interactions a new
first-order line separating two frozen phases occurs. The transitions are
continuous and the critical behavior in the disorder regime is found to be the
same as in the case of noninteracting dimers characterized by a specific heat
exponent $\a=1/2$.
