We study the implications of the inverse seesaw mechanism (ISS) on the
sparticle spectrum in the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(CMSSM) and Non-Universal Higgs Model (NUHM2). Employing the maximal value of
the Dirac Yukawa coupling involving the up type Higgs doublet provides a 2-3
GeV enhancement of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass. This effect permits
one to have lighter colored sparticles in the CMSSM and NUHM2 scenarios with
LSP neutralino, which can be tested at LHC14. We present a variety of LHC
testable benchmark points with the desired LSP neutralino dark matter relic
abundance.
