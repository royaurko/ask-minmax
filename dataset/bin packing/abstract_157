We study static packings of frictionless and frictional spheres in three
dimensions, obtained via molecular dynamics simulations, in which we vary
particle hardness, friction coefficient, and coefficient of restitution.
Although frictionless packings of hard-spheres are always isostatic (with six
contacts) regardless of construction history and restitution coefficient,
frictional packings achieve a multitude of hyperstatic packings that depend on
system parameters and construction history. Instead of immediately dropping to
four, the coordination number reduces smoothly from $z=6$ as the friction
coefficient $\mu$ between two particles is increased.
