We investigate the energy structures and the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC) in a triple-well potential coupled a high finesse optical
cavity within a mean field approach. Due to the intrinsic atom-cavity field
nonlinearity, several interesting phenomena arise which are the focuses of this
work. For the energy structure, the bistability appears in the energy levels
due to this atoms-cavity field nonlinearity, and the same phenomena can be
found in the intra-cavity photons number. With an increase of the pump-cavity
detunings, the higher and lower energy levels show a loop structure due to this
cavity-mediated effects. In the dynamical process, an extensive numerical
simulation of localization of the BECs for atoms initially trapped in one-,
two-, and three-wells are performed for the symmetric and asymmetric cases in
detail. It is shown that the the transition from oscillation to the
localization can be modified by the cavity-mediated potential, which will
enlarge the regions of oscillation. With the increasing of the atomic
interaction, the oscillation is blocked and the localization emerges. The
condensates atoms can be trapped either in one-, two-, or in three wells
eventually where they are initially uploaded for certain parameters. In
particular, we find that the transition from the oscillation to the
localization is accompanied with some irregular regime where tunneling dynamics
is dominated by chaos for this cavity-mediated system.
