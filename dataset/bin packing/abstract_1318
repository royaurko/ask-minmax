Fully packed trails on the square lattice are known to be described, in the
long distance limit, by a collection of free non compact bosons and symplectic
fermions, and thus exhibit some properties reminiscent of Brownian motion, like
vanishing fuseau exponents. We investigate in this paper the situation for
their non-intersection exponents. Our approach is purely numerical, and based
both on transfer matrix and Monte Carlo calculations. We find some evidence for
non-intersection exponents given by CFT formulas similar to the Brownian case,
albeit slightly different in their details.
