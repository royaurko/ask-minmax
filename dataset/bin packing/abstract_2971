The Exact-Exchange (EXX) Kohn-Sham formalism, which treats exchange
interactions exactly within density-functional theory, is applied to
one-dimensional periodic systems. The underlying implementation does not rely
on specific symmetries of the considered system and can be applied to any kind
of periodic structure in one to three dimensions. As a test system,
$trans$-polyacetylene, both in form of an isolated chain and in the bulk
geometry has been investigated. Within the EXX scheme, bandstructures and
independent particle response functions are calculated and compared to
experimental data as well as to data calculated by several other methods.
Compared to results from the local-density approximation, the EXX method leads
to an increased value for the band gap, in line with similar observations for
three-dimensional semiconductors. An inclusion of correlation potentials within
the local density approximation or generalized gradient approximations leads to
only negligible effects in the bandstructure. The EXX band gaps are in good
agreement with experimental data for bulk $trans$-polyacetylene. Packing
effects of the chains in bulk $trans$-polyacetylene are found to lower the band
gap by about 0.5 eV.
