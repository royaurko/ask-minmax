Pupil-remapping is a new high-dynamic range imaging technique that has
recently demonstrated feasibility on sky. The current prototypes present
however deceiving limiting magnitude, restricting the current use to the
brightest stars in the sky. We propose to combine pupil-remapping with
spatio-spectral encoding, a technique first applied to the VEGA/CHARA
interferometer. The result is an instrument proposal, called "Dividing
Interferometer for Stars Characterizations and Observations" (DISCO). The idea
is to take profit of wavelength multiplexing when using a spectrograph in order
to pack as much as possible the available information, yet providing a
potential boost of 1.5 magnitude if used in existing prototypes. We detail in
this paper the potential of such a concept.
