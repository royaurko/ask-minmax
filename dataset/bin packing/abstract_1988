A density functional theory for a mixture of hard rods and polymers modeled
as chains built of hard tangent spheres is proposed by combining the functional
due to Yu and Wu for the polymer mixtures [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 117}, 2368
(2002)] with the Schmidt's functional [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 63}, 50201 (2001)] for
rod-sphere mixtures. As a simple application of the functional, the demixing
transition into polymer-rich and rod-rich phases is examined. When the chain
length increases, the phase boundary broadens and the critical packing fraction
decreases. The shift of the critical point of a demixing transition is most
noticeable for short chains.
