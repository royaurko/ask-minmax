We present a high time resolution study of the two brightest $\gamma$-ray
outbursts from a blazar PKS 1222+216 observed by the \textit{Fermi} Large Area
Telescope (LAT) in 2010. The $\gamma$-ray light-curves obtained in four
different energy bands: 0.1--3, 0.1--0.3, 0.3--1 and 1--3 GeV, with time bin of
6 hr, show asymmetric profiles with a similar rise time in all the bands but a
rapid decline during the April flare and a gradual one during the June. The
light-curves during the April flare show $\sim 2$ days long plateau in 0.1--0.3
GeV emission, erratic variations in 0.3--1 GeV emission, and a daily recurring
feature in 1--3 GeV emission until the rapid rise and decline within a day. The
June flare shows a monotonic rise until the peak, followed by a gradual decline
powered mainly by the multi-peak 0.1--0.3 GeV emission. The peak fluxes during
both the flares are similar except in the 1--3 GeV band in April which is twice
the corresponding flux during the June flare. Hardness ratios during the April
flare indicate spectral hardening in the rising phase followed by softening
during the decay. We attribute this behavior to the development of a shock
associated with an increase in acceleration efficiency followed by its decay
leading to spectral softening. The June flare suggests hardening during the
rise followed by a complicated energy dependent behavior during the decay.
Observed features during the June flare favor multiple emission regions while
the overall flaring episode can be related to jet dynamics.
