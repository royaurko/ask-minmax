We examine a simple hard disc fluid with no long range interactions on the
two dimensional space of constant negative Gaussian curvature, the hyperbolic
plane. This geometry provides a natural mechanism by which global crystalline
order is frustrated, allowing us to construct a tractable model of disordered
monodisperse hard discs. We extend free area theory and the virial expansion to
this regime, deriving the equation of state for the system, and compare its
predictions with simulation near an isostatic packing in the curved space.
Additionally, we investigate packing and dynamics on triply periodic,
negatively curved surfaces with an eye toward real biological and polymeric
systems.
