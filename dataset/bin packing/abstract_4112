For random walks on networks (graphs), it is a theoretical challenge to
explicitly determine the mean first-passage time (MFPT) between two nodes
averaged over all pairs. In this paper, we study the MFPT of random walks in
the famous T-graph, linking this important quantity to the resistance distance
in electronic networks. We obtain an exact formula for the MFPT that is
confirmed by extensive numerical calculations. The interesting quantity is
derived through the recurrence relations resulting from the self-similar
structure of the T-graph. The obtained closed-form expression exhibits that the
MFPT approximately increases as a power-law function of the number of nodes,
with the exponent lying between 1 and 2. Our research may shed light on the
deeper understanding of random walks on the T-graph.
