In a single optical spectrum, the quasar narrow-line region (NLR) reveals low
density, photoionized gas in the host galaxy interstellar medium, while the
immediate vicinity of the central engine generates the accretion disk continuum
and broad emission lines. To isolate these two components, we construct a
library of high S/N optical composite spectra created from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS-DR7). We divide the sample into bins of continuum luminosity
and Hbeta FWHM that are used to construct median composites at different
redshift steps up to 0.75. We measure the luminosities of the narrow-emission
lines [NeV]3427, [NeIII]3870, [OIII]5007, and [OII]3728 with ionization
potentials (IPs) of 97, 40, 35, and 13.6 eV respectively. The high IP lines'
luminosities show no evidence of increase with redshift consistent with no
evolution in the AGN SED or the host galaxy ISM illuminated by the continuum.
In contrast, we find that the [OII] line becomes stronger at higher redshifts,
and we interpret this as a consequence of enhanced star formation contributing
to the [OII] emission in host galaxies at higher redshifts. The SFRs estimated
from the [OII] luminosities show a flatter increase with z than non-AGN
galaxies given our assumed AGN contribution to the [OII] luminosity. Finally,
we confirm an inverse correlation between the strength of the FeII4570 complex
and both the [OIII] EW (though not the luminosity) and the width of the Hbeta
line as known from the eigenvector 1 correlations.
