We study the evolution with redshift of three measures of gamma-ray burst
(GRB) duration ($T_{\rm 90}$, $T_{\rm 50}$ and $T_{\rm R45}$) in a fixed rest
frame energy band for a sample of 232 Swift/BAT detected GRBs. Binning the data
in redshift we demonstrate a trend of increasing duration with increasing
redshift that can be modelled with a power-law for all three measures.
Comparing redshift defined subsets of rest-frame duration reveals that the
observed distributions of these durations are broadly consistent with
cosmological time dilation. To ascertain if this is an instrumental effect, a
similar analysis of Fermi/GBM data for the 57 bursts detected by both
instruments is conducted, but inconclusive due to small number statistics. We
then investigate under-populated regions of the duration redshift parameter
space. We propose that the lack of low-redshift, long duration GRBs is a
physical effect due to the sample being volume limited at such redshifts.
However, we also find that the high-redshift, short duration region of
parameter space suffers from censorship as any Swift GRB sample is
fundamentally defined by trigger criteria determined in the observer frame
energy band of Swift/BAT. As a result, we find that the significance of any
evidence for cosmological time dilation in our sample of duration measures
typically reduces to $<2\sigma$.
