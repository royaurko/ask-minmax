Questions surrounding the spatial disposition of particles in various
condensed-matter systems continue to pose many theoretical challenges. This
paper explores the geometric availability of amorphous many-particle
configurations that conform to a given pair correlation function g(r). Such a
study is required to observe the basic constraints of non-negativity for g(r)
as well as for its structure factor S(k). The hard sphere case receives special
attention, to help identify what qualitative features play significant roles in
determining upper limits to maximum amorphous packing densities. For that
purpose, a five-parameter test family of g's has been considered, which
incorporates the known features of core exclusion, contact pairs, and damped
oscillatory short-range order beyond contact. Numerical optimization over this
five-parameter set produces a maximum-packing value for the fraction of covered
volume, and about 5.8 for the mean contact number, both of which are within the
range of previous experimental and simulational packing results. However, the
corresponding maximum-density g(r) and S(k) display some unexpected
characteristics. A byproduct of our investigation is a lower bound on the
maximum density for random sphere packings in $d$ dimensions, which is sharper
than a well-known lower bound for regular lattice packings for d >= 3.
