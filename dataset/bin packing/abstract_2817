Crystalline order in dense packings of long polymers with a definite
handedness is difficult to reconcile with the tendency of these chiral objects
to twist and braid about each other. If the chirality is weak, the state of
lowest energy is a triangular lattice of rigid rods. When the chirality is
strong, however, screw dislocations proliferate, leading to either a tilt grain
boundary phase or a new "moire state" with twisted bond order. In the latter
case, polymer trajectories in the plane perpendicular to their average
direction are described by iterated moir\'e maps of remarkable complexity,
reminiscent of dynamical systems.
