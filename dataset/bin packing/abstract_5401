In this paper, we investigate problems of communication over physically
degraded, state-dependent broadcast channels (BCs) with cooperating decoders.
Two different setups are considered and their capacity regions are
characterized. First, we study a setting in which one decoder can use a finite
capacity link to send the other decoder information regarding the messages or
the channel states. In this scenario we analyze two cases: one where noncausal
state information is available to the encoder and the strong decoder and the
other where state information is available only to the encoder in a causal
manner. Second, we examine a setting in which the cooperation between the
decoders is limited to taking place before the outputs of the channel are
given. In this case, one decoder, which is informed of the state sequence
noncausally, can cooperate only to send the other decoder rate-limited
information about the state sequence. The proofs of the capacity regions
introduce a new method of coding for channels with cooperation between
different users, where we exploit the link between the decoders for
multiple-binning. Finally, we discuss the optimality of using rate splitting
techniques when coding for cooperative BCs. In particular, we show that rate
splitting is not necessarily optimal when coding for cooperative BCs by solving
an example in which our method of coding outperforms rate splitting.
