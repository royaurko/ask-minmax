We report the first entanglement generation experiment that utilizes a
silicon waveguide. Using spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1.09-cm-long silicon
wire waveguide, we generated 1.5-um, high-purity time-bin entangled photons
without temperature control, and observed a two-photon interference fringe with
>73% visibility.
