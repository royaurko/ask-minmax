We consider a brane world and its gravitational linear perturbations. We
present a general solution of the perturbations in the bulk and find the
complete perturbed junction conditions for generic brane dynamics. We also
prove that (spin 2) gravitational waves in the great majority of cases can only
arise in connection with a non-vanishing anisotropic stress. This has far
reaching consequences for inflation in the brane world. Moreover, contrary to
the case of the radion, perturbations are stable.
