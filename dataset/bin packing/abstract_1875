Let (g,[p]) be a finite-dimensional restricted Lie algebra defined over an
algebraically closed field K of characteristic p > 0, and G be the adjoint
group of g. A Borel subalgebra (or Borel for short) of g is defined as a
maximal solvable subalgebra containing a maximal torus of g. Generic Borel
subalgebras are by definition a class of Borel subalgebras containing so-called
generic Cartan subalgebras. In this paper, we first prove that a conjecture
Premet proposed in [17] on regular Cartan subalgebras is valid if and only if
it is the case when g has generic Cartan subalgebras. We further prove that all
maximal solvable subalgebras of g are Borels whenever p > dimg. We finally
classify the conjugay classes of Borel subalgebras of the restricted simple Lie
algebras W(n) under G-conjugation when p > 3, and present the representatives
of these classes. We also describe the closed connected solvable subgroups of G
associated with those representative Borel subalgebras.
