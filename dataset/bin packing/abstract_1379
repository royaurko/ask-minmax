In this paper we extend a classical theorem of Corr\'adi and Hajnal into the
setting of sparse random graphs. We show that if $p(n) \gg (\log n / n)^{1/2}$,
then asymptotically almost surely every subgraph of $G(n,p)$ with minimum
degree at least $(2/3 + o(1))np$ contains a triangle packing that covers all
but at most $O(p^{-2})$ vertices. Moreover, the assumption on $p$ is optimal up
to the $(\log n)^{1/2}$ factor and the presence of the set of $O(p^{-2})$
uncovered vertices is indispensable. The main ingredient in the proof, which
might be of independent interest, is an embedding theorem which says that if
one imposes certain natural regularity conditions on all three pairs in a
balanced 3-partite graph, then this graph contains a perfect triangle packing.
