According to different topological configurations, we suggest that there are
two kinds of extreme black holes in the nature. We find that the Euler
characteristic plays an essential role to classify these two kinds of extreme
black holes. For the first kind of extreme black holes, Euler characteristic is
zero, and for the second kind, Euler characteristic is two or one provided they
are four dimensional holes or two dimensional holes respectively.
