We propose a new exponential f(R) gravity model with f(R)=(R-\lambda
c)e^{\lambda(c/R)^n} and n>3, \lambda\geq 1, c>0 to explain late-time
acceleration of the universe. At the high curvature region, the model behaves
like the \LambdaCDM model. In the asymptotic future, it reaches a stable
de-Sitter spacetime. It is a cosmologically viable model and can evade the
local gravity constraints easily. This model share many features with other
f(R) dark energy models like Hu-Sawicki model and Exponential gravity model. In
it the dark energy equation of state is of an oscillating form and can cross
phantom divide line \omega_{de}=-1. In particular, in the parameter range 3<
n\leq 4, \lambda \sim 1, the model is most distinguishable from other models.
For instance, when n=4, \lambda=1, the dark energy equation of state will cross
-1 in the earlier future and has a stronger oscillating form than the other
models, the dark energy density in asymptotical future is smaller than the one
in the high curvature region. This new model can evade the local gravity tests
easily when n>3 and \lambda>1.
