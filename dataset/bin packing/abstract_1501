We present the galaxy-galaxy angular correlations as a function of
photometric redshift in a deep-wide galaxy survey centered on the Hubble Deep
Field South. Images were obtained with the Big Throughput Camera on the Blanco
4m telescope at CTIO, of 1/2 square degree in broad-band uBVRI, reaching ~24th
mag. Approximately 40,000 galaxies are detected in the survey. We determine
photometric redshifts using galaxy template fitting to the photometry. Monte
Carlo simulations show that redshifts from these data should be reliable out to
z~1, where the 4000 Angstrom break shifts into the I-band. The inferred
redshift distribution, n(z), shows good agreement with the distribution of
galaxies measured in the HDF North and the Canada-France Redshift Survey. After
assigning galaxies to redshift bins with width Delta_z=0.33, we determine the
two point angular correlation function in each bin. We find that the amplitude
of the correlation, A_w, drops across the three bins to redshift z~1. Simple
epsilon models of clustering evolution fit this result, with the best agreement
for epsilon=0. Hierarchical cold-dark-matter models best fit in a low density,
Lambda-dominated universe.
