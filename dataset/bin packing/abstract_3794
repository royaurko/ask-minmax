A measurement of the flux of neutrino-induced muons using the MACRO detector
is presented. Different event topologies, corresponding to different neutrino
parent energies can be detected. The upward throughgoing muon sample is the
larger event sample. The observed upward-throughgoing muons are 26% fewer than
expected and the zenith angle distribution does not fit with the expected one.
Assuming neutrino oscillations, both measurements suggest maximum mixing and
Dm2 of a few times 10-3 eV2. The other samples are due to the internally
produced events and to upward-going stopping muons. These data show a regular
deficit of observed events in each angular bin, as expected assuming neutrino
oscillations with maximum mixing, in agreement with the analysis of the
upward-throughgoing muon sample.
