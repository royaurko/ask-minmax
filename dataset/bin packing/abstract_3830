A Monte Carlo study of the azimuthal angular distribution around the virtual
boson-proton beam axis for dijet events in DIS at HERA is presented. In the
presence of typical acceptance cuts on the jets in the laboratory frame, the
azimuthal distribution is dominated by kinematic effects rather than the
typical $\cos\phi$ and $\cos 2\phi$ dependence predicted by the QCD matrix
elements. This implies that the $\phi$ dependent part of the QCD matrix
elements contributes even to the dijet production cross section. Neglecting
this $\phi$ dependence leads to an error of about 5-8\% in the production cross
section for typical acceptance cuts in the laboratory frame. We also present
first NLO results on the $\phi$-decorrelation of the jets through NLO effects.
