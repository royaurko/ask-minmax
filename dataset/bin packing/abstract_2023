The raise and peel model is a one-dimensional stochastic model of a
fluctuating interface with nonlocal interactions. This is an interesting
physical model. It's phase diagram has a massive phase and a gapless phase with
varying critical exponents. At the phase transition point, the model exhibits
conformal invariance which is a space-time symmetry. Also at this point the
model has several other facets which are the connections to associative
algebras, two-dimensional fully packed loop models and combinatorics.
