We study the problem of local alignment, which is finding pairs of similar
subsequences with gaps. The problem exists in biosequence databases. BLAST is a
typical software for finding local alignment based on heuristic, but could miss
results. Using the Smith-Waterman algorithm, we can find all local alignments
in O(mn) time, where m and n are lengths of a query and a text, respectively. A
recent exact approach BWT-SW improves the complexity of the Smith-Waterman
algorithm under constraints, but still much slower than BLAST. This paper takes
on the challenge of designing an accurate and efficient algorithm for
evaluating local-alignment searches, especially for long queries. In this
paper, we propose an efficient software called ALAE to speed up BWT-SW using a
compressed suffix array. ALAE utilizes a family of filtering techniques to
prune meaningless calculations and an algorithm for reusing score calculations.
We also give a mathematical analysis and show that the upper bound of the total
number of calculated entries using ALAE could vary from 4.50mn0.520 to
9.05mn0.896 for random DNA sequences and vary from 8.28mn0.364 to 7.49mn0.723
for random protein sequences. We demonstrate the significant performance
improvement of ALAE on BWT-SW using a thorough experimental study on real
biosequences. ALAE guarantees correctness and accelerates BLAST for most of
parameters.
