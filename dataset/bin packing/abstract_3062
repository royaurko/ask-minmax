We present ab initio calculations of the high-temperature axial c/a ratio of
hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) iron at Earth's core pressures, in order to help
interpret the observed seismic anisotropy of the inner core. The calculations
are based on density functional theory, which is known to predict the
properties of high-pressure iron with good accuracy. The temperature dependence
of c/a is determined by minimising the Helmholtz free energy at fixed volume
and temperature, with thermal contributions due to lattice vibrations
calculated using harmonic theory. Anharmonic corrections to the harmonic
predictions are estimated from calculations of the thermal average stress
obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of hcp iron at the
conditions of the inner core. We find a very gradual increase of axial ratio
with temperature. This increase is much smaller than found in earlier
calculations, but is in reasonable agreement with recent high-pressure,
high-temperature diffraction measurements. This result casts doubt on an
earlier interpretation of the seismic anisotropy of the inner core.
