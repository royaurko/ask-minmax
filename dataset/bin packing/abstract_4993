AIMS. The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain model
fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We
investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its
subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix.
Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix
is invertible. METHODS. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the
behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the
number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data
vectors. RESULTS. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator
of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the
number of bins (data vector variables), P, to the number of data sets, N. This
bias inevitably leads to an -- in extreme cases catastrophic -- underestimation
of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias
for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data
vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters
introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of
the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we
give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is
singular if P>N.
