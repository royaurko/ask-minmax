We use a sample of 45 core collapse supernovae detected with the Advanced
Camera for Surveys on-board the Hubble Space Telescope to derive the core
collapse supernova rate in the redshift range 0.1<z<1.3. In redshift bins
centered on <z>=0.39, <z>=0.73, and <z>=1.11, we find rates 3.00
{+1.28}{-0.94}{+1.04}{-0.57}, 7.39 {+1.86}{-1.52}{+3.20}{-1.60}, and 9.57
{+3.76}{-2.80}{+4.96}{-2.80}, respectively, given in units yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3}
10^{-4} h_{70}^3. The rates have been corrected for host galaxy extinction,
including supernovae missed in highly dust enshrouded environments in infrared
bright galaxies. The first errors represent statistical while the second are
the estimated systematic errors. We perform a detailed discussion of possible
sources of systematic errors and note that these start to dominate over
statistical errors at z>0.5, emphasizing the need to better control the
systematic effects. For example, a better understanding of the amount of dust
extinction in the host galaxies and knowledge of the supernova luminosity
function, in particular the fraction of faint M > -15 supernovae, is needed to
better constrain the rates. When comparing our results with the core collapse
supernova rate based on the star formation rate, we find a good agreement,
consistent with the supernova rate following the star formation rate, as
expected.
