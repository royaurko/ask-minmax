With the development of mobile sensing and mobile social networking
techniques, Mobile Crowd Sensing and Computing (MCSC), which leverages
heterogeneous crowdsourced data for large-scale sensing, has become a leading
paradigm. Built on top of the participatory sensing vision, MCSC has two
characterizing features: (1) it leverages heterogeneous crowdsourced data from
two data sources: participatory sensing and participatory social media; and (2)
it presents the fusion of human and machine intelligence (HMI) in both the
sensing and computing process. This paper characterizes the unique features and
challenges of MCSC. We further present early efforts on MCSC to demonstrate the
benefits of aggregating heterogeneous crowdsourced data.
