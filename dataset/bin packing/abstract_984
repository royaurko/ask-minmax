Forward-backward correlations of charged-particle multiplicities in symmetric
bins in pseudorapidity are studied in order to gain insight into the underlying
correlation structure of particle production in Au+Au collisions. The PHOBOS
detector is used to measure integrated multiplicities in bins centered at eta,
defined within |eta|<3, and covering intervals Delta-eta. The variance
sigma^2_C of a suitably defined forward-backward asymmetry variable C is
calculated as a function of eta, Delta-eta, and centrality. It is found to be
sensitive to short range correlations, and the concept of "clustering'' is used
to interpret comparisons to phenomenological models.
