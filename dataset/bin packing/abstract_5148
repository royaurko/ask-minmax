Previous studies have suggested a link between alcohol outlets and assaultive
violence. In this paper, we explore the effects of alcohol availability on
assault crimes at the census tract level over time. The statistical analysis is
challenged by several features of the data: (1) the effects of possible
covariates (for example, the alcohol outlet density of each census tract) on
the assaultive crime rates may be complex; (2) the covariates may be highly
correlated with each other; (3) there are a lot of missing inputs in the data;
and (4) spatial correlations exist in the outcome assaultive crime rates. We
propose a hierarchical additive model, where the nonlinear correlations and the
complex interaction effects are modeled using the multiple additive regression
trees (MART) and the spatial variances in the assaultive rates that cannot be
explained by the specified covariates are smoothed trough the Conditional
Autoregressive (CAR) model. We develop a two-stage algorithm that connect the
non-parametric trees with CAR to look for important variables covariates
associated with the assaultive crime rates, while taking account of the spatial
correlations among adjacent census tracts. The proposed methods are applied to
the Los Angeles assaultive data (1990-1999) and compared with traditional
method.
