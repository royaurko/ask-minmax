We investigate how well the redshift distributions of galaxies sorted into
photometric redshift bins can be determined from the galaxy angular two-point
correlation functions. We find that the uncertainty in the reconstructed
redshift distributions depends critically on the number of parameters used in
each redshift bin and the range of angular scales used, but not on the number
of photometric redshift bins. Using six parameters for each photometric
redshift bin, and restricting ourselves to angular scales over which the galaxy
number counts are normally distributed, we find that errors in the
reconstructed redshift distributions are large; i.e., they would be the
dominant source of uncertainty in cosmological parameters estimated from
otherwise ideal weak lensing or baryon acoustic oscillation data. However,
either by reducing the number of free parameters in each redshift bin, or by
(unjustifiably) applying our Gaussian analysis into the non-Gaussian regime, we
find that the correlation functions can be used to reconstruct the redshift
distributions with moderate precision; e.g., with mean redshifts determined to
around 0.01. We also find that dividing the galaxies into two spectral types,
and thereby doubling the number of redshift distribution parameters, can result
in a reduction in the errors in the combined redshift distributions.
