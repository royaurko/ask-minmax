Given a cake in form of a triangle and a box that fits the mirror image of
the cake, how to cut the cake into a minimal number of pieces so that it can be
put into the box? The cake has an icing, so that we are not allowed to put it
into the box upside down. V.G. Boltyansky asked this question in 1977 and
showed that three pieces always suffice. In this paper we provide examples of
cakes that cannot be cut into two pieces to put into the box. This shows that
three is the answer to V.G. Boltyansky's question. Also we give examples of
cakes which can be cut into two pieces.
