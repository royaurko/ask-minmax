We conduct experiments on two-dimensional packings of colloidal
thermosensitive hydrogel particles whose packing fraction can be tuned above
the jamming transition by varying the temperature. By measuring displacement
correlations between particles, we extract the vibrational properties of a
corresponding "shadow" system with the same configuration and interactions, but
for which the dynamics of the particles are undamped. The vibrational spectrum
and the nature of the modes are very similar to those predicted for
zero-temperature idealized sphere models and found in atomic and molecular
glasses; there is a boson peak at low frequency that shifts to higher frequency
as the system is compressed above the jamming transition.
