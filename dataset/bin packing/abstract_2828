We attempt to describe the stress distributions of granular packings using
lattice-based layer-by-layer stochastic models that satisfy the constraints of
force and torque balance and non-tensile forces at each site. The inherent
asymmetry in the layer-by-layer approach appears to lead to an asymmetric force
distribution, in disagreement with both experiments and general symmetry
considerations. The vertical force component probability distribution is robust
and in agreement with predictions of the scalar q model while the distribution
of horizontal force components is qualitatively different and depends on the
details of implementation.
