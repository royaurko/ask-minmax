We prove that every planar graph with maximum degree three has a planar
drawing in which the edges are drawn as circular arcs that meet at equal angles
around every vertex. Our construction is based on the Koebe-Thurston-Andreev
circle packing theorem, and uses a novel type of Voronoi diagram for circle
packings that is invariant under Moebius transformations, defined using
three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. We also use circle packing to construct
planar Lombardi drawings of a special class of 4-regular planar graphs, the
medial graphs of polyhedral graphs, and we show that not every 4-regular planar
graph has a Lombardi drawing. We have implemented our algorithm for 3-connected
planar cubic graphs.
