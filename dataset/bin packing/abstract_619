We describe a technique to produce narrow-band photon pairs with
frequency-bin entanglement, whose relative phase can be tuned using linear
polarization optics. We show that, making use of the polarization-frequency
coupling effect, the phase of a complex polarizer can be transferred into the
frequency entanglement.
