We calculate the angular power spectrum of galaxies selected from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) by using a quadratic estimation
method with KL-compression. The primary data sample includes over 18 million
galaxies covering more than 5,700 square degrees after masking areas with
bright objects, reddening greater than 0.2 magnitudes, and seeing of more than
1.5 arcseconds. We test for systematic effects by calculating the angular power
spectrum by SDSS stripe and find that these measurements are minimally affected
by seeing and reddening. We calculate the angular power spectrum for l \leq 200
multipoles by using 40 bandpowers for the full sample, and l \leq 1000
multipoles using 50 bandpowers for individual stripes. We also calculate the
angular power spectrum for this sample separated into 3 magnitude bins with
mean redshifts of z = 0.171, z = 0.217, and z = 0.261 to examine the evolution
of the angular power spectrum. We determine the theoretical linear angular
power spectrum by projecting the 3D power spectrum to two dimensions for a
basic comparison to our observational results. By minimizing the {\chi}^2 fit
between these data and the theoretical linear angular power spectrum we measure
a loosely-constrained fit of {\Omega}_m = 0.31^{+0.18}_{-0.11} with a linear
bias of b = 0.94 \pm 0.04.
