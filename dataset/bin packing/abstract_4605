The Cold Dark Matter paradigm successfully explains many phenomena on scales
larger than galaxies, but seems to predict galaxy halos which are more
centrally concentrated and have a lumpier substructure than observed. Endowing
cosmic dark matter with a small primordial velocity dispersion preserves the
successful predictions of the Cold Dark Matter scenario on large scales and
improves the agreement with halo structure. A ``phase density'' $Q$,
proportional to the inverse entropy for nonrelativistic matter, is estimated
for relativistically decoupled thermal or degenerate relic particles of mass
$m_X$, with a numerical factor depending on the particle type but no
cosmological parameters. Since $Q$ cannot increase for dissipationless,
collisionless matter, at a given velocity dispersion there is a maximum space
density; this ``phase packing'' constraint eliminates the singular density
predicted by CDM. The core radius and halo circular velocity scale analogously
to degenerate dwarf stars. Particle velocities also filter primordial
perturbations on a scale depending on $Q$ and on details of particle
distributions. Particle candidates for warm matter are briefly discussed; for
warm thermal relics to have the observed mass density requires decoupling prior
to the QCD epoch and therefore a superweak interaction with thermal Standard
Model particles.
