We use an extension of fundamental measure theory to lattice hard-core fluids
to study the phase diagram of two different systems. First, two-dimensional
parallel hard squares with edge-length $\sigma=2$ in a simple square lattice.
This system is equivalent to the lattice gas with first and second neighbor
exclusion in the same lattice, and has the peculiarity that its close packing
is degenerated (the system orders in sliding columns). A comparison with other
theories is discussed. Second, a three-dimensional binary mixture of parallel
hard cubes with $\sigma_{\rm{L}}=6$ and $\sigma_{\rm{S}}=2$. Previous
simulations of this model only focused on fluid phases. Thanks to the
simplicity introduced by the discrete nature of the lattice we have been able
to map out the complete phase diagram (both uniform and nonuniform phases)
through a free minimization of the free energy functional, so the structure of
the ordered phases is obtained as a result. A zoo of entropy-driven phase
transitions is found: one-, two- and three-dimensional positional ordering, as
well as fluid-ordered phase and solid-solid demixings.
