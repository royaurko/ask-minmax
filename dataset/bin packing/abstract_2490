It is demonstrated experimentally that strongly-coupled plasma exhibits solid
superheating. A 2D suspension of microspheres in dusty plasma, initially
self-organized in a solid lattice, was heated and then cooled rapidly by
turning laser heating on and off. Particles were tracked using video
microscopy, allowing atomistic-scale observation during melting and
solidification. During rapid heating, the suspension remained in a solid
structure at temperatures above the melting point, demonstrating solid
superheating. Hysteresis diagrams did not indicate liquid supercooling in this
2D system.
