We investigate in this paper the relation between Apollonian $d$-ball
packings and stacked $(d+1)$-polytopes for dimension $d\ge 3$. For $d=3$, the
relation is fully described: we prove that the $1$-skeleton of a stacked
$4$-polytope is the tangency graph of an Apollonian $3$-ball packing if and
only if no six $4$-cliques share a $3$-clique. For higher dimension, we have
some partial results.
