Hyperspectral Unmixing (HU) has received increasing attention in the past
decades due to its ability of unveiling information latent in hyperspectral
data. Unfortunately, most existing methods fail to take advantage of the
spatial information in data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Structured Sparse regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SS-NMF) method
from the following two aspects. First, we incorporate a graph Laplacian to
encode the manifold structures embedded in the hyperspectral data space. In
this way, the highly similar neighboring pixels can be grouped together.
Second, the lasso penalty is employed in SS-NMF for the fact that pixels in the
same manifold structure are sparsely mixed by a common set of relevant bases.
These two factors act as a new structured sparse constraint. With this
constraint, our method can learn a compact space, where highly similar pixels
are grouped to share correlated sparse representations. Experiments on real
hyperspectral data sets with different noise levels demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.
