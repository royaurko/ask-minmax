We present the results of a search for cosmic ray point sources at energies
above 10^19 eV in the HiRes stereo data set. The analysis is based on a maximum
likelihood ratio test using the probability density function for each event
rather than requiring an a priori choice of a fixed angular bin size. The
search is extended to the combined data set of HiRes data above 10^19 eV and
AGASA data above 4.0 10^19 eV. In both cases, no statistically significant
clustering of events consistent with a point source is found.
