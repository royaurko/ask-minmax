We show how real-number codes can be used to compress correlated sources and
establish a new framework for distributed lossy source coding, in which we
quantize compressed sources instead of compressing quantized sources. This
change in the order of binning and quantization blocks makes it possible to
model correlation between continuous-valued sources more realistically and
compensate for the quantization error when the sources are completely
correlated. We focus on the asymmetric case, i.e., lossy source coding with
side information at the decoder, also known as Wyner-Ziv coding. The encoding
and decoding procedures are described in detail for discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) codes, both for syndrome- and parity-based approaches. We also extend the
parity-based approach to the case where the transmission channel is noisy and
perform distributed joint source-channel coding in this context. The proposed
system is well suited for low-delay communications. Furthermore, the
mean-squared reconstruction error (MSE) is shown to be less than or close to
the quantization error level, the ideal case in coding based on binary codes.
