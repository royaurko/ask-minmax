A new atmospheric neutrino oscillation tool which utilizes full three
neutrino oscillation probabilities and a full three neutrino treatment of the
MSW effect is combined with a standard analysis of the K2K, MINOS, and CHOOZ
data to examine the bounds on $\theta_{13}$ implied by existing data, including
the recent, more finely binned, Super-K atmospheric data. In the region
$L/E_\nu\gtrsim 10^4$ km/GeV, we have previously found that the sub-dominant
expansion does not converge and that terms linear in $\theta_{13}$ can be
significant. The current analysis confirms this and leads to the conclusion
that $\theta_{13}$ is bounded from above by the atmospheric data while CHOOZ
provides the lower bound. We trace the origin of this result to fully contained
data in the previously mentioned very long baseline region, to a combination of
a quadratic in $\theta_{13}$ term in ${\mathcal P}_{ee}$ and a linear term in
${\mathcal P}_{e\mu}$ and their contribution to $R_e$, a broad MSW resonance
for the solar mass-squared difference at 180 MeV, and an increase in
$\theta_{12}$ due to this resonant matter effect which alters the sign of the
linear in $\theta_{13}$ term. Assuming CP is conserved in the lepton sector, we
find $\theta_{13}=-0.07^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$, the asymmetry being a reflection of
the importance of the linear in $\theta_{13}$ terms.
