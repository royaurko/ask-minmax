For certain classes of holomorphic correspondences which are matings between
Kleinian groups and polynomials, we prove the existence of pinching
deformations, analogous to Maskit's deformations of Kleinian groups which pinch
loxodromic elements to parabolic elements. We apply our results to establish
the existence of matings between quadratic maps and the modular group, for a
large class of quadratic maps, and of matings between the quadratic map $z\to
z^2$ and circle-packing representations of the free product $C\_2*C\_3$ of
cyclic groups of order 2 and 3.
