We introduce a matrix model describing the fully-packed O(n) model on random
Eulerian triangulations (i.e. triangulations with all vertices of even
valency). For n=1 the model is mapped onto a particular gravitational 6-vertex
model with central charge c=1, hence displaying the expected shift c -> c+1
when going from ordinary random triangulations to Eulerian ones. The case of
arbitrary n is also discussed.
