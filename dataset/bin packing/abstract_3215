FAST (Fusion Advanced Studies Torus), the Italian proposal of a Satellite
Facility to ITER, is a compact tokamak (R$_0$ = 1.82 m, a = 0.64 m,
triangularity $\delta$ = 0.4) able to investigate non-linear dynamics effects
of $\alpha$-particle behavior in burning plasmas and to test technical
solutions for the first wall/divertor directly relevant for ITER and DEMO.
Currently, ENEA is investigating the feasibility of a superconducting solution
for the magnet system. This paper focuses on the analysis of the CS (Central
Solenoid) magnet thermal behavior. In particular, considering a superconducting
solution for the CS which uses the room available in the resistive design and
referring to one of the most severe scenario envisaged for FAST, the heat load
of the CS winding pack due to AC losses is preliminarily evaluated. The results
provide a tentative baseline for the definition of the strand requirements and
conductor design, that can be accepted in order to fulfil the design
requirements.
