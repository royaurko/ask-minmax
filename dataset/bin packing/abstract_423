Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $\mathcal{X}$ be a $k$-fold packing of
infinitely many simply connected compact sets in the plane, that is, assume
that every point belongs to at most $k$ sets. Suppose that there is a function
$f(n)=o(n^2)$ with the property that any $n$ members of $\mathcal{X}$ surround
at most $f(n)$ holes, which means that the complement of their union has at
most $f(n)$ bounded connected components. We use tools from extremal graph
theory and the topological Helly theorem to prove that $\mathcal{X}$ can be
decomposed into at most $p$ packings, where $p$ is a constant depending only on
$k$ and $f$.
