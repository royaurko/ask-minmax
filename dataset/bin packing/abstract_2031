We present a model of charmonium as two heavy quarks propagating classically
in a weakly coupled quark-gluon plasma. The quarks interact via a static,
color-dependent potential and also suffer collisions with the plasma particles.
We calculate the radiation width of the color octet state (for fixed, classical
$q\bar q$ separation) and find that it is long-lived provided a finite gluon
mass is used to provide a threshold energy.
