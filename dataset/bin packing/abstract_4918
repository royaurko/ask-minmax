We searched for cluster X-ray luminosity and radius evolution using our
sample of 200 galaxy clusters detected in the 160 deg^2 survey with the ROSAT
PSPC (Vikhlinin et al. 1998, astro-ph/9803099). With such a large area survey,
it is possible, for the first time with ROSAT, to test the evolution of
luminous clusters, Lx > 3x10^44 erg/s, in the 0.5-2 keV band. We detect a
factor of 3-4 deficit of such luminous clusters at z>0.3 compared to the
present. The evolution is much weaker or absent at modestly lower luminosities,
1-3x10^44 erg/s. At still lower luminosities, we find no evolution from the
analysis of the log N - log S relation. The results in the two upper Lx bins
are in agreement with the Einstein EMSS evolution result (Gioia et al. 1990a,
Henry et al. 1992) while being obtained using a completely independent cluster
sample. The low-Lx results are in agreement with other ROSAT surveys (e.g.
Rosati et al. 1998, Jones et al. 1998).
  We also compare the distribution of core radii of nearby and distant (z>0.4)
luminous (with equivalent temperatures 4-7 keV) clusters, and detect no
evolution. The ratio of average core radius for z~0.5 and z<0.1 clusters is
0.9+/-0.1, and the core radius distributions are remarkably similar. A decrease
of cluster sizes incompatible with our data is predicted by self-similar
evolution models for high-Omega universe.
