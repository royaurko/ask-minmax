Packing is a complex phenomenon of prominence in many natural and industrial
processes (liquid crystals, granular materials, infiltration, melting, flow,
sintering, segregation, sedimentation, compaction, etc.). A variety of
computational methods is available in particular for spheroid particles. Our
aim is to apply the principle of the random sequential addition algorithm but
with small blocks of varying size and orientation. Here the main purpose is to
reproduce the observed arrangement of graphitic assemblies in polymeric
matrices. Random packing is improved by applying an external pressure
implemented with a drifted diffusive motion of the fillers. Attention is also
paid to the emergence of structural and orientational order. Interestingly,
mixtures of fillers of irregular shapes can be dealt with efficiently using the
proposed algorithm.
