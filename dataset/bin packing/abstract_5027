We propose a sensitive way to test the anomalous HVV couplings
(V=W(+/-),Z(0)) of the Higgs boson (H), which can arise from either the
dimension-3 effective operator in a nonlinearly realized Higgs sector or the
dimension-6 effective operators in a linearly realized Higgs sector, via
studying the VV scattering processes at the CERN LHC. The gold-plated pure
leptonic decay modes of the final state weak bosons in the processes pp->VVjj
are studied. For comparison, we also analyze the constraints from the precision
electroweak data, the expected precision of the measurements of the Higgs boson
production rate, decay width and branching ratios at the Tevatron run-2 and the
CERN LHC, and the requirement of unitarity of the S-matrix. We show that, with
an integrated luminosity of 300 inverse fb and sufficient kinematical cuts for
suppressing the backgrounds, studying the process
pp->w(+)+W(+)+j+j->l(+)+nu+l(+)+nu+j+j can probe the anomalous HWW couplings at
a few tens of percent level for the nonlinearly realized Higgs sector, and at
the level of 0.01-0.08 inverse TeV for the linearly realized effective
Lagrangian.
