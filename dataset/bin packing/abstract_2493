We explore the effect of hadronization by partonic coalescence on a "conical"
signal at the partonic level. We show that, by transferring partons from a
lower to a higher $p_T$, coalescence makes the conical signal stronger and
hence less susceptible to thermal smearing, provided the signal is integrated
over a large momentum bin and effects such as non-collinearity and a finite
Wigner function width are taken into account. We explore the role of this
effect in baryon/meson scaling and calculate the effect of resonances decays on
such a conical signal.
