We analyze solid-state phase transformations that occur in zinc-sulfide
crystals during annealing using a random deformation-faulting mechanism with a
very simple interaction between adjacent close-packed double layers. We show
that, through annealing, infinite-range structures emerge from initially
short-range crystal order. That is, widely separated layers carry structurally
significant information and so layer stacking cannot be completely described by
any finite-range Markov process. We compare our results to two experimental
diffraction spectra, finding excellent agreement.
