We provide a refinement of the sphere-packing bound for constant composition
codes over asymmetric discrete memoryless channels that improves the pre-factor
in front of the exponential term. The order of our pre-factor is
$\Omega(N^{-1/2(1+\epsilon + \rho_{R}^{\ast})})$ for any $\epsilon >0$, where
$\rho_{R}^{\ast}$ is the maximum absolute-value subdifferential of the
sphere-packing exponent at rate $R$ and $N$ is the blocklength.
