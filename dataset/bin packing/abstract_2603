We investigate the holographic fermionic phase transition induced by the
effective impurity, which is introduced by massless scalar fields in
Einstein-Maxwell-massless scalar gravity. We obtain the phase diagram $(\alpha,
T)$ which displays part of the existing phase structure in the high $T_c$
Cuprate. It reveals that $\alpha$ plays the role of the impurity in the dual
field theory and induces the phase transition from Fermi liquid to non-Fermi
liquid.
