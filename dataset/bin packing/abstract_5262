It is widely believed that charm meson production and decay may play an
important role in high energy astrophysical sources of neutrinos, especially
those that are baryon-rich, providing an environment conducive to pp
interactions. Using slow-jet supernovae (SJS) as an example of such a source,
we study the detectability of high-energy neutrinos, paying particular
attention to those produced from charmed-mesons. We highlight important
distinguishing features in the ultra-high energy neutrino flux which would act
as markers for the role of charm in the source. In particular, charm leads to
significant event rates at higher energies, after the conventional (pi, K)
neutrino fluxes fall off. We calculate event rates both for a nearby single
source and for diffuse SJS fluxes for an IceCube-like detector. By comparing
muon event rates for the conventional and prompt fluxes in different energy
bins, we demonstrate the striking energy dependence in the rates induced by the
presence of charm. We also show that it leads to an energy dependant flux ratio
of shower to muon events, providing an additional important diagnostic tool for
the presence of prompt neutrinos. Motivated by the infusion of high energy
anti-electron neutrinos into the flux by charm decay, we also study the
detectability of the Glashow resonance due to these sources.
