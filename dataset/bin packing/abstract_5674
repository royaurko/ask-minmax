We extend the concept of Lifshits--Krein spectral shift function associated
with a pair of self-adjoint operators to the case of pairs of admissible
operators that are similar to self-adjoint operators. Our main result is the
following. Let \cH_0 and \cH_1 be separable Hilbert spaces, A_0 a self-adjoint
operator in \cH_0, A_1 a self-adjoint operator in \cH_1, and B_{ij} a bounded
operator from \cH_j to \cH_i, i=0,1, j=1-i, and B_10=B_01^*. Assume that the
block operator matrix \bH=\bA+\bB=(A_0 & B_01 B_{10}& A_1) has reducing graph
subspaces of the form {x_i\oplus Q_ji x_i: x_i\in\cH_i}, i=0,1, j=1-i, and Q_ji
are Hilbert-Schmidt operators such that Q_ji=-Q_ij^*. If both
(\bH-z\bI)^{-1}-(\bA-z\bI)^{-1} and \bB\bQ(\bA-z\bI)^{-1} are trace class
operators in \cH for \Img(z)\neq 0, then the operators A_i+B_ij Q_ji and A_i,
i=0,1, j=1-i, acting in the spaces \cH_i are resolvent comparable admissible
operators. Moreover, the spectral shift function \xi(x,\bH,\bA) associated with
the pair (\bH,\bA) admits the representation \xi(x,\bH,\bA)=\xi(x,A_0+B_01
Q_10,A_0)+ \xi(x,A_1+B_10 Q_01,A_1). We also obtain new representations for the
solution to the operator Sylvester equation in the form of Stieltjes operator
integrals and formulate sufficient criterion for the strong solvability of the
operator Riccati equation that ensures the existence of reducing graph
subspaces for block operator matrices.
