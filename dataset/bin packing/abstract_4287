In this letter, based on Kubo's formula and the QCD low energy theorem, we
propose a direct formula for calculating the bulk viscosity of QCD at finite
chemical potential $\mu$ and zero temperature. According to this formula, the
bulk viscosity at finite $\mu$ is totally determined by the dressed quark
propagator at finite $\mu$. We then use a dynamical, confining Dyson-Schwinger
equation model of QCD to calculate the bulk viscosity at finite $\mu$. It is
found that no sharp peak behavior of the bulk viscosity at finite $\mu$ is
observed, which is quite different from that of the bulk viscosity at finite
temperature.
