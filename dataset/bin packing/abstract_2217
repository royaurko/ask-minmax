We consider an optical fiber with nanoscale variation of the effective fiber
radius supporting whispering gallery modes slowly propagating along the fiber,
and reveal that the radius variation can be designed to support reflectionless
propagation of these modes. We show that reflectionless modulations can realize
control of transmission amplitude and temporal delay, while enabling close
packing due to the absence of cross-talk, in contrast to conventional
potentials.
