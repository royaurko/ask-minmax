According to the formal holographic principle, a modification to the
assumption of holographic principle in Verlinder's investigation of entropy
force is obtained. A more precise relation between entropy and area in the
holographic system is proposed. With the entropy corrections to the
area-relation, we derivate Newton's laws and Einstein equation with a static
spherically symmetric holographic screen. Furthermore we derived the correction
terms to the modified Friedmann equation of the FRW universe starting from the
holographic principle and the Debye model.
