This note is concerned with stability analysis of integral delay systems with
multiple delays. To study this problem, the well-known Jensen inequality is
generalized to the case of multiple terms by introducing an individual slack
weighting matrix for each term, which can be optimized to reduce the
conservatism. With the help of the multiple Jensen inequalities and by
developing a novel linearizing technique, two novel Lyapunov functional based
approaches are established to obtain sufficient stability conditions expressed
by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown that these new conditions are
always less conservative than the existing ones. Moreover, by the positive
operator theory, a single LMI based condition and a spectral radius based
condition are obtained based on an existing sufficient stability condition
expressed by coupled LMIs. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of
the proposed approaches.
