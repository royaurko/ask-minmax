The unusual reentrant phenomenon is observed in the anisotropic 3-state Potts
model on a gen- eralized Kagome lattice. By employing the linearized tensor
renormalization group method, we find that the reentrance can appear in the
region not only under a partial ordered phase as commonly known but also a
phase without a local order parameter, which is uncovered to fall into the uni-
versality of the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) type. The region of the reentrance
depends strongly on the ratios of the next nearest couplings {\alpha} = J2 /|J1
| and {\beta} = J3 /|J1 |. The phase diagrams in the plane of temperature
versus {\beta} for different {\alpha} are obtained. Through massive
calculations, it is also revealed that the quasi-entanglement entropy can be
used to accurately detect the KT transition temperature.
