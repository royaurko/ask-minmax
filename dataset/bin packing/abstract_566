We consider the problem of finding an integral packing of branchings in a
capacitated digraph with root-set demands. Schrijver described an algorithm
that returns a packing with at most m+n^3+r branchings that makes at most
m(m+n^3+r) calls to an oracle that basically computes a minimum cut, where n is
the number of vertices, m is the number of arcs and r is the number of
root-sets of the input digraph. In this work we provide an algorithm, inspired
on ideas of Schrijver and on an paper of Gabow and Manu, that returns a packing
with at most m+r-1 branchings and makes at most 2n+m+r-1 oracle calls.
