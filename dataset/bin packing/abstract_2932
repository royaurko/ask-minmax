A racetrack coil using MgB2/Cu strand has been fabricated and tested for
transport current density at 4.2 K in self field. The monofilamentary strand
was 1.0 mm OD and insulated with S-glass braid. Eighty turns of strand (42 m)
were wound onto a stainless steel former with outer dimensions 25 cm x 10 cm x
0.86 cm. The resulting racetrack coil was heat treated at 675C for 30 minutes
in flowing Ar. The strand, with a superconducting fraction of 26%, occupied 49%
of the total coil pack cross sectional area. The coil Ic at 4.2 K and self
field was 120 A (using a 1 microvolt/cm criterion). This led to a Jc,sc (across
the whole coil) of 6.12 x 10^4 A/cm2, a Je in the wire of 1.59 x 10^4 A/cm2,
and an overall winding Je of 7.9 x 10^3 A/cm2 at 4.2 K in self field. The
n-values ranged from 17 to 56.
