We investigate the question of the suppression of the CMB power spectrum for
the lowest multipoles in closed Universes. The intrinsic reason for a lowest
cutoff in closed Universes, connected with the discrete spectrum of the
wavelength, is shown not to be enough to explain observations. We thus extend
the holographic cosmic duality to closed universes by relating the dark energy
equation of state and the power spectrum, showing a suppression behavior which
describes the low l features extremely well. We also explore the possibility to
disclose the nature of the dark energy from the observed small l CMB spectrum
by employing the holographic idea.
