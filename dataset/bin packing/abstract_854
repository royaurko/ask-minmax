The packing of elastic sheets is investigated in a quasi two-dimensional
experimental setup: a sheet is pulled through a rigid hole acting as a
container, so that its configuration is mostly prescribed by the cross-section
of the sheet in the plane of the hole. The characterisation of the packed
configuration is made possible by using refined image analysis. The geometrical
properties and energies of the branches forming the cross-section are broadly
distributed. We find distributions of energy with exponential tails. This setup
naturally divides the system into two sub-systems: in contact with the
container and within the bulk. While the geometrical properties of the
sub-systems differ, their energy distributions are identical, indicating
'thermal' homogeneity and allowing the definition of effective temperatures
from the characteristic scales of the energy distributions.
