Disordered assemblies with maximum packing fraction are studied by discrete
element numerical simulation for monodisperse or bidisperse spherical
particles, the diameter ratio being set at three. A maximum packing fraction
value corresponds to an equilibrium state under isotropic loading of rigid
frictionless particles. A statistical study of size effects enables one to
evaluate, in the limit of large systems, the maximum packing fractions of both
monodisperse assemblies, for which the conventional value 0.639 is retrieved,
and bidisperse ones, for two distinct values of the coarse particle volume
fraction. An enduring initial assembling step in which agitated grains interact
through collisions induces an increase in the final packing fraction due to
crystalline order nucleation for a monodisperse system or to a gradual
segregation for a binary mixture. Albeit slow and moderate in a number of
practical situations, this effect leads to a definition of the random close
packing state, as the one obtained with frictionless rigid grains under an
isotropic pressure in the limit of fast assembling processes. A few potential
extensions to this preliminary study are suggested.
