We introduce three area preserving maps with phase space structures which
resemble circle packings. Each mapping is derived from a kicked Hamiltonian
system with one of three different phase space geometries (planar, hyperbolic
or spherical) and exhibits an infinite number of coexisting stable periodic
orbits which appear to `pack' the phase space with circular resonances.
