The merits of different analytical equations of state for the hard-sphere
system with respect to the recently computed high-accuracy value of the
freezing-point packing fraction are assessed. It is found that the
Carnahan-Starling-Kolafa and the branch-point approximant equations of state
yield the best performance.
