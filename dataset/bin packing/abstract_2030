A simple model for the photoproduction of kaons off protons with a lambda
hyperon in the final state is presented. In a quark model, the interaction is
modelled by the pair-creation of the (anti-) strange quarks in the final state
which recombine with the three quarks of the proton to form the lambda and
kaon. The calculated scattering cross sections for photon energies up to
$E_\gamma = 1.9 \; \mbox{GeV}$ are compared to experiment. The pair-creation
process is found to have a significant contribution to the total cross section.
