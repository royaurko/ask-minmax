As all the globally fitted nuclear PDFs (nPDFs) have been so far impact
parameter independent, it has not been possible to calculate the hard process
cross sections in different centrality classes consistently with the global
analyses. In \cite{Helenius:2012wd} we have offered a solution to this problem
by determining two spatially dependent nPDF sets, \texttt{EPS09s} and
\texttt{EKS98s}, using the $A$-systematics of the earlier global fits EPS09 and
EKS98 and an assumption that the spatial dependence can be written as a power
series of the nuclear thickness function. For a data comparison, we have
calculated the nuclear modification factor of inclusive neutral pion production
in d+Au collisions at RHIC in four centrality bins at midrapidity and compared
these to a PHENIX measurement. In addition, we have also performed a similar
calculation for inclusive photon production in d+Au collisions at RHIC.
