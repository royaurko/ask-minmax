Granular packings slowly driven towards their instability threshold are
studied using a digital imaging technique as well as a nonlinear acoustic
method. The former method allows us to study grain rearrangements on the
surface during the tilting and the latter enables to selectively probe the
modifications of the weak-contact fraction in the material bulk. Gradual ageing
of both the surface activity and the weak-contact reconfigurations is observed
as a result of repeated tilt cycles up to a given angle smaller than the angle
of avalanche. For an aged configuration reached after several consecutive tilt
cycles, abrupt resumption of the on-surface activity and of the weak-contact
rearrangements occurs when the packing is subsequently inclined beyond the
previous maximal tilting angle. This behavior is compared with literature
results from numerical simulations of inclined 2D packings. It is also found
that the aged weak-contact configurations exhibit spontaneous restoration
towards the initial state if the packing remains at rest for tens of minutes.
When the packing is titled forth and back between zero and near-critical
angles, instead of ageing, the weak-contact configuration exhibits "internal
weak-contact avalanches" in the vicinity of both the near-critical and zero
angles. By contrast, the stronger-contact skeleton remains stable.
