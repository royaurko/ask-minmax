It is found that there is no period in the imaginary Beltrami-time of the de
Sitter spacetime with Beltrami metric and that the `surface-gravity' in view of
inertial observers in de Sitter spacetime is zero! They show that the horizon
might be at zero temperature in de Sitter spacetime and that the thermal
property of the horizon in the de Sitter spacetime with a static metric should
be analogous to that of the Rindler horizon in Minkowski spacetime.
