Extensive molecular dynamics simulation studies of particles interacting via
a short ranged attractive square-well (SW) potential are reported. The
calculated loci of constant diffusion coefficient $D$ in the
temperature-packing fraction plane show a re-entrant behavior, i.e. an increase
of diffusivity on cooling, confirming an important part of the high
volume-fraction dynamical-arrest scenario earlier predicted by theory for
particles with short ranged potentials. The more efficient localization
mechanism induced by the short range bonding provides, on average, additional
free volume as compared to the hard-sphere case and results in faster dynamics.
