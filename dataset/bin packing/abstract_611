Colored planar rook algebra is a semigroup algebra in which the basis element
has a diagrammatic description. The category of finite dimensional modules over
this algebra is completely reducible and suitable functors are defined on this
category so that it admits a crystal structure in the sense of Kashiwara. We
show that the category and functors categorify the crystal bases for the
polynomial representations of quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(gl_{n+1})$.
