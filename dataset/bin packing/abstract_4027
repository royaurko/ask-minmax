A measurement of the electron charge asymmetry in inclusive pp to W + X to e
nu + X production at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV is presented based on data recorded by the
CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 840
inverse picobarns. The electron charge asymmetry reflects the unequal
production of positive and negative W bosons in pp collisions. The electron
charge asymmetry is measured in bins of absolute value of electron
pseudorapidity in the range of abs(eta) < 2.4. The asymmetry rises from about
0.1 to 0.2 as a function of the pseudorapidity and is measured with a relative
precision better than 7%. This measurement provides new stringent constraints
for parton distribution functions.
