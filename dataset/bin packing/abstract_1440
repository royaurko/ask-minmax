The shape of the cross section of a dense fiber bundle is related to the
symmetry of its molecular packing. However, this statement might be belied by
type I collagen fibrils which have a rounded section of high symmetry while
structural studies suggest that their molecules are assembled with a long range
lateral order of lower symmetry. We examine how phyllotaxis, which is a non
conventional crystallographic solution to packing efficiency in situations of
high radial symmetry, can establish a link between those two apparently
conflicting points. The lateral order imposed by the algorithm of phyllotaxis,
which implies an enlargement of the notion of long range lateral order beyond
that used for classical crystals, provides a basis for a new analysis of the
experimental data.
