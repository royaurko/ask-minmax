We present an approach for calculating coarse-grained angle-resolved
effective pair potentials for uniaxial molecules. For integrating out the
intramolecular degrees of freedom we apply umbrella sampling and steered
dynamics techniques in atomistically-resolved molecular dynamics (MD) computer
simulations. Throughout this study we focus on disk-like molecules such as
coronene. To develop the methods we focus on integrating out the van-der-Waals
and intramolecular interactions, while electrostatic charge contributions are
neglected. The resulting coarse-grained pair potential reveals a strong
temperature and angle dependence. In the next step we fit the numerical data
with various Gay-Berne-like potentials to be used in more efficient simulations
on larger scales. The quality of the resulting coarse-grained results is
evaluated by comparing their pair and many-body structure as well as some
thermodynamic quantities self-consistently to the outcome of atomistic MD
simulations of many particle systems. We find that angle-resolved potentials
are essential not only to accurately describe crystal structures but also for
fluid systems where simple isotropic potentials start to fail already for low
to moderate packing fractions. Further, in describing these states it is
crucial to take into account the pronounced temperature dependence arising in
selected pair configurations due to bending fluctuations.
