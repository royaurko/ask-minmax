We present a general method for obtaining a lower bound for the ground state
entropy density of the Ising Model with nearest neighbor interactions. Then,
using this method, and with a random coupling constant configuration, we obtain
a lower bound for the ground state entropy density of the square, triangular,
and hexagonal two-dimensional lattices with free, cylindrical, and toroidal
boundary conditions.
