We study the morphological evolution of strained heteroepitaxial films using
a kinetic Monte Carlo method in three dimensions. The elastic part of the
problem uses a Green's function method. Isolated islands are observed under
deposition conditions for deposition rates slow compared with intrinsic surface
roughening rates. They are semi-spherical and truncated conical for high and
low temperature cases respectively. Annealing of films at high temperature
leads to the formation of closely packed islands consistent with an instability
theory. At low temperature, pits form via a layer-by-layer nucleation mechanism
and subsequently develop into grooves.
