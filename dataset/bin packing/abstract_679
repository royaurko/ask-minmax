The oscillatory force F_b^ac on the bottom of a rigid, vertically vibrated,
grain filled column, reveals rich granular dynamics, even when the peak
acceleration of the vibrations is signicantly less than the gravitational
acceleration at the earth's surface. For loose packings or high frequencies,
F_b^ac 's dynamics are dominated by grain motion. For moderate driving
conditions in more compact samples, grain motion is virtually absent, but
F_b^ac nevertheless exhibits strongly nonlinear and hysteretic behavior,
evidencing a granular regime dominated by nontrivial force-network dynamics.
