In this paper, we study Li-Yau gradient estimates for the solutions $u$ to
the heat equation $\partial_tu=\Delta u$ on graphs under the curvature
condition $CD(n,-K)$ introduced by Bauer et al. in \cite{BHLLMY}. As
applications, we derive Harnack inequalities and heat kernel estimates on
graphs. Also we present a type of Hamilton gradient estimates.
