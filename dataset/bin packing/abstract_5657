We discuss the results of the monitoring programs of the X-ray binaries with
relativistic jets studies. We carried out a multi-frequency (1-30 GHz) daily
monitoring of the radio flux variability of the microquasars SS433,
GRS1915+105, V4641 Sgr and Cyg X-3 with RATAN-600 radio telescope during the
recent sets in 2002-2006. We detected a lot of bright short-time flares from
GRS 1915+105 which could be associated with active X-ray events. In 2004 we
have detected two flares from V4641 Sgr, which followed after recurrent X-ray
activity of the transient. From September 2005 to May 2006 and then in July we
have daily measured flux densities from Cyg X-3. In January 2006 we detected a
drop down of its quiescent fluxes (from 100 to ~20 mJy), then the 1Jy-flare was
detected on 2 February 2006 after 18 days of quenched radio emission. The daily
spectra of the flare in the maximum were flat from 2 to 110 GHz, using the
quasi-simultaneous observations at 110 GHz with the RT45m telescope and the NMA
millimeter array of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory in Japan. Several bright
radio flaring events (1-15 Jy) followed during the continuing state of very
variable and intensive 1-12 keV X-ray emission (~0.5 Crab), which was monitored
in the RXTE ASM program. We discuss the various spectral and temporal
characteristics of the light curves from the microquasars. Thus we conclude
that monitoring of the flaring radio emission is a good tracer of jet activity
X-ray binaries.
