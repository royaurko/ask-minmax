Using density-functional theory (DFT) we investigate the incorporation of
oxygen directly below the Rh(111) surface. We show that oxygen incorporation
will only commence after nearly completion of a dense O adlayer (\theta_tot =
1.0 monolayer) with O in the fcc on-surface sites. The experimentally suggested
octahedral sub-surface site occupancy, inducing a site-switch of the on-surface
species from fcc to hcp sites, is indeed found to be a rather low energy
structure. Our results indicate that at even higher coverages oxygen
incorporation is followed by oxygen agglomeration in two-dimensional
sub-surface islands directly below the first metal layer. Inside these islands,
the metastable hcp/octahedral (on-surface/sub-surface) site combination will
undergo a barrierless displacement, introducing a stacking fault of the first
metal layer with respect to the underlying substrate and leading to a stable
fcc/tetrahedral site occupation. We suggest that these elementary steps,
namely, oxygen incorporation, aggregation into sub-surface islands and
destabilization of the metal surface may be more general and precede the
formation of a surface oxide at close-packed late transition metal surfaces.
