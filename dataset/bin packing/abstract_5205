Directed graphs have asymmetric connections, yet the current graph clustering
methodologies cannot identify the potentially global structure of these
asymmetries. We give a spectral algorithm called di-sim that builds on a dual
measure of similarity that correspond to how a node (i) sends and (ii) receives
edges. Using di-sim, we analyze the global asymmetries in the networks of Enron
emails, political blogs, and the c elegans neural connectome. In each example,
a small subset of nodes have persistent asymmetries; these nodes send edges
with one cluster, but receive edges with another cluster. Previous approaches
would have assigned these asymmetric nodes to only one cluster, failing to
identify their sending/receiving asymmetries. Regularization and "projection"
are two steps of di-sim that are essential for spectral clustering algorithms
to work in practice. The theoretical results show that these steps make the
algorithm weakly consistent under the degree corrected Stochastic
co-Blockmodel, a model that generalizes the Stochastic Blockmodel to allow for
both (i) degree heterogeneity and (ii) the global asymmetries that we intend to
detect. The theoretical results make no assumptions on the smallest degree
nodes. Instead, the theorem requires that the average degree grows sufficiently
fast and that the weak consistency only applies to the subset of the nodes with
sufficiently large leverage scores. The results results also apply to bipartite
graphs.
