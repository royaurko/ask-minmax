Recently released Planck data favor a lower value of the Hubble constant and
a higher value of the fraction matter density in the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model, which are discrepant with some of the low-redshift measurements. Within
the context of this cosmology, we examine the consistency of the estimated
values for the Hubble constant and fraction matter density with redshift
tomography. Using the SNe Ia, Hubble parameter, BAO and CMB data, which are
divided into three bins, we find no statistical evidence for any tension in the
three redshift bins, although there exists a 1.4$\sigma$ deviation of the
Hubble constant in the middle redshift from the one in the high redshift bin.
