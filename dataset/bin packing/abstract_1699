In this note we study the linear dynamics of scalar graviton in a de Sitter
background in the infrared limit of the healthy extension of
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with the dynamical critical exponent $z=3$. Both
our analytical and numerical results show that the non-zero Fourier modes of
scalar graviton oscillate with an exponentially damping amplitude on the
sub-horizon scale, while on the super-horizon scale, the phases are frozen and
they approach to some asymptotic values. In addition, as the case of the
non-zero modes on super-horizon scale, the zero mode also initially decays
exponentially and then approaches to an asymptotic constant value.
