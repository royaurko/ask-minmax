In this paper, we study the semi-classical strings in AdS_4*CP^3 spacetime.
We construct various kinds of string solutions, including the point-like,
circular, folded and pulsating strings. For the circular and folded strings, we
figure out their field theory dual operators. In particular, we discuss the
anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators from decoupled SU(2)*SU(2)
spin chain. We find that in the large angular momentum limit, the field theory
and string theory results are in very good agreement up to an interpolating
function of coupling constant.
