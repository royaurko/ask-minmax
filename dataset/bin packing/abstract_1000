This paper reports the first demonstration of the generation and distribution
of entangled photon pairs in the 1.5-um band using spontaneous four-wave mixing
in a cooled fiber. Noise photons induced by spontaneous Raman scattering were
suppressed by cooling a dispersion shifted fiber with liquid nitrogen, which
resulted in a significant improvement in the visibility of two-photon
interference. By using this scheme, time-bin entangled qubits were successfully
distributed over 60 km of optical fiber with a visibility of 76%, which was
obtained without removing accidental coincidences.
