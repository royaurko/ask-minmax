The electronic structure of a single layer graphene on Ru(0001) is compared
with that of a single layer hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Ru(0001). Both
are corrugated sp2 networks and display a pi-band gap at the K point of their 1
x 1 Brillouin zone. Graphene has a distinct Fermi surface which indicates that
0.1 electrons are transferred per 1 x 1 unit cell. Photoemission from adsorbed
xenon identifies two distinct Xe 5p1/2 lines, separated by 240 meV, which
reveals a corrugated electrostatic potential energy surface. These two Xe
species are related to the topography of the system and have different
desorption energies.
