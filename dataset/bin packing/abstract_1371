Two types of homogeneous surface nanobubble populations, created by different
means, are analyzed statistically on both their sizes and spatial positions. In
the first type (created by droplet-deposition, case A) the bubble size R is
found to be distributed according to a generalized gamma law with a preferred
radius R*=20 nm. The radial distribution function shows a preferred spacing at
~5.5 R*. These characteristics do not show up in comparable Monte-Carlo
simulations of random packings of hard disks with the same size distribution
and the same density, suggesting a structuring effect in the nanobubble
formation process. The nanobubble size distribution of the second population
type (created by ethanol-water exchange, case B) is a mixture of two clearly
separated distributions, hence, with two preferred radii. The local ordering is
less significant, due to the looser packing of the nanobubbles.
