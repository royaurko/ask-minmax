In this paper, we study the problem of channel simulation via interactive
communication, known as the coordination capacity, in a two-terminal network.
We assume that two terminals observe i.i.d.\ copies of two random variables and
would like to generate i.i.d.\ copies of two other random variables jointly
distributed with the observed random variables. The terminals are provided with
two-way communication links, and shared common randomness, all at limited
rates. Two special cases of this problem are the interactive function
computation studied by Ma and Ishwar, and the tradeoff curve between one-way
communication and shared randomness studied by Cuff. The latter work had
inspired Gohari and Anantharam to study the general problem of channel
simulation via interactive communication stated above. However only inner and
outer bounds for the special case of no shared randomness were obtained in
their work. In this paper we settle this problem by providing an exact
computable characterization of the multi-round problem. To show this we employ
the technique of "output statistics of random binning" that has been recently
developed by the contributors.
