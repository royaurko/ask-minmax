The contributors (Cason, Friedman and Hopkins, Reviews of Economics Studies, 2014)
claimed a result that the treatments (using simultaneous matching in discrete
time) replicate previous results that exhibit weak or no cycles. After correct
two mathematical mistakes in their cycles tripwire algorithm, we research the
cycles by scanning the tripwire in the full strategy space of the games and we
find significant cycles missed by the contributors. So we suggest that, all of the
treatments (using simultaneous matching in discrete time) exhibit significant
cycles.
