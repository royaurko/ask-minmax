An incremental evolution equation, i.e. a Master equation in statistical
mechanics, is introduced for force distributions in polydisperse frictional
particle packings. As basic ingredients of the Master equation, the conditional
probability distributions of particle overlaps are determined by molecular
dynamics simulations. Interestingly, tails of the distributions become much
narrower in the case of frictional particles than frictionless particles,
implying that correlations of overlaps are strongly reduced by microscopic
friction. Comparing different size distributions, we find that the tails are
wider for the wider distribution.
