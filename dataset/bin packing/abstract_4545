In this paper, we investigate the abilities of systems of self-assembling
tiles which can each pass a constant number of signals to their immediate
neighbors to create replicas of input shapes. Namely, we work within the
Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM), and we provide a universal STAM tile
set which is capable of creating unbounded numbers of assemblies of shapes
identical to those of input assemblies. The shapes of the input assemblies can
be arbitrary 2-dimensional hole-free shapes at scale factor 2. This greatly
improves previous shape replication results in self-assembly that required
models in which multiple assembly stages and/or bins were required, and the
shapes which could be replicated were quite constrained.
