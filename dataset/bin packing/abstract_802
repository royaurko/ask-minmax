This paper deals also with a problem of gas absorption accompanied by an
instantaneous, irreversible reaction in the liquid layer. The well-known
methods for calculating such processes are based usually on the certain
amendments to solutions, which are obtained disregarding the chemical reaction.
Unlike the known work (1. D. Baetens, R. Van Keer, L.H. Hosten. Gas-liquid
reaction: absorption accompanied by an instantaneous, irreversible reaction//
Moving Boundaries IV, Southampton, Boston, 1997) the approach we used takes
into account the influence of reaction resulting product on the arising and
velocity of a moving reaction plane. The known results in the theory of
chemical apparatuses scaling are devoted to apparatuses with non-regular
packings mainly. However how the phases distribution over the regular packings
of chemical columns effects the heat and mass efficiency is studied lesser.
This paper deals with the methods of simulation the scaling effects applying to
chemical towers with regular packings of various types. The models for
describing the influence of initial liquid and gas distribution in chemical
columns with regular packing on the mass transfer efficiency have been
submitted. The sufficiently simple methods for evaluating the influence of
large-scale factor on the efficiency of mass transfer have been obtained. These
methods are suitable for use in engineering calculation techniques.
