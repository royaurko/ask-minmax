The notion of a completely saturated packing [Fejes Toth, Kuperberg and
Kuperberg, Highly saturated packings and reduced coverings, Monats. Math. 125
(1998) 127-145] is a sharper version of maximum density, and the analogous
notion of a completely reduced covering is a sharper version of minimum
density. We define two related notions: uniformly recurrent and weakly
recurrent dense packings, and diffusively dominant packings. Every compact
domain in Euclidean space has a uniformly recurrent dense packing. If the
domain self-nests, such a packing is limit-equivalent to a completely saturated
one. Diffusive dominance is yet sharper than complete saturation and leads to a
better understanding of n-saturation.
