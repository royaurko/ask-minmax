The goal of this paper to determine the optimal horoball packing arrangements
and their densities for all four fully asymptotic Coxeter tilings (Coxeter
honeycombs) in hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$. Centers of horoballs are
required to lie at vertices of the regular polyhedral cells constituting the
tiling. We allow horoballs of different types at the various vertices. Our
results are derived through a generalization of the projective methodology for
hyperbolic spaces. The main result states that the known B\"or\"oczky--Florian
density upper bound for "congruent horoball" packings of $\mathbb{H}^3$ remains
valid for the class of fully asymptotic Coxeter tilings, even if packing
conditions are relaxed by allowing for horoballs of different types under
prescribed symmetry groups. The consequences of this remarkable result are
discussed for various Coxeter tilings.
