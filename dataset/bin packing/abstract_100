Heat conduction in a random packing of hard spheres is studied by
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. We find a hard-sphere random
packing shows higher thermal conductivity than a crystalline packing with same
packing fraction. Under the same pressure, the random structure causes
reduction of thermal conductivity by only 10% from crystalline packing, which
is consistent with the experimental fact that amorphous materials can have high
thermal conductivity which is comparable to that of crystals.
