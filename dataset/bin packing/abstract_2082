A free-energy functional for a crystal that contains both the symmetry
conserved and symmetry broken parts of the direct pair correlation function is
developed. The free-energy functional is used to investigate the
crystallization of fluids interacting via the inverse power potential ;
$u(r)=\epsilon {(\sigma/r)}^n$. In agreement with simulation results we find
that for $n=12$ the freezing is into close packed f.c.c structure while for
soft repulsions $(n\leq 6)$ b.c.c phase is more stable.
