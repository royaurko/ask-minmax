The anuglar distribution of $J/\psi$ decays in the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ channel
in 800 proton-copper collisions has been measured for $x_F$ > 0.25. The
polarization parameter $\lambda$ is extracted in 1 GeV of $p_T$ and 0.1 of
$x_F$ bins for two magnet configugrations with different acceptances. The data
indicate that the $J/\psi$'s are produced with a slight transverse polarization
at small $x_F$, which turns to longitudinal at $x_F$ > 0.6. No $p_T$ dependence
of $\lambda$ is observed. Theoretical calculations are needed in order to
interpret the measurements.
