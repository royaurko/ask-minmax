Isospin violating signals in the tau -> 3 pi nu_tau decay mode are discussed.
For the tau -> pi^- pi^- pi^+ nu_tau decay mode, isospin violation arises from
the vector current contribution in the tau -> omega pi nu_tau decay with the
subsequent isospin violating omega decay into pi^+ pi^-. We demonstrate that
such effects may be observed in presently available data through the
measurement of the interference effects of these vector current contributions
with the dominating axial vector current, i.e. through a measurement of the
structure functions W_F,W_G,W_H and W_I. In the case of the tau -> pi^0 pi^0
pi^- nu_tau decay mode, a vector current contribution is generated by eta pi
mixing in the decay chain tau -> eta rho nu_tau -> pi^0 pi^0 pi^- nu_tau. We
find that this effect is rather small, the magnitude of the associated
interference terms being too low for present statistics.
