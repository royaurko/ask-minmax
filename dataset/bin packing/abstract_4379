We have combined the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalogue with information from
the HES, KIS and 2MASS photometric surveys to produce spectral energy
distribution fits to over 2600 eclipsing binaries in the catalogue over a
wavelength range of 0.36 to 2.16\AA. We present primary ($T_1$) and secondary
($T_2$) stellar temperatures, plus information on the stellar radii and system
distance ratios. The derived temperatures are on average accurate to 370K in
$T_1$ and 620K in $T_2$. Our results improve on the similarly derived physical
parameters of the Kepler Input Catalogue through consideration of both stars of
the binary system rather than a single star model, and inclusion of additional
U band photometry. We expect these results to aid future uses of the Kepler
Eclipsing Binary data, both in target selection and to inform users of the
extremely high precision light curves available. We do not include surface
gravities or system metallicities, as these were found to have an insignificant
effect on the observed photometric bands.
