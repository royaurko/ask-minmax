In this paper, two parametric probability distributions capable to describe
the statistics of X-ray photon detection by a CCD are presented. They are
formulated from simple models that account for the pile-up phenomenon, in which
two or more photons are counted as one. These models are based on the Poisson
process, but they have an extra parameter which includes all the detailed
mechanisms of the pile-up process that must be fitted to the data statistics
simultaneously with the rate parameter. The new probability distributions, one
for number of counts per time bins (Poisson-like), and the other for waiting
times (exponential-like) are tested fitting them to statistics of real data,
and between them through numerical simulations, and their results are analyzed
and compared. The probability distributions presented here can be used as
background statistical models to derive likelihood functions for statistical
methods in signal analysis.
