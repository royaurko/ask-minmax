We present the first measurements of the Probability Distribution Function
(PDF) of galaxy fluctuations in the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) cone, covering
0.4x0.4 deg between 0.4<z<1.5. The second moment of the PDF, i.e. the rms
fluctuations of the galaxy density field, is with good approximation constant
over the full redshift baseline investigated: we find that, in redshift space,
sigma_8 for galaxies brighter than M=-20+5log h has a mean value of 0.94\pm0.07
in the redshift interval 0.7<z<1.5. The third moment, i.e. the skewness,
increases with cosmic time: we find that the probability of having underdense
regions is greater at z~0.7 than it was at z~1.5. By comparing the PDF of
galaxy density contrasts with the theoretically predicted PDF of mass
fluctuations we infer the redshift-, density-, and scale-dependence of the
biasing function b(z, \delta, R) between galaxy and matter overdensities up to
redshift z=1.5. Our results can be summarized as follows: i) the galaxy bias is
an increasing function of redshift: evolution is marginal up to z~0.8 and more
pronounced for z>0.8; ii) the formation of bright galaxies is inhibited below a
characteristic mass-overdensity threshold whose amplitude increases with
redshift and luminosity; iii) the biasing function is non linear in all the
redshift bins investigated with non-linear effects of the order of a few to 10%
on scales >5Mpc.
