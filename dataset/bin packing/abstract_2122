Pharma frauds are on the rise, counterfeit drugs are giving sleepless nights
to patients, pharmaceutical companies and governments. The laws prohibiting the
sales of counterfeit drugs cannot succeed without technological interventions.
Several analytical techniques and tools including spectroscopy, holograms,
barcoding, differentiated packing, radio frequency identification,
fingerprints, hyperspectral imaging etc. have been employed over the years in
combating this menace; however this challenge is becoming more sophisticated
with the evolution of the World Wide Web and online pharmacies. This paper
presents a review on the contribution of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) as a drug counterfeit countermeasure.
