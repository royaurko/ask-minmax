Let $\ggg=\ggg_\bz+\ggg_\bo$ be a basic classical Lie superalgebra over an
algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>2$, and $G$ be an algebraic
supergroup satisfying $\Lie(G)=\ggg$, with the purely even subgroup $G_\ev$
which is a reductive group. In this paper, we prove that the center
$\cz:=\cz(\ggg)$ of the universal enveloping algebra of $\ggg$ is a domain, and
$U(\ggg)\otimes_{\cz}\Frac(\cz)$ is a simple superalgebra over $\Frac(\cz)$.
And then we prove that the quotient field of $\cz$ coincides with that of the
subalgebra generated by the $G_{\ev}$-invariant ring $\cz^{G_\ev}$ of $\cz$ and
the $p$-center $\cz_0$ of $U(\ggg_\bz)$. In the case when $\ggg=\osp(1|2n)$,
$\cz$ is just generated by $\cz^{G_\ev}$ and $\cz_0$. Furthermore, we will
demonstrate the precise relation between the smooth points of the maximal
spectrum ${Maxspec}(\cz)$ and the corresponding irreducible modules for
$\osp(1|2)$.
