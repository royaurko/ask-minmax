We collect together results for bond percolation on various lattices from two
to fourteen dimensions which, in the limit of large dimension $d$ or number of
neighbors $z$, smoothly approach a randomly diluted Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph. We
include new results on bond diluted hyper-sphere packs in up to nine
dimensions, which show the mean coordination, excess kurtosis and skewness
evolving smoothly with dimension towards the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi limit.
