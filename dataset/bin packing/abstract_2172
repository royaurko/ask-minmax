In this paper, we devise three deterministic algorithms for solving the
$m$-set $k$-packing, $m$-dimensional $k$-matching, and $t$-dominating set
problems in time $O^*(5.44^{mk})$, $O^*(5.44^{(m-1)k})$ and $O^*(5.44^{t})$,
respectively. Although recently there has been remarkable progress on
randomized solutions to those problems, our bounds make good improvements on
the best known bounds for deterministic solutions to those problems.
