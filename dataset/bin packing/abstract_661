This work studies the problem of separate random number generation from
correlated sources with side information at the tester under the criterion of
statistical distance. The complete characterization of the achievable rate
region of this problem is obtained using the information-spectrum approach and
the random-bin approach. A perfect duality between separate random number
generation and Slepian-Wolf coding is therefore established. A refined analysis
is further performed for two important random-bin maps. One is the
pure-random-bin map that is uniformly distributed over the set of all maps
(with the same domain and codomain). The other is the equal-random-bin map that
is uniformly distributed over the set of all surjective maps that induce an
equal or quasi-equal partition of the domain. Both of them are proved to have a
doubly-exponential concentration of the performance of their sample maps. As an
application, an open and transparent lottery scheme, using a random number
generator on a public data source, is proposed to solve the social problem of
scarce resource allocation. The core of the proposed framework of lottery
algorithm is a permutation, a good rateless randomness extractor, whose
existence is confirmed by the theoretical performance of equal-random-bin maps.
This extractor, together with other important details of the scheme, ensures
that the lottery scheme is immune to all kinds of fraud (under some reasonable
assumptions).
