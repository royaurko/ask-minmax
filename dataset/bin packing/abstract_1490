Embedding nanostructures within a bulk matrix is an important practical
approach towards the electronic engineering of high performance thermoelectric
systems. For power generation applications, it ideally combines the efficiency
benefit offered by low dimensional systems along with the high power output
advantage offered by bulk systems. In this work, we uncover a few crucial
details about how to embed nanowires and nanoflakes in a bulk matrix so that an
overall advantage over pure bulk may be achieved. First and foremost, we point
out that a performance degradation with respect to bulk is inevitable as the
nanostructure transitions to being multi moded. It is then shown that a nano
embedded system of suitable cross-section offers a power density advantage over
a wide range of efficiencies at higher packing fractions, and this range
gradually narrows down to the high efficiency regime, as the packing fraction
is reduced. Finally, we introduce a metric - \emph{the advantage factor}, to
elucidate quantitatively, the enhancement in the power density offered via
nano-embedding at a given efficiency. In the end, we explore the maximum
effective width of nano-embedding which serves as a reference in designing
generators in the efficiency range of interest.
