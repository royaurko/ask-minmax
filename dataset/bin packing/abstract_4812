The article introduces crotons, multifaceted pre-geometric objects that occur
both as labels encoded on the boundary of a "volume" and as complementary
aspects of geometric fluctuations within that volume. If you think of crotons
as linear combinations, then the scalars used are croton base numbers. Croton
base numbers can be combined to form the amplitudes and phases of Mersenne
fluctuations which, in turn, form qphyla. Volume normally requires space or
space-time as a prerequisite; in a pre-geometric setting, however, "volume" is
represented by a qphyletic assembly. Various stages of pre-geometric
refinement, expressed through the aspects crotonic amplitude or phase, combine
to eventually form and/or dissolve sphere-packed chunks of Euclidean space. A
time-like crotonic refinement is a rough analog of temporal resolution in
tenacious time; a space-like crotonic refinement corresponds to spatial
resolution in sustained space. The analogy suggests the existence of a
conceptual link between the ever-expanding scope of Mersenne fluctuations and
the creation and lifetime patterns of massive elementary particles, an idea
that is exploited to substantiate our previously proposed preon model of
subnuclear structure.
