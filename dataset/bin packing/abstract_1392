Contacts at the Coulomb threshold are unstable to tangential perturbations
and thus contribute to failure at the microscopic level. How is such a local
property related to global failure, beyond the effective picture given by a
Mohr-Coulomb type failure criterion? Here, we use a simulated bed of frictional
disks slowly tilted under the action of gravity to investigate the link between
the avalanche process and a global generalized isostaticity criterion. The
avalanche starts when the packing as a whole is still stable according to this
criterion, underlining the role of large heterogeneities in the destabilizing
process: the clusters of particles with fully mobilized contacts concentrate
local failure. We demonstrate that these clusters, at odds with the pile as a
whole, are also globally marginal with respect to generalized isostaticity.
More precisely, we observe how the condition of their stability from a local
mechanical proprety progressively builds up to the generalized isostaticity
criterion as they grow in size and eventually span the whole system when
approaching the avalanche.
