We propose a field theory model for dark energy and dark matter in
interaction. Comparing the classical solutions of the field equations with the
observations of the CMB shift parameter, BAO, lookback time and Gold supernovae
sample, we observe a possible interaction between dark sectors with energy
decay from dark energy into dark matter. The observed interaction provides an
alleviation to the coincidence problem.
