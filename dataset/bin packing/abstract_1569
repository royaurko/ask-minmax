In this paper, we study Whittaker modules for a Lie algebras of Block type.
We define Whittaker modules and under some conditions, obtain a one to one
correspondence between the set of isomorphic classes of Whittaker modules over
this algebra and the set of ideals of a polynomial ring, parallel to a result
from the classical setting and the case of the Virasoro algebra.
