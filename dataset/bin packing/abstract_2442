In the PHOBOS experiment, charged particles are measured in almost the full
solid angle. This enables the study of fluctuations and correlations in the
particle production over a very wide kinematic range. In this paper, we show
results of a direct search for fluctuations identified by an unusual shape of
the pseudorapidity distribution. In addition, we use analysis of correlations
of the multiplicity in similar pseudorapidity bins, placed symmetrically in the
forward and backward hemispheres, to test the hypothesis of production of
particles in clusters.
