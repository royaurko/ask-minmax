Myelin figures are densely packed stacks of coaxial cylindrical bilayers that
are unstable to the formation of coils or double helices. These myelin figures
appear to have no intrinsic chirality. We show that such cylindrical membrane
stacks can develop an instability when they acquire a spontaneous curvature or
when the equilibrium distance between membranes is decreased. This instability
breaks the chiral symmetry of the stack and may result in coiling. A
unilamellar cylindrical vesicle, on the other hand, will develop an
axisymmetric instability, possibly related to the pearling instability.
