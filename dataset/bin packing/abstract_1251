Employing Molecular Dynamics simulations of a chemically realistic model of
1,4-polybutadiene between graphite walls we show that the mass exchange between
layers close to the walls is a slow process already in the melt state. For the
glass transition of confined polymers this process competes with the slowing
down due to packing effects and intramolecular rotation barriers.
