FLAC is a program to calculate the small-angle neutron scattering intensity
of highly packed polydisperse systems of neutral or charged hard spheres within
the Percus-Yevick and the Mean Spherical Approximation closures, respectively.
The polydisperse system is defined by a size distribution function and the
macro-particles have hard sphere radii which may differ from the size of their
scattering cores. With FLAC, one can either simulate scattering intensities or
fit experimental small angle neutron scattering data. In output scattering
intensities, structure factors and pair correlation functions are provided.
Smearing effects due to instrumental resolution, vertical slit, primary beam
width and multiple scattering effects are also included on the basis of the
existing theories. Possible form factors are those of filled or two-shell
spheres.
