Binary logic and devices have been in used since inception with advancement
and technology and millennium gate design era. The development in binary logic
has become tedious and cumbersome. Multivalued logic enables significant more
information to be packed within a single digit. The design and development of
logic circuit becomes very compact and easier. Attempts are being made to
fabricate multivalued logic based devices. Since present devices can be
implemented only in binary system,it is necessary to evolve a system that can
built the circuit in multivalued logic system and convert in binary logic
system. In multivalued logic system logic gates differ in different logic
system, a quaternary has become mature in terms of logic algebra and gates.
Hence logic design based on above system can be done using standard procedure.
In this dissertation a logic circuit design entry based on multivalued logic
system has been taken up that can provide the ease of circuit design in
multivalued system and output as binary valued circuit. The named "MVL-DEV"
offers editing, storage and conversion into binary facility.
