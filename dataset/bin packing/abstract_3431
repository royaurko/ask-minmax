We investigate the nature of electron transport through monolayer molybdenum
dichalcogenides (MoX$_2$, X=S, Se) suspended between Au and Ti metallic
contacts. The monolayer is placed ontop of the close-packed surfaces of the
metal electrodes and we focus on the role of the metal-MoX$_2$ binding distance
and the contact area. Based on \emph{ab initio} transport calculations we
identify two different scattering mechanisms which depend differently on the
metal-MoX$_2$ binding distance: (i) An interface resistance between the metal
and the supported part of MoX$_2$ which decreases with decreasing binding
distance and increasing contact area. (ii) An edge resistance across the 1D
interface between metal-supported and free-standing MoX$_2$ which increases
with decreasing binding distance and is independent on contact area. The origin
of the edge resistance is a metal-induced potential shift within the MoX$_2$
layer. The optimal metal thus depends on the junction geometry. In the case of
MoS$_2$, we find that for short contacts, L$<$6 nm, Ti electrodes (with short
binding distance) gives the lowest resistance, while for longer contacts, Au
(large binding distance) is a better electrode metal.
