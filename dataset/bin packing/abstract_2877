The remarkable preference of biomembranes, to constitute vesicles of certain
discrete sizes is explained by using the following properties of phospholipids
that are either well understood or at least documented.
 A. By hexagonal close-packing their fatty acyl chains form a triangular
lattice.
 Their molecules:
 B. Prefer to form linear arrays that occasionally make angles of 120 degrees.
 C. Form relatively large hexagons. Based on these properties a model for
monolayers is proposed and a simple equation derived for the calculation of
diameters of vesicles. The diameters of vesicles of neurotransmitters and
hormones determined by electron microscopy were compared with those obtained
with the equation. Statistical analysis of this comparison revealed the model
to give very significant results (p=.0002).
