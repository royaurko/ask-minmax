New results on the production of charged pions in p+p interactions are
presented. The data come from a sample of 4.8 million inelastic events obtained
with the NA49 detector at the CERN SPS at 158 GeV/c beam momentum. Pions are
identified by energy loss measurement in a large TPC tracking system which
covers a major fraction of the production phase space. Inclusive invariant
cross sections are given on a grid of nearly 300 bins per charge over intervals
from 0 to 2 GeV/c in transverse momentum and from 0 to 0.85 in Feynman x. The
results are compared to existing data in overlapping energy ranges.
