The forward-backward multiplicity correlation strength is calculated for
arbitrary nucleus-nucleus collision in the framework of the wounded nucleon
model. Discussion of our results in the context of the recent STAR data in
Au+Au collisions at sqrt{s}=200 GeV is presented. It is suggested that the
observed (i) growth of the correlation coefficient with centrality and (ii)
approximately flat pseudorapidity dependence of the correlation strength for
central collisions are due to the fluctuations of the number of wounded
nucleons at a given centrality bin.
