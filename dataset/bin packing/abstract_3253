Within the quasichemical approach, the hydration free energy of an ion is
decomposed into a chemical term accounting for ion specific ion-water
interactions within the coordination sphere and nonspecific contributions
accounting for packing (excluded volume) and long range interactions. The
change in the chemical term with a change in the radius of the coordination
sphere is the compressive force exerted by the bulk solvent medium on the
surface of the coordination sphere. For the Na+, K+, F-, and Cl- ions
considered here this compressive force becomes equal for similarly charged ions
for coordination radii of about 0.39 nm, not much larger than a water molecule.
These results show that ion specific effects are short ranged and arise
primarily due to differences in the local ion-water interactions.
