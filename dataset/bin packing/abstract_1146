Allowing the input auxiliary random variables to be correlated and using the
binning scheme, the Han-Kobayashi (HK) rate region for general interference
channel is partially improved. The obtained partially new achievable rate
region (i) is compared to the HK region and its simplified description, i.e.,
Chong-Motani-Garg (CMG) region, in a detailed and favorable manner, by
considering different versions of the regions, and (ii) has an interesting and
easy interpretation: as expected, any rate in our region has generally two
additional terms in comparison with the HK region (one due to the input
correlation and the other as a result of the binning scheme). Keywords.
