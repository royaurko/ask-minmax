In order to describe two-dimensionally packed cells in epithelial tissues
both mathematically and physically, there have been developed several sorts of
geometrical models, such as the vertex model, the finite element model, the
cell-centered model, the cellular Potts model. So far, in any case, pressures
have not neatly been dealt with and curvatures of the cell boundaries have been
even omitted through their approximations. We focus on these quantities and
formulate them on the vertex model. Thus, a model with the curvatures is
constructed and its algorithm is given for simulation. Its possible extensions
and applications will also be discussed.
