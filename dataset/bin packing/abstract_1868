The research on the efforts of combining human and machine intelligence has a
long history. With the development of mobile sensing and mobile Internet
techniques, a new sensing paradigm called Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS), which
leverages the power of citizens for large-scale sensing has become popular in
recent years. As an evolution of participatory sensing, MCS has two unique
features: (1) it involves both implicit and explicit participation; (2) MCS
collects data from two user-participant data sources: mobile social networks
and mobile sensing. This paper presents the literary history of MCS and its
unique issues. A reference framework for MCS systems is also proposed. We
further clarify the potential fusion of human and machine intelligence in MCS.
Finally, we discuss the future research trends as well as our efforts to MCS.
