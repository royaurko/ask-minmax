We develop a model to describe the properties of random assemblies of
polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the key features to describe the system
are (i) the dependence between the free volume of a sphere and the various
coordination numbers between the species, and (ii) the dependence of the
coordination numbers with the concentration of species; quantities that are
calculated analytically. The model predicts the density of random close packing
and random loose packing of polydisperse systems for a given distribution of
ball size and describes packings for any interparticle friction coefficient.
The formalism allows to determine the optimal packing over different
distributions and may help to treat packing problems of non-spherical particles
which are notoriously difficult to solve.
