Based on the Beltrami-de Sitter spacetime, we present the Newton-Hooke model
under the Newton-Hooke contraction of the $BdS$ spacetime with respect to the
transformation group, algebra and geometry. It is shown that in Newton-Hooke
space-time, there are inertial-type coordinate systems and inertial-type
observers, which move along straight lines with uniform velocity. And they are
invariant under the Newton-Hooke group. In order to determine uniquely the
Newton-Hooke limit, we propose the Galilei-Hooke's relativity principle as well
as the postulate on Newton-Hooke universal time. All results are readily
extended to the Newton-Hooke model as a contraction of Beltrami-anti-de Sitter
spacetime with negative cosmological constant.
