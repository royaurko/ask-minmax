In an Euclidean $d$-space, the container problem asks to pack $n$ equally
sized spheres into a minimal dilate of a fixed container. If the container is a
smooth convex body and $d\geq 2$ we show that solutions to the container
problem can not have a ``simple structure'' for large $n$. By this we in
particular find that there exist arbitrary small $r>0$, such that packings in a
smooth, 3-dimensional convex body, with a maximum number of spheres of radius
$r$, are necessarily not hexagonal close packings. This contradicts Kepler's
famous statement that the cubic or hexagonal close packing ``will be the
tightest possible, so that in no other arrangement more spheres could be packed
into the same container''.
