A variational method for computing conformational properties of molecules with
Lennard-Jones potentials for the monomer-monomer interactions is presented. The
approach is tailored to deal with angular degrees of freedom, {\it rotors}, and
consists in the iterative solution of a set of deterministic equations with
annealing in temperature. The singular short-distance behaviour of the
Lennard-Jones potential is adiabatically switched on in order to obtain stable
convergence. As testbeds for the approach two distinct ensembles of molecules
are used, characterized by a roughly dense-packed ore a more elongated ground
state. For the latter, problems are generated from natural frequencies of
occurrence of amino acids and phenomenologically determined potential
parameters; they seem to represent less disorder than was previously assumed in
synthetic protein studies. For the dense-packed problems in particular, the
variational algorithm clearly outperforms a gradient descent method in terms of
minimal energies. Although it cannot compete with a careful simulating
annealing algorithm, the variational approach requires only a tiny fraction of
the computer time. Issues and results when applying the method to
polyelectrolytes at a finite temperature are also briefly discussed.
