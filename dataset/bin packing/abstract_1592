In this paper, we give a new version of the modified Futaki invariant for a
test configuration associated to the soliton action on a Fano manifold. Our
version will naturally come from toric test configurations defined by Donaldson
for toric manifolds. As an application, we show that the modified $K$-energy is
proper for toric invariant K\"ahler potentials on a toric Fano manifold.
