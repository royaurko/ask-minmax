The spectrogram is a classical DSP tool used to view signals in both time and
frequency. Unfortunately, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal limits our
ability to use them for detecting and measuring narrowband signal modulation in
wideband environments. On a spectrogram, instantaneous frequency can only be
measured to the nearest bin without additional interpolation. This work
presents a novel technique for extracting higher accuracy frequency estimates.
Whereas most practitioners seek to suppress spectral leakage, we use mismatched
windows to exploit such artifacts in order to produce super-resolved spectral
displays. We present a derivation of our methodology and exhibit several
interesting examples.
