(La1-xSrx)(Zn1-yMny)AsO is a two dimensional diluted ferromagnetic
semiconductor that has the advantage of decoupled charge and spin doping. The
substitution of Sr2+ for La3+ and Mn2+ for Zn2+ into the parent semiconductor
LaZnAsO introduces hole carriers and spins, respectively. This advantage
enables us to investigate the influence of carrier doping on the ferromagnetic
ordered state through the control of Sr concentrations in
(La1-xSrx)(Zn0.9Mn0.1)AsO. 10 % Sr doping results in a ferromagnetic ordering
below TC ~ 30 K. Increasing Sr concentration up to 30 % heavily suppresses the
Curie temperature and saturation moments. Neutron scattering measurements
indicate that no structural transition occurs for (La0.9Sr0.1)(Zn0.9Mn0.1)AsO
below 300 K.
