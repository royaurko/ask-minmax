The Unitary Events (UE) method is a popular and efficient method used this
last decade to detect dependence patterns of joint spike activity among
simultaneously recorded neurons. The first introduced method is based on binned
coincidence count \citep{Grun1996} and can be applied on two or more
simultaneously recorded neurons. Among the improvements of the methods, a
transposition to the continuous framework has recently been proposed in
\citep{muino2014frequent} and fully investigated in \citep{MTGAUE} for two
neurons. The goal of the present paper is to extend this study to more than two
neurons. The main result is the determination of the limit distribution of the
coincidence count. This leads to the construction of an independence test
between $L\geq 2$ neurons. Finally we propose a multiple test procedure via a
Benjamini and Hochberg approach \citep{Benjamini1995}. All the theoretical
results are illustrated by a simulation study, and compared to the UE method
proposed in \citep{Grun2002}. Furthermore our method is applied on real data.
