The angular distribution and differential branching fraction of the decay
$B^{0} \to K^{*0} \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ are studied using a data sample, collected by
the LHCb experiment in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7\,{\rm TeV}$,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $1.0\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$. Several
angular observables are measured in bins of the dimuon invariant mass squared,
$q^{2}$. A first measurement of the zero-crossing point of the forward-backward
asymmetry of the dimuon system is also presented. The zero-crossing point is
measured to be $q_{0}^{2} = 4.9 \pm 0.9 \,{\rm GeV}^{2}/c^{4}$, where the
uncertainty is the sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties. The results
are consistent with the Standard Model predictions.
