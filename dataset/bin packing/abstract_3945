Recently it has been shown that string gas cosmology, an alternative model of
the very early universe which does not involve a period of cosmological
inflation, can give rise to an almost scale invariant spectrum of metric
perturbations. Here we calculate the non-Gaussianities of the spectrum of
cosmological fluctuations in string gas cosmology, and find that these
non-Gaussianities depend linearly on the wave number and that their amplitude
depends sensitively on the string scale. If the string scale is at the TeV
scale, string gas cosmology could lead to observable non-Gaussianities, if it
is close to the Planck scale, then the non-Gaussianities on current
cosmological scales are negligible.
