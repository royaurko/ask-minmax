In the framework of Multifractal Diffusion Entropy Analysis we propose a
method for choosing an optimal bin-width in histograms generated from
underlying probability distributions of interest. The method presented uses
techniques of R\'{e}nyi's entropy and the mean squared error analysis to
discuss the conditions under which the error in the multifractal spectrum
estimation is minimal. We illustrate the utility of our approach by focusing on
a scaling behavior of financial time series. In particular, we analyze the
S&P500 stock index as sampled at a daily rate in the time period 1950-2013. In
order to demonstrate a strength of the method proposed we compare the
multifractal $\delta$-spectrum for various bin-widths and show the robustness
of the method, especially for large values of $q$. For such values, other
methods in use, e.g., those based on moment estimation, tend to fail for
heavy-tailed data or data with long correlations. Connection between the
$\delta$-spectrum and R\'{e}nyi's $q$ parameter is also discussed and
elucidated on a simple example of multiscale time series.
