We present some novel rotating hairy black hole metric in $(2+1)$ dimensions,
which is an exact solution to the field equations of the Einstein-scalar-AdS
theory with a non-minimal coupling. The scalar potential is determined by the
metric ansatz and consistency of the field equations and cannot be prescribed
arbitrarily. In the simplified, critical case, the scalar potential contains
two independent constant parameters, which are respectively related to the mass
and angular momentum of the black hole in a particular way. As long as the
angular momentum does not vanish, the metric can have zero, one or two
horizons. The case with no horizon is physically uninteresting because of the
curvature singularity lying at the origin. We identified the necessary
conditions for at least one horizon to be present in the solution, which
imposes some bound on the mass-angular momentum ratio. For some particular
choice of parameters our solution degenerates into some previously known black
hole solutions.
