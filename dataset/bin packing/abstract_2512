In this paper, we investigate the warped dS/CFT correspondence of the
self-dual warped dS$_3$ spacetime, which is a solution of three-dimensional
topologically massive gravity (TMG) with a positive cosmological constant. We
discuss its thermodynamics at two cosmological horizons. We propose that the
self-dual warped dS$_3$ spacetime is holographically dual to a chiral conformal
field theory. We analytically calculate the quasinormal modes of scalar,
vector, tensor, and spinor perturbations under the self-dual warped dS$_3$
spacetime. It turns out that the frequencies of the quasinormal modes could be
identified with the poles in the thermal boundary-boundary correlators.
