The diffraction pattern of a quasicrystal admits as symmetry group a finite
group G, and there exists a G-cluster C (a union of orbits of G) such that the
quasicrystal can be regarded as a quasiperiodic packing of copies of C,
generally, partially occupied. On the other hand, by starting from the
G-cluster C we can define in a canonical way a permutation representation of G
in a higher dimensional space, decompose this space into the orthogonal sum of
two G-invariant subspaces and use the strip projection method in order to
define a pattern which can also be regarded as a quasiperiodic packing of
copies of C, generally, partially occupied. This mathematical algorithm is
useful in quasicrystal physics, but the dimension of the superspace we have to
use in the case of a two or three-shell cluster is rather large. We show that
the generalization concerning the strip projection method proposed by Baake and
Moody [Proc. Int. Conf. Aperiodic' 97 (Alpe d'Huez, 27-31 August, 1997) ed M de
Boissieu et al. (Singapore: World Scientific, 1999) pp 9-20] allows to reduce
this dimension, and present some examples.
