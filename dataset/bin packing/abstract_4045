We make a full tree level study of the signatures of anomalous gauge
couplings of the Higgs boson at the CERN LHC via the semileptonic decay mode in
WW scatterings. Both signals and backgrounds are studied at the hadron level
for the Higgs mass in the range 115 GeV to 200 GeV. We carefully impose
suitable kinematical cuts for suppressing the backgrounds. To the same
sensitivity as in the pure leptonic mode, our result shows that the
semileptonic mode can reduce the required integrated luminosity by a factor of
3. If the anomalous couplings in nature are actually larger than the
sensitivity bounds shown in the text, the experiment can start the test for an
integrated luminosity of 50 inverse fb.
