Transverse momentum spectra of neutral pions in the range 1 < p_T < 10 GeV/c
have been measured at mid-rapidity by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in Au+Au
collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. The pi^0 multiplicity in central reactions
is significantly below the yields measured at the same sqrt(s_NN) in peripheral
Au+Au and p+p reactions scaled by the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For
the most central bin, the suppression factor is ~2.5 at p_T = 2 GeV/c and
increases to ~4-5 at p_T ~= 4 GeV/c. At larger p_T, the suppression remains
constant within errors. The deficit is already apparent in semi-peripheral
reactions and increases smoothly with centrality.
