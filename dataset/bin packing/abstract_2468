Simulations are reported to investigate solid superheating and liquid
supercooling of two-dimensional (2D) systems with a Yukawa interparticle
potential. Motivated by experiments where a dusty plasma is heated and then
cooled suddenly, we track particle motion using a simulation with Langevin
dynamics. Hysteresis is observed when the temperature is varied rapidly in a
heating and cooling cycle. As in the experiment, transient solid superheating,
but not liquid supercooling, is observed. Solid superheating, which is
characterized by solid structure above the melting point, is found to be
promoted by a higher rate of temperature increase.
