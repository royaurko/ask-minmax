The methods of obtaining the average spectral shape in a low statistics
regime are presented. Different approaches to averaging are extensively tested
with simulated spectra, based on the ASCA responses. The issue of binning up
the spectrum before fitting is discussed together with the choice of statistic
used to model the spectral shape. The best results are obtained with methods in
which input data are represented by probability density functions. Application
of weights, representing the coverage between the input and output bins,
slightly improves the resolution of averaging.
