Previous INTEGRAL/IBIS observations have shown that the gamma-ray radiation
of the Crab Nebula is highly polarised and remarkably aligned along the axis of
rotation of the pulsar (Forot et al. 2008). Their study was based on the first
four years of operation of the satellite. Here we present an analysis based
upon nearly ten years of operation. This new analysis allows a better
characterisation of the polarisation fraction and position angle, as well as a
measure of spectral energy distribution of the polarised component. These
results are then compared to the known optical polarisation of the pulsar and
nearby synchrotron knot. In the future we shall compare the gamma-ray
polarisation with the phase-resolved optical polarisation using instruments
such as GASP (Kyne et al. 2010).
