Extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that a short-range central
potential, suited to model C60, undergoes a high temperature transition to a
glassy phase characterized by the positional disorder of the constituent
particles. Crystallization, melting and sublimation, which also take place
during the simulation runs, are illustrated in detail. It turns out that
vitrification and the mentioned phase transitions occur when the packing
fraction of the system - defined in terms of an effective hard-core diameter -
equals that of hard spheres at their own glass and melting transition,
respectively. A close analogy also emerges between our findings and recent mode
coupling theory calculations of structural arrest lines in a similar model of
protein solutions. We argue that the conclusions of the present study might
hold for a wide class of potentials currently employed to mimic interactions in
complex fluids (some of which of biological interest), suggesting how to
achieve at least qualitative predictions of vitrification and crystallization
in those systems.
