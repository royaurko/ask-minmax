The packing chromatic number $\chi_{\rho}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest
integer $k$ such that vertices of $G$ can be partitioned into disjoint classes
$X_1, ..., X_k$ where vertices in $X_i$ have pairwise distance greater than
$i$. We study the packing chromatic number of infinite distance graphs $G(Z,
D)$, i.e. graphs with the set $Z$ of integers as vertex set and in which two
distinct vertices $i, j \in Z$ are adjacent if and only if $|i - j| \in D$. In
this paper we focus on distance graphs with $D = \{1, t\}$. We improve some
results of Togni who initiated the study. It is shown that $\chi_{\rho}(G(Z,
D)) \leq 35$ for sufficiently large odd $t$ and $\chi_{\rho}(G(Z, D)) \leq 56$
for sufficiently large even $t$. We also give a lower bound 12 for $t \geq 9$
and tighten several gaps for $\chi_{\rho}(G(Z, D))$ with small $t$.
