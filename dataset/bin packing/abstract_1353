We study jammed configurations of hard spheres as a function of compression
speed using an event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm. We find that during
the compression, the pressure follows closely the metastable liquid branch
until the system gets arrested into a glass state as the relaxation time
exceeds the compression speed. Further compression yields a jammed
configuration that can be regarded as the infinite pressure configuration of
that glass state. Consequently, we find that the density of jammed packings
varies from 0.638 to 0.658 for polydisperse hard spheres and from 0.635 to
0.645 for pure hard spheres upon decreasing the compression rate. This
demonstrates that the density at which the systems falls out of equilibrium
determines the density at which the system jams at infinite pressure. In
addition, we give accurate data for the jamming density as a function of
compression rate and size polydispersity.
