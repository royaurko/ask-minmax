Data discretization, also known as binning, is a frequently used technique in
computer science, statistics, and their applications to biological data
analysis. We present a new method for the discretization of real-valued data
into a finite number of discrete values. Novel aspects of the method are the
incorporation of an information-theoretic criterion and a criterion to
determine the optimal number of values. While the method can be used for data
clustering, the motivation for its development is the need for a discretization
algorithm for several multivariate time series of heterogeneous data, such as
transcript, protein, and metabolite concentration measurements. As several
modeling methods for biochemical networks employ discrete variable states, the
method needs to preserve correlations between variables as well as the dynamic
features of the time series. A C++ implementation of the algorithm is available
from the contributors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization .
