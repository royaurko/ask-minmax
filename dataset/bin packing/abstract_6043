We examine stellar population gradients in ~100 massive early type galaxies
spanning 180 < sigma* < 370 km/s and M_K of -22.5 to -26.5 mag, observed as
part of the MASSIVE survey (Ma et al. 2014). Using integral-field spectroscopy
from the Mitchell Spectrograph on the 2.7m telescope at McDonald Observatory,
we create stacked spectra as a function of radius for galaxies binned by their
stellar velocity dispersion, stellar mass, and group richness. With excellent
sampling at the highest stellar mass, we examine radial trends in stellar
population properties extending to beyond twice the effective radius (~2.5
R_e). Specifically, we examine trends in age, metallicity, and abundance ratios
of Mg, C, N, and Ca, and discuss the implications for star formation histories
and elemental yields. At a fixed physical radius of 3-6 kpc (the likely size of
the galaxy cores formed at high redshift) stellar age and [alpha/Fe] increase
with increasing sigma* and depend only weakly on stellar mass, as we might
expect if denser galaxies form their central cores earlier and faster. If we
instead focus on 1-1.5 R_e, the trends in abundance and abundance ratio are
washed out, as might be expected if the stars at large radius were accreted by
smaller galaxies. Finally, we show that when controlling for \sigmastar, there
are only very subtle differences in stellar population properties or gradients
as a function of group richness; even at large radius internal properties
matter more than environment in determining star formation history.
