We present timing data spanning 6.4 yr for the young and energetic PSR
J0205+6449, in the supernova remnant 3C 58. Data were obtained with the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer, the Jodrell Bank Observatory and the Green Bank
Telescope. We present phase-coherent timing analyses showing timing noise and
two spin-up glitches with fractional frequency increases of ~3.4E-7 near MJD
52555, and ~3.8E-6 between MJDs 52777 and 53062. These glitches are unusually
large if the pulsar was created in the historical supernova in 1181 as has been
suggested. For the X-ray timing we developed a new unbinned maximum-likelihood
method for determining pulse arrival times which performs significantly better
than the traditional binned techniques. In addition, we present an X-ray pulse
profile analysis of four years of RXTE data showing that the pulsar is detected
up to ~40 keV. We also present the first measurement of the phase offset
between the radio and X-ray pulse for this source, showing that the radio pulse
leads the X-ray pulse by phi=0.10+/-0.01 in phase. We compile all known
measurements of the phase offsets between radio and X-ray and radio and
gamma-ray pulses for X-ray and gamma-ray pulsars. We show that there is no
relationship between pulse period and phase offset, supported by our
measurement of the phase offset for PSR J0205+6449.
