In this letter, we present the first experimental study of bridge structures
in three-dimensional dry granular packings. When bridges are small, they are
predominantly 'linear', and have an exponential size distribution. Larger,
predominantly 'complex' bridges, are confirmed to follow a power-law size
distribution. Our experiments, which use X-ray tomography, are in good
agreement with the simulations presented here, for the distribution of sizes,
end-to-end lengths, base extensions and orientations of predominantly linear
bridges. Quantitative differences between the present experiment and earlier
simulations suggest that packing fraction is an important determinant of bridge
structure.
