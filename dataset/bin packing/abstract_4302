We show that the anomalously large top quark forward-backward asymmetry
observed by CDF and D\O\, can naturally be accommodated in models with
flavor-violating couplings of a new massive spin-2 state to quarks. Regardless
of its origin, the lowest-order couplings of a spin-2 boson to fermions are
analogous to the coupling of the graviton to energy/momentum, leading to strong
sensitivity of the effects associated with its virtual exchange to the energy
scales at hand. Precisely due to this fact, the observed dependence of the
asymmetry on the $t\bar t$ invariant mass fits nicely into the proposed
framework. In particular, we find a vast parameter space which can lead to the
central value for the observed forward-backward asymmetry in the high mass bin,
while being in accord with all of the existing experimental constraints.
