In this paper we consider the classical maximum set packing problem where set
cardinality is upper bounded by $k$. We show how to design a variant of a
polynomial-time local search algorithm with performance guarantee $(k+2)/3$.
This local search algorithm is a special case of a more general procedure that
allows to swap up to $\Theta(\log n)$ elements per iteration. We also design
problem instances with locality gap $k/3$ even for a wide class of exponential
time local search procedures, which can swap up to $cn$ elements for a constant
$c$. This shows that our analysis of this class of algorithms is almost tight.
