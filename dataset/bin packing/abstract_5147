We report here the in orbit performance of the CCD camera (MAXI/SSC) onboard
the International Space Station (ISS). It was commissioned in August, 2009.
This is the first all-sky survey mission employing X-ray CCDs. It consists of
32 CCDs each of which is 1 inch square. It is a slit camera with a field of
view of 1deg.5x 90deg and scans the sky as the rotation of the ISS. The CCD on
the SSC is cooled down to the working temperature around -60degC by the
combination of the peltier cooler, a loop heat pipe and a radiator. The
standard observation mode of the CCD is in a parallel sum mode (64-binning).
The CCD functions properly although it suffers an edge glow when the Sun is
near the field of view (FOV) which reduces the observation efficiency of the
SSC down to about 30%. The performance of the CCD is continuously monitored
both by the Mn-K X-rays and by the Cu-K X-rays. There are many sources
detected, not only point sources but extended sources. Due to the lack of the
effective observation time, we need more observation time to obtain an extended
emission analysis extraction process.
