We systematically compare three filtering methods used to extract topological
excitations from lattice gauge configurations, namely smearing, Laplace
filtering and the filtered fermionic topological charge (with chirally improved
fermions). Each of these techniques introduces ambiguities, like its parameter
dependence. We show, however, that all these methods can be tuned to each other
over a broad range of filtering levels and that they reveal very similar
topological structures. For these common structures we find an interesting
power-law relating the number and packing fraction of clusters of filtered
topological charge.
