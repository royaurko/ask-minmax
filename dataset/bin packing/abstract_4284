Angular correlations between unidentified hadron trigger and associated
particles are measured by the ALICE experiment for $0.5 < p_T^{t,a} < 15$ GeV,
where $\ptt \geq \pta$. The pair correlation shapes are examined in a variety
of centrality categories for pairs in $|\eta| < 1.0$ where $|\eta^t - \eta^a| >
0.8$. A series of two-particle Fourier components $V_{n\Delta} \equiv
<\cos(n\Delta\phi)>$ are extracted from the long-range azimuthal correlation
functions. The sum of $n<6$ terms match the data. For each $n$, a fit is
applied over all $p_{T}$ bins simultaneously to test the collectivity
hypothesis $V_{n\Delta} \simeq v_n^t \, v_n^a$. The factorization holds at
$p_{T}^{t,a}$ below approximately 4 GeV but breaks progressively at higher
momenta. The divergence between the data and the global fit quantifies the
onset of nonflow dominance in long-range correlations due to the away side jet.
The $v_n$ values from the global fit are in close agreement with results from
more established methods. At higher \pt where jet correlations dominate, the
modification of conditional yields in central Pb--Pb collisions is measured
with respect to $pp$ ($I_{AA}$) and with respect to peripheral events
($I_{CP}$). Significant suppression is observed on the side opposing the
trigger, while a moderate enhancement is measured on the near side.
