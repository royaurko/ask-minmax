The relation between quasar variability and parameters such as luminosity and
redshift has been a matter of hot debate over the last few years with many
papers on the subject. Any correlations which can be established will have a
profound effect on models of quasar structure and evolution. The sample of
quasars in ESO/SERC field 287 contains over 600 quasars in the range 0 < z <
3.5 and is now large enough to bin in luminosity and redshift, and give
definitive measures of the correlations. We find no significant correlation
between amplitude and redshift, except perhaps at very low redshift, but an
inverse correlation between amplitude and luminosity. This is examined in the
context of various models for quasar variability.
