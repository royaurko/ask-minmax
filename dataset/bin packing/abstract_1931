A new, flexible inference method for Horn logic program is proposed, which is
a drastic generalization of chart parsing, partial instantiations of clauses in
a program roughly corresponding to arcs in a chart. Chart-like parsing and
semantic-head-driven generation emerge from this method. With a parsimonious
instantiation scheme for ambiguity packing, the parsing complexity reduces to
that of standard chart-based algorithms.
