The impact of radiative processes on kinetic equilibration is studied via a
radiative transport model. The 2 <-> 3 processes can significantly increase the
level of thermalization. These processes lead to an approximate coupling
constant scaling of the evolution of the pressure anisotropy qualitatively
different from the case with only 2 -> 2 partonic processes. Furthermore,
thermal and Color Glass Condensate motivated initial conditions are shown to
share the same asymptotic evolution when 2 <-> 3 processes are included. This
emphasizes the unique role of radiative processes in Quark-Gluon Plasma
thermalization.
