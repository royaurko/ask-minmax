Searches for the kinematic selection criteria for estimation of multiple
parton interaction fraction in 14 TeV pp collisions are presented using the
eikonalization of the cross section implemented in the Herwig++ Monte Carlo
event generator. W+ boson pair production is studied in the muon decay channel.
Four types of the main background processes are discussed and analyzed. These
include W+W+ jj, W+Z, ZZ, and tt' productions of the positively charged muon
pairs. The double parton scattering contribution to the requested di-muon final
state is found to be around 25 per cent with the production cross section of
0.94 fb.
