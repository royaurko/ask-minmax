The cutting stock problem with binary patterns (0-1 CSP) is a variant of CSP
that usually appears as a relaxation of 2D and 3D packing problems. We present
an exact method, based on an arc-flow formulation with side constraints, for
solving 0-1 CSP by simply representing all the patterns in a very compact
graph.
  Gilmore-Gomory's column generation approach is usually used to compute strong
lower bounds for 0-1 CSP. We report a computational comparison between the
arc-flow approach and the Gilmore-Gomory's approach.
