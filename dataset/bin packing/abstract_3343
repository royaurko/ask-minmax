We analyze the glassy dynamics of a binary mixtures of hard disks in two
dimensions. Predictions of the Mode-Coupling theory(MCT) are tested with
extensive Brownian dynamics simulations. Measuring the collective particle
density correlation functions in the vicinity of the glass transition we verify
four predicted mixing effects. For instance, for large size disparities, adding
a small amount of small particles at fixed packing fraction leads to a speed up
in the long time dynamics, while at small size disparity it leads to a slowing
down. Qualitative features of the non-ergodicity parameters and the
$\beta$-relaxation which both depend in a non-trivial way on the mixing ratio
are found in the simulated correlators. Studying one system in detail we are
able to determine its ideal MCT glass transition point as $\phi^c = 0.7948$ and
test MCT predictions quantitatively.
