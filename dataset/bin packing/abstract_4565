This paper has investigated the growth pattern of traffic oscillations in the
NGSIM vehicle trajectories data, via measuring the standard deviation of
velocity of vehicles involved in oscillations. We found that the standard
deviation of the velocity increases in a concave way along vehicles in the
oscillations. Moreover, all datasets collapse into a single concave curve,
which indicates that there might be a universal evolution law of oscillations
in certain range of traffic speed. A comparison with traffic experiment shows
that the empirical and the experimental results are highly compatible and can
be fitted by a single concave curve, which demonstrates that qualitatively the
growth pattern of oscillations is not affected by type of bottleneck and lane
changing behavior. Simulations show that models in which the traffic state
dynamically spans a 2D region in the speed-spacing plane can qualitatively (or
even quantitatively) reproduce these characteristics.
