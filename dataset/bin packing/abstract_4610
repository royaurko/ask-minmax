Polarization is a powerful remote-sensing method to investigate solar system
bodies. It is an especially sensitive diagnostic tool to reveal physical
properties of the bodies whose observational characteristics are governed by
small scatterers (dust, regolith surfaces). For these objects, at small phase
angles, a negative polarization is observed, i.e., the electric vector E
oscillates predominantly in the scattering plane, contrary to what is typical
for rather smooth homogeneous surfaces. The behavior of negative polarization
with phase angle depends on the size, composition and packing of the
scatterers. These characteristics can be unveiled by modelling the light
scattering by the dust or regolith in terms of the coherent backscattering
mechanism.
  We have investigated the surface properties of TNOs and Centaurs by means of
polarimetric observations with FORS1 of the ESO VLT.
  TNOs Ixion and Quaoar, and Centaur Chiron show a negative polarization surge.
The Centaur Chiron has the deepest polarization minimum (-1.5 - 1.4%). The two
TNOs show differing polarization curves: for Ixion, the negative polarization
increases rapidly with phase; for Quaoar, the polarization is relatively small
(~ -0.6%), and nearly constant at the observed phase angles. For all three
objects, modelling results suggest that the surface contains an areal mixture
of at least two components with different single-scatterer albedos and photon
mean-free paths.
