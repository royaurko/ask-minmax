Diffuse envelopes around Mira variables are among the most important sources
influencing the chemical evolution of galaxies. However they represent an
observational challenge because of their complex spectral features and their
rapid temporal variability. We constrained the exact brightness distribution of
the Mira star TLep with a model-independent analysis. We obtained single-epoch
interferometric observations with a dataset continuous in the spectral domain
(1.5-2.4mum) and in the spatial domain (baselines ranging from 11 to 96m). We
performed a model independent image reconstruction for each spectral bin using
the MIRA software. We completed the analysis by modeling the data with a simple
star+layer model inspired from the images. Reconstructed images confirm the
general picture of a central star partially obscured by the surrounding
molecular shell of changing opacity. At 1.7mum, the shell becomes optically
thin, with corresponding emission appearing as a ring circling the star. This
is the first direct evidence of the spherical morphology of the molecular
shell. Model fitting confirmed a spherical layer of constant size and changing
opacity over the wavelengths. Rough modeling points to a continuum opacity
within the shell, in addition to the CO and H2O features. Accordingly, it
appeared impossible to model the data by a photosphere alone in any of the
spectral bins.
