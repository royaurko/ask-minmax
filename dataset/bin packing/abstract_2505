We present a fully-exclusive next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD
calculation for vector boson production in hadron-hadron collisions. The
calculation is implemented in a parton level Monte Carlo program, which
includes the gamma-Z interference, finite-width effects, the leptonic decay of
the vector bosons and the corresponding spin correlations. The code allows the
user to apply arbitrary (though infrared safe) kinematical cuts on the
final-states and to compute distributions in the form of bin histograms. We
show some illustrative numerical results at the Tevatron and the LHC.
