We describe a novel algorithm for rounding packing integer programs based on
multidimensional Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Starting from an optimal
fractional feasible solution $\bar{x}$, the procedure converges in polynomial
time to a distribution over (possibly infeasible) point set $P \subset {\{0,1
\}}^n$ such that the expected value of any linear objective function over $P$
equals the value at $\bar{x}$. This is an alternate approach to the classical
randomized rounding method of Raghavan and Thompson \cite{RT:87}.
  Our procedure is very general and in conjunction with discrepancy based
arguments, yield efficient alternate methods for rounding other optimization
problems that can be expressed as packing ILPs including disjoint path problems
and MISR.
