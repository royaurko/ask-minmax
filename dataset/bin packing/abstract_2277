Using molecular-dynamics simulation, we have calculated the interfacial free
energy, \gamma, between a hard-sphere fluid and hard spherical and cylindrical
colloidal particles, as functions of the particle radius R and the fluid
packing fraction \eta= \rho\sigma^3/6, where \rho and \sigma are the number
density and hard-sphere diameter, respectively. These results verify that
Hadwiger's theorem from integral geometry, which predicts that \gamma for a
fluid at a surface, with certain restrictions, should be a linear combination
of the average mean and Gaussian surface curvatures, is valid within the
precision of the calculation for spherical and cylindrical surfaces up to \eta
about 0.42. In addition, earlier results for \gamma for this system [Bryk, et
al., Phys. Rev. E, 68, 031602 (2003)] using a geometrically-based classical
Density Functional Theory are in excellent agreement with the current
simulation results for packing fractions in the range where Hadwiger's theorem
is valid. However, above \eta about 0.42, \gamma(R) shows significant
deviations from the Hadwiger form indicating limitations to its use for
high-density hard-sphere fluids. Using the results of this study together with
Hadwiger's theorem allows one, in principle, to determine $\gamma$ for any
sufficiently smooth surface immersed in a hard-sphere fluid.
