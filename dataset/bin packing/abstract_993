To study heavy ion collisions at energies to be available from the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), we have developed a transport model
that includes both initial partonic and final hadronic interactions.
Specifically, the parton cascade model ZPC, which uses as input the parton
distribution from the HIJING model, is extended to include the quark-gluon to
hadronic matter transition and also final-state hadronic interactions based on
the ART model. Comparisons with SPS data and predictions for RHIC are reported.
