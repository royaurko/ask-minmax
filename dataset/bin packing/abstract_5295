In many semiparametric models that are parameterized by two types of
parameters---a Euclidean parameter of interest and an infinite-dimensional
nuisance parameter---the two parameters are bundled together, that is, the
nuisance parameter is an unknown function that contains the parameter of
interest as part of its argument. For example, in a linear regression model for
censored survival data, the unspecified error distribution function involves
the regression coefficients. Motivated by developing an efficient estimating
method for the regression parameters, we propose a general sieve M-theorem for
bundled parameters and apply the theorem to deriving the asymptotic theory for
the sieve maximum likelihood estimation in the linear regression model for
censored survival data. The numerical implementation of the proposed estimating
method can be achieved through the conventional gradient-based search
algorithms such as the Newton--Raphson algorithm. We show that the proposed
estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal and achieves the
semiparametric efficiency bound. Simulation studies demonstrate that the
proposed method performs well in practical settings and yields more efficient
estimates than existing estimating equation based methods. Illustration with a
real data example is also provided.
