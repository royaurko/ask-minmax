We consider ``lattice glass models'' in which each site can be occupied by at
most one particle, and any particle may have at most l occupied nearest
neighbors. Using the cavity method for locally tree-like lattices, we derive
the phase diagram, with a particular focus on the vitreous phase and the
highest packing limit. We also study the energy landscape via the
configurational entropy, and discuss different equilibrium glassy phases.
Finally, we show that a kinetic freezing, depending on the particular dynamical
rules chosen for the model, can prevent the equilibrium glass transitions.
