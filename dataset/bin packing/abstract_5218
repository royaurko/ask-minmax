Angular correlations between charged trigger and associated particles are
measured by the ALICE detector in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon
centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV for transverse momentum ranges within 0.5 <
pT,assoc < pT,trig < 4 GeV/c. The correlations are measured over two units of
pseudorapidity and full azimuthal angle in different intervals of event
multiplicity, and expressed as associated yield per trigger particle. Two
long-range ridge-like structures, one on the near side and one on the away
side, are observed when the per-trigger yield obtained in low-multiplicity
events is subtracted from the one in high-multiplicity events. The excess on
the near-side is qualitatively similar to that recently reported by the CMS
collaboration, while the excess on the away-side is reported for the first
time. The two-ridge structure projected onto azimuthal angle is quantified with
the second and third Fourier coefficients as well as by near-side and away-side
yields and widths. The yields on the near side and on the away side are equal
within the uncertainties for all studied event multiplicity and pT bins, and
the widths show no significant evolution with event multiplicity or pT. These
findings suggest that the near-side ridge is accompanied by an essentially
identical away-side ridge.
