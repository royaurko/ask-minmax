The understanding of the prompt $\gamma$-ray spectra of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) is of great importance to correctly interpreting the physical mechanisms
that produce the underlying event as well as the structure of the relativistic
jet from which the emission emanates. Time-resolved analysis of these spectra
is the main method of extracting information from the data. In this work,
several techniques for temporal binning of GRB spectra are examined to
understand the systematics associated with each with the goal of finding the
best method(s) to bin lightcurves for analysis. The following binning methods
are examined: constant cadence (CC), Bayesian blocks (BB), signal-to-noise
(S/N) and Knuth bins (KB). I find that both the KB and BB methods reconstruct
the intrinsic spectral evolution accurately while the S/N method fails in most
cases. The CC method is accurate when the cadence is not too coarse but does
not necessarily bin the data based on the true source variability.
Additionally, the integrated pulse properties are investigated and compared to
the time-resolved properties. If intrinsic spectral evolution is present then
the integrated properties are not useful in identifying physical and
cosmological properties of GRBs without knowing the physical emission mechanism
and its evolution.
