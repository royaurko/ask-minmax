We study a simple model of periodic contraction and extension of large
intruders in a granular bed to understand the mechanism for swimming in an
otherwise solid media. Using an event-driven simulation, we find optimal
conditions that idealized swimmers must use to critically fluidize a sand bed
so that it is rigid enough to support a load when needed, but fluid enough to
permit motion with minimal resistance. Swimmers - or other intruders - that
agitate the bed too rapidly produce large voids that prevent traction from
being achieved, while swimmers that move too slowly cannot travel before the
bed re-solidifies around them i.e., the swimmers locally probe the fundamental
time-scale in a granular packing.
