We model the packing structure of a marginally jammed bulk ensemble of
polydisperse spheres using an extended granocentric mode explicitly taking into
account rattlers. This leads to a relation- ship between the characteristic
parameters of the packing, such as the mean number of neighbors and the
fraction of rattlers, and the radial distribution function g(r). We find
excellent agreement between the model predictions for g(r) and packing
simulations as well as experiments on jammed emulsion droplets. The observed
quantitative agreement opens the path towards a full structural
characterization of jammed particle systems for imaging and scattering
experiments.
