Protein structure is generally conceptualized as the global arrangement or of
smaller, local motifs of helices, sheets, and loops. These regular, recurring
secondary structural elements have well-understood and standardized definitions
in terms of amino acid backbone geometry and the manner in which hydrogen
bonding requirements are satisfied. Recently, "tube" models have been proposed
to explain protein secondary structure in terms of the geometrically optimal
packing of a featureless cylinder. However, atomically detailed simulations
demonstrate that such packing considerations alone are insufficient for
defining secondary structure; both excluded volume and hydrogen bonding must be
explicitly modeled for helix formation. These results have fundamental
implications for the construction and interpretation of realistic and
meaningful biomacromolecular models.
