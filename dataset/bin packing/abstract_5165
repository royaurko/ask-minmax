The BRAHMS measured proton-to-pion ratios in Au+Au and p+p collisions at
\rootsnn{62.4} and \rootsnn{200} are presented as a function of transverse
momentum and collision centrality within the pseudo-rapidity range 0 < eta <
3.8 The results for Au+Au at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV are compared with predictions
from models which incorporate hydro-dynamics, hadron rescattering and jet
production, in the eta interval covered. In Au+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 200
GeV, eta ~ 2.2, and at sqrt(sNN) = 62.4 GeV, eta = 0, the bulk medium can be
characterized by the common value of \mi_B ~ 65 MeV. The p/pi ratios measured
for these two selections display a striking agreement in the pT range covered
(up to 2.2 GeV/c). At a collision energy of 62.4 GeV and at forward
pseudo-rapidity we found a crossing point of p/pi+ ratios measured in central
and semi-peripheral Au+Au and in p+p reactions. The crossing occurs in the
narrow eta bin around value of 3.2, simultaneously in the whole covered pT
range (0.3 GeV/c < pT < 2 GeV/c).
