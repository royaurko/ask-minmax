Using the first seven known virial coefficients and forcing it to possess two
branch-point singularities, a new equation of state for the hard-sphere fluid
is proposed. This equation of state predicts accurate values of the higher
virial coefficients, a radius of convergence smaller than the close-packing
value, and it is as accurate as the rescaled virial expansion and better than
the Pad\'e [3/3] equations of state. Consequences regarding the convergence
properties of the virial series and the use of similar equations of state for
hard-core fluids in $d$ dimensions are also pointed out.
