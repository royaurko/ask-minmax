Two dimensional space-filling bearings are dense packings of disks that can
rotate without slip. We consider the entire first family of bearings for loops
of size four and propose a hierarchical construction of their contact network.
We provide analytic expressions for the clustering coefficient and degree
distribution, revealing bipartite scale-free behavior with tunable degree
exponent depending on the bearing parameters. We also analyze their average
shortest path and percolation properties.
