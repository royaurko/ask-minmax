Correlations in the hadron distributions produced in relativistic Au+Au
collisions are studied in the discrete wavelet expansion method. The analysis
is performed in the space of pseudorapidity (|eta| < 1) and azimuth (full 2 pi)
in bins of transverse momentum (p_t) from 0.14 < p_t < 2.1 GeV/c. In peripheral
Au+Au collisions a correlation structure ascribed to mini-jet fragmentation is
observed. It evolves with collision centrality and p_t in a way not seen before
which suggests strong dissipation of minijet fragmentation in the
longitudinally-expanding medium.
