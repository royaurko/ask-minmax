An extension of the Asakura-Oosawa-Vrij model of hard sphere colloids and
non-adsorbing polymers, that takes polymer non-ideality into account through a
repulsive stepfunction pair potential between polymers, is studied with grand
canonical Monte Carlo simulations and density functional theory. Simulation
results validate previous theoretical findings for the shift of the bulk fluid
demixing binodal upon increasing strength of polymer-polymer repulsion,
promoting the tendency to mix. For increasing strength of the polymer-polymer
repulsion, simulation and theory consistently predict the interfacial tension
of the free colloidal liquid-gas interface to decrease significantly for fixed
colloid density difference in the coexisting phases, and to increase for fixed
polymer reservoir packing fraction.
