We report a study of the process pp to l nu gamma gamma at CERN's Large
Hadron Collider, using a leading order partonic-level event generator
interfaced to the Pythia program for showering and hadronisation and a with a
generic detector simulation. The process is sensitive to possible anomalous
quartic gauge boson couplings of the form W W gamma gamma. It is shown how
unitarity-safe limits may be placed on these anomalous couplings by applying a
binned maximum likelihood fit to the distribution of the two-photon invariant
mass, M(gamma gamma), below a cutoff of 1TeV. Assuming 30fb-1 of integrated
luminosity, the expected limits are two orders of magnitude tighter than those
available from LEP. It is also demonstrated how the Standard Model radiation
zero feature of the qq to W gamma gamma process may be observed in the
difference between the two-photon and charged lepton pseudo-rapidities.
