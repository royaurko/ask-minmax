The multifunctional support structure (MFSS) technology is promising a
reduction of overall mass and packing volume for spacecraft (S/C) electronic
components. This technology eliminates the electronic box chassis and the
cabling between the boxes by integrating the electronics, thermal control and
the structural support into one single element. The ultimate goal of the MFSS
technology is to reduce size, weight, power consumption, cost and production
time for future spacecraft components. The paper focus on the main challenges
and solutions related to the thermal management within the MFSS technology
based on the selected charge regulator (CR) application. Starting with the main
set of thermal requirements for the CR the paper will include, conceptual and
detailed design based on highconductivity carbon fibre CFRP, description and
results of the thermal material sample test program ; parameter and results for
the performed first thermal simulation
