The present study asks how cooperation and consequently structure can emerge
in many different evolutionary contexts. Cooperation, here, is a persistent
behavioural pattern of individual entities pooling and sharing resources.
Examples are: individual cells forming multicellular systems whose various
parts pool and share nutrients; pack animals pooling and sharing prey; families
firms, or modern nation states pooling and sharing financial resources. In
these examples, each atomistic decision, at a point in time, of the better-off
entity to cooperate poses a puzzle: the better-off entity will book an
immediate net loss -- why should it cooperate? For each example, specific
explanations have been put forward. Here we point out a very general mechanism
-- a sufficient null model -- whereby cooperation can evolve. The mechanism is
based the following insight: natural growth processes tend to be
multiplicative. In multiplicative growth, ergodicity is broken in such a way
that fluctuations have a net-negative effect on the time-average growth rate,
although they have no effect on the growth rate of the ensemble average.
Pooling and sharing resources reduces fluctuations, which leaves ensemble
averages unchanged but -- contrary to common perception -- increases the
time-average growth rate for each cooperator.
