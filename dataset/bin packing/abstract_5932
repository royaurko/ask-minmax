The extraction of detailed nuclear structure information from transfer
reactions requires reliable, well-normalized data as well as optical potentials
and a theoretical framework demonstrated to work well in the relevant mass and
beam energy ranges. It is rare that the theoretical ingredients can be tested
well for exotic nuclei owing to the paucity of data. The halo nucleus Be-11 has
been examined through the 10Be(d,p) reaction in inverse kinematics at
equivalent deuteron energies of 12,15,18, and 21.4 MeV. Elastic scattering of
Be-10 on protons was used to select optical potentials for the analysis of the
transfer data. Additionally, data from the elastic and inelastic scattering of
Be-10 on deuterons was used to fit optical potentials at the four measured
energies. Transfers to the two bound states and the first resonance in Be-11
were analyzed using the Finite Range ADiabatic Wave Approximation (FR-ADWA).
Consistent values of the spectroscopic factor of both the ground and first
excited states were extracted from the four measurements, with average values
of 0.71(5) and 0.62(4) respectively. The calculations for transfer to the first
resonance were found to be sensitive to the size of the energy bin used and
therefore could not be used to extract a spectroscopic factor.
