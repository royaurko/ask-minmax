We systematically investigate the self-assembly of anisotropic cone-shaped
particles decorated by ring-like attractive patches. We demonstrate that the
self-assembled clusters, which arise due to the conical particle's anisotropic
shape combined with directional attractive interactions, are precise for
certain cluster sizes, resulting in a precise packing sequence of clusters of
increasing sizes with decreasing cone angles. We thoroughly explore the
dependence of cluster packing on cone angle and cooling rate, and categorize
the resulting structures as stable and metastable clusters. We also discuss the
implication of our simulation results in the context of the Israelachvili
packing rule for surfactants, and a recent geometrical packing analysis on hard
cones in the limit of large numbers of cones.
