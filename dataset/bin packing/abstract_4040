Two-particle azimuthal correlations of high-pT hadrons can serve as a probe
of interactions of partons with the dense medium produced in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions. First NA49 results on such correlations are presented for
central and mid-central Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV beam energy, for different
centrality bins and charge combinations of trigger and associate particles.
These results feature a flattened away-side peak in the most central
collisions, which is consistent with expectations of the medium-interaction
scenario. A comparison with CERES Pb+Au results at the same energy, as well as
with PHENIX Au+Au results at the top RHIC energy, is provided.
