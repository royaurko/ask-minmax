The cosmological information encapsulated within a weak lensing signal can be
accessed via the power spectrum of the so called convergence. We use the Fisher
information matrix formalism with the convergence power spectrum as the
observable to predict how future weak lensing surveys will constrain the
expansion rate and the growth function as functions of redshift without using
any specific model to parameterize these two quantities. To do this, we divide
redshift space into bins and linearly interpolate the functions with the
centers of the redshift bins as sampling points, using a fiducial set of
parameters. At the same time, we use these redshift bins for power spectrum
tomography, where we analyze not only the power spectrum in each bin but also
their cross-correlation in order to maximize the extracted information. We find
that a small number of bins with the given photometric redshift mea- surement
precision is sufficient to access most of the information content and that the
projected constraints are comparable to current constraints from X-ray cluster
growth data. This way, the weak lensing data alone might be able to rule out
some modified gravity theories only at the 2{\sigma} level, but when including
priors from surveys of the cosmic microwave background radiation this would
improve to a 3{\sigma} level.
