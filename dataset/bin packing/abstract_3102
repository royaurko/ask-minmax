In this paper we develop two mathematical models to predict the release
kinetics of a water soluble drug from a polymer/excipient matrix tablet. The
first of our models consists of a random walk on a weighted graph, where the
vertices of the graph represent particles of drug, excipient and polymer,
respectively. The graph itself is the contact graph of a multidisperse random
sphere packing. The second model describes the dissolution and the subsequent
diffusion of the active drug out of a porous matrix using a system of partial
differential equations. The predictions of both models show good qualitative
agreement with experimental release curves. The models will provide tools for
designing better controlled release devices.
