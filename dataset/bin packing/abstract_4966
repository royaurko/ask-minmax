We present composite UV spectra for low redshift Type 1 AGN binned to exploit
the information content of the Eigenvector 1 (E1) parameter space. Composite
spectra allow a decomposition of the CIV1549 line profile - one of the
strongest high-ionization lines. The simplest CIV decomposition into narrow
(NLR), broad (BLR) and very broad (VBLR) components suggests that different
components have an analog in Hb with two major exceptions. VBLR emission is
seen only in population B (FWHM(Hb)>4000 km/s) sources. A blue
shifted/asymmetric BLR component is seen only in pop. A (FWHM(Hb)<4000 km/s)
HIL such as CIV. The blueshifted component is thought to arise in a wind or
outflow. Our analysis suggests that such a wind can only be produced in pop. A
(almost all radio-quiet) sources where the accretion rate is relatively high.
Comparison between broad UV lines in radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ)
sources shows few significant differences. Clear evidence is found for a narrow
CIV component in most radio-loud sources. We find also some indirect
indications that the black hole (BH) spin, rather than BH mass or accretion
rate is a key trigger in determining whether an object will be RL or RQ. We
find a ten-fold decrease in EW CIV with Eddington ratio (decreasing from ~1 to
\~0.01) while NV shows no change. These trends suggest a luminosity-independent
"Baldwin effect" where the physical driver may be the Eddington ratio.
