Densely packed systems of thermal particles in curved geometries are
frequently encountered in biological and microfluidic systems. In 2D systems,
at sufficiently high surface coverage, diffusive motion is widely known to be
strongly affected by physical confinement, e.g., by the walls. In this Letter,
we explore the effects of confinement by shape, not rigid boundaries, on the
diffusion of particles by confining them to the surface of a cylinder. We find
that both the magnitude and the directionality of lateral diffusion is strongly
influenced by the radius of the cylinder. An anisotropy between diffusion in
the longitudinal and circumferential direction of the cylinder develops. We
demonstrate that the origin of this effect lies in the fact that screw-like
packings of mono- and oligodisperse discs on the surface of a cylinder induce
preferential collective motions in the circumferential direction, but also show
that even in polydisperse systems lacking such order an intrinsic finite size
confinement effect increases diffusivity in the circumferential direction.
