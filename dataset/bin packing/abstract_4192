We present observations of the extremely long GRB 080704 obtained with the
instruments of the Interplanetary Network (IPN). The observations reveal two
distinct emission episodes, separated by a ~1500 s long period of quiescence.
The total burst duration is about 2100 s. We compare the temporal and spectral
characteristics of this burst with those obtained for other ultra-long GRBs and
discuss these characteristics in the context of different models.
