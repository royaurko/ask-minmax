Observations of the transient accreting pulsar XTE J1946+274 made with the
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer during the course of the 1998 September-November
outburst, reveal a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (or "cyclotron line")
in the hard X-ray spectrum near 35 keV. We determine a centroid energy of 36.2
+0.5/-0.7 keV, which implies a magnetic field strength of 3.1(1+z)x10^12 G,
where z is the gravitational redshift of the scattering region. The optical
depth, Tau = 0.33 +0.07/-0.06, and width, sigma = 3.37 +0.92/-0.75 keV, are
typical of known cyclotron lines in other pulsars. This discovery makes XTE
J1946+274 one of thirteen pulsars with securely detected cyclotron lines
resulting in direct magnetic field measurements.
