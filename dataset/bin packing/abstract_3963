A three-neutrino analysis of oscillation data is performed using the recent,
more finely binned Super-K oscillation data, together with the CHOOZ, K2K, and
MINOS data. The solar parameters, $\Delta_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$, are fixed
from a recent analysis, and $\Delta_{32}$, $\theta_{13}$, and $\theta_{23}$ are
varied. We utilize the full three-neutrino oscillation probability and an exact
treatment of the Earth's MSW effect with a castle-wall density. By including
terms linear in $\theta_{13}$ and $\varepsilon := \theta_{23} - \pi/4$, we find
asymmetric errors for these parameters $\theta_{13}=-0.07^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$ and
$\varepsilon=0.03^{+0.09}_{-0.15}$. For $\theta_{13}$, we see that the lower
bound is primarily set by the CHOOZ experiment while the upper bound is
determined by the low energy $e$-like events in the Super-K atmospheric data.
We find that the parameters $\theta_{13}$ and $\varepsilon$ are correlated --
the preferred negative value of $\theta_{13}$ permits the preferred value of
$\theta_{23}$ to be in the second octant, and the true value of $\theta_{13}$
affects the allowed region for $\theta_{23}$.
