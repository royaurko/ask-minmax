Local similarity theory is suggested based on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency and
the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy instead the turbulent fluxes
used in the traditional Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Based on dimensional
analysis (Pi theorem), it is shown that any properly scaled statistics of the
small-scale turbulence are universal functions of a stability parameter defined
as the ratio of a reference height z and the Dougherty-Ozmidov length scale
which in the limit of z-less stratification is linearly proportional to the
Obukhov length scale. Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made at five
levels on a 20-m tower over the Arctic pack ice during the Surface Heat Budget
of the Arctic Ocean experiment (SHEBA) are used to examine the behaviour of
different similarity functions in the stable boundary layer. It is found that
in the framework of this approach the non-dimensional turbulent viscosity is
equal to the gradient Richardson number whereas the non-dimensional turbulent
thermal diffusivity is equal to the flux Richardson number. These results are a
consequence of the approximate local balance between production of turbulence
by the mean flow shear and viscous dissipation. The turbulence framework based
on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic
energy may have practical advantages for estimating turbulence when the fluxes
are not directly available.
