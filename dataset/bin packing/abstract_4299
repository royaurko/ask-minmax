Charge fluctuations provide a possible signature for the existence of the
de-confined Quark Gluon Plasma phase (QGP). Being sensitive to the square of
the charges, fluctuations in QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are
significantly different from those of a hadron gas with unit charged particles.
Studies of charge fluctuations have been carried out using the variable,
$\nu_{(+-,dyn)}$ which, by its construction, is free from collisional bias
(impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of
charged particles within the detector acceptance). The dependence of charge
fluctuations on the pseudo--rapidity windows for various centrality bins is
analyzed for Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV in the ALICE
experiment at CERN-LHC. A scaling behavior is observed as a function of
increasing pseudo-rapidity window for the charge fluctuations, expressed in
terms of \nchnudyn, where $N_{ch}$ is the number of charged particles. The
results are compared to experimental measurements at lower energies and to
model predictions.
