Using molecular dynamics simulation of a standard bead-spring model we
investigate the density crossover scaling of strictly two-dimensional
self-avoiding polymer chains focusing on properties related to the contact
exponent set by the intrachain subchain size distribution. Irrespective of the
density sufficiently long chains are found to consist of compact packings of
blobs of fractal perimeter dimension dp = 5/4.
