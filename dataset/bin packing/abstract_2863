We study the relaxation process in a two-dimensional lattice gas model, where
the interactions come from the excluded volume. In this model particles have
three arms with an asymmetrical shape, which results in geometrical frustration
that inhibits full packing. A dynamical crossover is found at the arm
percolation of the particles, from a dynamical behavior characterized by a
single step relaxation above the transition, to a two-step decay below it.
Relaxation functions of the self-part of density fluctuations are well fitted
by a stretched exponential form, with a $\beta$ exponent decreasing when the
temperature is lowered until the percolation transition is reached, and
constant below it. The structural arrest of the model seems to happen only at
the maximum density of the model, where both the inverse diffusivity and the
relaxation time of density fluctuations diverge with a power law. The dynamical
non linear susceptibility, defined as the fluctuations of the self-overlap
autocorrelation, exhibits a peak at some characteristic time, which seems to
diverge at the maximum density as well.
