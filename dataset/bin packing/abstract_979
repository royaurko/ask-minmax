We study the quasinormal modes and the late-time tail behavior of scalar
perturbation in the background of a black hole localized on a tensional
three-brane in a world with two large extra dimensions. We find that finite
brane tension modifies the standard results in the wave dynamics for the case
of a black hole on a brane with completely negligible tension. We argue that
the wave dynamics contains the imprint of the extra dimensions.
