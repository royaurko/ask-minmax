We present a new homogeneous set of metallicity estimates based on Lick
indices for 245 old globular clusters of the M31 galaxy comprised in the
Revised Bologna Catalog. The metallicity distribution of the M31 globular
clusters is briefly discussed and compared with that of the Milky Way. Simple
parametric statistics suggests that the [Fe/H] distribution is likely not
unimodal. The strong correlation between metallicity and kinematics found in
previous studies is confirmed. The most metal-rich GCs tend to be packed at the
center of the system and share the galactic rotation as traced by the HI disk.
Although the velocity dispersion around the curve increases with decreasing
metallicity, also clusters with [Fe/H]<-1.0 display a clear rotational pattern,
at odds with their Milky Way counterparts.
