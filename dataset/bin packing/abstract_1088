We establish the gravity/fluid correspondence in the nonminimally coupled
scalar-tensor theory of gravity. Imposing Petrov-like boundary conditions over
the gravitational field, we find that, for a certain class of background
metrics, the boundary fluctuations obey the standard Navier-Stokes equation for
an incompressible fluid without any external force term in the leading order
approximation under the near horizon expansion. That is to say, the scalar
field fluctuations does not contribute in the leading order approximation
regardless of what kind of boundary condition we impose on it.
