Using a multiphase transport model (AMPT) with both partonic and hadronic
interactions, we study the multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions
of charged particles such as pions, kaons and protons in central Au+Au
collisions at RHIC energies. Effects due to nuclear shadowing and jet quenching
on these observables are also studied. We further show preliminary results on
the production of multistrange baryons from the strangeness-exchange reactions
during the hadronic stage of heavy ion collisions.
