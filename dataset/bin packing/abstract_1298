We study the aging dynamics in a model for dense simple liquids, in which
particles interact through a hard-core repulsion complemented by a short-ranged
attractive potential, of the kind found in colloidal suspensions. In this
system, at large packing fractions, kinetically arrested disordered states can
be created both on cooling (attractive glass) and on heating (repulsive glass).
The possibility of having two distinct glasses, at the same packing fraction,
with two different dynamics offers the unique possibility of comparing --
within the same model -- the differences in aging dynamics. We find that, while
the aging dynamics of the repulsive glass is similar to the one observed in
atomic and molecular systems, the aging dynamics of the attractive glass shows
novel unexpected features.
