We study the classical solutions of three dimensional topologically massive
gravity (TMG) and its higher spin generalization, in the first order
formulation. The action of higher spin TMG has been proposed in arXiv:1110.5113
to be of a Chern-Simons-like form. The equations of motion are more complicated
than the ones in pure higher spin AdS$_3$ gravity, but are still tractable. As
all the solutions in higher spin gravity are automatically the solutions of
higher spin TMG, we focus on other solutions. We manage to find the AdS pp-wave
solutions with higher spin hair, and find that the nonvanishing higher spin
fields may or may not modify the pp-wave geometry. In order to discuss the
warped spacetime, we introduce the notion of special Killing vector, which is
defined to be the symmetry on the frame-like fields. We reproduce various
warped spacetimes of TMG in our framework, with the help of special Killing
vectors.
