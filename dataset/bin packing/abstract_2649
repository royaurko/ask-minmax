We explore how finite integration times or equivalently temporal binning
induces morphological distortions to the transit light-curve. These
distortions, if uncorrected for, lead to the retrieval of erroneous system
parameters and may even lead to some planetary candidates being rejected as
ostensibly unphysical. We provide analytic expressions for estimating the
disturbance to the various light-curve parameters as a function of the
integration time. These effects are particularly crucial in light of the
long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by, for
example, Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits (COROT) and the Kepler
Mission (8.5 and 30 min). One of the dominant effects of long integration times
is a systematic underestimation of the light-curve-derived stellar density,
which has significant ramifications for transit surveys. We present a
discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects
and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such techniques, as a
function of integration time and numerical resolution. This allows for an
economic choice of resolution before attempting fits of long-cadence
light-curves. We provide a comparison of the short- and long-cadence
light-curves of TrES-2b and show that the retrieved transit parameters are
consistent using the techniques discussed here.
