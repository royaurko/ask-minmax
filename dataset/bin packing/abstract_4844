Nanostructuring of graphene is in part motivated by the requirement to open a
gap in the electronic band structure. In particular, a periodically perforated
graphene sheet in the form of an antidot lattice may have such a gap. Such
systems have been investigated with a view towards application in transistor or
waveguiding devices. The desired properties have been predicted for atomically
precise systems, but fabrication methods will introduce significant levels of
disorder in the shape, position and edge configurations of individual antidots.
We calculate the electronic transport properties of a wide range of finite
graphene antidot devices to determine the effect of such disorders on their
performance. Modest geometric disorder is seen to have a detrimental effect on
devices containing small, tightly packed antidots, which have optimal
performance in pristine lattices. Larger antidots display a range of effects
which strongly depend on their edge geometry. Antidot systems with armchair
edges are seen to have a far more robust transport gap than those composed from
zigzag or mixed edge antidots. The role of disorder in waveguide geometries is
slightly different and can enhance performance by extending the energy range
over which waveguiding behavior is observed.
