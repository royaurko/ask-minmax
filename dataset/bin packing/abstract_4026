Using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy, we study the temperature-dependent
complex optical conductivity of the topological insulator,
Bi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.8}$Se$_{1.2}$ single-crystal from 5 K to 150 K in
the terahertz regime (0.4 -- 3.0 THz). We analyze our experimental results
using the Drude-Lorentz model, with the Drude component representing the
metallic surface state and the Lorentz term representing the bulk insulating
state. We find the conductivity to be dominated by the Drude contribution,
suggesting the presence of metallic surface states. The low-frequency real
conductivity follows a thermally-activated behavior. Its origin is also
discussed.
