Measurements of the variation of inclusive jet suppression as a function of
relative azimuthal angle, Delta phi, with respect to the elliptic event plane
provide insight into the path-length dependence of jet quenching. ATLAS has
measured the Delta phi dependence of jet yields in 0.14 nb^-1 of sqrt(s(NN))=
2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC for jet transverse momenta p_T > 45 GeV in
different collision centrality bins using an underlying event subtraction
procedure that accounts for elliptic flow. The variation of the jet yield with
Delta phi was characterized by the parameter, v_2^jet, and the ratio of
out-of-plane (Delta phi ~ pi/2) to in-plane (Delta phi ~ 0) yields. Non-zero
v_2^jet values were measured in all centrality bins for p_T < 160 GeV. The jet
yields are observed to vary by as much as 20% between in-plane and out-of-plane
directions.
