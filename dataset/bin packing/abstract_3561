Mode-I fracture exhibits microbranching in the high velocity regime where the
simple straight crack is unstable. For velocities below the instability,
classic modeling using linear elasticity is valid. However, showing the
existence of the instability and calculating the dynamics post-instability
within the linear elastic framework is difficult and controversial. The
experimental results give several indications that the microbranching phenomena
is basically a three-dimensional phenomena. Nevertheless, the theoretical
effort has been focused mostly in two-dimensional modeling. There some success
has been achieved concerning the origin of the instability and the
post-instability behavior, particularly within the context of atomistic
simulations. In this work we study the microbranching instability using
three-dimensional atomistic simulations, exploring the difference between the
2D and 3D models. We find that the basic 3D fracture pattern shares similar
behavior with the 2D case. Nevertheless, some pure 3D experimental effects are
reproduced by our simulations, and the quantitative features of the
microbranches, separating the regimes of steady-state cracks (mirror) and
post-instability (mist-hackle) are reproduced as well. We see a 3D-2D
transition as the crack velocity increases, consistent with the experimental
findings.
