We present results from a detailed simulation of a quasi-2D dissipative
granular gas, kept in a non-condensed steady state via vertical shaking over a
rough substrate. This gas shows a weak power-law decay in the tails of its Pair
Distribution Functions (PDF's), indicating fractality and therefore a tendency
to form clusters over several size scales. This clustering depends
monotonically on the dissipation coefficient, and disappears when the
sphere-sphere collisions are conservative. Clustering is also sensitive to the
packing fraction. This gas also displays the standard nonequilibrium
characteristics of similar systems, including non-Maxwellian velocity
distributions. The diffusion coefficients are calculated over all the
conditions of the simulations, and it is found that diluted gases are more
diffusive for smaller restitution coefficients.
