We derive Hawking radiation of 5-dimensional black rings from gauge and
gravitational anomalies using the method proposed by Robinson and Wilczek. We
find as in the black hole case, the problem could reduce to a (1+1) dimensional
field theory and the anomalies result in correct Hawking temperature for
neutral,dipole and charged black rings.
