The compositional ordering of Ag, Pb, Sb, Te ions in
(AgSbTe$_{2}$)$_{x}$(PbTe)$_{2(1-x)}$ systems possessing a NaCl structure is
studied using a Coulomb lattice gas (CLG) model on a face-centered cubic (fcc)
lattice and Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show different possible
microstructural orderings. Ordered superlattice structures formed out of
AgSbTe$_{2}$ layers separated by Pb$_{2}$Te$_{2}$ layers are observed for a
large range of $x$ values. For $x=0.5$, we see an array of tubular structures
formed by AgSbTe$_{2}$ and Pb$_{2}$Te$_{2}$ blocks. For $x=1$, AgSbTe$_{2}$ has
a body-centered tetragonal (bct) structure which is in agreement with previous
Monte Carlo simulation results for restricted primitive model (RPM) at closed
packed density. The phase diagram of this frustrated CLG system is discussed.
