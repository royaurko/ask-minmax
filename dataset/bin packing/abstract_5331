We present the new energy calibration of the ISGRI detector onboard INTEGRAL,
that has been implemented in the Offline Scientific Analysis (OSA) version 10.
With the previous OSA 9 version, a clear departure from stability of both W and
22Na background lines was observed after MJD 54307 (revolution ~583). To solve
this problem, the energy correction in OSA 10 uses: 1) a new description for
the gain depending on the time and the pulse rise time, 2) an improved
temperature correction per module, and 3) a varying shape of the low threshold,
corrected for the change in energy resolution. With OSA 10, both background
lines show a remarkably stable behavior with a relative energy variation below
1% around the nominal position (>6% in OSA 9), and the energy reconstruction at
low energies is more stable compared to previous OSA versions. We extracted
Crab light curves with ISGRI in different energy bands using all available data
since the beginning of the mission, and found a very good agreement with the
currently operational hard X-ray instruments Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM.
