Every year, the computing resources available on dynamically partially
reconfigurable devices increase enormously. In the near future, we expect many
applications to run on a single reconfigurable device. In this paper, we
present a concept for multitasking on dynamically partially reconfigurable
systems called virtual area management. We explain its advantages, show its
challenges, and discuss possible solutions. Furthermore, we investigate one
problem in more detail: Packing modules with time-varying resource requests.
This problem from the reconfigurable computing field results in a completely
new optimization problem not tackled before. ILP-based and heuristic approaches
are compared in an experimental study and the drawbacks and benefits discussed.
