A matrix-based approach to numerical integration of the DGLAP evolution
equations is presented. The method arises naturally on discretisation of the
Bjorken x variable, a necessary procedure for numerical integration. Owing to
peculiar properties of the matrices involved, the resulting equations take on a
particularly simple form and may be solved in closed analytical form in the
variable t=ln(alpha_0/alpha). Such an approach affords parametrisation via data
x bins, rather than fixed functional forms. Thus, with the aid of the full
correlation matrix, appraisal of the behaviour in different x regions is
rendered more transparent and free of pollution from unphysical
cross-correlations inherent to functional parametrisations. Computationally,
the entire programme results in greater speed and stability; the matrix
representation developed is extremely compact. Moreover, since the parameter
dependence is linear, fitting is very stable and may be performed analytically
in a single pass over the data values.
