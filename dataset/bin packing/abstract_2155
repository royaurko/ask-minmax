We consider a class of operator-induced norms, acting as finite-dimensional
surrogates to the L2 norm, and study their approximation properties over
Hilbert subspaces of L2 . The class includes, as a special case, the usual
empirical norm encountered, for example, in the context of nonparametric
regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). Our results have
implications to the analysis of M-estimators in models based on
finite-dimensional linear approximation of functions, and also to some related
packing problems.
