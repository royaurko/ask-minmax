Using molecular dynamics simulations we study the slow dynamics of a
colloidal fluid annealed within a matrix of obstacles quenched from an
equilibrated colloidal fluid. We choose all particles to be of the same size
and to interact as hard spheres, thus retaining all features of the porous
confinement while limiting the control parameters to the packing fraction of
the matrix, {\Phi}m, and that of the fluid, {\Phi}f. We conduct detailed
investigations on several dynamic properties, including the tagged-particle and
collective intermediate scattering functions, the mean-squared displacement,
and the van Hove function. We show the confining obstacles to profoundly impact
the relaxation pattern of various quantifiers pertinent to the fluid. Varying
the type of quantifier (tagged-particle or collective) as well as {\Phi}m and
{\Phi}f, we unveil both discontinuous and continuous arrest scenarios.
Furthermore, we discover subdiffusive behavior and demonstrate its close
connection to the matrix structure. Our findings partly confirm the various
predictions of a recent extension of mode-coupling theory to the
quenched-annealed protocol.
