A rateless coding scheme transmits incrementally more and more coded bits
over an unknown channel until all the information bits are decoded reliably by
the receiver. We propose a new rateless coding scheme based on polar codes, and
we show that this scheme is capacity-achieving, i.e. its information rate is as
good as the best code specifically designed for the unknown channel. Previous
rateless coding schemes are designed for specific classes of channels such as
AWGN channels, binary erasure channels, etc. but the proposed rateless coding
scheme is capacity-achieving for broad classes of channels as long as they are
ordered via degradation. Moreover, it inherits the conceptual and computational
simplicity of polar codes.
