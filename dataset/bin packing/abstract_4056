We study a class of topological black hole solutions in RSII braneworld
scenario in the presence of a localized Maxwell field on the brane. Such a
black hole can carry two types of charge, one arising from the extra dimension,
the tidal charge, and the other one from a localized gauge field confined to
the brane. We find that the localized charge on the brane modifies the bulk
geometry and in particular the bulk Weyl tensor. The bulk geometry does not
depend on different topologies of the horizons. We present the temperature and
entropy expressions associated with the event horizon of the braneworld black
hole and by using the first law of black hole thermodynamics we calculate the
mass of the black hole.
