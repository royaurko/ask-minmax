After the first nine years of INTEGRAL operational life, the discovery of new
sources and source types, a large fraction of which are highly transient or
highly absorbed, is certainly one of the most compelling results and legacies
of INTEGRAL. Frequent monitoring of the Galactic Plane in AO8 and AO9 campaigns
allowed us to detect transient sources, both known and new, confirming that the
gamma-ray sky is dominated by the extreme variability of different classes of
objects. Regular scans of the Galactic Plane by INTEGRAL provide the most
sensitive hard X-ray wide survey to date of our Galaxy, with flux limits of the
order of 0.3 mCrab for an exposure time of ~2Ms. Many transient sources have
been detected on a wide range of time scales (~hours to months) and identified
by triggered followup observations, mainly by Swift/XRT and optical/infrared
telescopes. These discoveries are very important to characterize the X-ray
binary population in our Galaxy, that is necessary input for evolution studies.
The transient source monitoring is crucial to sample a variety of physical
conditions corresponding to a large span in luminosity. The long exposure times
available allow us to define the spectral and timing properties of the known
sources and the global properties of each object class.
