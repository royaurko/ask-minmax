The temperature and angle dependent resistivity of
Ba(Fe$_{0.75}$Ru$_{0.25}$)$_2$As$_2$ single crystals were measured in magnetic
fields up to 14 T. The temperature dependent resistivity with the magnetic
field aligned parallel to c-axis and ab-planes allow us to derive the slope of
d$H_{c2}^{ab}/dT$ and d$H_{c2}^c/dT$ near $T_c$ yielding an anisotropy ratio
$\Gamma=dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT/dH_{c2}^c/dT \approx$ 2. By scaling the curves of
resistivity vs. angle measured at a fixed temperature but different magnetic
fields within the framework of the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory, we
obtained the anisotropy in an alternative way. Again we found that the
anisotropy $(m_c/m_{ab})^{1/2}$ was close to 2. This value is very similar to
that in Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (K-doped Ba122) and
Ba(Fe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$)$_2$As$_2$ (Co-doped Ba122). This suggests that the
3D warping effect of the Fermi surface in Ru-doped samples may not be stronger
than that in the K-doped or Co-doped Ba122 samples, therefore the possible
nodes appearing in Ru-doped samples cannot be ascribed to the 3D warping effect
of the Fermi surface.
