In a recent paper by Jones et al., it is argued, based on FP-LAPW
band-structure calculations, that previous calculations of ground-state
properties for actinides, using the FP-LMTO method implemented by J. M. Wills,
are in error. We demonstrate in this paper that the conclusions of Jones et.
al. are unfounded. Calculations using the FP-LMTO method are compared with
calculations performed with the FP-LAPW method and, in contradiction to
statements by Jones et. al., they agree very well. The limitation of the
present implementation of the spin-orbit coupling is discussed, where
especially the 6p states pose a difficulty. The observed discrepancy (0-10%)
between the FP-LMTO calculations and the recent FP-LAPW calculation of Jones
et. al. is shown to be due to the choice of muffin-tin radius in the
calculations. We argue that the choice of a constant muffin-tin radius, common
for all calculated volumes, is less satisfactory compared to the choice of a
muffin-tin radius that scales with the volume, especially when a large volume
interval and open packed structures are considered. The conclusion of Jones et
al. that alpha-Pu has partially delocalized 5f electrons is argued to be
erroneous.
