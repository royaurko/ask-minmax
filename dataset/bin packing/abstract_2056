We have measured the photonic bandgap in the transmission of microwaves
through a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab. The structure was constructed
by cementing acrylic rods in a hexagonal closed-packed array to form
rectangular stacks. We find a bandgap centered at approximately 11 GHz, whose
depth, width and center frequency vary with the number of layers in the slab,
angle of incidence and microwave polarization.
