We present results from microscopic mode coupling theory generalized to
colloidal dispersions under shear in an integration-through-transients
formalism. Stress-strain curves in start-up shear, flow curves, and normal
stresses are calculated with the equilibrium static structure factor as only
input. Hard spheres close to their glass transition are considered, as are hard
spheres with a short-ranged square-well attraction at their attraction
dominated glass transition. The consequences of steric packing and physical
bond formation on the linear elastic response, the stress release during
yielding, and the steady plastic flow are discussed and compared to
experimental data from concentrated model dispersions.
