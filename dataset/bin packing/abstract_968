We model the $N\bar{N}$ system at rest as a baryon number zero lump in the
Skyrme model including the $\omega$ field. We integrate the classical equations
of motion from the highly non-perturbative annihilation region into the
non-interacting radiation zone. Subsequent coherent state quantization of the
radiation field gives a good description of the pion spectrum from annihilation
at rest.
