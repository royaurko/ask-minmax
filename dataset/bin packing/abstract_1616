Employing the Quark Mass Denisity- and temperature- dependent model and the
Hartle's method, We have studied the slowly rotating strange star with uniform
angular velocity. The mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia and the frame
dragging for different frequencies are given. We found that we cannot use the
strange star to solve the challenges of Stella and Vietri for the horizontal
branch oscillations and the moment of inertia $I_{45}/(M/M_ s)>2.3$.
Furthermore, we extended the Hartle's method to study the differential rotating
strange star and found that the differential rotation is an effective way to
get massive strange star.
