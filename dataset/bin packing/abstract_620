We give a survey on M{\oe}glin's construction of representations in the
Arthur packets for $p$-adic quasisplit symplectic and orthogonal groups. The
emphasis is on comparing M{\oe}glin's parametrization of elements in the Arthur
packets with that of Arthur (2013). This comparison has already been done in
the original works of M{\oe}glin, so our goal is only to make it more
transparent.
