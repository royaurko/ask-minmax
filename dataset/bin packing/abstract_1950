Crystallization within the discrete spheres of a block copolymer mesophase
was studied by time-resolved x-ray scattering. The cubic packing of
microdomains, established by self-assembly in the melt, is preserved throughout
crystallization by strong interblock segregation even though the amorphous
matrix block is well above its glass transition temperature. Homogeneous
nucleation within each sphere yields isothermal crystallizations which follow
first-order kinetics, contrasting with the sigmoidal kinetics normally
exhibited in the quiescent crystallization of bulk polymers.
