The progress of magnetization reversal of weakly packed ferromagnetic
Ni80Fe20 nanowire arrays of different diameters (40, 50, 70 and 100 nm)
electrodeposited in polycarbonate membranes was studied by magnetic force
microscopy (MFM). For such a low packing density of nanomagnets, the dipolar
interactions between neighbouring wires can be neglected. The intrinsic
switching field distribution has been extracted from in situ MFM images and its
width was found to be considerably smaller than for densely packed nanowire
arrays.
