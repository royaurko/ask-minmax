We study gelation in suspensions of model colloidal particles with
short-ranged attractive and long-ranged repulsive interactions by means of
three-dimensional fluorescence confocal microscopy. At low packing fractions,
particles form stable equilibrium clusters. Upon increasing the packing
fraction the clusters grow in size and become increasingly anisotropic until
finally associating into a fully connected network at gelation. We find a
surprising order in the gel structure. Analysis of spatial and orientational
correlations reveals that the gel is composed of dense chains of particles
constructed from face-sharing tetrahedral clusters. Our findings imply that
dynamical arrest occurs via cluster growth and association.
