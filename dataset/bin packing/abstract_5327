The Upsilon(1S), Upsilon(2S), and Upsilon(3S) production cross sections are
measured using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.8
+/-1.4 inverse picobarns of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV,
collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The Upsilon resonances are
identified through their decays to dimuons. Integrated over the Upsilon
transverse momentum range pt[Upsilon] < 50 GeV and rapidity range
abs(y[Upsilon]) < 2.4, and assuming unpolarized Upsilon production, the
products of the Upsilon production cross sections and dimuon branching
fractions are sigma(pp to Upsilon(1S) X) B(Upsilon(1S) to mu+ mu-) = (8.55 +/-
0.05 +0.56/-0.50 +/- 0.34) nb, sigma(pp to Upsilon(2S) X) B(Upsilon(2S) to mu+
mu-) = (2.21 +/- 0.03 +0.16/-0.14 +/- 0.09) nb, sigma(pp to Upsilon(3S) X)
B(Upsilon(3S) to mu+ mu-) = (1.11 +/- 0.02 +0.10/-0.08 +/- 0.04) nb, where the
first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is
from the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity. The differential cross
sections in bins of transverse momentum and rapidity, and the cross section
ratios are presented. Cross section measurements performed within a restricted
muon kinematic range and not corrected for acceptance are also provided. These
latter measurements are independent of Upsilon polarization assumptions. The
results are compared to theoretical predictions and previous measurements.
