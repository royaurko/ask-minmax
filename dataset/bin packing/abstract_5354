Communication-based train control (CBTC) is gradually adopted in urban rail
transit systems, as it can significantly enhance railway network efficiency,
safety and capacity. Since CBTC systems are mostly deployed in underground
tunnels and trains move in high speed, building a train-ground wireless
communication system for CBTC is a challenging task. Modeling the tunnel
channels is very important to design and evaluate the performance of CBTC
systems. Most of existing works on channel modeling do not consider the unique
characteristics in CBTC systems, such as high mobility speed, deterministic
moving direction, and accurate train location information. In this paper, we
develop a finite state Markov channel (FSMC) model for tunnel channels in CBTC
systems. The proposed FSMC model is based on real field CBTC channel
measurements obtained from a business operating subway line. Unlike most
existing channel models, which are not related to specific locations, the
proposed FSMC channel model takes train locations into account to have a more
accurate channel model. The distance between the transmitter and the receiver
is divided into intervals, and an FSMC model is applied in each interval. The
accuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the simulation results
generated from the model and the real field measurement results.
