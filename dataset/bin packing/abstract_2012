Using exact computations we study the classical hard-core monomer-dimer
models on m x n plane lattice strips with free boundaries. For an arbitrary
number v of monomers (or vacancies), we found a logarithmic correction term in
the finite-size correction of the free energy. The coefficient of the
logarithmic correction term depends on the number of monomers present (v) and
the parity of the width n of the lattice strip: the coefficient equals to v
when n is odd, and v/2 when n is even. The results are generalizations of the
previous results for a single monomer in an otherwise fully packed lattice of
dimers.
