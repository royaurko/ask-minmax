In this paper, we study online multidimensional bin packing problem when all
items are hypercubes.
 Based on the techniques in one dimensional bin packing algorithm Super
Harmonic by Seiden, we give a framework for online hypercube packing problem
and obtain new upper bounds of asymptotic competitive ratios.
 For square packing, we get an upper bound of 2.1439, which is better than
2.24437.
 For cube packing, we also give a new upper bound 2.6852 which is better than
2.9421 by Epstein and van Stee.
