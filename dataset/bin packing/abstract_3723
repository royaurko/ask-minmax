We propose a new method of estimation of the black hole masses in AGN based
on the normalized excess variance, sigma_{nxs}^2. We derive a relation between
sigma_{nxs}^2, the length of the observation, T, the light curve bin size,
Delta t, and the black hole mass, assuming that (i) the power spectrum above
the high frequency break, f_{bf}, has a slope of -2, (ii) the high frequency
break scales with black hole mass, (iii) the power spectrum amplitude (in
'frequency x power' space) is universal and (iv) sigma_{nxs}^2 is calculated
from observations of length T < 1/f_{bf}. Values of black hole masses in AGN
obtained with this method are consistent with estimates based on other
techniques such as reverberation mapping or the Mbh-stellar velocity dispersion
relation. The method is formally equivalent to methods based on power spectrum
scaling with mass but the use of the normalized excess variance has the big
advantage of being applicable to relatively low quality data.
