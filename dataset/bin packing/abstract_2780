Promoting cooperation is an intellectual challenge in the social sciences,
for which the iterated Prisoners' Dilemma (IPD) is a fundamental framework. The
traditional view that there exists no simple ultimatum strategy whereby one
player can unilaterally control the share of the surplus has been challenged by
a new class of "zero-determinant" (ZD) strategies raised by Press and Dyson. In
particular, the extortionate strategies can subdue the opponent and obtain
higher scores. However, no empirical evidence has yet been found to support
this theoretical finding. In a long-run laboratory experiment of the iterated
Prisoners' Dilemma pairing each human subject with a computer co-player, we
demonstrate that the extortionate strategy indeed outperforms the generous
strategy against human subjects. Our results show that the extortionate
strategy achieves higher scores than the generous strategy, the extortionate
strategy promotes the cooperation rate to a similar level as the generous
strategy does, and the human subjects' cooperation rates in both the
extortionate and generous treatments are increasing over time. While our
results imply that the human subjects cared about their earnings as well as
fairness or reciprocity, we do observe that subjects learned to become
increasingly cooperative over time to increase their own monetary payoffs. Our
experiments provide the first laboratory evidence in support of the Press-Dyson
theory.
