The mobility of a charged projectile in a strongly coupled dusty plasma is
simulated. A net force $F$, opposed by a combination of collisional scattering
and gas friction, causes projectiles to drift at a mobility-limited velocity
$u_p$. The mobility $\mu_p=u_p/F$ of the projectile's motion is obtained. Two
regimes depending on $F$ are identified. In the high force regime, $\mu_p
\propto F^{0.23}$, and the scattering cross section $\sigma_s$ diminishes as
$u_p^{-6/5}$. Results for $\sigma_s$ are compared with those for a weakly
coupled plasma and for two-body collisions in a Yukawa potential. The
simulation parameters are based on microgravity plasma experiments.
