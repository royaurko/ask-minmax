We theoretically study the effect of a nonmagnetic impurity in heavy fermion
superconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$ within a realistic band model and the T-matrix
approximation approach. By considering two known possible pairing symmetry
candidates $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and $d_{xy}$, we find that although both total
density of states exhibit a similar V-shaped gaplike feature, only the
$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing symmetry gives rise to robust intragap impurity
resonance states reflected by the resonance peaks near the Fermi energy in the
local density of states. These features can be readily probed by scanning
tunneling microscopy experiments, and are proposed to shed light on the pairing
symmetry and provide hints on the microscopic mechanism of unconventional
superconductivity in the Ce-based heavy fermion superconductors.
