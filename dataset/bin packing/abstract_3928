The Intense Pulsed Neutron Source has been an operating user facility for
more than 20 years. Development of an upgrade for the data acquisition system
has been in progress for some time now. Now that the initial installation on
the test bed instrument (HRMECS) is completed new features and possibilities
are starting to come forward. Run setup is moving from large monolithic
programs to more flexible scripting. EPICS based controls allow flexible and
extendable instrument configurations. Hardware is also being made more
flexible. This flexibility allows implementation of new methods of binning
data, that better match instrument resolution. This allows better use of memory
and disk space. Increased flexibiliy has also allowed use of the new
time-of-flight modules in applications past their original intent.
