We experimentally determine ensemble-averaged responses of granular packings
to point forces, and we compare these results to recent models for force
propagation in a granular material. We used 2D granular arrays consisting of
photoelastic particles: either disks or pentagons, thus spanning the range from
ordered to disordered packings. A key finding is that spatial ordering of the
particles is a key factor in the force response. Ordered packings have a
propagative component that does not occur in disordered packings.
