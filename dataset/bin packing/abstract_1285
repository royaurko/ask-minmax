The effect of boundaries on the force distributions in granular media is
illustrated by simulations of 2D packings of frictionless, Hertzian spheres. To
elucidate discrepancies between experimental observations and theoretical
predictions, we distinguish between the weight distribution {\cal P} (w)
measured in experiments and analyzed in the q-model, and the distribution of
interparticle forces P(f). The latter one is robust, while {\cal P}(w) can be
obtained once the local packing geometry and P(f) are known. By manipulating
the (boundary) geometry, we show that {\cal P}(w) can be varied drastically.
