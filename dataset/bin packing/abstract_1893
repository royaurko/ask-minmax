We present a new, amplitude model-independent method to measure the CP
violation parameter $\gamma$ in $B^- \to DK^-$ and related decays. Information
on charm interference parameters, usually obtained from charm threshold data,
is obtained from charm mixing. By splitting the phase space of the $D$ meson
decay into several bins, enough information can be gained to measure $\gamma$
without input from the charm threshold. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach with a simulation study of $B^- \to DK^-$ with $D \to K^+ \pi^- \pi^+
\pi^-$. We compare the performance of our novel approach to that of a
previously proposed binned analysis which uses charm interference parameters
obtained from threshold data. While both methods provide useful constraints,
the combination of the two by far outperforms either of them applied on their
own. Such an analysis would provide a highly competitive measurement of
$\gamma$. Our simulation studies indicate, subject to assumptions about data
yields and the amplitude structure of $D^0 \to K^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^-$, a
statistical uncertainty on $\gamma$ of $\sim 12^{\circ}$ with existing data and
$\sim 4^{\circ}$ for the LHCb-upgrade.
