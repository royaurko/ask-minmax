The isospin-dependence of mechanical and chemical instabilities is
investigated within a thermal and nuclear transport model using a Skyrme-type
phenomenological equation of state for neutron-rich matter. Respective roles of
the nuclear mean field and the 2-body stochastic scattering on the evolution of
density and isospin fluctuations in either mechanically or chemically unstable
regions of neutron-rich matter are investigated. It is found that the mean
field dominates overwhelmingly the fast growth of both fluctuations, while the
2-body scattering influences significantly the later growth of the isospin
fluctuation only. The magnitude of both fluctuations decreases with the
increasing isospin asymmetry because of the larger reduction of the attractive
isoscalar mean field by the stronger repuslive neutron symmetry potential in
the more neutron-rich matter. Moreover, it is shown that the isospin
fractionation happens later, but grows faster in the more neutron-rich matter.
Implications of these results to current experiments exploring properties of
neutron-rich matter are discussed.
