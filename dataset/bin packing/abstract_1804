We present a Monte Carlo study of dijet angular distributions at
$\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. First we perform a next-to-leading order QCD study; we
calculate the distributions in four different bins of dijet invariant mass
using different Monte Carlo programs and different jet algorithms, and we also
investigate the systematic uncertainties coming from the choice of the parton
distribution functions and the renormalization and factorization scales. In the
second part of this paper, we present the effects on the distributions coming
from a model including gravitational scattering and black hole formation in a
world with large extra dimensions. Assuming a 25% systematic uncertainty, we
report a discovery potential for the mass bin $1 < M_{jj} < 2$ TeV at 10
pb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity.
