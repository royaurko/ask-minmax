We study photon diffusion in a two-dimensional random packing of monodisperse
disks as a simple model of granular media and wet foams. We assume that the
intensity reflectance of disks is a constant. We present an analytic expression
for the transport-mean-free path in terms of the velocity of light in the disks
and host medium, radius and packing fraction of the disks, and the intensity
reflectance. For the glass beads immersed in the air or water, we estimate
transport-mean-free paths about half the experimental ones. For the air bubbles
immersed in the water, transport-mean-free paths is an inverse function of
liquid volume fraction of the model wet foam. This throws new light on the
empirical law of Vera et. al, and promotes more realistic models.
