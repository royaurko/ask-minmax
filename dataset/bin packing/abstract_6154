This Report summarizes the results of the activities in 2012 and the first
half of 2013 of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group. The main goal of the
working group was to present the state of the art of Higgs Physics at the LHC,
integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. This
report follows the first working group report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross
Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002) and the second working group
report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 2. Differential Distributions
(CERN-2012-002). After the discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC in mid-2012
this report focuses on refined prediction of Standard Model (SM) Higgs
phenomenology around the experimentally observed value of 125-126 GeV, refined
predictions for heavy SM-like Higgs bosons as well as predictions in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and first steps to go beyond these
models. The other main focus is on the extraction of the characteristics and
properties of the newly discovered particle such as couplings to SM particles,
spin and CP-quantum numbers etc.
