A coincidence site lattice is a sublattice formed by the intersection of a
lattice \Gamma in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the image of \Gamma under a linear
isometry. Such a linear isometry is referred to as a linear coincidence
isometry of \Gamma. Here, we consider the more general case allowing any affine
isometry. Consequently, general results on coincidence isometries of shifted
copies of lattices, and of multilattices are obtained. In particular, we
discuss the shifted square lattice and the diamond packing in detail.
