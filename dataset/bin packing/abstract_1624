We have studied the equalization of the response functions of the SK and SNO
for total event rate and event rate for the energy bins. To calculate the
response functions of SNO, we have used the latest theoretical values of the
cross section of the neutrino-deuteron CC process. By using these new
theoretical values, we find that the trigger threshold of the SK at which its
response function is equalized to the response function of SNO (at the trigger
threshold of 6.75 MeV), is 8.5 MeV. This value is 0.1 MeV smaller than the
value calculated using the old theoretical values of the cross section of
neutrino-deuteron process. The use of these new theoretical values also
produces a small change in the range of the energy bins where the response
functions are equalized.
