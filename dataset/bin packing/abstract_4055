We report measurements of the beam spin asymmetry in Deeply Virtual Compton
Scattering (DVCS) at an electron beam energy of 4.8 GeV using the CLAS detector
at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The DVCS beam spin
asymmetry has been measured in a wide range of kinematics, 1(GeV/c)$^2$
$<Q^2<2.8$(GeV/c)$^2$, $0.12<x_B<0.48$, and 0.1 (GeV/c)$^2$
$<-t<0.8$(GeV/c)$^2$, using the reaction \pEpX. The number of
H$(e,e^{\prime}\gamma p)$ and H$(e,e^{\prime}\pi^0 p)$ events are separated in
each $(Q^2,x_B,t)$ bin by a fit to the line shape of the H$(e,e^{\prime}p)X$
$M_x^2$ distribution. The validity of the method was studied in detail using
experimental and simulated data. It was shown, that with the achieved missing
mass squared resolution and the available statistics, the separation of DVCS-BH
and $\pi^0$ events can reliably be done with less than 5% uncertainty. The
$Q^2$- and $t$-dependences of the $\sin\phi$ moments of the asymmetry are
extracted and compared with theoretical calculations.
