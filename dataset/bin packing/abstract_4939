We use automated surface photometry and pattern classification techniques to
morphologically classify galaxies. The two-dimensional light distribution of a
galaxy is reconstructed using Fourier series fits to azimuthal profiles
computed in concentric elliptical annuli centered on the galaxy. Both the phase
and amplitude of each Fourier component have been studied as a function of
radial bin number for a large collection of galaxy images using principal
component analysis. We find that up to 90 percent of the variance in many of
these Fourier profiles may be characterized in as few as 3 principal components
and their use substantially reduces the dimensionality of the classification
problem. We use supervised learning methods in the form of artificial neural
networks to train galaxy classifiers that detect morphological bars at the
85-90 percent confidence level and can identify the Hubble type with a 1-sigma
scatter of 1.5 steps on the 16-step stage axis of the revised Hubble system.
Finally, we systematically characterize the adverse effects of decreasing
resolution and S/N on the quality of morphological information predicted by
these classifiers.
