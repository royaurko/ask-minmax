Data in 5-day bins, recently released by the Super-Kamiodande Consortium, has
been analyzed by a likelihood procedure that has certain advantages over the
Lomb-Scargle procedure used by the consortium. The two most prominent peaks in
the power spectrum of the 10-day data were at 9.42 y-1 and 26.57 y-1, and it
was clear that one was an alias of the other caused by the regularity of the
binning. There were reasons to believe that the 9.42 y-1 peak was an alias of
the 26.57 y-1 peak, but analysis of the 5-day data makes it clear that the
reverse is the case. In addition to a strong peak near 9.42 y-1, we find peaks
at 43.72 y-1and at 39.28 y-1. After comparing this analysis with a
power-spectrum analysis of magnetic-field data, we suggest that these three
peaks may be attributed to a harmonic of the solar rotation rate and to an
r-mode oscillation with spherical harmonic indices l = 2, m = 2.
