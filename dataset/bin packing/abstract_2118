Using atomic resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we present here the
experimental evidence of a silicene sheet (graphene like structure) epitaxially
grown on a close-packed silver surface (Ag(111)). This has been achieved via
direct condensation of a silicon atomic flux onto the single-crystal substrate
in ultra-high vacuum conditions. A highly ordered silicon structure, arranged
within a honeycomb lattice is synthesized and presenting two silicon
sub-lattices occupying positions at different heights (0.02 nm) indicating
possible sp2-sp3 hybridizations.
