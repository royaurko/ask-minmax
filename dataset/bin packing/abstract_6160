Production of exclusive dijets in diffractive deep inelastic $e^\pm p$
scattering has been measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated
luminosity of 372 pb$^{-1}$. The measurement was performed for $\gamma^*-p$
centre-of-mass energies in the range $90 < W < 250$ GeV and for photon
virtualities $Q^2 > 25$ GeV$^2$. Energy and transverse-energy flows around the
jet axis are presented. The cross section is presented as a function of $\beta$
and $\phi$, where $\beta=x/x_{\rm I\!P}$, $x$ is the Bjorken variable and
$x_{\rm I\!P}$ is the proton fractional longitudinal momentum loss. The angle
$\phi$ is defined by the $\gamma^*-$dijet plane and the $\gamma^*-e^\pm$ plane
in the rest frame of the diffractive final state. The $\phi$ cross section is
measured in bins of $\beta$. The results are compared to predictions from
models based on different assumptions about the nature of the diffractive
exchange.
