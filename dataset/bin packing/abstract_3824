We reanalyze the decay $B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$ without assuming dominance of QCD
penguins with internal top-quark exchanges. In that case the weak phase of the
$\bar b \to\bar d$ QCD penguin amplitude is not related in a simple way to the
CKM angle $\beta$. Nevertheless it is still possible to extract the CKM angle
$\alpha$ in a transparent and almost model-independent way from the
time-dependent CP-violating asymmetry of the transition $B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$.
Aside from that CP asymmetry this approach needs as an input only amplitudes of
decays with branching ratios of order $10^{-5}$ and will thus be well within
reach at future $B$-factories.
