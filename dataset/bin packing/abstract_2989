We investigate the transport properties of superconducting films with
periodic arrays of in-plane magnetized micromagnets. Two different magnetic
textures are studied: a square array of magnetic bars and a close-packed array
of triangular microrings. As confirmed by MFM imaging, the magnetic state of
both systems can be adjusted to produce arrays of almost point-like magnetic
dipoles. By carrying out transport measurements with ac drive, we observed
experimentally a recently predicted ratchet effect induced by the interaction
between superconducting vortices and the magnetic dipoles. Moreover, we find
that these magnetic textures produce vortex-antivortex patterns, which have a
crucial role on the transport properties of this hybrid system.
