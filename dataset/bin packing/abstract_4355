Based on a multi-phase transport model, the measured jet fragmentation
function ratio of Pb+Pb collisions to p+p collisions in CERN Large Hadron
Collider experiments is decomposed into two parts, corresponding to the two
contributions of jet hadronization from fragmentation and coalescence. The
results suggest an existence of distinct competitions between two jet
hadronization mechanisms for different $\xi$=ln(1/$z$) ranges in different
centrality bins. The jet fragmentation functions for different types of hadrons
(mesons and baryons) are proposed as a good probe to study the competition
between fragmentation and coalescence for the jet hardonization in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions.
