Polyhedra and their arrangements have intrigued humankind since the ancient
Greeks and are today important motifs in condensed matter, with application to
many classes of liquids and solids. Yet, little is known about the
thermodynamically stable phases of polyhedrally-shaped building blocks, such as
faceted nanoparticles and colloids. Although hard particles are known to
organize due to entropy alone, and some unusual phases are reported in the
literature, the role of entropic forces in connection with polyhedral shape is
not well understood. Here, we study thermodynamic self-assembly of a family of
truncated tetrahedra and report several atomic crystal isostructures, including
diamond, {\beta}-tin, and high- pressure lithium, as the polyhedron shape
varies from tetrahedral to octahedral. We compare our findings with the densest
packings of the truncated tetrahedron family obtained by numerical compression
and report a new space filling polyhedron, which has been overlooked in
previous searches. Interestingly, the self-assembled structures differ from the
densest packings. We show that the self-assembled crystal structures can be
understood as a tendency for polyhedra to maximize face-to-face alignment,
which can be generalized as directional entropic forces.
