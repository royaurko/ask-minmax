The definition and properties of the Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups
$H^{2k-1}$, $1 \leqslant k \leqslant n$, on a symplectic manifold $({\cal
M}^{2n},\omega)$ are given and studied. For $k = 1$ and $k = n$, they are
isomorphic to the corresponding de Rham cohomology groups $H_{dR}^1({\cal
M}^{2n})$ and $H_{dR}^{2n-1}({\cal M}^{2n})$, respectively. The other
Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups are different from either the de Rham
cohomology groups or the harmonic cohomology groups on $({\cal
M}^{2n},\omega)$, in general. The general volume-preserving equations on
$({\cal M}^{2n},\omega)$ are also presented from cohomological point of view.
In the special cases, these equations become the ordinary canonical equations
in the Hamilton mechanics. Therefore, the Hamilton mechanics has been
generalized via the cohomology.
