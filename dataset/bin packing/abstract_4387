We present efficient Bayesian methods for extracting neuronal spiking
information from calcium imaging data. The goal of our methods is to sample
from the posterior distribution of spike trains and model parameters (baseline
concentration, spike amplitude etc) given noisy calcium imaging data. We
present discrete time algorithms where we sample the existence of a spike at
each time bin using Gibbs methods, as well as continuous time algorithms where
we sample over the number of spikes and their locations at an arbitrary
resolution using Metropolis-Hastings methods for point processes. We provide
Rao-Blackwellized extensions that (i) marginalize over several model parameters
and (ii) provide smooth estimates of the marginal spike posterior distribution
in continuous time. Our methods serve as complements to standard point
estimates and allow for quantification of uncertainty in estimating the
underlying spike train and model parameters.
