At low volume fraction, disordered arrangements of frictionless spheres are
found in un--jammed states unable to support applied stresses, while at high
volume fraction they are found in jammed states with mechanical strength. Here
we show, focusing on the hard sphere zero pressure limit, that the transition
between un-jammed and jammed states does not occur at a single value of the
volume fraction, but in a whole volume fraction range. This result is obtained
via the direct numerical construction of disordered jammed states with a volume
fraction varying between two limits, $0.636$ and $0.646$. We identify these
limits with the random loose packing volume fraction $\rl$ and the random close
packing volume fraction $\rc$ of frictionless spheres, respectively.
