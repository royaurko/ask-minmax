Recent Molecular Dynamics simulations of glass-forming liquids revealed
superdiffusive fluctuations associated with the position of a tracer particle
(TP) driven by an external force. Such anomalous response, whose mechanism
remains elusive, has been observed up to now only in systems close to their
glass transition, suggesting that this could be one of its hallmarks. Here, we
show that the presence of superdiffusion is in actual fact much more general,
provided that the system is crowded and geometrically confined. We present and
solve analytically a minimal model consisting of a driven TP in a dense,
crowded medium in which the motion of particles is mediated by the diffusion of
packing defects, called vacancies. For such non glass-forming systems, our
analysis predicts a long-lived superdiffusion which ultimately crosses over to
giant diffusive behavior. We find that this trait is present in confined
geometries, for example long capillaries and stripes, and emerges as a
universal response of crowded environments to an external force. These findings
are confirmed by numerical simulations of systems as varied as lattice-gases,
dense liquids and granular fluids.
