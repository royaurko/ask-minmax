Dynamic fluctuations in the local density of non-identified hadron tracks
reconstructed in the STAR TPC are studied using the discrete wavelet transform
power spectrum technique which involves mixed event reference sample
comparison. The two-dimensional event-by-event analysis is performed in
pseudo-rapidity eta and azimuthal angle phi in bins of transverse momentum pT.
HIJING simulations indicate that jets and mini-jets result in characteristic
signals, visible already at soft pT, when the dynamic texture analysis is
applied. In this analysis, the discrepancy between the experiment and the
HIJING expectations for Au+Au at sqrt(S_NN)=200 GeV is most prominent in the
central collisions where we observe the long range fluctuations to be enhanced
at low pT, and suppressed above pT = 0.6 GeV.
