The structural and electronic properties of Rutherfordium, the newest group
IV B element, have been evaluated by first principles density functional theory
in scalar relativistic formalism with and without spin-orbit coupling and
compared with the known experimental and theoretical properties of its
homologue Hf. It is found that it will crystallize in the hexagonal close
packed structure with metallic character. However, under pressure, it will have
different sequence of phase transitions than Hf: hcp\rightarrow bcc instead of
hcp\ rightarrow {\omega}\rightarrow bcc.
