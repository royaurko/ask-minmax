We present results on the hard X-ray emission of NGC 5506, the brightest
narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy above 20 keV. All the recent observations by
INTEGRAL, Swift and Suzaku have been analysed and spectral analysis during nine
separated time periods has been performed. While flux variations by a factor of
2 were detected during the last 7 years, only moderate spectral variations have
been observed, with the hint of a hardening of the X-ray spectrum and a
decrease of the intrinsic absorption with time. Using Suzaku observations it is
possible to constrain the amount of Compton reflection to R = 0.6-1.0, in
agreement with previous results on the source. The signature of Comptonisation
processes can also be found in the detection of a high-energy cut-off during
part of the observations, at Ec = 40-100 keV. When a Comptonisation model is
applied to the Suzaku data, the temperature and the optical depth of the
Comptonising electron plasma are measured at kT = 60-80 keV and tau = 0.6-1.0,
respectively. The properties inferred for NGC 5506 in this study agree with
those based on other data sets for the same AGN, and fit the picture of NLS1
having in general lower high-energy cut-offs at hard X-rays than their broad
line equivalent.
