The opportunities which are offered by a next generation and multi-purpose
fixed-target experiment exploiting the proton and lead LHC beams extracted by a
bent crystal are outlined. In particular, such an experiment can greatly
complement facilities with lepton beams by unraveling the partonic structure of
polarised and unpolarised nucleons and of nuclei, especially at large momentum
fractions.
