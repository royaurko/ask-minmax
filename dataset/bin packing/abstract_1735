Tilting theory in cluster categories of hereditary algebras has been
developed in [BMRRT] and [BMR]. These results are generalized to cluster
categories of hereditary abelian categories. Furthermore, for any tilting
object $T$ in a hereditary abelian category $\mathcal{H}$, we verify that the
tilting functor Hom$_\mathcal{H}(T,-)$ induces a triangle equivalence from the
cluster category $\mathcal{C(H)}$ to the cluster category $\mathcal{C}(A)$,
where $A$ is the quasi-tilted algebra End$_{\mathcal{H}}T.$ Under the condition
that one of derived categories of hereditary abelian categories $\mathcal{H},$
$\mathcal{H}'$ is triangle equivalent to the derived category of a hereditary
algebra, we prove that the cluster categories $\mathcal{C(H)}$ and
$\mathcal{C(H')}$ are triangle equivalent to each other if and only if
$\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{H}'$ are derived equivalent, by using the precise
relation between cluster-tilted algebras (by definition, the endomorphism
algebras of tilting objects in cluster categories) and the corresponding
quasi-tilted algebras proved previously. As an application, we give a
realization of "truncated simple reflections" defined by Fomin-Zelevinsky on
the set of almost positive roots of the corresponding type [FZ2, FZ5], by
taking $\mathcal{H}$ to be the representation category of a valued Dynkin
quiver and $T$ a BGP-tilting (or APR-tilting, in other words).
