We present a comprehensive computational study of the short-time transport
properties of bidisperse neutral colloidal suspensions and the corresponding
porous media. Our study covers bidisperse particle size ratios up to $4$, and
total volume fractions up to and beyond the monodisperse hard-sphere close
packing limit. The many-body hydrodynamic interactions are computed using
conventional Stokesian Dynamics (SD) via a Monte-Carlo approach. We address
suspension properties including the short-time translational and rotational
self-diffusivities, the instantaneous sedimentation velocity, the
wavenumber-dependent partial hydrodynamic functions, and the high-frequency
shear and bulk viscosities; and porous media properties including the
permeability and the translational and rotational hindered diffusivities. We
carefully compare the SD computations with existing theoretical and numerical
results. For suspensions, we also explore the range of validity of various
approximation schemes, notably the Pairwise Additive (PA) approximations with
the Percus-Yevick structural input. We critically assess the strengths and
weaknesses of the SD algorithm for various transport properties. For very dense
systems, we discuss in detail the interplay between the hydrodynamic
interactions and the structures due to the presence of a second species of a
different size.
