Optical and X-ray studies of six nearby galaxies show that the probability a
globular cluster will be an X-ray source is consistent with being linearly
proportional to its mass. We show that this result is consistent with some
recent estimates of the velocity kick distributions for isolated radio pulsars
-- those which are the sum of two Maxwellians, with the slower distribution at
about 100 km/sec -- so long as a large fraction of the retained binaries are in
binary systems with other massive stars. We confirm that over a large sample of
galaxies, metallicity is clearly a factor in determining whether a globular
cluster will contain an X-ray binary, and we estimate the transformations
between color and metallicity for a large number of optical filter
combinations. We also show that the core interaction rate is roughly linearly
proportional to the stellar mass of a globular cluster for the Milky Way when
one bins the clusters by mass.
