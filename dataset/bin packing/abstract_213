We show that there exist efficient algorithms for the triangle packing
problem in colored permutation graphs, complete multipartite graphs,
distance-hereditary graphs, k-modular permutation graphs and complements of
k-partite graphs (when k is fixed). We show that there is an efficient
algorithm for C_4-packing on bipartite permutation graphs and we show that
C_4-packing on bipartite graphs is NP-complete. We characterize the cobipartite
graphs that have a triangle partition.
