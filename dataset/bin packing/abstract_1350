Elastic properties and internal states of isotropic sphere packings are
studied by numerical simulations. Several numerical protocols to assemble dense
configurations are compared. One, which imitates experiments with lubricated
contacts, produces well coordinated states, while another, mimicking the effect
of vibrations, results, for the same density, in a much smaller coordination
number z, as small as in much looser systems. Upon varying the confining
pressure P, simulations show a very nearly reversible variation of density,
while z is irreversibly changed in a pressure cycle. Elastic moduli are shown
to be mainly related to the coordination number. Their P dependence notably
departs from predictions of simple homogenization approaches in the case of the
shear moduli of poorly coordinated systems.
