The triple "magnetic-transport-structural" transition versus temperature in
three series of "114" cobaltites - Y1-xYbxBaCo4O7, Y1-xCaxBaCo4O7 and
Yb1-xCaxBaCo4O7 - has been studied using magnetic, transport and differential
scanning calorimetric measurements. The effect of the size mismatch {\sigma}2,
due to cationic disordering at the Ln sites upon such a transition is shown for
the first time in a triangular lattice. We show that increasing <rLn> has an
effect of increasing TS dramatically, while the size mismatch {\sigma}2 at the
Ln sites decreases TS substantially. Moreover, the cationic mismatch at the Ln
sites modifies the nature of the hysteretic transition by turning the sharp
first order transition seen in the undoped samples into an intermix of first
and second order transitions. These results are discussed on the basis of the
particular nature of the high temperature form which exhibits a hexagonal close
packed structure (space group: P63mc) with respect to the low temperature
orthorhombic form (space group: Pbn21), the latter corresponding to a
distortion of the former due to a puckering of the kagom\'e layers.
