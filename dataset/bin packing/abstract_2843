The equations of state at room temperature as well as the energies of crystal
structures up to pressures exceeding 100 GPa are calculated for Na and K . It
is shown that the allowance for generalized gradient corrections (GGA) in the
density functional method provides a precision description of the equation of
state for Na, which can be used for the calibration of pressure scale. It is
established that the close-packed structures and BCC structure are not
energetically advantageous at high enough compressions. Sharply non-monotonous
pressure dependences of elastic moduli for Na and K are predicted and melting
temperatures at high pressures are estimated from various melting criteria. The
phase diagram of K is calculated and found to be in good agreement with
experiment.
