The performance of the Lasso is well understood under the assumptions of the
standard linear model with homoscedastic noise. However, in several
applications, the standard model does not describe the important features of
the data. This paper examines how the Lasso performs on a non-standard model
that is motivated by medical imaging applications. In these applications, the
variance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation.
Like all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are
\textit{not} independent of the design matrix.
  More specifically, this paper studies the sign consistency of the Lasso under
a sparse Poisson-like model. In addition to studying sufficient conditions for
the sign consistency of the Lasso estimate, this paper also gives necessary
conditions for sign consistency. Both sets of conditions are comparable to
results for the homoscedastic model, showing that when a measure of the signal
to noise ratio is large, the Lasso performs well on both Poisson-like data and
homoscedastic data.
  Simulations reveal that the Lasso performs equally well in terms of model
selection performance on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data (with
properly scaled noise variance), across a range of parameterizations. Taken as
a whole, these results suggest that the Lasso is robust to the Poisson-like
heteroscedastic noise.
