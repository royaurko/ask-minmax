We propose a new semi empirical expression of the virial coefficients for a
hard sphere fluid which is valid in the disordered phase over the whole density
range. The results are in good agreement with the numerical data and better
than those of the well-known Carnahan & Starling equation of state in the
domain of validity of the later; moreover this new expression accounts for the
singularity which is required for the equation of state at the close random
packing limit.
