We revisit the problem of compaction of a column of granular matter exposed
to discrete taps. We accurately control the vertical motion of the column,
which allows us to vary the duration T and the amplitude A of single-cycle
sinusoidal taps independently. We find that the density of the material at the
reversible branch depends both on A and T. By comparing the densities on the
reversible branches obtained for a range of values of T, we find that we can
collapse all data when plotted as function of A/T, which scales similar to both
the liftoff velocity and the time of flight of the packing. We further show
that switching between states obtained for different A and T, but chosen such
that their densities on the reversible branches match, does not lead to
appreciable hysteresis. We conclude that the appropriate control parameter for
sinusoidal tapping is not the peak acceleration \Gamma \sim A/T^2, as is
usually assumed, but rather \Gamma T \sim A/T.
