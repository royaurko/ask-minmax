This document emerged from work that started in January 2012 as a joint
effort by the ATLAS, CMS and LPCC supersymmetry (SUSY) working groups to
compile state-of-the-art cross section predictions for SUSY particle production
at the LHC. We present cross sections for various SUSY processes in pp
collisions at $\sqrt{s} =7$ TeV, including an estimate of the theoretical
uncertainty due to scale variation and the parton distribution functions.
Further results for higher LHC centre-of-mass energies will be collected at
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCPhysics/SUSYCrossSections. For squark
and gluino production, which dominate the inclusive SUSY cross section, we
employ calculations which include the resummation of soft gluon emission at
next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, matched to next-to-leading order (NLO)
SUSY-QCD. In all other cases we rely on NLO SUSY-QCD predictions.
