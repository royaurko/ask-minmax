The detailed shapes of spectral line profiles provide valuable information
about the emitting plasma, especially when the plasma contains an unresolved
mixture of velocities, temperatures, and densities. As a result of finite
spectral resolution, the intensity measured by a spectrometer is the average
intensity across a wavelength bin of non-zero size. It is assigned to the
wavelength position at the center of the bin. However, the actual intensity at
that discrete position will be different if the profile is curved, as it
invariably is. Standard fitting routines (spline, Gaussian, etc.) do not
account for this difference, and this can result in significant errors when
making sensitive measurements. Detection of asymmetries in solar coronal
emission lines is one example. Removal of line blends is another. We have
developed an iterative procedure that corrects for this effect. It can be used
with any fitting function, but we employ a cubic spline in a new analysis
routine called Intensity Conserving Spline Interpolation (ICSI). As the name
implies, it conserves the observed intensity within each wavelength bin, which
ordinary fits do not. Given the rapid convergence, speed of computation, and
ease of use, we suggest that ICSI be made a standard component of the
processing pipeline for spectroscopic data.
