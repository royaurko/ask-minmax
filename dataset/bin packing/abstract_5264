We present an investigation of velocity fields in early to late M-type
hydrodynamic stellar atmosphere models. These velocities will be expressed in
classical terms of micro- and macro-turbulent velocities for usage in 1D
spectral synthesis. The M-star model parameters range between log g of 3.0 -
5.0 and Teff of 2500 K - 4000 K. We characterize the Teff- and log g-dependence
of the hydrodynamical velocity fields in these models with a binning method,
and for the determination of micro-turbulent velocities, the Curve of Growth
method is used. The macro-turbulent velocities are obtained by convolutions
with Gaussian profiles. Velocity fields in M-stars strongly depend on log g and
Teff. Their velocity amplitudes increase with decreasing log g and increasing
Teff. The 3D hydrodynamical and 1D macro-turbulent velocities range from ~100
m/s for cool high gravity models to ~ 800 m/s - 1000 m/s for hot models or
models with low log g. The micro-turbulent velocities range in the order of
~100 m/s for cool models, to ~600 m/s for hot or low log g models. Our M-star
structure models are calculated with the 3D radiative-hydrodynamics (RHD) code
CO5BOLD. The spectral synthesis on these models is performed with the line
synthesis code LINFOR3D.
