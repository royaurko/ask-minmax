In this paper, we consider a data matrix $X_N\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times p}$ where
all the rows are i.i.d. samples in $\mathbb{R}^p$ of mean zero and covariance
matrix $\Sigma\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$. Here the population matrix $\Sigma$
is of finite rank perturbation of the identity matrix. This is the "spiked
population model" first proposed by Johnstone. As $N, p\to\infty$ but $N/p \to
\gamma\in(1, \infty)$, for the sample covariance matrix $S_N := X_NX_N^T/N$, we
establish the joint distribution of the largest and the smallest few packs of
eigenvalues. Inside each pack, they will behave the same as the eigenvalues
drawn from a Gaussian matrix of the corresponding size. Among different packs,
we also calculate the covariance between the Gaussian matrices entries. As a
corollary, if all the rows of the data matrix are Gaussian, then these packs
will be asymptotically independent. Also, the asymptotic behavior of sample
eigenvectors are obtained. Their local fluctuation is also Gaussian with
covariance explicitly calculated.
