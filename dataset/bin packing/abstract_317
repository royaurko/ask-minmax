A hybrid helical structure of equal-sized hard spheres in cylindrical
confinement was discovered as a 'by-product' of the recently developed
sequential deposition approach [Physical Review E 84, 050302(R) (2011)] for
constructing the densest possible packings of such systems. Unlike the
conventional triple-helix structure where its three strands of spheres are
packed densely to form triads of close-packed, mutually touching spheres, in
this novel helical phase only two of its three strands of spheres are packed in
this densest arrangement and the overall structure resembles a hybrid of the
single and the double helix. This article explains how this previously unknown
structure can be constructed via the abovementioned sequential deposition of
spheres, which involves manipulating the positions of a few spheres to create a
template for the deposition process. The findings show that it is possible to
discover new structures through varying only the configuration of few spheres
within the template, where this approach relies on a sensitive dependence of
the deposition-generated structures on the template.
