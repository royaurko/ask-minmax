A graph $G$ immerses $H$ if $H$ can be obtained from a subgraph of $G$ by
splitting off edges and removing isolated vertices. In this paper, we prove an
edge-variant of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa property with respect to the immersion
containment in 4-edge-connected graphs. More precisely, we prove that for every
graph $H$, there exists a function $f$ such that for every 4-edge-connected
graph $G$, either $G$ contains $k$ pairwise edge-disjoint subgraphs each
immersing $H$, or there exist at most $f(k)$ edges of $G$ intersecting all such
subgraphs. The theorem is best possible in the sense that the
4-edge-connectivity cannot be replaced by the 3-edge-connectivity.
