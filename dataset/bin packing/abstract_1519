We outline how redshift-space distortions (RSD) can be measured from the
angular correlation function w({\theta}), of galaxies selected from photometric
surveys. The natural degeneracy between RSD and galaxy bias can be minimized by
comparing results from bins with top-hat galaxy selection in redshift, and bins
based on the radial position of galaxy pair centres. This comparison can also
be used to test the accuracy of the photometric redshifts. The presence of RSD
will be clearly detectable with the next generation of photometric redshift
surveys. We show that the Dark Energy Survey (DES) will be able to measure
f(z){\sigma}_8(z) to a 1{\sigma} accuracy of (17 {\times} b)%, using galaxies
drawn from a single narrow redshift slice centered at z = 1. Here b is the
linear bias, and f is the logarithmic rate of change of the linear growth rate
with respect to the scale factor. Extending to measurements of w({\theta}) for
a series of bins of width 0.02(1 + z) over 0.5 < z < 1.4 will measure {\gamma}
to a 1{\sigma} accuracy of 25%, given the model f = {\Omega}_m(z)^{\gamma}, and
assuming a linear bias model that evolves such that b = 0.5 + z (and fixing
other cosmological parameters). The accuracy of our analytic predictions is
confirmed using mock catalogs drawn from simulations conducted by the MICE
collaboration.
