Improved data reduction techniques for 3D data cubes obtained from
Fabry-Perot integral field spectroscopy are presented. They provide accurate
sky emission subtraction and adaptive spatial binning and smoothing. They help
avoiding the effect analogous to the beam smearing, seen in HI radio data, when
strong smoothing is applied to 3D data in order to get the most extended signal
coverage. The data reduction techniques presented in this paper allow one to
get the best of both worlds: high spatial resolution in high signal-to-noise
regions and large spatial coverage in low signal-to-noise regions.
