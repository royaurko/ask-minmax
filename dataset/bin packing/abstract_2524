We present the Transiting Exoearth Robust Reduction Algorithm (TERRA) --- a
novel framework for identifying and removing instrumental noise in Kepler
photometry. We identify instrumental noise modes by finding common trends in a
large ensemble of light curves drawn from the entire Kepler field of view.
Strategically, these noise modes can be optimized to reveal transits having a
specified range of timescales. For Kepler target stars of low photometric
noise, TERRA produces ensemble-calibrated photometry having 33 ppm RMS scatter
in 12-hour bins, rendering individual transits of earth-size planets around
sun-like stars detectable as ~3 sigma signals.
