Given a quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(\mathfrak g)$ and a pair of
dominant weights ($\lambda$, $\mu$), we extend a conjecture raised by Lusztig
in \cite{Lusztig:1992}to a more general form and then prove this extended
Lusztig's conjecture. Namely we prove that for any symmetrizable Kac-Moody
algebra $\mathfrak g$, there is a composition series of the $U_q(\mathfrak
g)$-module $V(\lambda)\otimes V(\mu)$ compatible with the canonical basis. As a
byproduct, the celebrated Littlewood-Richardson rule is derived and we also
construct, in the same manner, a composition series of $V(\lambda)\otimes
V(-\mu)$ compatible with the canonical basis when $\mathfrak g$ is of affine
type and the level of $\lambda-\mu$ is nonzero.
