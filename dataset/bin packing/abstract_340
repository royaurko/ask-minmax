We have discovered an invariant distribution for local packing configurations
in static granular media. This distribution holds in experiments for packing
fractions covering most of the range from random loose packed to random close
packed, for beads packed both in air and in water. Assuming only that there
exist elementary cells in which the system volume is subdivided, we derive from
statistical mechanics a distribution that is in accord with the observations.
This universal distribution function for granular media is analogous to the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for molecular gasses.
