We present results of a two-pion correlation analysis performed with the
Au+Pb collision data collected by the upgraded CERES experiment in the fall of
2000. The analysis was done in bins of the reaction centrality and the pion
azimuthal emission angle with respect to the reaction plane. The pion source,
deduced from the data, is slightly elongated in the direction perpendicular to
the reaction plane, similarly as was observed at the AGS and at RHIC.
