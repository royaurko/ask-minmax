Stars are most likely to merge or collide in regions of the highest stellar
densities, and our own Galactic Center contains many stars packed into a
relatively small volume -- even the ambient stellar number density in the
central 50 pc is quite high, ~10^3 stars pc^{-3}. More striking, the three
compact young clusters in this region have central densities as high as 10^6
stars pc^{-3}. We discuss these extreme environments and the possibility that
stellar mergers and collisions have recently occured there. In particular, we
predict that at least one massive star in the Arches cluster has already
experienced a stellar merger in its short lifetime. Further, the Pistol Star,
in the nearby Quintuplet cluster, might owe its apparent relative youth to a
rejuvinating stellar merger. Finally, the apparently young stars in the central
arcsecond could be products of either collisions, inducing atmospheric
stripping, or mergers.
