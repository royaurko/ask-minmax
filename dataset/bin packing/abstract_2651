This paper provides a new geospatial perspective on whether or not Zipf's law
holds for all cities or for the largest cities in the United States using a
massive dataset and its computing. A major problem around this issue is how to
define cities or city boundaries. Most of the investigations of Zipf's law rely
on the demarcations of cities imposed by census data, e.g., metropolitan areas
and census-designated places. These demarcations or definitions (of cities) are
criticized for being subjective or even arbitrary. Alternative solutions to
defining cities are suggested, but they still rely on census data for their
definitions. In this paper we demarcate urban agglomerations by clustering
street nodes (including intersections and ends), forming what we call natural
cities. Based on the demarcation, we found that Zipf's law holds remarkably
well for all the natural cities (over 2-4 million in total) across the United
States. There is little sensitivity for the holding with respect to the
clustering resolution used for demarcating the natural cities. This is a big
contrast to urban areas, as defined in the census data, which do not hold
stable for Zipf's law.
