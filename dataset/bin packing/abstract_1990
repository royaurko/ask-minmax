We present an X-ray diffraction study of the normale alkane nonadecane
C_{19}H_{40} embedded in nanoporous Vycor glass. The confined molecular crystal
accomplishes a close-packed structure by alignment of the rod-like molecules
parallel to the pore axis while sacrificing one basic principle known from the
bulk state, i.e. the lamellar ordering of the molecules. Despite this disorder,
the phase transitions observed in the confined solid mimic the phase behavior
of the 3D unconfined crystal, though enriched by the appearance of a true
rotator phase known only from longer alkane chains.
