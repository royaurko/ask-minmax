We study the existence of polynomial kernels for the problem of deciding
feasibility of integer linear programs (ILPs), and for finding good solutions
for covering and packing ILPs. Our main results are as follows: First, we show
that the ILP Feasibility problem admits no polynomial kernelization when
parameterized by both the number of variables and the number of constraints,
unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly. This extends to the restricted cases of bounded
variable degree and bounded number of variables per constraint, and to covering
and packing ILPs. Second, we give a polynomial kernelization for the Cover ILP
problem, asking for a solution to Ax >= b with c^Tx <= k, parameterized by k,
when A is row-sparse; this generalizes a known polynomial kernelization for the
special case with 0/1-variables and coefficients (d-Hitting Set).
