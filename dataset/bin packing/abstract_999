We generate high-dimensional time-bin entanglement using a mode-locked laser
and analyze it with a 2-photon Fabry-Perot interferometer. The dimension of the
entangled state is limited only by the phase coherence between subsequent
pulses and is practically infinite. In our experiment a pico-second mode-locked
laser at 532 nm pumps a non-linear potassium niobate crystal to produce photon
pairs by spontaneous parametric down-conversion at 810 and 1550 nm.
