We prove the fractal crumpled structure of collapsed unknotted polymer ring.
In this state the polymer chain forms a system of densely packed folds,
mutually separated in all scales. The proof is based on the numerical and
analytical investigation of topological correlations in randomly generated
dense knots on strips $L_{v} \times L_{h}$ of widths $L_{v}=3,5$. We have
analyzed the conditional probability of the fact that a part of an unknotted
chain is also almost unknotted. The complexity of dense knots and quasi--knots
is characterized by the power $n$ of the Jones--Kauffman polynomial invariant.
It is shown, that for long strips $L_{h} \gg L_{v}$ the knot complexity $n$ is
proportional to the length of the strip $L_{h}$. At the same time, the typical
complexity of the quasi--knot which is a part of trivial knot behaves as $n\sim
\sqrt{L_{h}}$ and hence is significantly smaller. Obtained results show that
topological state of any part of the trivial knot in a collapsed phase is
almost trivial.
