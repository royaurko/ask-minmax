I. J. Schoenberg proved that a function is positive definite in the unit
sphere if and only if this function is a nonnegative linear combination of
Gegenbauer polynomials. This fact play a crucial role in Delsarte's method for
finding bounds for the density of sphere packings on spheres and Euclidean
spaces. One of the most excited applications of Delsarte's method is a solution
of the kissing number problem in dimensions 8 and 24. However, 8 and 24 are the
only dimensions in which this method gives a precise result. For other
dimensions (for instance, three and four) the upper bounds exceed the lower. We
have found an extension of the Delsarte method that allows to solve the kissing
number problem (as well as the one-sided kissing number problem) in dimensions
three and four. In this paper we also will discuss the maximal cardinalities of
spherical two-distance sets. Using the so-called polynomial method and
Delsarte's method these cardinalities can be determined for all dimensions
$n<40$. Recently, were found extensions of Schoenberg's theorem for
multivariate positive-definite functions. Using these extensions and
semidefinite programming can be improved some upper bounds for spherical codes.
