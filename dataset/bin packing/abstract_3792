Jet event rates in deep inelastic ep scattering at HERA are investigated
applying the modified JADE jet algorithm. The analysis uses data taken with the
H1 detector in 1994 and 1995. The data are corrected for detector and
hadronization effects and then compared with perturbative QCD predictions using
next-to-leading order calculations. The strong coupling constant alpha_S(M_Z^2)
is determined evaluating the jet event rates. Values of alpha_S(Q^2) are
extracted in four different bins of the negative squared momentum
transfer~$\qq$ in the range from 40 GeV2 to 4000 GeV2. A combined fit of the
renormalization group equation to these several alpha_S(Q^2) values results in
alpha_S(M_Z^2) = 0.117+-0.003(stat)+0.009-0.013(syst)+0.006(jet algorithm).
