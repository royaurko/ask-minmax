We present a new flexible estimator for comparing theoretical templates for
the predicted bispectrum of the CMB anisotropy to observations. This estimator,
based on binning in harmonic space, generalizes the optimal estimator of
Komatsu, Spergel, and Wandelt by allowing an adjustable weighting scheme for
masking possible foreground and other contaminants and detecting particular
noteworthy features in the bispectrum. The utility of this estimator is
illustrated by demonstrating how acoustic oscillations in the bispectrum and
other details of the bispectral shape could be detected in the future PLANCK
data provided that fNL is sufficiently large. The character and statistical
weight of the acoustic oscillations and the decay tail are described in detail.
