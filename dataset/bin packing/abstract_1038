We consider a relay network with two relays and two feedback links from the
relays to the sender. To obtain the achievability results, we use the
compress-and-forward and the decode-and-forward strategies to superimpose
facility and cooperation analogue to what proposed by Cover and El Gamal for a
relay channel. In addition to random binning, we use deterministic binning to
perform restricted decoding. We show how to use the feedback links for
cooperation between the sender and the relays to transmit the information which
is compressed in the sender and the relays.
