In this paper we develop general LP and ILP techniques to find an approximate
solution with improved objective value close to an existing solution. The task
of improving an approximate solution is closely related to a classical theorem
of Cook et al. in the sensitivity analysis for LPs and ILPs. This result is
often applied in designing robust algorithms for online problems. We apply our
new techniques to the online bin packing problem, where it is allowed to
reassign a certain number of items, measured by the migration factor. The
migration factor is defined by the total size of reassigned items divided by
the size of the arriving item. We obtain a robust asymptotic fully polynomial
time approximation scheme (AFPTAS) for the online bin packing problem with
migration factor bounded by a polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$. This answers
an open question stated by Epstein and Levin in the affirmative. As a byproduct
we prove an approximate variant of the sensitivity theorem by Cook at el. for
linear programs.
