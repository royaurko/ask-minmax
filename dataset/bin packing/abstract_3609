We present a detection of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) decrement associated
with the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The
SZ data come from 148 GHz maps of the equatorial region made by the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The LRG sample is divided by luminosity into four
bins, and estimates for the central Sunyaev-Zel'dovich temperature decrement
are calculated through a stacking process. We detect and account for a bias of
the SZ signal due to weak radio sources. We use numerical simulations to relate
the observed decrement to Y200 and clustering properties to relate the galaxy
luminosity bins to mass. We also use a relation between brightest cluster
galaxy luminosity and cluster mass based on stacked gravitational lensing
measurements to estimate the characteristic halo masses. The masses are found
to be around 1e14 M_sun.
