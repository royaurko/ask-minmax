We present the results from a study of the long-term optical spectral
variations of BL Lacertae, using the long and well-sampled B and R-band light
curves of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) collaboration, binned on time
intervals of 1 day. The relation between spectral slope and flux (the spectrum
gets bluer as the source flux increases) is well described by a power-law
model, although there is significant scatter around the best-fitting model
line. To some extent, this is due to the spectral evolution of the source
(along well-defined loop-like structures) during low-amplitude events, which
are superimposed on the major optical flares, and evolve on time scales of a
few days. The "bluer-when-brighter" mild chromatism of the long-term variations
of the source can be explained if the flux increases/decreases faster in the B
than in the R band. The B and R-band variations are well correlated, with no
significant, measurable delays larger than a few days. On the other hand, we
find that the spectral variations lead those in the flux light curves by ~ 4
days. Our results can be explained in terms of Doppler factor variations due to
changes in the viewing angle of a curved and inhomogeneous emitting jet.
