Dense particle packings acquire rigidity through a nonequilibrium jamming
transition commonly observed in materials from emulsions to sandpiles. We
describe athermal packings and their observed geometric phase transitions using
fully equilibrium statistical mechanics and develop a microscopic many-body
mean-field theory of the jamming transition for soft repulsive spherical
particles. We derive analytically some of the scaling laws and exponents
characterizing the transition and obtain predictions for microscopic
correlation functions of jammed states that are amenable to experimental
verifications, and whose accuracy we confirm using computer simulations.
