We discuss an analysis of Constraint Satisfaction problems, such as Sphere
Packing, K-SAT and Graph Coloring, in terms of an effective energy landscape.
Several intriguing geometrical properties of the solution space become in this
light familiar in terms of the well-studied ones of rugged (glassy) energy
landscapes. A `benchmark' algorithm naturally suggested by this construction
finds solutions in polynomial time up to a point beyond the `clustering' and in
some cases even the `thermodynamic' transitions. This point has a simple
geometric meaning and can be in principle determined with standard Statistical
Mechanical methods, thus pushing the analytic bound up to which problems are
guaranteed to be easy. We illustrate this for the graph three and four-coloring
problem. For Packing problems the present discussion allows to better
characterize the `J-point', proposed as a systematic definition of Random Close
Packing, and to place it in the context of other theories of glasses.
