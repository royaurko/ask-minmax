The Network-on-chip (NoC) designs consisting of large pack of Intellectual
Property (IP) blocks (cores) on the same silicon die is becoming technically
possible nowadays. But, the communication between the IP Cores is the main
issue in recent years. This paper presents the design of a Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA) based wrapper interconnect as a component of System on
programmable chip (SOPC) builder to communicate between IP cores. In the
proposal, only bus lines that carry address and data signals are CDMA coded.
CDMA technology has better data integrity, channel continuity, channel
isolation, and also mainly it reduces the no.of lines in the bus architecture
for transmitting the data from master to slave.
