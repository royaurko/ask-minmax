SSE (streaming SIMD extensions) and AVX (advanced vector extensions) are SIMD
(single instruction multiple data streams) instruction sets supported by recent
CPUs manufactured in Intel and AMD. This SIMD programming allows parallel
processing by multiple cores in a single CPU. Basic arithmetic and data
transfer operations such as sum, multiplication and square root can be
processed simultaneously. Although popular compilers such as GNU compilers and
Intel compilers provide automatic SIMD optimization options, one can obtain
better performance by a manual SIMD programming with proper optimization: data
packing, data reuse and asynchronous data transfer. In particular, linear
algebraic operations of vectors and matrices can be easily optimized by the
SIMD programming. Typical calculations in lattice gauge theory are composed of
linear algebraic operations of gauge link matrices and fermion vectors, and so
can adopt the manual SIMD programming to improve the performance.
