We present a new numerical scheme to study systems of non-convex, irregular,
and punctured particles in an efficient manner. We employ this method to
analyze regular packings of odd-shaped bodies, not only from a nanoparticle but
also both from a computational geometry perspective. Besides determining
close-packed structures for many shapes, we also discover a new denser
configuration for Truncated Tetrahedra. Moreover, we consider recently
synthesized nanoparticles and colloids, where we focus on the excluded volume
interactions, to show the applicability of our method in the investigation of
their crystal structures and phase behavior. Extensions to the presented scheme
include the incorporation of soft particle-particle interactions, the study of
quasicrystalline systems, and random packings.
