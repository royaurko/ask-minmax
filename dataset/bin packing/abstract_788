In [1], whether a target binary string s can be represented from a boolean
formula with operands chosen from a set of binary strings W was studied. In
this paper, we first examine selecting a maximum subset X from W, so that for
any string t in X, t is not representable by X\{t}. We rephrase this problem as
graph, and surprisingly find it give rise to a broad model of edge packing
problem, which itself falls into the model of forbidden subgraph problem.
Specifically, given a graph G(V;E) and a constant c, the problem asks to choose
as many as edges to form a subgraph G'. So that in G', for each edge, at least
one of its endpoints has degree no more than c. We call such G' partial c
degree bounded. When c = 1, it turns out to be the complement of dominating
set. We present several results about hardness, approximation for the general
graph and efficient exact algorithm on trees. This edge packing problem model
also has a direct interpretation in resource allocation. There are n types of
resources and m jobs. Each job needs two types of resources. A job can be
accomplished if either one of its necessary resources is shared by no more than
c other jobs. The problem then asks to nish as many jobs as possible. We
believe this partial degree bounded graph problem merits more attention.
