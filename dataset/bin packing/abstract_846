This letter considers several physical arguments about contributions to
hydrophobic hydration of inert gases, constructs default models to test them
within information theories, and gives information theory predictions using
those default models with moment information drawn from simulation of liquid
water. Tested physical features include: packing or steric effects, the role of
attractive forces that lower the solvent pressure, and the roughly tetrahedral
coordination of water molecules in liquid water. Packing effects (hard sphere
default model) and packing effects plus attractive forces (Lennard-Jones
default model) are ineffective in improving the prediction of hydrophobic
hydration free energies of inert gases over the previously used Gibbs and flat
default models. However, a conceptually simple cluster Poisson model that
incorporates tetrahedral coordination structure in the default model is one of
the better performers for these predictions. These results provide a partial
rationalization of the remarkable performance of the flat default model with
two moments in previous applications. The cluster Poisson default model thus
will be the subject of further refinement.
