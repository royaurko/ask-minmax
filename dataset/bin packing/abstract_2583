We use likelihood approach for search for local astrophysical neutrino
sources in unbinned versus binned methods with Baikal deep underwater
telescopes. We analyze neutrino data sample selected with NT200 telescope for
1038 live days by scanning a celestial map with different nets and for listed
gamma ray sources. Significance of most probable location of enhance in
measured number of events is found to be less than one sigma. We obtain the
upper limits and a sensitivity at 90\% C.L. on neutrino fluxes from listed
sources for NT200 and NT1000 correspondingly.
