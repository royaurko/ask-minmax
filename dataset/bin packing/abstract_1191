We study both experimentally and theoretically the rheological behavior of
isotropic bidisperse suspensions of noncolloidal particles in yield stress
fluids. We focus on materials in which noncolloidal particles interact with the
suspending fluid only through hydrodynamical interactions. We observe that both
the elastic modulus and yield stress of bidisperse suspensions are lower than
those of monodisperse suspensions of same solid volume fraction. Moreover, we
show that the dimensionless yield stress of such suspensions is linked to their
dimensionless elastic modulus and to their solid volume fraction through the
simple equation of Chateau et al.[J. rheol. 52, 489-506 (2008)]. We also show
that the effect of the particle size heterogeneity can be described by means of
a packing model developed to estimate random loose packing of assemblies of dry
particles. All these observations finally allow us to propose simple closed
form estimates for both the elastic modulus and the yield stress of bidisperse
suspensions: while the elastic modulus is a function of the reduced volume
fraction $\phi/\phi_m$ only, where $\phi_m$ is the estimated random loose
packing, the yield stress is a function of both the volume fraction $\phi$ and
the reduced volume fraction.
