We study the Sudakov form factor for a spontaneously broken gauge theory
using a (new) Delta -regulator. To be well-defined, the effective theory
requires zero-bin subtractions for the collinear sectors. The zero-bin
subtractions depend on the gauge boson mass M and are not scaleless. They have
both finite and 1/epsilon contributions, and are needed to give the correct
anomalous dimension and low-scale matching contributions. We also demonstrate
the necessity of zero-bin subtractions for soft-collinear factorization. We
find that after zero-bin subtractions the form factor is the sum of the
collinear contributions 'minus' a soft mass-mode contribution, in agreement
with a previous result of Idilbi and Mehen in QCD. This appears to conflict
with the method-of-regions approach, where one gets the sum of contributions
from different regions.
