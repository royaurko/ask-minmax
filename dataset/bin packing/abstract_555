We address the question of which convex shapes, when packed as densely as
possible under certain restrictions, fill the least space and leave the most
empty space. In each different dimension and under each different set of
restrictions, this question is expected to have a different answer or perhaps
no answer at all. As the problem of identifying global minima in most cases
appears to be beyond current reach, in this paper we focus on local minima. We
review some known results and prove these new results: in two dimensions, the
regular heptagon is a local minimum of the double-lattice packing density, and
in three dimensions, the directional derivative (in the sense of Minkowski
addition) of the double-lattice packing density at the point in the space of
shapes corresponding to the ball is in every direction positive.
