In an earlier paper the contributor defined N1L configurations, and stated a
conjecture concerning them which would lead to an improvement by a constant
factor to the sphere-packing bound for linear double error correcting codes.
Here a computer search is presented, in an effort to gather evidence on the
conjecture.
