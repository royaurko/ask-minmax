In this paper we formulate a conjecture about the minimal dimensional
representations of the finite $W$-superalgebra $U(\mathfrak{g}_\bbc,e)$ over
the field of complex numbers and demonstrate it with examples including all the
cases of type $A$. Under the assumption of this conjecture, we show that the
lower bounds of dimensions in the modular representations of basic Lie
superalgebras are attainable. Such lower bounds, as a super-version of
Kac-Weisfeiler conjecture, were formulated by Wang-Zhao in \cite{WZ} for the
modular representations of a basic Lie superalgebra ${\ggg}_{{\bbk}}$ over an
algebraically closed field $\bbk$ of positive characteristic $p$.
