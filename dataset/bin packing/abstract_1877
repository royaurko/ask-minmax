We studied the signatures at the LHC of the electroweak SU(2) lepton doublet
which embeds a doubly charged lepton. The doubly charged lepton pair and single
production rates, which are different from the triplet case, are studied and
all the detectable decay modes are considered. We also applied the same
kinematic cuts as in triplet case to reduce the background at LHC and the
needed integrated luminosities to find the doubly charged leptons with
different masses are analyzed. We also suggested a method to distinguish the
exotic lepton doublet and triplet.
