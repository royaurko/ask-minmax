We propose a practical entanglement classification scheme for general
multipartite pure states in arbitrary dimensions under local unitary
equivalence by exploiting the high order singular value decomposition technique
and local symmetries of the states. By virtue of this scheme, the method of
determining the local unitary equivalence of $n$-qubit states proposed by Kraus
is extended to the case for arbitrary dimensional multipartite states.
