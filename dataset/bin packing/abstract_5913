A study of the $^2$H$({\gamma},{\Lambda})$X reaction was performed using a
tagged photon beam at the Research Center for Electron Photon Science (ELPH),
Tohoku University. The photoproduced $\Lambda$ was measured in the $p{\pi^{-}}$
decay channel by the upgraded Neutral Kaon Spectrometer (NKS2+). The momentum
integrated differential cross section was determined as a function of the
scatting angle of ${\Lambda}$ in the laboratory frame for five energy bins. Our
results indicated a peak in the cross section at angles smaller than
cos$\theta^{LAB}_{\Lambda}$ = $0.96$. The experimentally obtained angular
distributions were compared to isobar models, Kaon-Maid (KM) and Saclay-Lyon A
(SLA), in addition to the composite Regge-plus-resonance (RPR) model. Both
SLA(r$K_{1}K_{\gamma}$ = $-1.4$) and RPR describe the data quite well in
contrast to the KM model, which substantially under predicted the cross section
at the most forward angles. With the anticipated finalized data on ${\Lambda}$
integrated and momentum dependent differential cross sections of
$^2$H$({\gamma},{\Lambda})$X~\cite{Kaneta_Beckford}, we present our findings on
the angular distributions in this report.
