This note is concerned with the stability and stabilization of the linearized
spacecraft attitude control system. Necessary and sufficient conditions are
respectively provided to guarantee that the considered systems are polynomially
stable and stable in the Lyapunov sense. These two classes of conditions
guarantee that the linearized spacecraft attitude control system can be
respectively stabilized semi-globally and globally by saturated linear state
feedback.
