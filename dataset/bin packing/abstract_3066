A gaussian distribution of binding energies, but conditioned to exploit
generally available information on packing in liquids, provides a
statistical-thermodynamic theory of liquid water that is structurally
non-committal, molecularly realistic, and surprisingly accurate. Neglect of
fluctuation contributions to this gaussian model yields a mean-field theory
that produces useless results. A refinement that accounts for
sharper-than-gaussian behavior at high binding energies recognizes
contributions from a discrete number of water molecules and permits a natural
matching of numerically exact results. These gaussian models, which can be
understood as vigorous simplifications of quasi-chemical theories, are
applicable to aqueous environments where the utility of structural models based
on geometrical considerations of water hydrogen bonding have not been
established.
