In order to explore the statistical properties of galaxy morphological types
in compact groups (CGs), we construct a random group sample which has the same
distributions of redshift and number of member galaxies as those of the CG
sample. It turns out that the proportion of early-type galaxies in different
redshift bins for the CG sample is statistically higher than that for random
group sample, and with growing redshift z this kind of difference becomes more
significant. This may be due to the existence of interactions and mergers
within a significant fraction of SDSS CGs. We also compare statistical results
of CGs with those of more compact groups and pairs, but do not observe as large
statistical difference as Hickson (1982)'results.
