The current-voltage (I-V) curve is the basic characteristic of a
superconducting wire or tape. Measuring I-V curves is generally problematic
when samples have poor stabilization. Soldering voltage taps to an active part
of the conductor affects the effectiveness of the local cooling and/or can be
difficult to do in certain devices such as fault current limiters and cables
where the tapes are closely packed. In order to overcome these problems,
voltage taps can be placed outside the active area of the superconductor. We
proved both by simulations and experiments that this arrangement leads to the
same results as the standard four point method and it provides more detailed
information for sample protection. The same arrangement can also be used for AC
transport loss measurement. However in this case particular care has to be
taken because the eddy current loss in the current leads contributes to the
total measured loss. We used numerical simulations to evaluate the contribution
of the eddy current loss to the measured AC loss. With help of simulations one
can determine whether the contribution of the eddy current loss is significant
and possibly optimize the current leads to reduce that loss contribution.
