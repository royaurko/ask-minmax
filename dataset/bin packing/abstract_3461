Comparing the entropies of hard spheres in the limit of close packing, for
different stacking sequences of the hexagonal layers, has been a challenge
because the differences are so small. Here we present a new method based on a
"sticky-sphere" model by which the system interpolates between hard spheres in
one limit and a harmonic crystal in the other. For the fcc and hcp stackings we
have calculated the entropy difference in the harmonic (sticky) limit, as well
as the differences in the free energy change upon removing the stickiness in
the model. The former, or phonon entropy, accounts for most of the entropy
difference. Our value for the net entropy difference, 0.001164(8) k_B per
sphere, is in excellent agreement with the best previous estimate by Mau and
Huse [Phys. Rev. E 59, 4396 (1999)].
