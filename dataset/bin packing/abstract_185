1) We present new lattice sphere packings in Euclid spaces of many dimensions
in the range 3332-4096, which are denser than known densest Mrodell-Weil
lattice sphere packings in these dimensions. Moreover it is proved that if
there were some nice linear binary codes we could construct lattices denser
than Mordell-Weil lattices of many dimensions in the range 116-3332. 2) New
lattices with densities at least 8 times of the densities of Craig lattices in
the dimensions $p-1$, where $p$ is a prime satisfying $p-1 \geq 1222$, are
constructed. Some of these lattices provide new record sphere packings. 3)
Lattice sphere packings in many dimensions in the range 4098-8232 better than
present records are presented. Some new dense lattice sphere packings in
moderate dimensions $84, 85, 86, 181-189$ denser than any previously known
sphere packings in these dimensions are also given. The construction is based
on the analogues of Craig lattices.
