The study of the packing of a length of wire in a two dimensional domain is
done using techniques of conformal maps. The resulting scaling properties are
derived through the Coulomb gas formalism of Conformal Field Theories. An
analogy is drawn between this system and the 2D gravitational -- or Liouville
-- coupling of non-conformally invariant matter in two dimensions.
