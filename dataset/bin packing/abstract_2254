We study the kinetics of the liquid-to-crystal transformation and of gel
formation in colloidal suspensions of oppositely charged particles. We analyse,
by means of both computer simulations and experiments, the evolution of a fluid
quenched to a state point of the phase diagram where the most stable state is
either a homogeneous crystalline solid or a solid phase in contact with a
dilute gas. On the one hand, at high temperatures and high packing fractions,
close to an ordered-solid/disordered-solid coexistence line, we find that the
fluid-to-crystal pathway does not follow the minimum free energy route. On the
other hand, a quench to a state point far from the
ordered-crystal/disordered-crystal coexistence border is followed by a
fluid-to-solid transition through the minimum free energy pathway. At low
temperatures and packing fractions we observe that the system undergoes a
gas-liquid spinodal decomposition that, at some point, arrests giving rise to a
gel-like structure. Both our simulations and experiments suggest that
increasing the interaction range favors crystallization over vitrification in
gel-like structures.
