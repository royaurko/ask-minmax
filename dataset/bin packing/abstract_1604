The Main Sequence Luminosity Function (LF) of the Galactic globular cluster
NGC 288 has been obtained using deep WFPC2 photometry. We have employed a new
method to correct for completeness and fully account for bin-to-bin migration
due to blending and/or observational scatter. The effect of the presence of
binary systems in the final LF is quantified and is found to be negligible.
There is a strong indication of the mass segregation of unevolved single stars
and clear signs of a depletion of low mass stars in NGC 288 with respect to
other clusters. The results are in good agreement with the prediction of
theoretical models of the dynamical evolution of NGC 288 that take into account
the extreme orbital properties of this cluster.
