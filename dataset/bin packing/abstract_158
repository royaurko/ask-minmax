This paper proves a bottom-left placement theorem for the rectangle packing
problem, stating that if it is possible to orthogonally place n arbitrarily
given rectangles into a rectangular container without overlapping, then we can
achieve a feasible packing by successively placing a rectangle onto a
bottom-left corner in the container. This theorem shows that even for the
real-parameter rectangle packing problem, we can solve it after finite times of
bottom-left placement actions. Based on this theorem, we might develop
efficient heuristic algorithms for solving the rectangle packing problem.
