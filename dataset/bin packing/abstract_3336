We establish a connection between two previously unrelated topics: a
particular discrete version of conformal geometry for triangulated surfaces,
and the geometry of ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic three-space. Two triangulated
surfaces are considered discretely conformally equivalent if the edge lengths
are related by scale factors associated with the vertices. This simple
definition leads to a surprisingly rich theory featuring M\"obius invariance,
the definition of discrete conformal maps as circumcircle preserving piecewise
projective maps, and two variational principles. We show how literally the same
theory can be reinterpreted to addresses the problem of constructing an ideal
hyperbolic polyhedron with prescribed intrinsic metric. This synthesis enables
us to derive a companion theory of discrete conformal maps for hyperbolic
triangulations. It also shows how the definitions of discrete conformality
considered here are closely related to the established definition of discrete
conformality in terms of circle packings.
