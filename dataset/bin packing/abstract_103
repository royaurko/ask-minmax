In this paper we consider the packing spectra for local dimension of
Bernoulli measures supported on Bedford-McMullen carpets. We show that
typically the packing dimension of the regular set is smaller than the packing
dimension of the attractor. We also consider a specific class of measures for
which we are able to calculate the packing spectrum exactly and we show that
the packing spectrum is discontinuous as a function on the space of Bernoulli
measures.
