The detailed nature of spatially heterogeneous dynamics of glycerol-silica
nanocomposites is unraveled by combining dielectric spectroscopy with atomistic
simulation and statistical mechanical theory. Analysis of the spatial mobility
gradient shows no 'glassy' layer, but the alpha relaxation time near the
nanoparticle grows with cooling faster than the alpha relaxation time in the
bulk, and is ~ 20 times longer at low temperatures. The interfacial layer
thickness increases from ~ 1.8 nm at higher temperatures to ~ 3.5 nm upon
cooling to near Tg. A real space microscopic description of the mobility
gradient is constructed by synergistically combining high temperature atomistic
simulation with theory. Our analysis suggests that the interfacial slowing down
arises mainly due to an increase of the local cage scale barrier for activated
hopping induced by enhanced packing and densification near the nanoparticle
surface. The theory is employed to predict how local surface densification can
be manipulated to control layer dynamics and shear rigidity over a wide
temperature range.
