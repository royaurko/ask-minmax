Advancements in the synthesis of faceted nanoparticles and colloids have
spurred interest in the phase behavior of polyhedral shapes. Regular tetrahedra
have attracted particular attention because they prefer local symmetries that
are incompatible with periodicity. Two dense phases of regular tetrahedra have
been reported recently. The densest known tetrahedron packing is achieved in a
crystal of triangular bipyramids (dimers) with packing density
4000/4671=85.63%. In simulation a dodecagonal quasicrystal is observed; its
approximant, with periodic tiling (3.4.3^2.4), can be compressed to a packing
fraction of 85.03%. Here, we show that the quasicrystal approximant is more
stable than the dimer crystal for packing densities below 84% using Monte Carlo
computer simulations and free energy calculations. To carry out the free energy
calculations, we use a variation of the Frenkel-Ladd method for anisotropic
shapes and thermodynamic integration. The enhanced stability of the approximant
can be attributed to a network substructure, which maximizes the free volume
(and hence the 'wiggle room') available to the particles and facilitates
correlated motion of particles, which further contributes to entropy and leads
to diffusion for packing densities below 65%. The existence of a solid-solid
transition between structurally distinct phases not related by symmetry
breaking -- the approximant and the dimer crystal-- is unusual for hard
particle systems.
