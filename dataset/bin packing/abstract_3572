We present an algorithm to simulate the many-body depletion interaction
between anisotropic colloids in an implicit way, integrating out the degrees of
freedom of the depletants, which we treat as an ideal gas. Because the
depletant particles are statistically independent and the depletion interaction
is short-ranged, depletants are randomly inserted in parallel into the excluded
volume surrounding a single translated and/or rotated colloid. A
configurational bias scheme is used to enhance the acceptance rate. The method
is validated and benchmarked both on multi-core CPUs and graphics processing
units (GPUs) for the case of hard spheres, hemispheres and discoids. With
depletants, we report novel cluster phases, in which hemispheres first assemble
into spheres, which then form ordered hcp/fcc lattices. The method is
significantly faster than any method without cluster moves and that tracks
depletants explicitly, for systems of colloid packing fraction $\phi_c<0.50$,
and additionally enables simulation of the fluid-solid transition.
