Li-ion batteries are crucial components for progress in mobile communications
and transport technologies. However, Li-ion batteries suffer from strong
self-heating, which limits their life-time and creates reliability and
environmental problems. Here we show that thermal management and the
reliability of Li-ion batteries can be drastically improved using hybrid phase
change material with graphene fillers. Conventional thermal management of
batteries relies on the latent heat stored in the phase change material as its
phase changes over a small temperature range, thereby reducing the temperature
rise inside the battery. Incorporation of graphene to the hydrocarbon-based
phase change material allows one to increase its thermal conductivity by more
than two orders of magnitude while preserving its latent heat storage ability.
A combination of the sensible and latent heat storage together with the
improved heat conduction outside of the battery pack leads to a significant
decrease in the temperature rise inside a typical Li-ion battery pack. The
described combined heat storage - heat conduction approach can lead to a
transformative change in thermal management of Li-ion and other types of
batteries.
