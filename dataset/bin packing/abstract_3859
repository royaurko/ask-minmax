Fluctuations in nuclear collisions can be measured as a function of
momentum-space binning scale over a scale interval bounded by detector
two-track resolution and acceptance. Fluctuation scale dependence is related to
two-particle correlations by a Fredholm integral equation. That equation can be
inverted by standard numerical methods to yield an autocorrelation distribution
on difference variables as a projection of the full two-particle distribution
which retains most of the correlation information in a more compact form.
Autocorrelation distributions are typically more easily interpreted in terms of
physical mechanisms than fluctuation measurements.
