Suppose that a $d$-dimensional domain is filled with a gas of (in general,
interacting) diffusive particles with density $n_0$. A particle is absorbed
whenever it reaches the domain boundary. Employing macroscopic fluctuation
theory, we evaluate the probability ${\mathcal P}$ that no particles are
absorbed during a long time $T$. We argue that the most likely gas density
profile, conditional on this event, is stationary throughout most of the time
$T$. As a result, ${\mathcal P}$ decays exponentially with $T$ for a whole
class of interacting diffusive gases in any dimension. For $d=1$ the stationary
gas density profile and ${\mathcal P}$ can be found analytically. In higher
dimensions we focus on the simple symmetric exclusion process (SSEP) and show
that $-\ln {\mathcal P}\simeq D_0TL^{d-2} \,s(n_0)$, where $D_0$ is the gas
diffusivity, and $L$ is the linear size of the system. We calculate the
rescaled action $s(n_0)$ for $d=1$, for rectangular domains in $d=2$, and for
spherical domains. Near close packing of the SSEP $s(n_0)$ can be found
analytically for domains of any shape and in any dimension.
