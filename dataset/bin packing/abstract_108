Continuing on recent computational and experimental work on jammed packings
of hard ellipsoids [Donev et al., Science, vol. 303, 990-993] we consider
jamming in packings of smooth strictly convex nonspherical hard particles. We
explain why the isocounting conjecture, which states that for large disordered
jammed packings the average contact number per particle is twice the number of
degrees of freedom per particle (\bar{Z}=2d_{f}), does not apply to
nonspherical particles. We develop first- and second-order conditions for
jamming, and demonstrate that packings of nonspherical particles can be jammed
even though they are hypoconstrained (\bar{Z}<2d_{f}). We apply an algorithm
using these conditions to computer-generated hypoconstrained ellipsoid and
ellipse packings and demonstrate that our algorithm does produce jammed
packings, even close to the sphere point. We also consider packings that are
nearly jammed and draw connections to packings of deformable (but stiff)
particles. Finally, we consider the jamming conditions for nearly spherical
particles and explain quantitatively the behavior we observe in the vicinity of
the sphere point.
