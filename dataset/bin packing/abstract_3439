By finding local minima of an enthalpy-like energy, we can generate jammed
packings of frictionless spheres under constant shear stress $\sigma$ and
obtain the yield stress $\sigma_y$ by sampling the potential energy landscape.
For three-dimensional systems with harmonic repulsion, $\sigma_y$ satisfies the
finite size scaling with the limiting scaling relation $\sigma_y\sim\phi -
\phi_{_{c,\infty}}$, where $\phi_{_{c,\infty}}$ is the critical volume fraction
of the jamming transition at $\sigma=0$ in the thermodynamic limit. The width
or uncertainty of the yield stress decreases with decreasing $\phi$ and decays
to zero in the thermodynamic limit. The finite size scaling implies a length
$\xi\sim (\phi-\phi_{_{c,\infty}})^{-\nu}$ with $\nu=0.81\pm 0.05$, which turns
out to be a robust and universal length scale exhibited as well in the finite
size scaling of multiple quantities measured without shear and independent of
particle interaction. Moreover, comparison between our new approach and
quasi-static shear reveals that quasi-static shear tends to explore low-energy
states.
