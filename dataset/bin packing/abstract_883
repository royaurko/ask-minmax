The packing of elastic bodies has emerged as a paradigm for the study of
macroscopic disordered systems. However, progress is hampered by the lack of
controlled experiments. Here we consider a model experiment for the isotropic
two-dimensional confinement of a rod by a central force. We seek to measure how
ordered is a folded configuration and we identify two key quantities. A
geometrical characterization is given by the number of superposed layers in the
configuration. Using temporal modulations of the confining force, we probe the
mechanical properties of the configuration and we define and measure its
effective compressibility. These two quantities may be used to build a
statistical framework for packed elastic systems.
