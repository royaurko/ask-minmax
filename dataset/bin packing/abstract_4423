Dark matter is one of the most important scientific goals for neutrino
telescopes. These instruments have particular advantages with respect to other
experimental approaches. Compared to direct searches, the sensitivity of
neutrino telescopes to probe the spin-dependent cross section of WIMP-proton is
unsurpassed. On the other hand, neutrino telescopes can look for dark matter in
the Sun, so a potential signal would be a strong indication of dark matter,
contrary to the case of other indirect searches like gammas or cosmic rays,
where more conventional astrophysical interpretations are very hard to rule
out. We present here the results of a binned search for neutralino annihilation
in the Sun using data gathered by the ANTARES neutrino telescope during
2007-2008. These result include limits on the neutrino and muon flux and on the
spin-dependent and spin-independent cross section of the WIMP-proton
scattering.
