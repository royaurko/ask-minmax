We present new conjectures on the distribution of link patterns for
fully-packed loop (FPL) configurations that are invariant, or almost invariant,
under a quarter turn rotation, extending previous conjectures of Razumov and
Stroganov and of de Gier. We prove a special case, showing that the link
pattern that is conjectured to be the rarest does have the prescribed
probability. As a byproduct, we get a formula for the enumeration of a new
class of quasi-symmetry of plane partitions.
