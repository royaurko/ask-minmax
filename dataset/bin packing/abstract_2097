We demonstrate that in a densely packed aligned array of single walled carbon
nanotubes, the breakdown of one nanotube leads to a highly correlated breakdown
of neighboring nanotubes, thereby producing a nano-fissure. We show that the
origin of the correlation is the electrostatic field of the broken nanotubes
that produces locally inhomogeneous current and Joule heating distributions in
the neighboring intact nanotubes triggering their breakdowns in the vicinity of
the broken nanotubes. Our results suggest that the densely aligned array
behaves like a correlated solid.
