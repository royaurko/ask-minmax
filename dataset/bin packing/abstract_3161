We say that a graph G has a perfect H-packing (also called an H-factor) if
there exists a set of disjoint copies of H in G which together cover all the
vertices of G. Given a graph H, we determine, asymptotically, the Ore-type
degree condition which ensures that a graph G has a perfect H-packing. More
precisely, let \delta_{\rm Ore} (H,n) be the smallest number k such that every
graph G whose order n is divisible by |H| and with d(x)+d(y)\geq k for all
non-adjacent x \not = y \in V(G) contains a perfect H-packing. We determine
\lim_{n\to \infty} \delta_{\rm Ore} (H,n)/n.
