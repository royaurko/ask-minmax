Caffeine (CAF) is one of the most widely and regularly consumed biologically
active substances. We use computer simulation approach to the study of CAF
activity by searching for its possible complexes with biopolymer fragments. The
principal CAF target at physiologically important concentrations refers to
adenosine receptors. It is a common opinion that CAF is a competitive
antagonist of adenosine. At the first step to molecular level elucidation of
CAF action, we have found a set of the minima of the interaction energy between
CAF and the fragments of human A1 adenosine receptor. Molecular mechanics is
the main method for the calculations of the energy of interactions between CAF
and the biopolymer fragments. We use the Monte Carlo simulation to follow
various mutual arrangements of CAF molecule near the receptor. It appears that
the deepest energy minima refer to hydrogen-bond formation of CAF with amino
acid residues involved in interactions with adenosine, its agonists and
antagonists. The results suggest that the formation of such CAF-receptor
complexes enforced by a close packing of CAF and the receptor fragments is the
reason of CAF actions on nervous system. CAF can block the atomic groups of the
adenosine repressors responsible for the interactions with adenosine, not
necessary by the formation of H bonds with them, but simply hide these groups
from the interactions with adenosine.
