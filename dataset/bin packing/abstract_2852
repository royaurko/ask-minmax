Density-functional calculations are presented for high-pressure structural
phases of S and Se. The structural phase diagrams, phonon spectra,
electron-phonon coupling, and superconducting properties of the isovalent
elements are compared. We find that with increasing pressure, Se adopts a
sequence of ever more closely packed structures (beta-Po, bcc, fcc), while S
favors more open structures (beta-Po, simple cubic, bcc). These differences are
shown to be attributable to differences in the S and Se core states. All the
compressed phases of S and Se considered are calculated to have weak to
moderate electron-phonon coupling strengths consistent with superconducting
transition temperatures in the range of 1 to 20 K. Our results compare well
with experimental data on the beta-Po --> bcc transition pressure in Se and on
the superconducting transition temperature in beta-Po S. Further experiments
are suggested to search for the other structural phases predicted at higher
pressures and to test theoretical results on the electron-phonon interaction
and superconducting properties.
