Coupling constants for the most relevant terms in the low energy effective
Hamiltonian of the XXZ spin chain are derived. Using this result we study the
low energy (low temperature, weak magnetic field) thermodynamics, finite size
effects and subleading long distance asymptotics of correlation functions.
