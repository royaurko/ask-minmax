We study X-ray absorption spectra of azobenzene-functionalized self-assembled
monolayers (SAMs), investigating excitations from the nitrogen K-edge.
Azobenzene with H-termination and functionalized with CF3 groups is considered.
The Bethe-Salpeter equation is employed to compute the spectra, including
excitonic effects, and to determine the character of the near-edge resonances.
Our results indicate that core-edge excitations are intense and strongly bound:
Their binding energies range from about 6 to 4 eV, going from isolated
molecules to densely-packed SAMs. Electron-hole correlation rules these
excitations, while the exchange interaction plays a negligible role.
