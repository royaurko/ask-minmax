We present a new class of multivariate binning-free and nonparametric
goodness-of-fit tests. The test quantity \emph{energy} is a function of the
distances of observed and simulated observations in the variate space. The
simulation follows the probability distribution function $f_{0}$ of the null
hypothesis. The distances are weighted with a weighting function which can be
adjusted to the variations of $f_{0}$. We have investigated the power of the
test for a uniform and a Gaussian distribution of one or two variates,
respectively and compared it to that of conventional tests. The energy test
with a Gaussian weighting function is closely related to the Pearson $\chi
^{2}$ test but is more powerful in most applications and avoids arbitrary bin
boundaries. The test is especially powerful in the multivariate case.
