We theoretically investigate the influence of dynamical decoupling sequence
in preserving entanglement of polarized photons in polarization-maintaining
birefringent fibers(PMF) under a classic Gauss 1/f noise. We study the dynamic
evolution of entanglement along the control sequence embedded fibers.
Decoherence due to dispersion of polarization mode in PMF can be dramatically
depressed, even for a wild optical width. Entanglement degree can be
effectively preserved while the control pulse is implemented.
