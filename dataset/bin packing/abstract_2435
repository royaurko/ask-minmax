$\nabla$-good filtration dimensions of modules and of algebras are introduced
by Parker for quasi-hereditary algebras. These concepts are now generalized to
the setting of standardly stratified algebras. Let $A$ be a standardly
stratified algebra. The $\bar{\nabla}$-good filtration dimension of $A$ is
proved to be the projective dimension of the characteristic module of $A$.
Several characterizations of $\bar{\nabla}$-good filtration dimensions and
$\bar{\Delta}$-good filtration dimensions are given for properly stratified
algebras. Finally we give an application of these results to the global
dimensions of quasi-hereditary algebras with exact Borel subalgebra.
