We previously reported [Phys. Rev. D 82, 112008 (2010)] measurements of
transverse single-spin asymmetries, A_N, in J/psi production from transversely
polarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV with data taken by the PHENIX
experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in 2006 and 2008.
Subsequently, we have found errors in the analysis procedures for the 2008
data, which resulted in an erroneous value for the extracted A_N. The errors
affected the sorting of events into the correct left/right and forward/backward
bins. This produced an incorrect value for the 2008 result, but the 2006 result
is unaffected. We have conducted two independent reanalyses with these errors
corrected, and we present here the corrected values for the 2008 data and the
combined results for 2006 and 2008. The new combined spin asymmetry in the
forward region is A_N = -0.026+/-0.026(stat)+/-0.003(sys). Since this asymmetry
is consistent with zero, we no longer claim that our results suggest a possible
non-zero trigluon correlation function in transversely polarized protons.
