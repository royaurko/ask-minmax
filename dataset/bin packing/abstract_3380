We propose a theory which describes the mechanical behaviour of
magneto-sensitive elastomers (MSEs) under a uniform external magnetic field. We
focus on the MSEs with isotropic spatial distribution of magnetic particles. A
mechanical model is used in which magnetic particles are arranged on the sites
of three regular lattices: simple cubic, body-centered cubic and hexagonal
close-packed lattices. By this we extend our previous approach [Ivaneyko D. et
al., Macromolecular Theory and Simulations, 2011, 20, 411] which used only a
simple cubic lattice for describing the spatial distribution of the particles.
The magneto-induced deformation and the Young's modulus of MSEs are calculated
as functions of the strength of the external magnetic field. We show that the
magneto-mechanical behaviour of MSEs is very sensitive to the spatial
distribution of the magnetic particles. MSEs can demonstrate either uniaxial
expansion or contraction along the magnetic field and the Young's modulus can
be an increasing or decreasing function of the strength of the magnetic field
depending on the spatial distribution of the magnetic particles.
