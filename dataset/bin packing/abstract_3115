Let $B^{\alpha_i}$ be an $(N_i,d)$-fractional Brownian motion with Hurst
index ${\alpha_i}$ ($i=1,2$), and let $B^{\alpha_1}$ and $B^{\alpha_2}$ be
independent. We prove that, if $\frac{N_1}{\alpha_1}+\frac{N_2}{\alpha_2}>d$,
then the intersection local times of $B^{\alpha_1}$ and $B^{\alpha_2}$ exist,
and have a continuous version. We also establish H\"{o}lder conditions for the
intersection local times and determine the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of
the sets of intersection times and intersection points.
  One of the main motivations of this paper is from the results of Nualart and
Ortiz-Latorre ({\it J. Theor. Probab.} {\bf 20} (2007)), where the existence of
the intersection local times of two independent $(1,d)$-fractional Brownian
motions with the same Hurst index was studied by using a different method. Our
results show that anisotropy brings subtle differences into the analytic
properties of the intersection local times as well as rich geometric structures
into the sets of intersection times and intersection points.
