We investigate the evolution of the galaxy two point correlation function
(CF) over a wide redshift range, 0.2 < z < 3. For the first time the systematic
analysis covers the redshifts above 1 - 1.5. The catalogue of ~250000 galaxies
with i+ < 25 and known photometric redshifts in the Subaru Deep field is used.
The galaxies are divided into three luminosity classes and several
distance/redshift bins. First, the 2D CF is determined for each luminosity
class and distance bin. Calculations are based on the quantitative differences
between the surface distributions of galaxy pairs with comparable and
distinctly different photometric redshifts. The power law approximation for the
CF is used. A limited accuracy of photometric redshifts as compared to the
spectroscopic ones has been examined and taken into account. Then, the 3D
functions for all the selected luminosities and distances are calculated. The
power-law parameters of the CF, the slope and the correlation length, are
determined. Both parameters do not show strong variations over the whole
investigated redshift range. The slope of the luminous galaxies appears to be
consistently steeper than that for the fainter ones. The linear bias factor,
b(z), grows systematically with redshift; assuming the local normalization b(0)
= 1.1-1.2, the bias reaches 3 - 3.5 at the high redshift limit.
