We study the Dp-brane dynamics near NS5-branes with constant electromagnetic
field. In the framework of effective Dirac-Born-Infeld action, we investigate
the effect of the electromagnetic field on the Dp-brane dynamics. The radial
motion of the Dp-brane on the transverse directions of NS5-branes can be mapped
to a rolling tachyon in a constant NS $B_{\mu\nu}$ background. In the near
throat region, the classical motion can be identified with the rescaled
hairpin. After constructing the boundary state of the rescaled hairpin, we
discuss the closed string emission of the Dp-brane and find that the energy of
the closed string emission is always finite in the presence of electric field.
Taking winding strings into account, the emitted energy is divergent,
indicating that the emitted winding strings carry away most of energy.
