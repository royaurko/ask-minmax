We report, for what we believe to be the first time, on the generation of
remote self-seeding laser amplification by using only one 800 nm Ti:Sapphire
femtosecond laser pulse. The laser pulse (~ 40 fs) is first used to generate a
filament either in pure nitrogen or in ambient air in which population
inversion between ground and excited states of nitrogen molecular ions is
realized. Self-induced white light inside the filament is then serving as the
seed to be amplified. The self-induced narrow-band laser at 428 nm has a pulse
duration of ~2.6 ps with perfect linear polarization property. This finding
opens new possibilities for remote detection in the atmosphere.
