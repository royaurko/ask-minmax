We present two implementations of photon counting time-multiplexing detectors
for near-infrared wavelengths, based on Peltier cooled InGaAs/InP avalanche
photo diodes (APDs). A first implementation is motivated by practical
considerations using only commercially available components. It features 16
bins, pulse repetition rates of up to 22 kHz and a large range of applicable
pulse widths of up to 100 ns. A second implementation is based on rapid gating
detectors, permitting deadtimes below 10 ns. This allows one to realize a high
dynamic-range 32 bin detector, able to process pulse repetition rates of up to
6 MHz for pulse width of up to 200 ps. Analysis of the detector response at
16.5% detection efficiency, reveals a single-shot energy resolution on the
attojoule level.
