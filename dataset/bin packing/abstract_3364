In undercooled liquids, the anharmonicity of the interatomic potentials
causes a volume increase of the inherent structures with increasing energy
content. In most glass formers, this increase is stronger than the vibrational
Gr\"uneisen volume expansion and dominates the thermal expansion of the liquid
phase. For a gaussian distribution of inherent states in energy, the generic
case, this implies a 1/T-squared temperature dependence of the additional
thermal expansion and the additional heat capacity at zero pressure. The
corresponding compressibility contribution has the Prigogine-Defay ratio one.
In experiment, one finds a higher Prigogine-Defay ratio, explainable in terms
of structural volume changes without any energy change. These should always
exist, though their influence becomes weak in close-packing systems, at the
crossover to soft matter.
