We propose a test of Monte Carlo Parton Cascade models based on analytic
solutions of covariant kinetic theory for longitudinally boost and transverse
translation invariant boundary conditions. We compute the evolution of the
transverse energy per unit rapidity for typical mini-jet initial conditions
expected in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. The kinetic theory solutions
under these conditions test the models severely because they deviate strongly
from free-streaming and also from ideal Euler and dissipative Navier-Stokes
hydrodynamical approximations. We show that the newly formulated ZPC model
passes this test. In addition, we show that the initial mini-jet density would
need to be approximately four times higher than estimated with the HIJING
generator in central Au+Au collisions at c.m. energies 200 AGeV in order that
parton cascade dynamics can be approximated by Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics.
