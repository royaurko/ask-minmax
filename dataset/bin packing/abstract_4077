The Chem2Bio2RDF portal is a Linked Open Data (LOD) portal for systems
chemical biology aiming for facilitating drug discovery. It converts around 25
different datasets on genes, compounds, drugs, pathways, side effects,
diseases, and MEDLINE/PubMed documents into RDF triples and links them to other
LOD bubbles, such as Bio2RDF, LODD and DBPedia. The portal is based on D2R
server and provides a SPARQL endpoint, but adds on few unique features like RDF
faceted browser, user-friendly SPARQL query generator, MEDLINE/PubMed cross
validation service, and Cytoscape visualization plugin. Three use cases
demonstrate the functionality and usability of this portal.
