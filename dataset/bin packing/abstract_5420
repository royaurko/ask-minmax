In this paper we report the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT)
detection of Very High Energy (VHE; $E_{\gamma}>100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission
from the BL Lac object RBS 0679. $5.3$ years of LAT observations revealed the
presence of three VHE photon events within 0.1 degrees of RBS 0679, with a
subsequent unbinned likelihood analysis finding RBS 0679 to be a source of VHE
photons at $6.9$ standard deviations ($\sigma$). An unbinned likelihood
analysis of the $0.1-100$ GeV data, binned in 28-day periods, finds both the
flux and spectral index to be variable, with a `softer-when-brighter' trend in
the global $\gamma$-ray characteristics. On the other hand, the 28-day periods
in which the VHE photons were detected have spectral indices that are
consistent with the $5.3$ year average suggesting that the observed VHE
emission is not associated with a spectral hardening event. The discovery of
RBS 0679 in the $100-300$ GeV energy range, combined with the non-detection
above 390 GeV with the H.E.S.S. telescope array, suggest RBS 0679 to be an
intriguing source that requires further follow-up observations with
ground-based $\gamma$-ray observatories.
