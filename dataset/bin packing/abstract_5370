We describe a new method for reducing the shape noise in weak lensing
measurements by an order of magnitude. Our method relies on spectroscopic
measurements of disk galaxy rotation and makes use of the Tully-Fisher (TF)
relation in order to control for the intrinsic orientations of galaxy disks.
For this new proposed experiment, the shape noise ceases to be an important
source of statistical error.
  Using CosmoLike, a new cosmological analysis software package, we simulate
likelihood analyses for two spectroscopic weak lensing survey concepts (roughly
similar in scale to Dark Energy Survey Task Force Stage III and Stage IV
missions) and compare their constraining power to a cosmic shear survey from
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Our forecasts in seven-dimensional
cosmological parameter space include statistical uncertainties resulting from
shape noise, cosmic variance, halo sample variance, and higher-order moments of
the density field. We marginalize over systematic uncertainties arising from
photometric redshift errors and shear calibration biases considering both
optimistic and conservative assumptions about LSST systematic errors.
  We find that even the TF-Stage III is highly competitive with the optimistic
LSST scenario, while evading the most important sources of theoretical and
observational systematic error inherent in traditional weak lensing techniques.
Furthermore, the TF technique enables a narrow-bin cosmic shear tomography
approach to tightly constrain time-dependent signatures in the dark energy
phenomenon.
