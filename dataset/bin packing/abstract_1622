We calculate the unpolarized QED Compton scattering cross section in a
manifestly covariant way. Our approach allows a direct implementation of the
specific kinematical cuts imposed in the experiments, {\it e. g.} HERA-H1. We
compare the 'exact' cross section in terms of the structure functions $F_{1,2}
(x_B,Q^2)$, assuming the Callan-Gross relation, with the one obtained using the
equivalent photon approximation (EPA) as well as with the experimental results.
We find that the agreement with the EPA is better in $x_{\gamma}$ bins, where
$x_{\gamma}$ is the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the proton carried
by the virtual photon, compared to the bins in the leptonic variable $x_l$.
