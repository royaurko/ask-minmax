This paper is concerned with the quasi-static rheology of packings of glass
spheres of diameter d (d=0.2mm, 0.7mm or 3mm). Stick-slip behaviour is observed
on small spheres, i.e d=0.2mm & 0.7mm ; one observes also in this case a
weakening of the rheology as the rate of deformation increases, and the larger
the rate the larger the weakening; this generates macroscopic instabilities and
stick-slip. Statistics of stick-slip events have been determined, which show
that the larger the sample the more regular (i.e. "periodic") the sick-slip,
the faster the strain rate the less periodic the events. One concludes that
this stick-slip is generated at the macroscopic level and comes from the
macroscopic rhelogical law. However when sample is small, local fluctuations
perturb the macroscopic events and trigger them erratically. Pacs # : 5.40 ;
