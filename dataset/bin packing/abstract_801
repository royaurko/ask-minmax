For $\cal C$ a collection of $n$ objects in $R^d$, let the packing and
piercing numbers of $\cal C$, denoted by $Pack({\cal C})$, and $Pierce({\cal
C})$, respectively, be the largest number of pairwise disjoint objects in
${\cal C}$, and the smallest number of points in $R^d$ that are common to all
elements of ${\cal C}$, respectively. When elements of $\cal C$ are fat objects
of arbitrary sizes, we derive sub-exponential time algorithms for the NP-hard
problems of computing ${Pack}({\cal C})$ and $Pierce({\cal C})$, respectively,
that run in $n^{O_d({{Pack}({\cal C})}^{d-1\over d})}$ and
$n^{O_d({{Pierce}({\cal C})}^{d-1\over d})}$ time, respectively, and $O(n\log
n)$ storage. Our main tool which is interesting in its own way, is a new
separation theorem. The algorithms readily give rise to polynomial time
approximation schemes (PTAS) that run in $n^{O({({1\over\epsilon})}^{d-1})}$
time and $O(n\log n)$ storage. The results favorably compare with many related
best known results. Specifically, our separation theorem significantly improves
the splitting ratio of the previous result of Chan, whereas, the
sub-exponential time algorithms significantly improve upon the running times of
very recent algorithms of Fox and Pach for packing of spheres.
