Assume that $\mathcal{D}$ is a Krull-Schmidt, Hom-finite triangulated
category with a Serre functor and a cluster-tilting object $T$. We introduce
the notion of ghost-tilting objects, and $T[1]$-tilting objects in
$\mathcal{D}$, which are a generalization of cluster-tilting objects. When
$\mathcal{D}$ is $2$-Calabi-Yau, the ghost-tilting objects are cluster-tilting.
Let $\Lambda={\rm End}^{op}_{\mathcal{D}}(T)$ be the endomorphism algebra of
$T$. We show that there exists a bijection between $T[1]$-tilting objects in
$\mathcal{D}$ and support $\tau$-tilting $\Lambda$-modules, which generalizes a
result of Adachi-Iyama-Reiten [AIR]. We develop a basic theory on
$T[1]$-tilting objects. In particular, we introduce a partial order on the set
of $T[1]$-tilting objects and mutation of $T[1]$-tilting objects, which can be
regarded as a generalization of `cluster-tilting mutation'. As an application,
we give a partial answer to a question posed in [AIR].
