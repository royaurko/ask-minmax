We measure nebular oxygen abundances for 204 emission-line galaxies with
redshifts 0.3<z<1.0 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North
(GOODS-N) field using spectra from the Team Keck Redshift Survey (TKRS). We
also provide an updated analytic prescription for estimating oxygen abundances
using the traditional strong emission line ratio, R_{23}, based on the
photoionization models of Kewley & Dopita (2003). We include an analytic
formula for very crude metallicity estimates using the [NII]6584/Halpha ratio.
Oxygen abundances for GOODS-N galaxies range from 8.2< 12+log(O/H)< 9.1
corresponding to metallicities between 0.3 and 2.5 times the solar value. This
sample of galaxies exhibits a correlation between rest-frame blue luminosity
and gas-phase metallicity (i.e., an L-Z relation), consistent with L-Z
correlations of previously-studied intermediate-redshift samples. The zero
point of the L-Z relation evolves with redshift in the sense that galaxies of a
given luminosity become more metal poor at higher redshift. Galaxies in
luminosity bins -18.5<M_B<-21.5 exhibit a decrease in average oxygen abundance
by 0.14\pm0.05 dex from z=0 to z=1. This rate of metal enrichment means that
28\pm0.07% of metals in local galaxies have been synthesized since z=1, in
reasonable agreement with the predictions based on published star formation
rate densities which show that ~38% of stars in the universe have formed during
the same interval. (Abridged)
