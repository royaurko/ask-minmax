Based on experiments of the compaction of granular materials under periodic
shear of a packing of glass beads, a minimal model for the dynamics of the
packing density as a function of time is proposed. First, a random ``energy
landscape'' is created by a random walk (RW) in energy. Second, an ensemble of
RWs is performed for various temperatures in different temperature-time
sequences. We identify the minimum (mean) of the energy landscape with the
maximum (random) density. The temperature scaled by the step-size of the energy
landscape determines the dynamics of the system and can be regarded as the
agitation or shear amplitude. The model reproduces qualitatively both tapping
and shear experiments.
