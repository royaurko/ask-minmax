We investigate the role of local force balance in the transition from a
microcanonical ensemble of static granular packings, characterized by an
invariant stress, to a canonical ensemble. Packings in two dimensions admit a
reciprocal tiling, and a collective effect of force balance is that the area of
this tiling is also invariant in a microcanonical ensemble. We present
analytical relations between stress, tiling area and tiling area fluctuations,
and show that a canonical ensemble can be characterized by an intensive
thermodynamic parameter conjugate to one or the other. We test the equivalence
of different ensembles through the first canonical simulations of the force
network ensemble, a model system.
