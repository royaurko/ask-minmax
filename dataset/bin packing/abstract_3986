Secret-key agreement protocols over wiretap channels controlled by a state
parameter are studied. The entire state sequence is known (non-causally) to the
sender but not to the receiver and the eavesdropper. Upper and lower bounds on
the secret-key capacity are established both with and without public
discussion. The proposed coding scheme involves constructing a codebook to
create common reconstruction of the state sequence at the sender and the
receiver and another secret-key codebook constructed by random binning. For the
special case of Gaussian channels, with no public discussion, - the secret-key
generation with dirty paper problem, the gap between our bounds is at-most 1/2
bit and the bounds coincide in the high signal-to-noise ratio and high
interference-to-noise ratio regimes. In the presence of public discussion our
bounds coincide, yielding the capacity, when then the channels of the receiver
and the eavesdropper satisfy an in- dependent noise condition.
