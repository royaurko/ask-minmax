We present multifiber echelle radial velocity results for 551 stars in the
Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy and identify 294 stars as probable Sextans
members. The projected velocity dispersion profile of the binned data remains
flat to a maximum angular radius of $30^{\prime}$. We introduce a nonparametric
technique for estimating the projected velocity dispersion surface, and use
this to search for kinematic substructure. Our data do not confirm previous
reports of a kinematically distinct stellar population at the Sextans center.
Instead we detect a region near the Sextans core radius that is kinematically
colder than the overall Sextans sample with 95% confidence.
