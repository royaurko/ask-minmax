Building on a quasi-chemical formulation of solution theory, this paper
proposes a self consistent molecular field theory for packing problems in
classical liquids, and tests the theoretical predictions for the excess
chemical potential of the hard sphere fluid. Results are given for the self
consistent molecular fields obtained, and for the probabilities of occupancy of
a molecular observation volume. For this system, the excess chemical potential
predicted is as accurate as the most accurate prior theories, particularly the
scaled particle (Percus-Yevick compressibility) theory. It is argued that the
present approach is particularly simple, and should provide a basis for a
molecular-scale description of more complex solutions.
