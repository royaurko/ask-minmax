A hot and dense partonic system can be produced in the early stage of a
relativistic heavy ion collision. How it equilibrates is important for the
extraction of Quark-Gluon Plasma properties. We study the chemical and kinetic
equilibrations of the Quark-Gluon Plasma using a radiative transport model.
Thermal and Color-Glass-Condensate motivated initial conditions are used. We
observe that screened parton interactions always lead to partial pressure
isotropization. Different initial pressure anisotropies result in the same
asymptotic evolution. Comparison of evolutions with and without radiative
processes shows that chemical equilibration interacts with kinetic
equilibration and radiative processes can contribute significantly to pressure
isotropization.
