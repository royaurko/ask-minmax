We prove that the set of quadratic growths attainable by integer-valued
superharmonic functions on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ has the structure of an
Apollonian circle packing. This completely characterizes the PDE which
determines the continuum scaling limit of the Abelian sandpile on the lattice
$\mathbb{Z}^2$.
