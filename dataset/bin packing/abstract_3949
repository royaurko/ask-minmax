It is important to understand, in detail, two-pion correlations measured in
p+p and d+A collisions. In particular, one wishes to understand the femtoscopic
correlations, in order to compare to similar measurements in heavy ion
collisions. However, in the low-multiplicity final states of these systems,
global conservation laws generate significant N-body correlations which project
onto the two-pion space in non-trivial ways and complicate the femtoscopic
analysis. We discuss a formalism to calculate and account for these
correlations in collisions dominated by a single particle species (e.g. pions).
We also discuss effects on two-particle correlations between non-identical
particles, the understanding of which may be important in the study of
femtoscopic space-time asymmetries.
