By using a fully relativistic embedded cluster Green's function technique we
investigated the magnetic anisotropy properties of four different compact Cr
trimers (equilateral triangles) and Cr mono-layers deposited on Au(111) surface
in both fcc and hcp stackings. For all trimers the magnetic ground state was
found a frustrated 120$^\circ$ N\'eel configuration. Applying global spin
rotations to the magnetic ground state, the predictions of an appropriate
second order spin Hamiltonian were reproduced with high accuracy by the first
principles calculations. For the Cr trimers with adjacent Au atoms in similar
geometry we obtained similar values for the in-plane and out-of-plane
anisotropy parameters, however, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions
appeared to differ remarkably. For two kinds of trimers we found an
unconventional magnetic ground state showing 90$^\circ$ in-the-plane rotation
with respect to the high symmetry directions. Due to higher symmetry, the
in-plane anisotropy term was missing for the mono-layers and distinctly
different DM interactions were obtained for the different stackings. The chiral
degeneracy of the N\'eel configurations was lifted by less then 2 meV for the
trimers, while this value raised up to about 15 meV per 3 Cr atoms for the hcp
packed mono-layer.
