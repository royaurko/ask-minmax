Functionals in geometric probability are often expressed as sums of bounded
functions exhibiting exponential stabilization. Methods based on cumulant
techniques and exponential modifications of measures show that such functionals
satisfy moderate deviation principles. This leads to moderate deviation
principles and laws of the iterated logarithm for random packing models as well
as for statistics associated with germ-grain models and $k$ nearest neighbor
graphs.
