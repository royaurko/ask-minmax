The thermodynamic properties of disks moving in a channel sufficiently narrow
that they can collide only with their nearest neighbors can be solved exactly
by determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an integral equation.
Using it we have determined the correlation length $\xi$ of this system. We
have developed an approximate solution which becomes exact in the high density
limit. It describes the system in terms of defects in the regular zigzag
arrangement of disks found in the high-density limit. The correlation length is
then effectively the spacing between the defects. The time scales for defect
creation and annihilation are determined with the help of transition-state
theory, as is the diffusion coefficient of the defects, and these results are
found to be in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations. On
compressing the system with the Lubachevsky--Stillinger procedure, jammed
states are obtained whose packing fractions $\phi_J$ are a function of the
compression rate $\gamma$. We find a quantitative explanation of this
dependence by making use of the Kibble--Zurek hypothesis. We have also
determined the point-to-set length scale $\xi_{PS}$ for this system. At a
packing fraction $\phi$ close to its largest value $\phi_{\text{max}}$,
$\xi_{PS}$ has a simple power law divergence, $\xi_{PS} \sim
1/(1-\phi/\phi_{\text{max}})$, while $\xi$ diverges much faster, $\ln(\xi) \sim
1/(1-\phi/\phi_{\text{max}})$.
