Contact breaking and Hertzian interactions between grains can both give rise
to nonlinear vibrational response of static granular packings. We perform
molecular dynamics simulations at constant energy in 2D of frictionless
bidisperse disks that interact via Hertzian spring potentials as a function of
energy and measure directly the vibrational response from the Fourier transform
of the velocity autocorrelation function. We compare the measured vibrational
response of static packings near jamming onset to that obtained from the
eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix to determine the temperature above which
the linear response breaks down. We compare packings that interact via
single-sided (purely repulsive) and double-sided Hertzian spring interactions
to disentangle the effects of the shape of the potential from contact breaking.
Our studies show that while Hertzian interactions lead to weak nonlinearities
in the vibrational behavior (e.g. the generation of harmonics of the
eigenfrequencies of the dynamical matrix), the vibrational response of static
packings with Hertzian contact interactions is dominated by contact breaking as
found for systems with repulsive linear spring interactions.
