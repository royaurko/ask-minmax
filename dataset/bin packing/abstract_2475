We study the absorption probability and Hawking radiation of the scalar field
in the rotating G\"{o}del black hole in minimal five-dimensional gauged
supergravity. We find that G\"{o}del parameter $j$ imprints in the greybody
factor and Hawking radiation. It plays a different role from the angular
momentum of the black hole in the Hawking radiation and super-radiance. These
information can help us know more about rotating G\"{o}del black holes in
minimal five-dimensional gauged supergravity.
