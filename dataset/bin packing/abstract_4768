Single-crystal organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on p-channel
molecular semiconductors have led to breakthrough carrier mobilities and to the
observation of band-like transport. These results represent the limit in our
quest for the ultimate OFET performance. However, band-like transport has not
been reported for n-channel OFETs and, for p-channel transistors, it is not
understood why it occurs only for certain molecular materials. Here we report
band-like electron transport for n-channel OFETs based on PDIF-CN2
single-crystals. Devices with different gate dielectrics - vacuum, Cytop, PMMA
- are compared and we find that the performance is suppressed for those with
larger dielectric constant. This phenomenon parallels that observed for holes
in p-channel OFETs, however, the magnitude of the suppression is smaller, an
effect that can be rationalized by the semiconductor molecular structure and
crystal packing. A quantitative analysis of our findings, together with results
on different high-quality p-channel transistors, indicates the importance of
the interplay between the semiconductor molecular polarizability and the
structure of the charge transport layers in the crystal, as a key factor
enabling band-like transport. Based on these considerations, we suggest
unprecedented structure-property relationships useful for performance
optimization of high-mobility organic transistors.
