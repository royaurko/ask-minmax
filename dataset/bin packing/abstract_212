Closely packed conformations of helices formed on the ideal rope are
considered. The pitch versus radius relations which define a closely packed
helix are determined. The relations stem from the turn-to-turn distance and
curvature limiting conditions. Plots of the relations are shown to cross each
other. The physical sense of the crossing point is discussed.
