Weak gravitational lensing observations probe the spectrum and evolution of
density fluctuations and the cosmological parameters which govern them. At low
redshifts, the non-linear gravitational evolution of large scale structure
produces a non-Gaussian covariance in the shear power spectrum measurements
that affects their translation into cosmological parameters. Using the dark
matter halo approach, we study the covariance of binned band power spectrum
estimates and the four point function of the dark matter density field that
underlies it. We compare this semi-analytic estimate to results from N-body
numerical simulations and find good agreement. We find that for a survey out to
z ~ 1, the power spectrum covariance increases the errors on cosmological
parameters determined under the Gaussian assumption by about 15%.
