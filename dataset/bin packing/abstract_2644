A generalization of the Gaussian dirty-paper problem to a multiple access
setup is considered. There are two additive interference signals, one known to
each transmitter but none to the receiver. The rates achievable using Costa's
strategies (i.e. by a random binning scheme induced by Costa's auxiliary random
variables) vanish in the limit when the interference signals are strong. In
contrast, it is shown that lattice strategies ("lattice precoding") can achieve
positive rates independent of the interferences, and in fact in some cases -
which depend on the noise variance and power constraints - they are optimal. In
particular, lattice strategies are optimal in the limit of high SNR. It is also
shown that the gap between the achievable rate region and the capacity region
is at most 0.167 bit. Thus, the dirty MAC is another instance of a network
setup, like the Korner-Marton modulo-two sum problem, where linear coding is
potentially better than random binning. Lattice transmission schemes and
conditions for optimality for the asymmetric case, where there is only one
interference which is known to one of the users (who serves as a "helper" to
the other user), and for the "common interference" case are also derived. In
the former case the gap between the helper achievable rate and its capacity is
at most 0.085 bit.
