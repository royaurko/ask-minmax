We present an all-electron study of the dynamical density-response function
of hexagonal close-packed transition metals Sc and Ti. We elucidate various
aspects of the interplay between the crystal structure and the electron
dynamics by investigating the loss function, and the associated dielectric
function, for wave-vector transfers perpendicular and parallel to the hexagonal
plane. As expected, but contrary to recent work, we find that the
free-electron-like aspects of the dynamical response are rather isotropic for
small wave vectors. The crystal local-field effects are found to have an impact
on the plasmon energy for small wave vectors, which gives rise to an interplay
with the exchange-correlation effects built into the many-body kernel. The loss
function lineshape shows a significant dependence on propagation direction; in
particular, for propagation on the hexagonal plane the plasmon hybridizes
substantially with fine structure due to d-electron transitions, and its
dispersion curve becomes difficult to establish, beyond the small wave vector
limit. The response is calculated in the framework of time-dependent density
functional theory (TDDFT), based on a full-potential linearized
augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) ground-state, in which the exchange-correlation
effects are treated in the local-density approximation.
