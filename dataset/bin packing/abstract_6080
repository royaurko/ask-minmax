We investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxy
colour-density relation using the data from the First Epoch VIMOS-VLT Deep
Survey (VVDS) on scales of R=5 h^(-1)Mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. While at lower
redshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with the
fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosity
increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressively
disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.Our results suggest the
existence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by the
absence of the colour-density relation on the R=5 h^(-1)Mpc scales
investigated. The rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal
pattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. We
find that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends upon
environment. Both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, on
the R=5 h^(-1)Mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product of
genetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least a
period of 9 Gyr. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star
formation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and
in high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shifting
with cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out of
high density environments.
