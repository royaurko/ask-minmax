We consider a triangular gap of side two in a $60^\circ$ angle on the
triangular lattice whose sides are zig-zag lines. We study the interaction of
the gap with the corner as the rest of the angle is completely filled with
lozenges. We show that the resulting correlation is governed by the product of
the distances between the gap and its five images in the sides of the angle.
This provides a new aspect of the parallel between the correlation of gaps in
dimer packings and electrostatics developed by the first contributor in previous
work.
