Fully packed loop models on the square and the honeycomb lattice constitute
new classes of critical behaviour, distinct from those of the low-temperature
O(n) model. A simple symmetry argument suggests that such compact phases are
only possible when the underlying lattice is bipartite. Motivated by the hope
of identifying further compact universality classes we therefore study the
fully packed loop model on the square-octagon lattice. Surprisingly, this model
is only critical for loop weights n < 1.88, and its scaling limit coincides
with the dense phase of the O(n) model. For n=2 it is exactly equivalent to the
selfdual 9-state Potts model. These analytical predictions are confirmed by
numerical transfer matrix results. Our conclusions extend to a large class of
bipartite decorated lattices.
