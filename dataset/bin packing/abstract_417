Let $\mu$ be the self-similar measure supported on the self-similar set $K$
with open set condition. In this article, we discuss the packing dimension of
the set $\{x\in K: A(\frac{\log\mu(B(x,r))}{\log r})=I\}$ for
$I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, where $A(\frac{\log\mu(B(x,r))}{\log r})$ denotes the
set of accumulation points of \frac{\log\mu(B(x,r))}{\log r}$ as $r\searrow0$.
Our main result solves the conjecture about packing dimension posed by Olsen
and Winter \cite{OlsWin} and generalizes the result in \cite{BaeOlsSni}.
