We consider the problem of quantifying temporal coordination between multiple
high-dimensional responses. We introduce a family of multi-way stochastic
blockmodels suited for this problem, which avoids preprocessing steps such as
binning and thresholding commonly adopted for this type of data, in biology. We
develop two inference procedures based on collapsed Gibbs sampling and
variational methods. We provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed methods
on simulated data, in terms of membership and blockmodel estimation,
predictions out-of-sample and run-time. We also quantify the effects of
censoring procedures such as binning and thresholding on the estimation tasks.
We use these models to carry out an empirical analysis of the functional
mechanisms driving the coordination between gene expression and metabolite
concentrations during carbon and nitrogen starvation, in S. cerevisiae.
