We investigate the process of random sequential adsorption of polydisperse
particles whose size distribution exhibits a power-law dependence in the small
size limit, $P(R)\sim R^{\alpha-1}$. We reveal a relation between pattern
formation kinetics and structural properties of arising patterns. We propose a
mean-field theory which provides a fair description for sufficiently small
$\alpha$. When $\alpha \to \infty$, highly ordered structures locally identical
to the Apollonian packing are formed. We introduce a quantitative criterion of
the regularity of the pattern formation process. When $\alpha \gg 1$, a sharp
transition from irregular to regular pattern formation regime is found to occur
near the jamming coverage of standard random sequential adsorption with
monodisperse size distribution.
