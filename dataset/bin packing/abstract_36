We consider the online bin packing problem under the advice complexity model
where the 'online constraint' is relaxed and an algorithm receives partial
information about the future requests. We provide tight upper and lower bounds
for the amount of advice an algorithm needs to achieve an optimal packing. We
also introduce an algorithm that, when provided with log n + o(log n) bits of
advice, achieves a competitive ratio of 3/2 for the general problem. This
algorithm is simple and is expected to find real-world applications. We
introduce another algorithm that receives 2n + o(n) bits of advice and achieves
a competitive ratio of 4/3 + {\epsilon}. Finally, we provide a lower bound
argument that implies that advice of linear size is required for an algorithm
to achieve a competitive ratio better than 9/8.
