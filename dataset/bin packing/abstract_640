We discuss the effects of initial collision geometry and centrality bin
definition on correlation and fluctuation observables in nucleus-nucleus
collisions. We focus on the forward-backward correlation coefficient recently
measured by the STAR Collaboration in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Our study is
carried out within two models: the Glauber Monte Carlo code with a `toy'
wounded nucleon model and the hadron-string dynamics (HSD) transport approach.
We show that strong correlations can arise due to averaging over events in one
centrality bin. We, furthermore, argue that a study of the dependence of
correlations on the centrality bin definition as well as the bin size may
distinguish between these `trivial' correlations and correlations arising from
`new physics'.
