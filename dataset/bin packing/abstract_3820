To obtain the most accurate predictions for the Higgs masses in the minimal
supersymmetric model (MSSM), one should compute the full set of one-loop
radiative corrections, resum the large logarithms to all orders, and add the
dominant two-loop effects. A complete computation following this procedure
yields a complex set of formulae which must be analyzed numerically. We discuss
a very simple approximation scheme which includes the most important terms from
each of the three components mentioned above. We estimate that the Higgs masses
computed using our scheme lie within 2 GeV of their theoretically predicted
values over a very large fraction of MSSM parameter space.
