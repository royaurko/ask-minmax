We study the sensitivity of testing the anomalous gauge couplings $g_{HVV}$'s
of the Higgs boson in the formulation of linearly realized gauge symmetry via
the processes $\gamma\gamma\to ZZ$ and $\gamma\gamma\to WWWW$ at polarized and
unpolarized photon colliders based on $e^+e^-$ linear colliders of
c.m.~energies 500 GeV, 1 TeV, and 3 TeV. Signals beyond the standard model (SM)
and SM backgrounds are carefully studied. We propose certain kinematic cuts to
suppress the standard model backgrounds. For an integrated luminosity of 1
ab$^{-1}$, we show that (a) $\gamma\gamma\to ZZ$ can provide a test of
$g_{H\gamma\gamma}$ to the $3\sigma$ sensitivity of $O(10^{-3}-10^{-2})$
TeV$^{-1}$ at a 500 GeV ILC, and $O(10^{-3})$ TeV$^{-1}$ at a 1 TeV ILC and a 3
TeV CLIC, and (b) $\gamma\gamma\to WWWW$ at a 3 TeV CLIC can test all the
anomalous couplings $g_{HVV}$'s to the $3\sigma$ sensitivity of
$O(10^{-3}-10^{-2})$ TeV$^{-1}$.
