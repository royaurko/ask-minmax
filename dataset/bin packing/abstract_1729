We obtained near-infrared (0.8 - 2.5 micron) spectra of seven Jovian Trojan
asteroids that have been formerly reported to show silicate-like absorption
features near 1 micron. Our sample includes the Trojan (1172) Aneas, which is
one of three Trojans known to possess a comet-like 10 micron emission feature,
indicative of fine-grained silicates. Our observations show that all seven
Trojans appear featureless in high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The
simultaneous absence of the 1 micron band and presence of the 10 micron
emission can be understood if the silicates on (1172) Aneas are iron-poor.
  In addition, we present near infrared observations of five optically grey
Trojans, including three objects from the collisionally produced Eurybates
family. The five grey Trojans appear featureless in the near infrared with no
diagnostic absorption features. The near infrared spectrum of Eurybates can be
best fitted with the spectrum of a CM2 carbonaceous chondrite, which hints that
the C-type Eurybates family members may have experienced aqueous alteration.
