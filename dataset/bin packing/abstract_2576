We calculate the quasinormal modes of massless scalar perturbations around
small and large four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-Anti de Sitter (RN-AdS)
black holes. We find a dramatic change in the slopes of quasinormal frequencies
in small and large black holes near the critical point where the Van der Waals
like thermodynamic phase transition happens. This further supports that the
quasinormal mode can be a dynamic probe of the thermodynamic phase transition.
