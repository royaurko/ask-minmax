Powered by effective parquet nesting a commensurate chiral honeycomb
superstructure in a trigonally packed transition metal dichalcogenide TaSe$_2$
results in a Dirac cone anomaly in one-particle excitation spectrum. However,
the formation of the well defined Dirac point seems to be hindered by effective
scattering on 2D plasmons.
