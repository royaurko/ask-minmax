We present a new catalog of absprption-line systems identified in the quasar
spectra. It contains data on 821 QSOs and 8558 absorption systems comprizing
16139 absorption lines with measured redshifts in the QSO spectra. The catalog
includes absorption-line systems consisting of lines of heavy elements, lines
of neutral hydrogen, Lyman limit systems, damped Ly\alpha absorption systems,
and broad absorption-line systems. The catalog is available in electronic form
at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via
http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/412/707 and at
www.ioffe.ru/astro/QC. Using the data of the present catalog we also discuss
redshift distributions of absorption-line systems.
