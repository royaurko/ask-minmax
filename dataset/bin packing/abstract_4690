An analysis of databases of photographic images of ocean's surface, taken
from various altitudes and for various types of rough ocean surface, revealed
the presence of an ocean's skeletal structures (OSS). The OSSs differ from the
formerly found skeletal structures (SS) only by the fact that OSS, in their
interior, are filled in with closely packed blocks of a smaller size, up to
thin capillaries of tens of micron in size. According to suggested hypothesis,
the structure-forming dust is produced due to volcanic activity and atmospheric
electricity. Such SS may fall on the ocean surface and produce an OSS. This
idea is supported by the adsorption of air bubbles in the water by the SS to
give a partial flotation of SS. In the sea water, various substances in
different phase states of matter are in touch. This suggests the hypothesis,
for the possibility of the action of surface tension even on the blocks of SS
which is immersed in the sea. This phenomenon results in the aggregation of
blocks deposited from the atmosphere on the ocean's surface, to form eventually
an OSS. The skeletal structuring assumes that the individual straight and
rather strong blocks may be joined flexibly, similarly to joints in a skeleton.
We make a stress on the phenomenon of OSS's blocks in the form of vertically
oriented floating cylinders because here we suggest the hypothesis that the
VFC's strength and floating is determined by; a capillary model of an OSS.
