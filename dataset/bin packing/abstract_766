We give a new proof that the Poisson boundary of a planar graph coincides
with the boundary of its square tiling and with the boundary of its circle
packing, originally proven by Georgakopoulos and Angel, Barlow, Gurel-Gurevich
and Nachmias respectively. Our proof is robust, and also allows us to identify
the Poisson boundaries of graphs that are rough-isometric to planar graphs.
  We also prove that the boundary of the square tiling of a bounded degree
plane triangulation coincides with its Martin boundary. This is done by
comparing the square tiling of the triangulation with its circle packing.
