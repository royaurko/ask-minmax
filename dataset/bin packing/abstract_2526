We analyze the science reach of a next generation galaxy redshift survey such
as BigBOSS to fit simultaneously for time varying dark energy equation of state
and time- and scale-dependent gravity. The simultaneous fit avoids potential
bias from assuming $\Lambda$CDM expansion or general relativity and leads to
only modest degradation in constraints. Galaxy bias, fit freely in redshift
bins, is self calibrated by spectroscopic measurements of redshift space
distortions and causes little impact. The combination of galaxy redshift,
cosmic microwave background, and supernova distance data can deliver 5-10%
constraints on 6 model independent modified gravity quantities.
