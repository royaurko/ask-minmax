We report on the comparative experimental investigation on third and fifth
harmonic generation (THG and FHG) in atomic and molecular gases driven by
mid-infrared ultrafast laser pulses at a wavelength of ~1500 nm. We observe
that the conversion efficiencies of both the THG and FHG processes saturate at
similar peak intensities close to ~1.5\times1014 W/cm2 for argon, nitrogen, and
air, whose ionization potentials are close to each other. Near the saturation
intensity, the ratio of yields of the FHG and THG reaches ~10-1 for all the
gases. Our results show that high-order Kerr effects do exist, whereas they are
insufficient to balance the Kerr self-focusing without the assistance of plasma
generation.
