Over the past five years, searches in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data have more
than doubled the number of known dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and
have revealed a population of ultra-faint galaxies with luminosities smaller
than typical globular clusters, L ~ 1000 Lsun. These systems are the faintest,
most dark matter dominated, and most metal poor galaxies in the universe.
Completeness corrections suggest that we are poised on the edge of a vast
discovery space in galaxy phenomenology, with hundreds more of these extreme
galaxies to be discovered as future instruments hunt for the low-luminosity
threshold of galaxy formation. Dark matter dominated dwarfs of this kind probe
the small-scale power-spectrum, provide the most stringent limits on the
phase-space packing of dark matter, and offer a particularly useful target for
dark matter indirect detection experiments. Full use of dwarfs as dark matter
laboratories will require synergy between deep, large-area photometric
searches; spectroscopic and astrometric follow-up with next-generation optical
telescopes; and subsequent observations with gamma-ray telescopes for dark
matter indirect detection.
