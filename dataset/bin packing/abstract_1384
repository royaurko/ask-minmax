P. Buser and P. Sarnak showed in 1994 that the maximum, over the moduli space
of Riemann surfaces of genus s, of the least conformal length of a
nonseparating loop, is logarithmic in s. We present an application of
(polynomially) dense Euclidean packings, to estimates for an analogous
2-dimensional conformal systolic invariant of a 4-manifold X with indefinite
intersection form. The estimate turns out to be polynomial, rather than
logarithmic, in \chi(X), if the conjectured surjectivity of the period map is
correct. Such surjectivity is targeted by the current work in gauge theory. The
surjectivity allows one to insert suitable lattices with metric properties
prescribed in advance, into the second de Rham cohomology group of X, as its
integer lattice. The idea is to adapt the well-known Lorentzian construction of
the Leech lattice, by replacing the Leech lattice by the Conway-Thompson
unimodular lattices which define asymptotically dense packings. The final step
can be described, in terms of the successive minima \lambda_i, as deforming a
\lambda_2-bound into a \lambda_1-bound.
