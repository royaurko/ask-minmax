We compute the nucleon matrix elements of QCD operators of twist 3 and 4 in
the instanton vacuum. We consider the operators determining 1/Q^2-power
corrections to the Bjorken, Ellis-Jaffe and Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rules.
The nucleon is described as a soliton of the effective chiral theory derived
from instantons in the 1/N_c-expansion. QCD operators involving the gluon field
are systematically represented by effective operators in the effective chiral
theory. We find that twist-3 matrix elements are suppressed relative to twist-4
by a power of the packing fraction of the instanton medium. Numerical results
for the spin-dependent (d^(2), f^(2)) and spin-independent twist-3 and 4 matrix
elements are compared with results of other approaches and with experimental
estimates of power corrections. The methods developed can be used to evaluate a
wide range of matrix elements relevant to DIS.
