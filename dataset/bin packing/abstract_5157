Measurements of the sphericity of primary charged particles in minimum bias
proton--proton collisions at sqrt(s)=0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV with the ALICE
detector at the LHC are presented. The observable is linearized to be collinear
safe and is measured in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction using
primary charged tracks with $p_{\rm T}\geq0.5$ GeV/c in $|\eta|\leq0.8$. The
mean sphericity as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at
mid-rapidity ($N_{\rm ch}$) is reported for events with different $p_{\rm T}$
scales ("soft" and "hard") defined by the transverse momentum of the leading
particle. In addition, the mean charged particle transverse momentum versus
multiplicity is presented for the different event classes, and the sphericity
distributions in bins of multiplicity are presented. The data are compared with
calculations of standard Monte Carlo event generators. The transverse
sphericity is found to grow with multiplicity at all collision energies, with a
steeper rise at low $N_{\rm ch}$, whereas the event generators show the
opposite tendency. The combined study of the sphericity and the mean $p_{\rm
T}$ with multiplicity indicates that most of the tested event generators
produce events with higher multiplicity by generating more back-to-back jets
resulting in decreased sphericity (and isotropy). The PYTHIA6 generator with
tune PERUGIA-2011 exhibits a noticeable improvement in describing the data,
compared to the other tested generators.
