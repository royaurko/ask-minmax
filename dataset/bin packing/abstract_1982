Persistent currents in rings constructed from carbon nanotubes are
investigated theoretically. After studying the contribution of finite
temperature or quenched disorder on covalent rings, the complexity due to the
bundle packing is addressed. The case of interacting nanotori and
self-interacting coiled nanotubes are analyzed in details in relation with
experiments.
