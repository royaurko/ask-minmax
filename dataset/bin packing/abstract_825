We investigate the jamming transition in packings of emulsions and granular
materials via molecular dynamics simulations. The emulsion model is composed of
frictionless droplets interacting via nonlinear normal forces obtained using
experimental data acquired by confocal microscopy of compressed emulsions
systems. Granular materials are modeled by Hertz-Mindlin deformable spherical
grains with Coulomb friction. In both cases, we find power-law scaling for the
vanishing of pressure and excess number of contacts as the system approaches
the jamming transition from high volume fractions. We find that the
construction history parametrized by the compression rate during the
preparation protocol has a strong effect on the micromechanical properties of
granular materials but not on emulsions. This leads the granular system to jam
at different volume fractions depending on the histories. Isostaticity is found
in the packings close to the jamming transition in emulsions and in granular
materials at slow compression rates and infinite friction. Heterogeneity of
interparticle forces increases as the packings approach the jamming transition
which is demonstrated by the exponential tail in force distributions and the
small values of the participation number measuring spatial localization of the
forces. However, no signatures of the jamming transition are observed in
structural properties, like the radial distribution functions and the
distributions of contacts.
