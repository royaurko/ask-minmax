The aim of this paper is to study the latitudinal variation in the solar
rotation in soft X-ray corona. The time series bins are formed on different
latitude regions of the solar full disk (SFD) images that extend from 80 degree
South to 80 degree North. These SFD images are obtained with the soft X-ray
telescope (SXT) on board the Yohkoh solar observatory. The autocorrelation
analyses are performed with the time series that track the SXR flux modulations
in the solar corona. Then for each year, extending from 1992 to 2001, we obtain
the coronal sidereal rotation rate as a function of the latitude. The present
analysis from SXR radiation reveals that; (i) the equatorial rotation rate of
the corona is comparable to the rotation rate of the photosphere and the
chromosphere, (ii) the differential profile with respect to the latitude varies
throughout the period of the study; it is more in the year 1999 and least in
1994 and (iii) the equatorial rotation period varies systematically with
sunspot numbers and indicates its dependence on the phases of the solar
activity cycle.
