In this research announcement we outline the methods used in our recent proof
that the Leech lattice is the unique densest lattice in R^24. Complete details
will appear elsewhere, but here we illustrate our techniques by applying them
to the case of lattice packings in R^2, and we discuss the obstacles that arise
in higher dimensions.
