Using the VISHNU hybrid model, we calculate the multiplicity, spectra, and
elliptic flow of $\Lambda$, $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ in 2.76 A TeV Pb+Pb collisions.
Comparisons between our calculations and the ALICE measurements show that the
model generally describes the soft hadron data of these strange and
multi-strange hadrons at several centrality bins. Mass ordering of elliptic
flow among $\pi$, K, p, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ has also been studied and
discussed. With a nice description of the particle yields, we explore chemical
and thermal freeze-out of various hadrons species at the LHC within the
framework of the VISHNU hybrid model.
