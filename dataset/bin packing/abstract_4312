The f(T) theory, a generally modified teleparallel gravity, has been proposed
as an alternative gravity model to account for the dark energy phenomena.
Following our previous work [Xin-he Meng and Ying-bin Wang, EPJC(2011),
arXiv:1107.0629v1], we prove that the Birkhoff's theorem holds in a more
general context, specifically with the off diagonal tetrad case, in this
communication letter. Then, we discuss respectively the results of the external
vacuum and internal gravitational field in the f(T) gravity framework, as well
as the extended meaning of this theorem. We also investigate the validity of
the Birkhoff's theorem in the frame of f(T) gravity via conformal
transformation by regarding the Brans-Dicke-like scalar as effective matter,
and study the equivalence between both Einstein frame and Jordan frame.
