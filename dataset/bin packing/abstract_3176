The many endless rivers of text now available present a serious challenge in
the task of gleaning, analyzing and discovering useful information. In this
paper, we describe a methodology for visualizing text streams in real time. The
approach automatically groups similar messages into "countries," with keyword
summaries, using semantic analysis, graph clustering and map generation
techniques. It handles the need for visual stability across time by dynamic
graph layout and Procrustes projection techniques, enhanced with a novel stable
component packing algorithm. The result provides a continuous, succinct view of
evolving topics of interest. It can be used in passive mode for overviews and
situational awareness, or as an interactive data exploration tool. To make
these ideas concrete, we describe their application to an online service called
TwitterScope.
