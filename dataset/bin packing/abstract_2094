We argue that a so far neglected dimensionless scale, the number of neighbors
in a closely packed system, is relevant for the convergence of the large $N_c$
expansion at high chemical potential. It is only when the number of colors is
large w.r.t. this new scale ($\sim \order{10}$) that a convergent large $N_c$
limit is reached. This provides an explanation as to why the large $N_c$
expansion, qualitatively successful in in vacuum QCD, fails to describe high
baryo-chemical potential systems, such as nuclear matter. It also means that
phenomenological claims about high density matter based on large $N_c$
extrapolations should be treated with caution.
