Atomistic (atom-scale) and coarse-grained (meso-scale) simulations of
structure and dynamics of poly-isoprene melts are compared. The local structure
and chain packing is mainly determined by the atomistic details of the polymer
architecture. The large-time dynamics encountered in NMR experiments can be
explained by meso-scale simulations including stiffness. The connecting link
between the two scales is the stiffness which, although being a local property,
influences strongly even the long-timescale dynamics. The standard reptation
scenario fails to explain the observed dynamics. We propose strong reptation as
a modified reptation scenario in which the local Rouse motion is absent.
