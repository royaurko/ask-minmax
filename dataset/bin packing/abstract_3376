We report the structural and magnetic properties of a new class of cobaltates
with the chemical formula (BaSr)4-xLa2xCo4O15 (x = 0, 0.5 and 1). These
compounds crystallize in a hexagonal structure in which cobalt ions are
distributed among two distinct crystallographic sites with different oxygen
coordination. Three Co-O tetrahedra and one octahedron are linked by shared
oxygen atoms to form Co4O15 clusters, which are packed together into a
honeycomb-like network. Partial substitution of Sr and/or Ba atoms by La allows
one to adjust the degree of Co valence mixing, but all compositions remain
subject to a random distribution of charge. Magnetic susceptibility together
with neutron scattering measurements reveal that all studied specimens are
characterized by competing ferro- and antiferro-magnetic exchange interactions
that give rise to a three dimensional Heisenberg spin-glass state. Neutron
spectroscopy shows a clear trend of slowing down of spin-dynamics upon
increasing La concentration, suggesting a reduction in charge randomness in the
doped samples.
