Crumpling and folding of paper are at rst sight very di erent ways of con
ning thin sheets in a small volume: the former one is random and stochastic
whereas the latest one is regular and deterministic. Nevertheless, certain
similarities exist. Crumpling is surprisingly ine cient: a typical crumpled
paper ball in a waste-bin consists of as much as 80% air. Similarly, if one
folds a sheet of paper repeatedly in two, the necessary force becomes so large
that it is impossible to fold it more than 6 or 7 times. Here we show that the
sti ness that builds up in the two processes is of the same nature, and
therefore simple folding models allow to capture also the main features of
crumpling. An original geometrical approach shows that crumpling is
hierarchical, just as the repeated folding. For both processes the number of
layers increases with the degree of compaction. We nd that for both processes
the crumpling force increases as a power law with the number of folded layers,
and that the dimensionality of the compaction process (crumpling or folding)
controls the exponent of the scaling law between the force and the compaction
ratio.
