The ASTEP project aims at detecting and characterizing transiting planets
from Dome C, Antarctica, and qualifying this site for photometry in the
visible. The first phase of the project, ASTEP South, is a fixed 10 cm diameter
instrument pointing continuously towards the celestial South pole. Observations
were made almost continuously during 4 winters, from 2008 to 2011. The
point-to-point RMS of 1-day photometric lightcurves can be explained by a
combination of expected statistical noises, dominated by the photon noise up to
magnitude 14. This RMS is large, from 2.5 mmag at R=8 to 6% at R=14, because of
the small size of ASTEP South and the short exposure time (30 s). Statistical
noises should be considerably reduced using the large amount of collected data.
A 9.9-day period eclipsing binary is detected, with a magnitude R=9.85. The
2-season lightcurve folded in phase and binned into 1000 points has a RMS of
1.09 mmag, for an expected photon noise of 0.29 mmag. The use of the 4 seasons
of data with a better detrending algorithm should yield a sub-millimagnitude
precision for this folded lightcurve. Radial velocity follow-up observations
are conducted and reveal a F-M binary system. The detection of this 9.9-day
period system with a small instrument such as ASTEP South and the precision of
the folded lightcurve show the quality of Dome C for continuous photometric
observations, and its potential for the detection of planets with orbital
period longer than those usually detected from the ground.
