We introduce a framework for computer-aided derivation of multi-scale models.
It relies on a combination of an asymptotic method used in the field of partial
differential equations with term rewriting techniques coming from computer
science.
  In our approach, a multi-scale model derivation is characterized by the
features taken into account in the asymptotic analysis. Its formulation
consists in a derivation of a reference model associated to an elementary
nominal model, and in a set of transformations to apply to this proof until it
takes into account the wanted features. In addition to the reference model
proof, the framework includes first order rewriting principles designed for
asymptotic model derivations, and second order rewriting principles dedicated
to transformations of model derivations. We apply the method to generate a
family of homogenized models for second order elliptic equations with periodic
coefficients that could be posed in multi-dimensional domains, with possibly
multi-domains and/or thin domains.
