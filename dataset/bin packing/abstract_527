The topological structure resulting from the network of contacts between
grains (\emph{contact network}) is studied for large samples of monosized
spheres with densities (fraction of volume occupied by the spheres) ranging
from 0.59 to 0.64. We retrieve the coordinates of each bead in the pack and we
calculate the average coordination number by using three different methods. We
show that, in the range of density investigated, the coordination number is
larger than 4 and it increases with the packing fraction. At local level we
also observe a positive correlation between local packing fraction and number
of neighbors. We discover a dependence between the local densities of
configurations with few neighbors in contact and the global sample-denities.
This might indicate that local configurations with small number of neighbors
are able to deform plastically when the sample is compactifying.
