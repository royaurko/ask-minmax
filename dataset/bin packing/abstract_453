We study in detail the counterintuitive result that in elongated rotating
Bose--Einstein condensates the ground state is composed of one or more vortex
lines which bend even in completely symmetric setups. This symmetry breaking
allows the condensate to smoothly adapt to rotation and to produce tightly
packed arrays of vortex lines.
