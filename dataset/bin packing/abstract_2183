We numerically study the distributions of global pressure that are found in
ensembles of statically jammed and quasistatically sheared systems of
bidisperse, frictionless, disks at fixed packing fraction $\phi$ in two
dimensions. We use these distributions to address the question of how pressure
increases as $\phi$ increases above the jamming point $\phi_J$, $p\sim |\phi -
\phi_J|^y$. For statically jammed ensembles, our results are consistent with
the exponent $y$ being simply related to the power law of the interparticle
soft-core interaction. For sheared systems, however, the value of $y$ is
consistent with a non-trivial value, as found previously in rheological
simulations.
