In this paper we deal with the packings derived by horo- and hyperballs
(briefly hyp-hor packings) in the $n$-dimensional hyperbolic spaces $\HYN$
($n=2,3$) which form a new class of the classical packing problems.
  We construct in the $2-$ and $3-$dimensional hyperbolic spaces hyp-hor
packings that are generated by complete Coxeter tilings of degree $1$ i.e. the
fundamental domains of these tilings are simple frustum orthoschemes and we
determine their densest packing configurations and their densities.
  We prove that in the hyperbolic plane ($n=2$) the density of the above
hyp-hor packings arbitrarily approximate the universal upper bound of the
hypercycle or horocycle packing density $\frac{3}{\pi}$ and in $\HYP$ the
optimal configuration belongs to the $[7,3,6]$ Coxeter tiling with density
$\approx 0.83267$.
  Moreover, we study the hyp-hor packings in truncated orthosche\-mes $[p,3,6]$
$(6< p < 7, ~ p\in \bR)$ whose density function is attained its maximum for a
parameter which lies in the interval $[6.05,6.06]$ and the densities for
parameters lying in this interval are larger that $\approx 0.85397$. That means
that these locally optimal hyp-hor configurations provide larger densities that
the B\"or\"oczky-Florian density upper bound $(\approx 0.85328)$ for ball and
horoball packings but these hyp-hor packing configurations can not be extended
to the entirety of hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$.
