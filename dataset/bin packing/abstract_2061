We experimentally study the condensed phases of repelling core-softened
spheres in two dimensions. The dipolar pair repulsion between superparamagnetic
spheres trapped in a thin cell is induced by a transverse magnetic field and
softened by suitably adjusting the cell thickness. We scan a broad density
range and we materialize a large part of the theoretically predicted phases in
systems of core-softened particles, including expanded and close-packed
hexagonal, square, chain-like, stripe/labyrinthine, and honeycomb phase.
Further insight into their structure is provided by Monte Carlo simulations.
