RooFit is a library of C++ classes that facilitate data modeling in the ROOT
environment. Mathematical concepts such as variables, (probability density)
functions and integrals are represented as C++ objects. The package provides a
flexible framework for building complex fit models through classes that mimic
math operators, and is straightforward to extend. For all constructed models
RooFit provides a concise yet powerful interface for fitting (binned and
unbinned likelihood, chi^2), plotting and toy Monte Carlo generation as well as
sophisticated tools to manage large scale projects. RooFit has matured into an
industrial strength tool capable of running the BABAR experiment's most
complicated fits and is now available to all users on SourceForge.
