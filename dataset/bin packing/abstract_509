The stress profile and reorientation of grains, in response to a point force
applied to a preloaded two dimensional granular system, are calculated in the
context of a continuum theory that incorporates the texture of the packing.
When high friction prevents slip at the inter-grain contacts, an anisotropic
packing propagates stress along two peaks which amalgamate into a single peak
as the packing is disordered into a less anisotropic structure; this single
peak may be wider or narrower than in the isotropic case, depending on the
preparation of the packing. At lower frictions, an effective treatment of
slipping contacts yields sharpened peaks, and ultimately a singular limit in
which stress propagates along straight rays. Recent experiments, as well as
aspects of hyperbolic models, are discussed in light of these results.
