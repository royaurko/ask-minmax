In order to transport sufficiently high current, high-temperature
superconductor (HTS) tapes are assembled in cable structures of different
forms. In such cables, the tapes are tightly packed and have a strong
electromagnetic interaction. In particular, the generated self-field is quite
substantial and can give an important contribution in reducing the maximum
current the cable can effectively carry. In order to be able to predict the
critical current of said cable structures, a static numerical model has been
recently proposed. In this contribution, we present in detail the
implementation of such models in different programming environments, including
finite-element-based and general numerical analysis programs, both commercial
an open-source. A comparison of the accuracy and calculation speed of the
different implementations of the model is carried out for the case of a Roebel
cable. The model is also used to evaluate the importance of choosing a very
accurate description of the angular Jc(B) dependence of the superconductor as
input for the material's property. The numerical codes, which are open-source,
are made freely available to interested users.
