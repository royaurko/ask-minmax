The contact values $g_{ij}(\sigma_{ij})$ of the radial distribution functions
of a $d$-dimensional mixture of (additive) hard spheres are considered. A
`universality' assumption is put forward, according to which
$g_{ij}(\sigma_{ij})=G(\eta, z_{ij})$, where $G$ is a common function for all
the mixtures of the same dimensionality, regardless of the number of
components, $\eta$ is the packing fraction of the mixture, and $z_{ij}$ is a
dimensionless parameter that depends on the size distribution and the diameters
of spheres $i$ and $j$. For $d=3$, this universality assumption holds for the
contact values of the Percus--Yevick approximation, the Scaled Particle Theory,
and, consequently, the Boublik--Grundke--Henderson--Lee--Levesque
approximation. Known exact consistency conditions are used to express
$G(\eta,0)$, $G(\eta,1)$, and $G(\eta,2)$ in terms of the radial distribution
at contact of the one-component system. Two specific proposals consistent with
the above conditions (a quadratic form and a rational form) are made for the
$z$-dependence of $G(\eta,z)$. For one-dimensional systems, the proposals for
the contact values reduce to the exact result. Good agreement between the
predictions of the proposals and available numerical results is found for
$d=2$, 3, 4, and 5.
