We present detailed clustering analysis of a large K-band selected local
galaxy sample, which is constructed from the 2MASS and the SDSS and consists of
$82,486$ galaxies with $10 < K < 13.5$ and $0.01 < z < 0.1$. The two-point
correlation function of the magnitude-limited sample in real space at small
scales is well described by a power law
$\xi(r)=(r/6.44\pm0.23)^{-1.81\pm0.02}$. The pairwise velocity dispersion is
derived from the anisotropic two-point correlation function and find the
dispersion $\sigma_{12}=685\pm 17\kms$ if its scale invariance is assumed,
which is larger than values measured in optical bands selected galaxy samples.
We further investigate the dependence of the two-point correlation function and
the $\sigma_{12}$ on the $g-r$ color and the $K$-band luminosity, obtain
similar results to previous works in optical bands. Comparing a mock galaxy
sample with our real data indicates that the semi-analytical model can not
mimic the $\sigma_{12}$ in observation albeit it can approximate the two-point
correlation function within measurement uncertainties.
