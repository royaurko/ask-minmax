The viscoelasticity of two-dimensional liquids is quantified in an experiment
using a dusty plasma. An experimental method is demonstrated for measuring the
wavenumber-dependent viscosity, $\eta(k)$, which is a quantitative indicator of
viscoelasticity. Using an expression generalized here to include friction,
$\eta(k)$ is computed from the transverse current autocorrelation function
(TCAF), which is found by tracking random particle motion. The TCAF exhibits an
oscillation that is a signature of elastic contributions to viscoelasticity.
Simulations of a Yukawa liquid are consistent with the experiment.
