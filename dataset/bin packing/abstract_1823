We have investigated the thermodynamical properties of the universe with dark
energy. It is demonstrated that in a universe with spacial curvature the
natural choice for IR cutoff could be the apparent horizon radius. We shown
that any interaction of pressureless dark matter with holographic dark energy,
whose infrared cutoff is set by the apparent horizon radius, implying a
constant effective equation of state of dark component in a universe. In
addition we found that for the static observer in space, the comoving distance
has a faster expansion than the apparent horizon radius with any spatial
curvature. We also verify that in some conditions the modified first law of
thermodynamics could return to the classic form at apparent horizon for a
universe filled with dark energy and dark matter. Besides, the generalized
second law of thermodynamics is discussed in a region enclosed by the apparent
horizon.
