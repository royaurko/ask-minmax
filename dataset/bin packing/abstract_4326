In this paper, new measurements of anisotropic flow ($v_{1}$, $v_{2}$) for
identified particles such as pions and proton in Cu+Au collisions at 200 GeV
and U+U collisions at 193 GeV are reported. The anisotropic flow is studied as
a function of $p_{T}$ and centrality in these two collision systems. In
ultra-central U+U collisions (0--2% centrality), $v_2$ of protons shows a weak
$p_{T}$ dependence for $p_T<$~1.0 GeV/c. A positive $v_1$ for charged pions is
observed for $p_{T} >$ 1 GeV/c with respect to the first-order event plane, the
angle of which is determined by the Au-going spectators. The scaling of
identified particles $v_2$ with the number of valence quarks ($n_q$) has been
observed, in different centrality bins, with the transverse kinetic energy in
these two collision systems.
