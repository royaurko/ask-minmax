The system of CH$_3$I adsorbed on submonolayer, monolayer and multilayer thin
films of D$_2$O on Cu(110) has been studied by measuring the time-of-flight
(TOF) distributions of the desorbing CH$_3$ fragments after photodissociation
using linearly polarized $\lambda$=248nm light. For multilayer D$_2$O films
(1--120ML), the photodissociation is dominated by neutral photodissociation via
the "A-band" absorption of CH$_3$I. The polarization and angle dependent
variation in the observed TOF spectra of the CH$_3$ photofragments find that
dissociation is largely via the $^3Q_0$ excited state, but that also a
contribution via the $^1Q_1$ excitation can be identified. The
photodissociation results also indicate that the CH$_3$I adsorbed on D$_2$O
forms close-packed islands at submonolayer coverages, with a mixture of C--I
bond axis orientations. For submonolayer quantities of D$_2$O we have observed
a contribution to CH$_3$I photodissociation via dissociative electron
attachment (DEA) by photoelectrons. The observed DEA is consistent with
delocalized photoelectrons from the substrate causing the observed
dissociation-- we do not find evidence for a DEA mechanism via the temporary
solvation of photoelectrons in localized states of the D$_2$O ice.
