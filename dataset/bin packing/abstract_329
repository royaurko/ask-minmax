In his monograph (2013) Arthur characterizes the L-packets of quasisplit
symplectic groups and orthogonal groups. By extending his work, we characterize
the L-packets for the corresponding similitude groups with desired properties.
In particular, we show these packets satisfy the conjectural endoscopic
character identities.
