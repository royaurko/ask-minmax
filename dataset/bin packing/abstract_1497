We propose a new technique, which we call the lens parallax method, to
determine simultaneously the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxies
and the mass distribution of foreground clusters of galaxies. The method is
based on gravitational lensing and uses the fact that the mean angular size of
the faint blue galaxies is a well-determined function of surface brightness.
The method requires first a calibration of the angular-size vs. surface
brightness relation in unlensed blank fields and a determination of the mean
redshift of the brightest of the faint blue galaxies. By combining this
information with observations of the distorted images of background galaxies in
the fields of foreground clusters, we show that it is possible to obtain the
mean redshift of the galaxies as a function of their surface brightness. With a
sample of about ten moderate redshift rich clusters and using ten bins in
surface brightness, a bin-to-bin signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim3.5$ can be
achieved. The method simultaneously allows a determination of the convergence
and shear of the lensing cluster as a function of position, and through this
the mass distribution of the lens can be obtained. The lens parallax method can
be used in conjunction with, and will improve the accuracy of, other previously
proposed techniques for mapping clusters.
