An exploratory study of the low-lying eigenvalues of the Wilson-Dirac
operator and their corresonding eigenvectors is presented. Results for the
eigenvalues from quenched and unquenched simulations are discussed. The
eigenvectors are studied with respect to their localization properties in the
quenched approximation for the cases of SU(2) and SU(3).
