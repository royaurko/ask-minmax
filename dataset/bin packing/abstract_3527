We study universal cycles of the set ${\cal P}(n,k)$ of $k$-partitions of the
set $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and prove that the transition digraph associated
with ${\cal P}(n,k)$ is Eulerian. But this does not imply that universal cycles
(or ucycles) exist, since vertices represent equivalence classes of partitions!
We use this result to prove, however, that ucycles of ${\cal P}(n,k)$ exist for
all $n \geq 3$ when $k=2$. We reprove that they exist for odd $n$ when $k =
n-1$ and that they do not exist for even $n$ when $k = n-1$. An infinite family
of $(n,k)$ for which ucycles do not exist is shown to be those pairs for which
$S(n-2, k-2)$ is odd ($3 \leq k < n-1$). We also show that there exist
universal cycles of partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ subsets of distinct sizes when
$k$ is sufficiently smaller than $n$, and therefore that there exist universal
packings of the partitions in ${\cal P}(n,k)$. An analogous result for
coverings completes the investigation.
