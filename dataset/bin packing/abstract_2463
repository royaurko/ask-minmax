We use a sample of 384 million BBbar decays collected with the Babar detector
at the PEP-II asymmetric e+e- storage ring to study the flavor-changing neutral
current decays B->K(*)l+l-, where l+l- is either e+e- or mu+mu-. We present
measurements in two dilepton mass bins, one below the J/psi resonance and the
other above, of the lepton forward-backward asymmetry AFB and the longitudinal
K* polarization FL in B->K*l+l-, along with isospin rate asymmetries in
B->K*l+l- and B->Kl+l- final states.
