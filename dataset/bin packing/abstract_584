Particle shape plays an important role in assembly and packing. The
combination of concave and convex surfaces in particular influence the way
particles arrange, both entropically and in the limit of infinite pressure. We
study recently synthesized spheroidal particles with up to six symmetric
concavities (dimples) between the convex and concave extents of their shape.
These particles exhibit a crossover in behavior during both packing and
assembly arising from a competition between their convex and concave features.
We identify the shape features that control this crossover as the total
circumference to depth ratio of dimples in packing, and the individual dimple
volume in assembly.
