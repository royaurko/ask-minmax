JEDI (Joint Efficient Dark-energy Investigation) is a candidate
implementation of the NASA-DOE Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM). JEDI will
probe dark energy in three independent methods: (1) type Ia supernovae, (2)
baryon acoustic oscillations, and (3) weak gravitational lensing. In an
accompanying paper, an overall summary of the JEDI mission is given. In this
paper, we present further details of the supernova component of JEDI. To derive
model-independent constraints on dark energy, it is important to precisely
measure the cosmic expansion history, H(z), in continuous redshift bins from z
\~ 0-2 (the redshift range in which dark energy is important). SNe Ia at z > 1
are not readily accessible from the ground because the bulk of their light has
shifted into the near-infrared where the sky background is overwhelming; hence
a space mission is required to probe dark energy using SNe. Because of its
unique near-infrared wavelength coverage (0.8-4.2 microns), JEDI has the
advantage of observing SNe Ia in the rest frame J band for the entire redshift
range of 0 < z < 2, where they are less affected by dust, and appear to be
nearly perfect standard candles. During the first year of JEDI operations,
spectra and light curves will be obtained for ~4,000 SNe Ia at z < 2. The
resulting constraints on dark energy are discussed, with special emphasis on
the improved precision afforded by the rest frame near-infrared data.
