The cognitive radio channel with common message (CRCC) is considered. In this
channel, similar to the cognitive radio channel (CRC), we have a cognitive user
which has full non-causal knowledge of the primary message, and like the
interference channel with common message (ICC), the information sources at the
two transmitters are statistically dependent and the senders need to transmit
not only the private message but also certain common message to their
corresponding receivers. By using a specific combination of superposition
coding, binning scheme and simultaneous decoding, we propose a unified
achievable rate region for the CRCC which subsumes the several existing results
for the CRC, ICC, interference channel without common message (IC), strong
interference channel and compound multiple access channel with common
information (SICC and CMACC).
