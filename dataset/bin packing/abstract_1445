Bulk, shear, and compressional aggregate sound velocities of hydrogen and
helium in the close- packed hexagonal structure are calculated over a wide
pressure range using two complementary approaches: semi-empirical lattice
dynamics based on the many-body intermolecular potentials and
density-functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation. The sound
velocities are used to calculate pressure dependence of the Debye temperature.
The comparison between experiment and first-principle and semi-empirical
calculations provide constraints on the density dependence of intermolecular
interactions in the zero-temperature limit.
