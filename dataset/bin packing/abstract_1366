We report a numerical investigation of the visco-elastic behavior in models
for steric repulsive and short-range attractive colloidal suspensions, along
different paths in the attraction-strength vs packing fraction plane. More
specifically, we study the behavior of the viscosity (and its frequency
dependence) on approaching the repulsive glass, the attractive glass and in the
re-entrant region where viscosity shows a non monotonic behavior on increasing
attraction strength. On approaching the glass lines, the increase of the
viscosity is consistent with a power-law divergence with the same exponent and
critical packing fraction previously obtained for the divergence of the density
fluctuations. Based on mode-coupling calculations, we associate the increase of
the viscosity with specific contributions from different length scales. We also
show that the results are independent on the microscopic dynamics by comparing
newtonian and brownian simulations for the same model. Finally we evaluate the
Stokes-Einstein relation approaching both glass transitions, finding a clear
breakdown which is particularly strong for the case of the attractive glass.
