A 2D neutron detector based on 3He convertor and MWPC with an active area of
200 mm \times 200 mm has been successfully designed and fabricated. The
detector has been tested with Am/Be neutron source and with collimated neutron
beam with wavelength of {\lambda} = 1.37 {\AA}. A best spatial resolution of
1.18 mm (FWHM) and good linearity were obtained. This is in good agreement with
the theoretical calculations.
