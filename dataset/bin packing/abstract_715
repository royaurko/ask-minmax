We use computer simulation to investigate the self-assembly of Janus-like
amphiphilic peanut-shaped nanoparticles, finding phases of clusters, bilayers
and micelles in accord with ideas of packing familiar from the study of
molecular surfactants. However, packing arguments do not explain the
hierarchical self-assembly dynamics that we observe, nor the coexistence of
bilayers and faceted polyhedra. This coexistence suggests that experimental
realizations of our model can achieve multipotent assembly of either of two
competing ordered structures.
