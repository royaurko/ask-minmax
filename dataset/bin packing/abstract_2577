We investigate in detail the mechanism of superradiance to render the
instability of Kerr-de Sitter black holes in scalar-tensor gravity. Our results
provide more clues to examine the scalar-tensor gravity in the astrophysical
black holes in the universe with cosmological constant. We also discuss the
spontaneous scalarization in the de Sitter background and find that this
instability can also happen in the spherical de Sitter configuration in a
special style.
