We show that linear redshift distortions in the galaxy distribution can
affect the ISW galaxy-temperature signal, when the galaxy selection function is
derived from a redshift survey. We find this effect adds power to the ISW
signal at all redshifts and is larger at higher redshifts. Omission of this
effect leads to an overestimation of the dark energy density $\Omega_\Lambda$
as well as an underestimation of statistical errors. We find a new expression
for the ISW Limber equation which includes redshift distortions, though we find
that Limber equations for the ISW calculation are ill-suited for tomographic
calculations when the redshift bin width is small. The inclusion of redshift
distortions provides a new cosmological handle in the ISW spectrum, which can
help constrain dark energy parameters, curvature and alternative cosmologies.
