We present details of a prototype fiber feed for use on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope (AAT) that uses a dedicated fiber-fed medium/high resolution (R >
10000) visible-band spectrograph to give integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of
an extended object. A focal reducer couples light from the telescope to the
close-packed lenslet array and fiber feed, allowing the spectrograph be used on
other telescopes with the change of a single lens. By considering the
properties of the fibers in the design of the spectrograph, an efficient design
can be realised, and we present the first scientific results of a prototype
spectrograph using a fiber feed with 37 spatial elements, namely the detection
of Lithium confirming a brown dwarf candidate and IFS of the supernova remnant
SN1987A.
