Hard exclusive electroproduction of $\omega$ mesons is studied with the
HERMES spectrometer at the DESY laboratory by scattering 27.6 GeV positron and
electron beams off a transversely polarized hydrogen target. The amplitudes of
five azimuthal modulations of the single-spin asymmetry of the cross section
with respect to the transverse proton polarization are measured. They are
determined in the entire kinematic region as well as for two bins in photon
virtuality and momentum transfer to the nucleon. Also, a separation of
asymmetry amplitudes into longitudinal and transverse components is done. These
results are compared to a phenomenological model that includes the pion pole
contribution. Within this model, the data favor a positive $\pi\omega$
transition form factor.
