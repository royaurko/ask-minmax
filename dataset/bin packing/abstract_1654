Centrality dependence of J/psi production in Au-Au collisions at 200 GeV
nucleon-nucleon center of mass energy is studied using the Glauber model plus
the kinetic formation model. Initial J/psi production and destruction by
incoming nucleons are described by the Glauber model. J/psi-charm equilibration
in the gluon plasma is described by the kinetic formation model. We explore the
possibility of J/psi suppression suggested by the recent PHENIX data. We show
that the J/psi yield monotonically decreases with increasing centrality in the
kinetic formation model when the charm mass is smaller than a critical mass.
The final J/psi yield is between the value after the Glauber suppression and
the dynamical equilibrium value. This underscores the importance of both J/psi
production from d-Au collisions, which is essential in determining the Glauber
suppression, and high statistics Au-Au data, which can further constrain final
state J/psi-charm equilibration.
