In this paper, we show that the coefficients of the E-characteristic
polynomial of a tensor are orthonormal invariants of that tensor. When the
dimension is 2, some simplified formulas of the E-characteristic polynomial are
presented. A re- sultant formula for the constant term of the E-characteristic
polynomial is given. We then study the set of tensors with infinitely many
eigenpairs and the set of irregular tensors, and prove both the sets have
codimension 2 as subvarieties in the projective space of tensors. This makes
our perturbation method workable. By using the perturbation method and
exploring the difference between E-eigenvalues and eigenpair equivalence
classes, we present a simple formula for the coefficient of the leading term of
the E-characteristic polynomial, when the dimension is 2.
