We systematically study the relationship between equilibrium and
non-equilibrium phase diagrams of a system of short-ranged attractive colloids.
Using Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations we find a window of
enhanced crystallization that is limited at high interaction strength by a
slowing down of the dynamics and at low interaction strength by the high
nucleation barrier. We find that the crystallization is enhanced by the
metastable gas-liquid binodal by means of a two-stage crystallization process.
First, the formation of a dense liquid is observed and second the crystal
nucleates within the dense fluid. In addition, we find at low colloid packing
fractions a fluid of clusters, and at higher colloid packing fractions a
percolating network due to an arrested gas-liquid phase separation that we
identify with gelation. We find that this arrest is due to crystallization at
low interaction energy and it is caused by a slowing down of the dynamics at
high interaction strength. Likewise, we observe that the clusters which are
formed at low colloid packing fractions are crystalline at low interaction
energy, but glassy at high interaction energy. The clusters coalesce upon
encounter.
