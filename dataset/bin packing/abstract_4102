The viscoelasticity of a two-dimensional liquid strongly-coupled dusty plasma
is studied experimentally, without macroscopic shear. Positions and velocities
of the dust particles, measured by video microscopy, are used as the inputs to
the generalized Green-Kubo relation to obtain the complex viscosity $\eta
(\omega)$. The real part of $\eta (\omega)$ (which corresponds to dissipation)
diminishes gradually with frequency, while the imaginary part (which
corresponds to elasticity) is peaked at a frequency below the 2D dusty plasma
frequency. The viscoelastic approximation is found to accurately describe the
2D experimental results for $\eta (\omega)$, yielding the Maxwell relaxation
time $\tau_M = 0.10 s$. Results for $\eta (\omega)$ are compared to 2D
molecular dynamics Yukawa simulations and to a previous experiment that was
performed using an oscillating macroscopic shear.
