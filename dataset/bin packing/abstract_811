To examine the relationship between sidechain geometry and sidechain packing,
we use an all-atom Monte Carlo simulation to sample the large space of
sidechain conformations. We study three models of excluded volume and use
umbrella sampling to effectively explore the entire space. We find that while
excluded volume constraints reduce the size of conformational space by many
orders of magnitude, the number of allowed conformations is still large. An
average repacked conformation has 20% of its chi angles in a non-native state.
Interestingly, well-packed conformations, with up to 50% non-native chi's
exist. Entropy is distributed non-uniformly over positions, and we partially
explain the observed distribution using rotamer probabilities derived from the
pdb database. In spite of our finding that 65% of the native rotamers and 85%
of chi 1 angles can be correctly predicted on the basis of excluded volume
only, 95% of positions can accomodate more than 1 rotamer in simulation. We
estimate that in order to quench the sidechain entropy observed in the presence
of excluded volume interactions, other interactions (hydrophobic, polar,
electrostatic) must provide an additional stabilization of at least 0.6 kT per
residue in order to single out the native state.
