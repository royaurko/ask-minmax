We propose a Bell inequality for high-dimensional bipartite systems obtained
by binning local measurement outcomes and show that it is tight. We find a
binning method for even d-dimensional measurement outcomes for which this Bell
inequality is maximally violated by maximally entangled states. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the Bell inequality is applicable to continuous variable
systems and yields strong violations for two-mode squeezed states.
