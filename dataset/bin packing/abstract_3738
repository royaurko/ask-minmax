A cosmic shear survey, spanning a significant proportion of the sky, should
greatly improve constraints on a number of cosmological parameters. It also
provides a unique opportunity to examine the matter power spectrum directly.
However, the observed lensing signal corresponds to a weighted average of the
power spectrum across a range of scales, and so the potential to resolve the
baryon oscillations has been somewhat neglected. These features originated
prior to recombination, induced by the acoustics of the photon-baryon fluid.
Recent galaxy surveys have detected the imprints, and in the future such
measurements may even be used to refine our understanding of dark energy.
Without redshift information, cosmic shear is an ineffective probe of the
baryon oscillations. However, by implementing a novel multipole-dependent
selection of photometric redshift bins, sensitivity is improved by an order of
magnitude, bringing the "wiggles" within reach of future surveys. As an
illustration, we show that data from surveys scheduled within the next ten
years will be able to distinguish a smoothed power spectrum at the two sigma
level.
