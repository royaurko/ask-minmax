Avalanches of grain displacements can be generated by creating local voids
within the interior of a granular material at rest in a bin. Modeling such a
two-dimensional granular system by a collection of mono-disperse discs, the
system on repeated perturbations, shows all signatures of Self-Organized
Criticality. During the propagation of avalanches the competition among grains
creates arches and in the critical state a distribution of arches of different
sizes is obtained. Using a cellular automata model we demonstrate that the
existence of arches determines the universal behaviour of the model system.
