The unpolarised transverse momentum dependent distribution and fragmentation
functions are extracted from HERMES and COMPASS experimental measurements of
SIDIS multiplicities for charged hadron production. The data are grouped into
independent bins of the kinematical variables, in which the TMD factorisation
is expected to hold. A simple factorised functional form of the TMDs is
adopted, with a Gaussian dependence on the intrinsic transverse momentum, which
turns out to be quite adequate in shape. HERMES data do not need any
normalisation correction, while fits of the COMPASS data much improve with a
$y$-dependent overall normalisation factor. A comparison of the extracted TMDs
with previous EMC and JLab data confirms the adequacy of the simple Gaussian
distributions. The possible role of the TMD evolution is briefly considered.
