We present a method enabling the creation of
constant-uncertainty/constant-significance light curves with the data of the
Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT). The adaptive-binning method enables more
information to be encapsulated within the light curve than with the
fixed-binning method. Although primarily developed for blazar studies, it can
be applied to any sources. This method allows the starting and ending times of
each interval to be calculated in a simple and quick way during a first step.
The reported mean flux and spectral index (assuming the spectrum is a power-law
distribution) in the interval are calculated via the standard LAT analysis
during a second step. The absence of major caveats associated with this method
has been established by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. We present the
performance of this method in determining duty cycles as well as power-density
spectra relative to the traditional fixed-binning method.
