The problem of lossless fixed-rate streaming coding of discrete memoryless
sources with side information at the decoder is studied. A random time-varying
tree-code is used to sequentially bin strings and a Stack Algorithm with a
variable bias uses the side information to give a delay-universal coding system
for lossless source coding with side information. The scheme is shown to give
exponentially decaying probability of error with delay, with exponent equal to
Gallager's random coding exponent for sources with side information. The mean
of the random variable of computation for the stack decoder is bounded, and
conditions on the bias are given to guarantee a finite $\rho^{th}$ moment for
$0 \leq \rho \leq 1$.
  Further, the problem is also studied in the case where there is a discrete
memoryless channel between encoder and decoder. The same scheme is slightly
modified to give a joint-source channel encoder and Stack Algorithm-based
sequential decoder using side information. Again, by a suitable choice of bias,
the probability of error decays exponentially with delay and the random
variable of computation has a finite mean. Simulation results for several
examples are given.
