We show how attractive interactions dramatically influence emulsion rheology.
Unlike the repulsive case, attractive emulsions below random close packing,
RCP, can form soft gel-like elastic solids. However, above RCP, attractive and
repulsive emulsions have similar elasticities. Such compressed attractive
emulsions undergo an additional shear-driven relaxation process during
yielding. Our results suggest that attractive emulsions begin to yield at weak
points through the breakage of bonds, and, above RCP, also undergo droplet
configurational rearrangements.
