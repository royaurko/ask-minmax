We extend the halo-independent method of Fox, Liu, and Weiner to include
energy resolution and efficiency with arbitrary energy dependence, making it
more suitable for experiments to use in presenting their results. Then we
compare measurements and upper limits on the direct detection of low mass
($\sim10$ GeV) weakly interacting massive particles with spin-independent
interactions, including the upper limit on the annual modulation amplitude from
the CDMS collaboration. We find that isospin-symmetric couplings are severely
constrained both by XENON100 and CDMS bounds, and that isospin-violating
couplings are still possible at the lowest energies, while the tension of the
higher energy CoGeNT bins with the CDMS modulation constraint remains. We find
the CRESST II signal is not compatible with the modulation signals of DAMA and
CoGeNT.
