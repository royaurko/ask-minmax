We analyze velocity dispersion profiles for the Draco and Ursa Minor (UMi)
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies based on published and new Keck HIRES spectra
for stars in the outer UMi field. Washington+DDO51 filter photometric catalogs
provide additional leverage on membership of individual stars, and beyond 0.5
King limiting radii (R_lim) identify bona fide dSph members up to 4.5 times
more efficiently than simple color-magnitude diagram selections. Previously
reported ``cold populations'' R_lim are not obvious in the data and appear only
with particular binning; more or less constant and platykurtic dispersion
profiles are characteristic of these dSphs to large radii. We report discovery
of UMi stars to at least 2.7 R_lim (i.e.,210 arcmin or 4 kpc). Even with
conservative assumptions, a UMi mass of M > 4.9 x 10^8 M_(sun) is required to
bind these stars, implying an unlikely global mass-to-light ratio of M/L > 900
(M/L)_(sun). We conclude that we have found stars tidally stripped from UMi.
