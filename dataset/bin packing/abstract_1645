We give a quiver representation theoretic interpretation of generalized
cluster complexes defined by Fomin and Reading.
  By using $d-$cluster categories which are defined by Keller as triangulated
orbit categories of (bounded) derived categories of representations of valued
quivers, we define a $d-$compatibility degree $(-||-)$ on any pair of
``colored'' almost positive real Schur roots which generalizes previous
definitions on the non-colored case, and call two such roots compatible
provided the $d-$compatibility degree of them is zero. Associated to the root
system $\Phi$ corresponding to the valued quiver, by using this compatibility
relation, we define a simplicial complex which has colored almost positive real
Schur roots as vertices and $d-$compatible subsets as simplicies. If the valued
quiver is an alternating quiver of a Dynkin diagram, then this complex is the
generalized cluster complex defined by Fomin and Reading.
