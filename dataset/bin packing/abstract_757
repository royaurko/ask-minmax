We present a solution to the long outstanding meter barrier problem in planet
formation theory. As solids spiral inward due to aerodynamic drag, they will
enter disk regions that are characterized by high temperatures, densities, and
pressures. High partial pressures of rock vapor can suppress solid evaporation,
and promote collisions between partially molten solids, allowing rapid growth.
This process should be ubiquitous in planet-forming disks, which may be
evidenced by the abundant class of Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets
(STIPs) discovered by the NASA Kepler mission.
