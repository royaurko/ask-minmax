In this paper, we compute holographically the two-point and three-point
functions of giant gravitons with open strings. We consider the maximal giant
graviton in $S^5$ and the string configurations corresponding to the ground
states of Z=0 and Y=0 open spin chain, and the spinning string in AdS$_5$
corresponding to the derivative type impurities in Y=0 or Z=0 open spin chain
as well. We treat the D-brane and open string contribution separately and find
the corresponding D3-brane and string configurations in bulk which connect the
composite operators at the AdS$_5$ boundary. We apply a new prescription to
treat the string state contribution and find agreements for the two-point
functions. For the three-point functions of two giant gravitons with open
strings and one certain half-BPS chiral primary operator, we find that the
D-brane contributions to structure constant are always vanishing and the open
string contribution for the Y=0 ground state is in perfect match with the
prediction in the free field limit.
