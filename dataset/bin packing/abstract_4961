We investigate the required redshift accuracy of type Ia supernova and
cluster number-count surveys in order for the redshift uncertainties not to
contribute appreciably to the dark energy parameter error budget. For the SNAP
supernova experiment, we find that, without the assistance of ground-based
measurements, individual supernova redshifts would need to be determined to
about 0.002 or better, which is a challenging but feasible requirement for a
low-resolution spectrograph. However, we find that accurate redshifts for z<0.1
supernovae, obtained with ground-based experiments, are sufficient to immunize
the results against even relatively large redshift errors at high z. For the
future cluster number-count surveys such as the South Pole Telescope, Planck or
DUET, we find that the purely statistical error in photometric redshift is less
important, and that the irreducible, systematic bias in redshift drives the
requirements. The redshift bias will have to be kept below 0.001-0.005 per
redshift bin (which is determined by the filter set), depending on the sky
coverage and details of the definition of the minimal mass of the survey.
Furthermore, we find that X-ray surveys have a more stringent required redshift
accuracy than Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect surveys since they use a shorter
lever arm in redshift; conversely, SZ surveys benefit from their high redshift
reach only so long as some redshift information is available for distant (z>1)
clusters.
