We explore adhesive loose packings of dry small spherical particles of
micrometer size using 3D discrete-element simulations with adhesive contact
mechanics. A dimensionless adhesion parameter ($Ad$) successfully combines the
effects of particle velocities, sizes and the work of adhesion, identifying a
universal regime of adhesive packings for $Ad>1$. The structural properties of
the packings in this regime are well described by an ensemble approach based on
a coarse-grained volume function that includes correlations between bulk and
contact spheres. Our theoretical and numerical results predict: (i) An equation
of state for adhesive loose packings that appears as a continuation from the
frictionless random close packing (RCP) point in the jamming phase diagram;
(ii) The existence of a maximal loose packing point at the coordination number
$Z=2$ and packing fraction $\phi=1/2^{3}$. Our results highlight that adhesion
leads to a universal packing regime at packing fractions much smaller than the
random loose packing, which can be described within a statistical mechanical
framework. We present a general phase diagram of jammed matter comprising
frictionless, frictional, adhesive as well as non-spherical particles,
providing a classification of packings in terms of their continuation from the
spherical frictionless RCP.
