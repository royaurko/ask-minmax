We demonstrate unexpectedly strong second harmonic generation (SHG) in Argon
gas by use of spatiotemporally focused (SF) femtosecond laser pulses. The
resulting SHG by the SF scheme at a 75 cm distance shows a significantly
enhanced efficiency than that achieved with conventional focusing scheme, which
offers a new promising possibility for standoff applications. Our theoretical
calculations reasonably reproduce the experimental observations, which indicate
that the observed SHG mainly originates from the gradient of nonuniform plasma
dynamically controlled by the SF laser field.
