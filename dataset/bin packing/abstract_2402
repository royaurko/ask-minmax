In this paper the three-loop polarization functions \Pi(q^2) are calculated
for the cases of an external vector, axial-vector, scalar or pseudo-scalar
current. Results are presented for the imaginary part which directly leads to
the cross section $\sigma(e^+e^- \to Z \to hadrons)$ and to the Higgs decay
rates, respectively.
