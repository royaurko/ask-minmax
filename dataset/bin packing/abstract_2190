In this paper, we introduce a class of fractals named homogeneous sets based
on some measure versions of homogeneity, uniform perfectness and doubling. This
fractal class includes all Ahlfors-David regular sets, but most of them are
irregular in the sense that they may have different Hausdorff dimensions and
packing dimensions. Using Moran sets as main tool, we study the dimensions,
bilipschitz embedding and quasi-Lipschitz equivalence of homogeneous fractals.
