We study the cluster automorphism group $Aut(\mathcal{A})$ of a coefficient
free cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of finite type. A cluster automorphism of
$\mathcal{A}$ is a permutation of the cluster variable set $\mathscr{X}$ that
is compatible with cluster mutations. We show that, on the one hand, by the
well-known correspondence between $\mathscr{X}$ and the almost positive root
system $\Phi_{\geq -1}$ of the corresponding Dynkin type, the piecewise-linear
transformations $\tau_+$ and $\tau_-$ on $\Phi_{\geq -1}$ induce cluster
automorphisms $f_+$ and $f_-$ of $\mathcal{A}$ respectively; on the other hand,
excepting type $D_{2n},(n\geqslant 2)$, all the cluster automorphisms of
$\mathcal{A}$ are compositions of $f_+$ and $f_-$. For a cluster algebra of
type $D_{2n},(n\geqslant 2)$, there exists exceptional cluster automorphism
induced by a permutation of negative simple roots in $\Phi_{\geq -1}$, which is
not a composition of $\tau_+$ and $\tau_-$. By using these results and folding
a simply laced cluster algebra, we compute the cluster automorphism group for a
non-simply laced finite type cluster algebra. As an application, we show that
$Aut(\mathcal{A})$ is isomorphic to the cluster automorphism group of the
$FZ$-universal cluster algebra of $\mathcal{A}$.
