We study perturbations of black holes absorbing dark energy. Due to the
accretion of dark energy, the black hole mass changes. We observe distinct
perturbation behaviors for absorption of different forms of dark energy into
the black holes. This provides the possibility of extracting information
whether dark energy lies above or below the cosmological constant boundary
$w=-1$. In particular, we find in the late time tail analysis that, differently
from the other dark energy models, the accretion of phantom energy exhibits a
growing mode in the perturbation tail. The instability behavior found in this
work is consistent with the Big Rip scenario, in which all of the bound objects
are torn apart with the presence of the phantom dark energy.
