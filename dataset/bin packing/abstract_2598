In distributed multilevel diversity coding, $K$ correlated sources (each with
$K$ components) are encoded in a distributed manner such that, given the
outputs from any $\alpha$ encoders, the decoder can reconstruct the first
$\alpha$ components of each of the corresponding $\alpha$ sources. For this
problem, the optimality of a multilayer Slepian-Wolf coding scheme based on
binning and superposition is established when $K\leq 3$. The same conclusion is
shown to hold for general $K$ under a certain symmetry condition, which
generalizes a celebrated result by Yeung and Zhang.
