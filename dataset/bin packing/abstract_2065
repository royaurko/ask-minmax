We use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study epitaxial
graphene grown on a C-face 4H-SiC(000-1) substrate. The results reveal amazing
nano-objects at the graphene/SiC interface leading to electronic interface
states. Their height profiles suggest that these objects are made of packed
carbon nanotubes confined vertically and forming mesas at the SiC surface. We
also find nano-cracks covered by the graphene layer that, surprisingly, is not
broken, with no electronic interface state. Therefore, unlike the above
nano-objects, these cracks should not affect the carrier mobility.
