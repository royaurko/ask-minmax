We report analysis of transit spectroscopy of the extrasolar planets WASP-12
b, WASP-17 b, and WASP-19 b using the Wide Field Camera 3 on the HST. We
analyze the data for a single transit for each planet using a strategy similar
in certain aspects to the techniques used by Berta et al. (2012), but we extend
their methodology to allow us to correct for channel- or wavelength-dependent
instrumental effects by utilizing the band-integrated time series and
measurements of the drift of the spectrum on the detector over time. We achieve
almost photon-limited results for individual spectral bins, but the
uncertainties in the transit depth for the the band-integrated data are
exacerbated by the uneven sampling of the light curve imposed by the orbital
phasing of HST's observations. Our final transit spectra for all three objects
are consistent with the presence of a broad absorption feature at 1.4 microns
potentially due to water. However, the amplitude of the absorption is less than
that expected based on previous observations with Spitzer, possibly due to
hazes absorbing in the NIR or non-solar compositions. The degeneracy of models
with different compositions and temperature structures combined with the low
amplitude of any features in the data preclude our ability to place unambiguous
constraints on the atmospheric composition without additional observations with
WFC3 to improve the S/N and/or a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis.
