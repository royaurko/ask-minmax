We have recently developed a mean-field theory to estimate the packing
fraction of non-spherical particles [A. Baule et al., Nature Commun. (2013)].
The central quantity in this framework is the Voronoi excluded volume, which
generalizes the standard hard-core excluded volume appearing in Onsager's
theory. The Voronoi excluded volume is defined from an exclusion condition for
the Voronoi boundary between two particles, which is usually not tractable
analytically. Here, we show how the technical difficulties in calculating the
Voronoi boundary can be overcome for lens-shaped particles and spherocylinders,
two standard prolate and oblate shapes with rotational symmetry. By decomposing
these shapes into unions and intersections of spheres analytical expressions
can be obtained.
