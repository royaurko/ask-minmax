We calculate the normal modes of vibration in jammed sphere packings to
obtain the energy diffusivity, a spectral measure of transport. At the boson
peak frequency, we find an Ioffe-Regel crossover from a diffusivity that drops
rapidly with frequency to one that is nearly frequency-independent. This
crossover frequency shifts to zero as the system is decompressed towards the
jamming transition, providing unambiguous evidence of a regime in frequency of
nearly constant diffusivity. Such a regime, postulated to exist in glasses to
explain the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, therefore
appears to arise from properties of the jamming transition.
