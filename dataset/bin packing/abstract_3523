We investigate the connection between the geometry of Favoured Local
Structures (FLS) in liquids and the associated liquid and solid properties. We
introduce a lattice spin model - the FLS model on a face-centered cubic lattice
- where this geometry can be arbitrarily chosen among a discrete set of 115
possible FLS. We find crystalline groundstates for all choices of a single FLS.
Sampling all possible FLS's, we identify the following trends: i) low symmetry
FLS's produce larger crystal unit cells but not necessarily higher energy
groundstates, ii) chiral FLS's exhibit to peculiarly poor packing properties,
iii) accumulation of FLS's in supercooled liquids is linked to large crystal
unit cells, and iv) low symmetry FLS's tend to find metastable structures on
cooling.
