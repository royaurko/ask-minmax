We investigate Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of metal oxide on pristine and
functionalized graphene. On pristine graphene, ALD coating can only actively
grow on edges and defect sites, where dangling bonds or surface groups react
with ALD precursors. This affords a simple method to decorate and probe single
defect sites in graphene planes. We used perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA)
to functionalize graphene surface and selectively introduced densely packed
surface groups on graphene. Uniform ultrathin ALD coating on PTCA graphene was
achieved over large area. The functionalization method could be used to
integrate ultrathin high-k dielectrics in future graphene electronics.
