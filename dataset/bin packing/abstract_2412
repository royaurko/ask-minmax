We complete the one loop renormalization of the HQET lagrangian at O(1/m_Q^3)
including four fermion operators with two heavy and two light quark fields in
the operator basis. It is shown that as a consequence the short distance
coefficients of the operators bilinear in the heavy quark field receive
nontrivial corrections.
