Dense hard-particle packings are intimately related to the structure of
low-temperature phases of matter and are useful models of heterogeneous
materials and granular media. Most studies of the densest packings in three
dimensions have considered spherical shapes, and it is only more recently that
nonspherical shapes (e.g., ellipsoids) have been investigated. Superballs
(whose shapes are defined by |x1|^2p + |x2|^2p + |x3|^2p <= 1) provide a
versatile family of convex particles (p >= 0.5) with both cubic- and
octahedral-like shapes as well as concave particles (0 < p < 0.5) with
octahedral-like shapes. In this paper, we provide analytical constructions for
the densest known superball packings for all convex and concave cases. The
candidate maximally dense packings are certain families of Bravais lattice
packings. The maximal packing density as a function of p is nonanalytic at the
sphere-point (p = 1) and increases dramatically as p moves away from unity. The
packing characteristics determined by the broken rotational symmetry of
superballs are similar to but richer than their two-dimensional "superdisk"
counterparts, and are distinctly different from that of ellipsoid packings. Our
candidate optimal superball packings provide a starting point to quantify the
equilibrium phase behavior of superball systems, which should deepen our
understanding of the statistical thermodynamics of nonspherical-particle
systems.
