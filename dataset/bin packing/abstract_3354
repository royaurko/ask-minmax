In the deformation of layered materials such as geological strata, or stacks
of paper, mechanical properties compete with the geometry of layering. Smooth,
rounded corners lead to voids between the layers, while close packing of the
layers results in geometrically-induced curvature singularities. When voids are
penalized by external pressure, the system is forced to trade off these
competing effects, leading to sometimes striking periodic patterns.
  In this paper we construct a simple model of geometrically nonlinear
multi-layered structures under axial loading and pressure confinement, with
non-interpenetration conditions separating the layers. Energy minimizers are
characterized as solutions of a set of fourth-order nonlinear differential
equations with contact-force Lagrange multipliers, or equivalently of a
fourth-order free-boundary problem. We numerically investigate the solutions of
this free boundary problem, and compare them with the periodic solutions
observed experimentally.
