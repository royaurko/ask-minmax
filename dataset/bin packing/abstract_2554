The Richardson-Lucy unfolding approach is simple and excellently performing.
It efficiently suppresses artificial high frequency contributions and permits
to introduce known features of the true distribution. An algorithm to fix the
number of iterations to an optimal value has been developed and tested with
five different types of distributions, with different event numbers and with
different binnings. The influence of the starting distribution has been
studied. A simple way to document the unfolding result such that it can be
compared to theoretical predictions is proposed.
