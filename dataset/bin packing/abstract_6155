The neutral current e+/-p cross section has been measured up to values of
Bjorken x of approximately 1 with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated
luminosity of 187 inv. pb of e-p and 142 inv. pb of e+p collisions at sqrt(s) =
318GeV. Differential cross sections in x and Q2, the exchanged boson
virtuality, are presented for Q2 geq 725GeV2. An improved reconstruction method
and greatly increased amount of data allows a finer binning in the high-x
region of the neutral current cross section and leads to a measurement with
much improved precision compared to a similar earlier analysis. The
measurements are compared to Standard Model expectations based on a variety of
recent parton distribution functions.
