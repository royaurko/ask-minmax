Using the published Kamiokande binned data for sub-GeV and multi-GeV
atmospheric neutrinos, we have searched for the optimum set of three flavor
neutrino oscillation parameters within the constraints of reactor experiments.
It is found that chi^2 is minimized for (Delta m_{21}^2, Delta m_{32}^2,
theta_{12}, theta_{13}, theta_{23}) = (7.4x10^{-1} eV^2, 2.6x 10^{-2} eV^2, 2
deg, 3 deg, 45 deg) and (2.6x 10^{-2} eV^2, 7.4x10^{-1} eV^2, 0 deg, 87 deg, 46
deg) with chi_{min}^2 = 87.8 (76%CL). The sets of parameters which are
suggested by the two flavor analysis turn out to be close to the minimum
(0.2sigma).
