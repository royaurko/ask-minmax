Differential cross sections for the reaction $\gamma p \to K^{*0} \Sigma^+$
are presented at nine bins in photon energy in the range from 1.7 to 3.0 GeV.
The \kstar was detected by its decay products, $K^+\pi^-$, in the CLAS detector
at Jefferson Lab. These data are the first \kstar photoproduction cross
sections ever published over a broad range of angles. Comparison with a
theoretical model based on the vector and tensor $K^*$-quark couplings shows
good agreement with the data in general, after adjusting the model's two
parameters in a fit to our data. Disagreement between the data at forward
angles and the global angle-energy fit to the model suggests that the role of
scalar $\kappa$ meson exchange in $t$-channel diagrams should be investigated.
