We describe the first nearly linear-time approximation algorithms for
explicitly given mixed packing/covering linear programs, and for (non-metric)
fractional facility location. We also describe the first parallel algorithms
requiring only near-linear total work and finishing in polylog time. The
algorithms compute $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solutions in time (and work)
$O^*(N/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the number of non-zeros in the constraint
matrix. For facility location, $N$ is the number of eligible client/facility
pairs.
