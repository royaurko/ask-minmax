The magnetic properties of densely packed magnetic nanoparticles (MNP)
assemblies are investigated from Monte Carlo simulations. The case of iron
oxide nanoparticles is considered as a typical example of MNP. The main focus
is put on particle size and size polydispersity influences on the magnetization
curve. The particles are modeled as uniformly magnetized spheres isolated one
from each other by a non magnetic layer representing the organic coating. A
comparison with recent experimental results on $\gamma-$Fe$_2$O$_3$ powder
samples differing by their size is given.
