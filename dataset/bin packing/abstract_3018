It is shown that the form factors in the semileptonic decay of ground state
heavy mesons to light pseudoscalar mesons are dominated by the vector meson
pole at all momentum transfers. First, the general approaches to modeling form
factors in terms of quark model, pole dominance, or hybrid shapes are reviewed.
It is then shown that in the combined limits of heavy quarks, chiral symmetry,
and large~$\Nc$ the form factor is precisely pole-dominated. It is also shown
that in a two-dimensional QCD model pole-dominance occurs for any heavy quark
mass. Corrections to this limit are discussed and, to illustrate the nature of
the approximations, an explicit exact calculation of the approach to the limit
in a two-dimensional model is given.
