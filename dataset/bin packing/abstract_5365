We report Gemini-North GMOS observations of the inflated hot Jupiter
HAT-P-32b during two primary transits. We simultaneously observed two
comparison stars and used differential spectro-photometry to produce
multi-wavelength light curves. 'White' light curves and 29 'spectral' light
curves were extracted for each transit and analysed to refine the system
parameters and produce transmission spectra from 520-930nm in ~14nm bins. The
light curves contain time-varying white noise as well as time-correlated noise,
and we used a Gaussian process model to fit this complex noise model. Common
mode corrections derived from the white light curve fits were applied to the
spectral light curves which significantly improved our precision, reaching
typical uncertainties in the transit depth of ~2x10^-4, corresponding to about
half a pressure scale height. The low resolution transmission spectra are
consistent with a featureless model, and we can confidently rule out broad
features larger than about one scale height. The absence of Na/K wings or
prominent TiO/VO features is most easily explained by grey absorption from
clouds in the upper atmosphere, masking the spectral features. However, we
cannot confidently rule out clear atmosphere models with low abundances (~10^-3
solar) of TiO, VO or even metal hydrides masking the Na and K wings. A smaller
scale height or ionisation could also contribute to muted spectral features,
but alone are unable to to account for the absence of features reported here.
