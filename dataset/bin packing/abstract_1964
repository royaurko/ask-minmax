Explicit expressions for anharmonic contributions to the thermodynamic
properties with allowance for higher-order phonon-phonon interactions for
closed-packed crystals are given, and the calculations for some fcc metals near
the melting (Ir, Rh) and martensite phase transition (Ca, Sr) points are
carried out. A detailed comparison of anharmonic and electron contributions to
the heat capacity of these metals is carried out. The computational results for
high-temperature heat capacity agree well with the available experimental data.
