Top quark polarization in $e^+e^-$ annihilation into $t\bar t$ is calculated
for linearly polarized beams. The Green function formalism is applied to this
reaction near threshold. The Lippmann--Schwinger equations for the $S$-wave and
$P$-wave Green functions are solved numerically for the QCD chromostatic
potential given by the two-loop formula for large momentum transfer and
Richardson's ansatz for intermediate and small momenta. $S$-$P$--wave
interference contributes to all components of the top quark polarization
vector. Rescattering of the decay products is considered. The mean values
$\langle n \ell \rangle$ of the charged lepton four-momentum projections on
appropriately chosen directions $n$ in semileptonic top decays are proposed as
experimentally observable quantities sensitive to top quark polarization. The
results for $\langle n \ell \rangle$ are obtained including $S$-$P$--wave
interference and rescattering of the decay products. It is demonstrated that
for the longitudinally polarized electron beam a highly polarized sample of top
quarks can be produced.
