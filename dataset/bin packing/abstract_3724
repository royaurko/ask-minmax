We construct eigenspectra from the DR1 quasars in the SDSS using the
Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) transform (or Principal Component Analysis, PCA) in
different redshift and luminosity bins. We find that the quasar spectra can be
classified, by the first two eigenspectra, into a continuous sequence in the
variation of the spectral slope. We also find a dependence on redshift and
luminosity in the eigencoefficients. The dominant redshift effect is the
evolution of the blended Fe~II emission (optical) and the Balmer continuum (the
``small-bump'', $\lambda_{rest} \approx 2000-4000$\AA), while the luminosity
effect is related to the Baldwin effect. Correlations among several major broad
emission lines are found, including the well-known ``Eigenvector-1''.
