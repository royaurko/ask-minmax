We investigate the influence of confinement on phase separation in
colloid-polymer mixtures. To describe the particle interactions, the
colloid-polymer model of Asakura and Oosawa [J. Chem. Phys. 22, 1255 (1954)] is
used. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations are then applied to this model
confined between two parallel hard walls, separated by a distance D=5 colloid
diameters. We focus on the critical regime of the phase separation and look for
signs of crossover from three-dimensional (3D) Ising to two-dimensional (2D)
Ising universality. To extract the critical behavior, finite size scaling
techniques are used, including the recently proposed algorithm of Kim et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 065701 (2003)]. Our results point to effective critical
exponents that differ profoundly from 3D Ising values, and that are already
very close to 2D Ising values. In particular, we observe that the critical
exponent beta of the order parameter in the confined system is smaller than in
3D bulk, yielding a flatter binodal. Our results also show an increase in the
critical colloid packing fraction in the confined system with respect to the
bulk. The latter seems consistent with theoretical expectations, although
subtleties due to singularities in the critical behavior of the coexistence
diameter cannot be ruled out.
