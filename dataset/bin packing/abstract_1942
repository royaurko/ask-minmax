The Onsager reaction-field (ORF) theory is extended so that it applies to any
three-dimensional Bravais lattice with a basis. The ORF calculation is used to
predict the critical temperature for classical Ising, XY, and Heisenberg
magnetic models, in particular, on diamond and hexagonal close packed lattices.
Results are compared with series extrapolations and other theoretical
approaches where available. For the hcp lattice the ORF calculation is seen to
be exactly equivalent to a Green's function approach.
