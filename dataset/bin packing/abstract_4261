In this paper, the cosmological dynamics of a modified holographic dark
energy which is derived from the UV/IR duality by considering the black hole
mass in higher dimensions as UV cutoff, is investigated in
Dvali-Gabadaze-Porrati (DGP) brane world model. We choose Hubble horizon and
future event horizon as IR cutoff respectively. And the two branches of the DGP
model are both taken into account. When Hubble horizon is considered as IR
cutoff, the modified holographic dark energy (HDE) behaves like an effect dark
energy that modification of gravity in pure DGP brane world model acts and it
can drive the expansion of the universe speed up at late time in $\epsilon=-1$
branch which in pure DGP model can not undergo an accelerating phase. When
future event horizon acts as IR cutoff, the equation of state parameter of the
modified HDE can cross the phantom divide.
