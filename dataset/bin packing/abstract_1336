Atomic-resolution electron microscope images show that a quasicrystal is a
quasiperiodic packing of clusters. The outer atomic shells of multi-shell
clusters occuring in quasicrystals are highly symmetric and rather robust, but
some structural disorder may be present around the core. The models describing
quasicrystal structure are quasiperiodic lattices containing two or more unit
cells decorated by atomic clusters. We show that a modified version of the
strip projection method may become an alternate way to obtain useful models.
