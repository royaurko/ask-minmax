We present numerical simulations of acoustic wave propagation in confined
granular systems consisting of particles interacting with the three-dimensional
Hertz-Mindlin force law. The response to a short mechanical excitation on one
side of the system is found to be a propagating coherent wavefront followed by
random oscillations made of multiply scattered waves. We find that the coherent
wavefront is insensitive to details of the packing: force chains do not play an
important role in determining this wavefront. The coherent wave propagates
linearly in time, and its amplitude and width depend as a power law on
distance, while its velocity is roughly compatible with the predictions of
macroscopic elasticity. As there is at present no theory for the broadening and
decay of the coherent wave, we numerically and analytically study
pulse-propagation in a one-dimensional chain of identical elastic balls. The
results for the broadening and decay exponents of this system differ
significantly from those of the random packings. In all our simulations, the
speed of the coherent wavefront scales with pressure as $p^{1/6}$; we compare
this result with experimental data on various granular systems where deviations
from the $p^{1/6}$ behavior are seen. We briefly discuss the eigenmodes of the
system and effects of damping are investigated as well.
