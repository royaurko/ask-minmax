In the development of multiscale biological models it is crucial to establish
a connection between discrete microscopic or mesoscopic stochastic models and
macroscopic continuous descriptions based on cellular density. In this paper a
continuous limit of a two-dimensional Cellular Potts Model (CPM) with excluded
volume is derived, describing cells moving in a medium and reacting to each
other through both direct contact and long range chemotaxis. The continuous
macroscopic model is obtained as a Fokker-Planck equation describing evolution
of the cell probability density function. All coefficients of the general
macroscopic model are derived from parameters of the CPM and a very good
agreement is demonstrated between CPM Monte Carlo simulations and numerical
solution of the macroscopic model. It is also shown that in the absence of
contact cell-cell interactions, the obtained model reduces to the classical
macroscopic Keller-Segel model. General multiscale approach is demonstrated by
simulating spongy bone formation from loosely packed mesenchyme via the
intramembranous route suggesting that self-organizing physical mechanisms can
account for this developmental process.
