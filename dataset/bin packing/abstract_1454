In this work we propose a heuristic algorithm for the layout optimization for
disks installed in a rotating circular container. This is a unequal circle
packing problem with additional balance constraints. It proved to be an NP-hard
problem, which justifies heuristic methods for its resolution. The main feature
of our heuristic is based on the selection of the next circle to be placed
inside the container according to the position of the system's center of mass.
Our approach has been tested on a series of instances up to 55 circles and
compared with the literature. Computational results show good performance in
terms of solution quality and computational time for the proposed algorithm.
