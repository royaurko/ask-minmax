We experimentally demonstrated a spectral imaging scheme with dual compressed
sensing. With the dimensions of spectral and spatial information both
compressed, the spectral image of a colored object can be obtained with only a
single point detector. The effect of spatial and spectral modulation numbers on
the imaging quality is also analyzed. Our scheme provides a stable, highly
consistent approach of spectral imaging.
