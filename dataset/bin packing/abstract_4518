Super-elastic collision is an abnormal collisional process, in which some
particular mechanisms cause the kinetic energy of the system increasing. Most
studies in this aspect focus on solid-like objects, but they rarely consider
gases or liquids, as the collision of the latter is primarily a mixing process.
With cross-field diffusion being effectively prohibited, magnetized plasmoids
are different from ordinary gases. But it remains unclear how they act during a
collision. Here we present the global picture of a unique collision between two
coronal mass ejections in the heliosphere, which are the largest magnetized
plasmoids erupting from the Sun. Our analysis for the first time reveals that
these two magnetized plasmoids collided like solid-like objects with a 73%
likelihood of being super-elastic. Their total kinetic energy surprisingly
increased by about 6.6% through the collision, which significantly influenced
the dynamics of the plasmoids.
