Linear alkyl benzene (LAB) will be used as the solvent of a liquid
scintillator mixture for the JUNO antineutrino experiment in the near future.
Its light absorption property should therefore be understood prior to its
effective use in the experiment. Attenuation length measurements at a light
wavelength of 430 nm have been performed on samples of LAB prepared for the
purpose of the JUNO experiment. Inorganic impurities in LAB have also been
studied for their possibilities of light absorption in our wavelength of
interest. In view of a tentative plan by the JUNO collaboration to utilize
neutron capture with hydrogen in the detector, we have also presented in this
work, a study on the carbon-hydrogen ratio and the relationship thereof with
the attenuation length of the samples.
