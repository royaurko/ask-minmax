We have developed an efficient cryogenic system with heat exchange and
associated gas purification system, as a prototype for the XENON1T experiment.
The XENON1T detector will use about 3 ton of liquid xenon (LXe) at a
temperature of 175K as target and detection medium for a dark matter search. In
this paper we report results on the cryogenic system performance focusing on
the dynamics of the gas circulation-purification through a heated getter, at
flow rates above 50 Standard Liter per Minute (SLPM). A maximum flow of 114
SLPM has been achieved, and using two heat exchangers in parallel, a heat
exchange efficiency better than 96% has been measured.
