The ALICE collaboration reports the measurement of the inclusive J/psi yield
as a function of charged particle pseudorapidity density dN_{ch}/deta in pp
collisions at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV at the LHC. J/psi particles are detected for p_t
> 0, in the rapidity interval |y| < 0.9 via decay into e+e-, and in the
interval 2.5 < y < 4.0 via decay into mu+mu- pairs. An approximately linear
increase of the J/psi yields normalized to their event average
(dN_{J/psi}/dy)/<dN_{J/psi}/dy> with (dN_{ch}/deta)/<dN_{ch}/deta> is observed
in both rapidity ranges, where dN_{ch}/deta is measured within |eta| < 1 and
p_t > 0. In the highest multiplicity interval with <dN_{ch}/deta(bin)> = 24.1,
corresponding to four times the minimum bias multiplicity density, an
enhancement relative to the minimum bias J/psi yield by a factor of about 5 at
2.5 < y < 4 (8 at |y| < 0.9) is observed.
