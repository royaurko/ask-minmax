Higher-dimensional orthogonal packing problems have a wide range of practical
applications, including packing, cutting, and scheduling. In the context of a
branch-and-bound framework for solving these packing problems to optimality, it
is of crucial importance to have good and easy bounds for an optimal solution.
Previous efforts have produced a number of special classes of such bounds.
Unfortunately, some of these bounds are somewhat complicated and hard to
generalize. We present a new approach for obtaining classes of lower bounds for
higher-dimensional packing problems; our bounds improve and simplify several
well-known bounds from previous literature. In addition, our approach provides
an easy framework for proving correctness of new bounds.
