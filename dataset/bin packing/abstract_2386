We construct an effective Lagrangian for the hadronic decays of a heavy
excited $s$-wave-spin-one quarkonium into its ground state. We show that
reasonable fits to the measured invariant mass spectra in the $J/\psi$ and
$\Upsilon$ systems can be obtained working in the chiral limit. The mass
dependence of the various terms in the Lagrangian is discussed on the basis of
a quark model.
