X-ray observations were used to examine the complex temperature structure of
Abell 85, a cool-core galaxy cluster. Temperature features can provide evidence
of merging events which shock heat the intracluster gas. Temperature maps were
made from both \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} obervations. The
combination of a new, long-exposure \textit{XMM} observation and an improved
temperature map binning technique produced the highest fidelity temperature
maps of A85 to date. Hot regions were detected near the subclusters to the
South and Southwest in both the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM} temperature
maps. The presence of these structures implies A85 is not relaxed. The hot
regions may indicate the presence of shocks. The Mach numbers were estimated to
be $\sim$1.9 at the locations of the hot spots. Observational effects will tend
to systematically reduce temperature jumps, so the measured Mach numbers are
likely underestimated. Neither temperature map showed evidence for a shock in
the vicinity of the presumed radio relic near the Southwest subcluster.
However, the presence of a weak shock cannot be ruled out. There was tension
between the temperatures measured by the two instruments.
