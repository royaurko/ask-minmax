More than 25 years ago, Mueller Navelet jets were proposed as a decisive test
of BFKL dynamics at hadron colliders. We here study this process at NLL BFKL
accuracy, taking into account NLL corrections to the Green's function and to
the jet vertices. We present detailed predictions for various observables that
can be measured at LHC in ongoing experiments like ATLAS or CMS at sqrt{s}=7
TeV: the cross-section, the azimuthal correlations and the angular distribution
of these jets. For this purpose, we apply realistic kinematical cuts and
binning, and study the dependence of our results with respect to several
parameters. We then compare our results with those that can be obtained in a
fixed order NLO treatment, and propose specific observables which could
actually be used as a probe of BFKL dynamics.
