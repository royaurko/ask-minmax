In this work we study the Hausdorff dimension of measures whose weight
distribution satisfies a markov non-homogeneous property. We prove, in
particular, that the Hausdorff dimensions of this kind of measures coincide
with their lower R\'enyi dimensions (entropy). Moreover, we show that the
Tricot dimensions (packing dimension) equal the upper R\'enyi dimensions. As an
application we get a continuity property of the Hausdorff dimension of the
measures, when it is seen as a function of the distributed weights under the
$\ell^{\infty}$ norm.
