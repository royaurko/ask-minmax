The phenomenon of CP violation in the B system and strategies for extracting
CKM phases are reviewed. We focus both on general aspects and on some recent
developments including CP-violating asymmetries in B_d decays, the B_s system
in light of a possible width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$, charged B decays, and
SU(3) relations among certain transition amplitudes. In order to describe the
relevant non-leptonic B decays, low energy effective Hamiltonians calculated
beyond the leading logarithmic approximation are used. Special emphasis is
given to the role of electroweak penguin operators in such transitions. These
effects are analyzed both within a general framework and more specifically in
view of the theoretical cleanliness of methods to determine CKM phases.
Strategies for obtaining insights into the world of electroweak penguins are
discussed.
