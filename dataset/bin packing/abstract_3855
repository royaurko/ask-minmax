We illustrate the exotic SU(3) baryon sub-multiplets in the SU(4) baryon
multiplets predicted from the flavor SU(4) collective-coordinate quantization,
and investigate the exotic states with charm number $C=\pm1$ up to leading
order of $1/N_c$ under chiral $SU(3)_L\times SU(3)_R$ symmetry and the heavy
quark limit from bound state approach. We find that there exist the
$\bar{15}$-plets and 24-plets with C=1 and the $\bar{6}$-plets, 15-plets and
$15^{\prime}$-plets with $C=-1$ bounded in this approach, qualitatively
consistent with predictions from the flavor SU(4) collective-coordinate
quantization. By fitting one unique parameter of leading SU(3) flavor symmetry
breaking term with the mass difference between $\Xi_c$ and $\Sigma_c$ and up to
$O(m_Q^0N_c^{-1})$, we give all the average masses of baryons in $\bar{6}$-plet
and 15-plet. Several general relations of these masses without any parameter
are also introduced.
