Analyzing data from GLAST's Large Area Telescope (LAT) will require
sophisticated techniques. The PSF and effective area are functions of both
photon energy and the position in the field-of-view. During most of the mission
the observatory will survey the sky continuously and thus the LAT will detect
each count from a source at a different detector orientation; each count
requires its own response function! The likelihood as a function of celestial
position and photon energy will be the foundation of the standard analysis
techniques. However the 20 MeV-300 GeV emission at the time of the ~100 keV
burst emission (timescale of ~10 s) can be isolated and analyzed because
essentially no non-burst counts are expected within a PSF radius of the burst
location during the burst. Both binned and unbinned (in energy) spectral
fitting will be possible. Longer timescale afterglow emission will require the
likelihood analysis that will be used for persistent sources.
