We present analysis of the asteroid surface density distribution of main belt
asteroids (mean perihelion $\Delta \simeq 2.404$ AU) in five ecliptic latitude
fields, $-17 \gtsimeq \beta(\degr) \ltsimeq +15$, derived from deep
\textit{Large Binocular Telescope} (LBT) $V-$band (85% completeness limit $V =
21.3$ mag) and \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope} IRAC 8.0 \micron (80%
completeness limit $\sim 103 \mu$Jy) fields enabling us to probe the 0.5--1.0
km diameter asteroid population. We discovered 58 new asteroids in the optical
survey as well as 41 new bodies in the \textit{Spitzer} fields. The derived
power law slopes of the number of asteroids per square degree are similar
within each $\sim 5$\degr{} ecliptic latitude bin with a mean value of $ -0.111
\pm 0.077$. For the 23 known asteroids detected in all four IRAC channels mean
albedos range from $0.24 \pm 0.07$ to $0.10 \pm 0.05$. No low albedo asteroids
($p_{V}$ $\ltsimeq$ 0.1) were detected in the \textit{Spitzer} FLS fields,
whereas in the SWIRE fields they are frequent. The SWIRE data clearly samples
asteroids in the middle and outer belts providing the first estimates of these
km-sized asteroids' albedos. Our observed asteroid number densities at optical
wavelengths are generally consistent with those derived from the Standard
Asteroid Model within the ecliptic plane. However, we find an over density at
$\beta \gtsimeq 5$\degr{} in our optical fields, while the infrared number
densities are under dense by factors of 2 to 3 at all ecliptic latitudes.
