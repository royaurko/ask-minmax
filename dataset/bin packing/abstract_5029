We recalculate masses and widths of anti-decuplet baryons in the case of
positive parity from chiral soliton models, provided that the member
$\Xi_{3/2}$ of the anti-decuplet has a mass 1.86 GeV as reported recently.
Calculations show that there are no convincing candidates for the nonexotic
members of the anti-decuplet available in the baryon listings. Up to the
leading order of $m_s$ and 1/$N_c$, the width formula for the decay of the
anti-decuplet baryons to the octet depends only on SU(3) symmetry
model-independently, except the coupling constant. Similarly we give a width
formula for the decay of negative parity baryons belong to certain SU(3) baryon
multiplet by pure symmetry consideration. By this formula, we find that if we
have an anti-decuplet with negative parity and that the masses are the same as
those given by chiral soltion models, the identification of N(1650) as
$N_{\bar{10}}$ are inconsistent with experiments for $N(1650)\to N\pi$ while
the widths agree with other two decay channels involving strangeness. And
$\Sigma(1750)$ seems to be a reasonable candidate for $\Sigma_{\bar{10}}$.
