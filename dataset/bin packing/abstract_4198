Be X-ray binaries are among the best known transient high-energy sources.
Their outbursts are commonly classified into a simple scheme of 'normal' and
'giant' outbursts, but a closer look shows that actual outbursts do not always
follow this simple scheme. Recent data show a variety of properties, like
pre-flares, shifts of the outburst peaks with respect to the periastron,
multi-peaked outbursts etc. We present results from a systematic study of a
large number of outbursts monitored by various space missions, comparing
outburst properties and their relation to system parameters and current
theoretical understanding.
