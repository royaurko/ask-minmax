We numerically investigate the competition between phase separation and
dynamical arrest in a colloidal system interacting via a short ranged
attractive potential. Equilibrium fluid configurations are quenched at two
different temperatures below the critical temperature and followed during their
time evolution. At the lowest studied $T$, the phase separation process is
interrupted by the formation of an attractive glass in the dense phase. At the
higher $T$, no arrest is observed and the phase separation process proceeds
endless in the simulated time window. The final structure of the glass retains
memory of the interrupted phase separation process in the form of a frozen
spinodal decomposition peak, whose location and amplitude is controlled by the
average packing fraction. We also discuss the time evolution of the non
ergodicity parameter, providing evidence of a progressively decreasing
localization length on increasing the packing fraction. Finally, we confirm
that the reported results are independent on the microscopic dynamics.
