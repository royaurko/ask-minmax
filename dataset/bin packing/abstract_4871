We study the orbital architecture of multi-planet systems detected by the
Kepler transit mission using N-body simulations, focusing on the orbital
spacing between adjacent planets in systems showing four or more transiting
planets. We find that the observed spacings are tightly clustered around 12
mutual Hill radii, when transit geometry and sensitivity limits are accounted
for. In comparison, dynamical integrations reveal that the minimum spacing
required for systems of similar masses to survive dynamical instability for as
long as a billion years is, ~10 if all orbits are circular and coplanar, and
~12 if planetary orbits have eccentricities ~0.02 (a value suggested by studies
of planet transit-time-variations). This apparent coincidence, between the
observed spacing and the theoretical stability threshold, leads us to propose
that typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing, but most,
except for the widest ones, have undergone dynamical instability, and are pared
down to a more anemic version of their former selves, with fewer planets and
larger spacings. So while the high multiple systems (five or more transiting
planets) are primordial systems that remain stable, the single or double
planetary systems, abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission, may be the
descendants of more closely packed high multiple systems. If this hypothesis is
correct, we infer that the formation environment of Kepler systems should be
different from that of the terrestrial planets.
