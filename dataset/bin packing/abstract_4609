We present new observations of the prominence system on the K3 dwarf Speedy
Mic (BO Mic, HD 197890). Using an improved technique to track the absorption
features in H_alpha we find a very active prominence system with approximately
ten prominences on the observable hemisphere per rotation. From a total of 25
prominences we find an average axial distance of 2.85+/-0.54 R_* which is twice
the co-rotation radius above the stellar surface. We discuss the consequences
of these observations on the nature of the supporting magnetic structures. Two
consecutive nights, with complete phase coverage, combined with a further night
after a three night gap allow us to study the evolution of the prominence
system on two different timescales. Several of the prominences have
counterparts at similar phases on consecutive nights. During this interval many
prominences show evidence for evolution in their heights and phases of
observation. Five nights (13 rotation cycles) later we recover many prominences
at approximately the same phases. Whilst individual prominences change axial
distances or appear/re-appear from night-to-night the underlying prominence
supporting structures appear to be stable over as many as 13 stellar rotations.
