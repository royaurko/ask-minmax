Triangular fully packed loop configurations (TFPLs) emerged as auxiliary
objects in the study of fully packed loop configurations on a square (FPLs)
corresponding to link patterns with a large number of nested arches. Wieland
gyration, on the other hand, was invented to show the rotational invariance of
the numbers $A_\pi$ of FPLs corresponding to a given link pattern $\pi$. The
focus of this article is the definition and study of Wieland gyration on TFPLs.
We show that the repeated application of this gyration eventually leads to a
configuration that is left invariant. We also provide a characterization of
such stable configurations. Finally we apply our gyration to the study of TFPL
configurations, in particular giving new and simple proofs of several results.
