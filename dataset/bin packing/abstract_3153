We consider the computational complexity of producing the best possible
offspring in a crossover, given two solutions of the parents. The crossover
operators are studied on the class of Boolean linear programming problems,
where the Boolean vector of variables is used as the solution representation.
By means of efficient reductions of the optimized gene transmitting crossover
problems (OGTC) we show the polynomial solvability of the OGTC for the maximum
weight set packing problem, the minimum weight set partition problem and for
one of the versions of the simple plant location problem. We study a connection
between the OGTC for linear Boolean programming problem and the maximum weight
independent set problem on 2-colorable hypergraph and prove the NP-hardness of
several special cases of the OGTC problem in Boolean linear programming.
