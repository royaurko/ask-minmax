Large-capacity Content Addressable Memory (CAM) is a key element in a wide
variety of applications. The inevitable complexities of scaling MOS transistors
introduce a major challenge in the realization of such systems. Convergence of
disparate technologies, which are compatible with CMOS processing, may allow
extension of Moore's Law for a few more years. This paper provides a new
approach towards the design and modeling of Memristor (Memory resistor) based
Content Addressable Memory (MCAM) using a combination of memristor MOS devices
to form the core of a memory/compare logic cell that forms the building block
of the CAM architecture. The non-volatile characteristic and the nanoscale
geometry together with compatibility of the memristor with CMOS processing
technology increases the packing density, provides for new approaches towards
power management through disabling CAM blocks without loss of stored data,
reduces power dissipation, and has scope for speed improvement as the
technology matures.
