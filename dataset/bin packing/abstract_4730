We use grand canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo and discontinuous
molecular dynamics simulations to generate precise thermodynamic and kinetic
data for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid confined between smooth hard walls.
These simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the
fluid normal to the confining walls, often the primary focus of density
functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average
properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. We present one
consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation
relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid
with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid
properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense
and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters.
For this limited set of conditions, we find that "in-phase" oscillatory
deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of
the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size.
These paired thermodynamic/kinetic deviations from bulk behavior appear to
reflect the geometric packing frustration that arises when the confined space
cannot naturally accommodate an integer number of particle layers.
