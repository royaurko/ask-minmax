Let k be a subring of the field of rational functions in \alpha, s which
contains \alpha^{1}, \alpha^{-1}, s^{1}, s^{-1}, . Let M be a compact oriented
3-manifold, and let K(M) denote the Kauffman skein module of M over k. Then
K(M) is the free k-module generated by isotopy classes of framed links in M
modulo the Kauffman skein relations. In the case of k={Q}(\alpha, s), the field
of rational functions in \alpha, s, we give a basis for the Kauffman skein
module of the solid torus and a basis for the relative Kauffman skein module of
the solid torus with two points on the boundary. We then show that K(S^{1}
\times S^2) is generated by the empty link, i.e., K(S^{1} \times S^2)=k.
