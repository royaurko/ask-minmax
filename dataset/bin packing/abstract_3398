A close packed organization with circular symmetry of a large number of small
discs on a plane is obtained when the centres of the discs are distributed
according to the algorithm of phyllotaxis. We study here the distributions
obtained on surfaces of constant Gaussian curvatures, positive for the sphere
or negative for the hyperbolic plane. We examine how the properties of
homogeneity, isotropy and self-similarity typical of the distribution on the
plane, and resulting from the presence of circular grain boundaries with
quasicrystalline sequences, are affected by the curvature of the bearing
surface. The quasicrystalline sequences of the grain boundaries appear indeed
to be structural invariants, but the widths of the grains they separate vary
differently with the curvature of the surface. The self similarity of the whole
organization observed on the plane is therefore lost on the hyperbolic plane
and the sphere. The evolutions of the local order within the grains show no
differences except on the equatorial belt of the sphere where the isotropy is
decreased owing to the symmetry of this finite surface around its equator.
