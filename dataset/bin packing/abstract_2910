We study the aggregation of peptides using the discrete molecular dynamics
simulations. At temperatures above the alpha-helix melting temperature of a
single peptide, the model peptides aggregate into a multi-layer parallel
beta-sheet structure. This structure has an inter-strand distance of 0.48 nm
and an inter-sheet distance of 1.0 nm, which agree with experimental
observations. In this model, the hydrogen bond interactions give rise to the
inter-strand spacing in beta-sheets, while the Go interactions among side
chains make beta-strands parallel to each other and allow beta-sheets to pack
into layers. The aggregates also contain free edges which may allow for further
aggregation of model peptides to form elongated fibrils.
