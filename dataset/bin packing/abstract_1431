Corrugated cardboard is a sandwich used generally for packing in the form of
case. It's the most used material for packing because it can be recycled as
well as biodegradable. It's implementation in form of structure, makes the
numerical studies of the product (cases) very heavy. Analytical and numerical
models were developed to predict the mechanical behavior of the homogenized
material. Following that the studies become more simple and less expensive. An
analytical model of homogenisation based on the classical laminate theory has
been proposed in a previous studies. It predicts the elastic behavior of the
corrugated cardboard. This work purposes an extension of this model. Initially,
It will be applied at the case of corrugated cardboard composed of more than
three constituents. After that, a numerical study of bending witch take account
of the effect of shear is proposed. Finally, the anlytical model will be used
to predict the elastic and anelastic behavior of the corrugated cardboard.
