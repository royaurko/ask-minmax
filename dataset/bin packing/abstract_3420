The contributors report on the realization of ordered arrays of light-emitting
conjugated polymer nanofibers by near-field electrospinning. The fibers, made
by poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene], have diameters of
few hundreds of nanometers and emission peaked at 560 nm. The observed
blue-shift compared to the emission from reference films is attributed to
different polymer packing in the nanostructures. Optical confinement in the
fibers is also analyzed through self-waveguided emission. These results open
interesting perspectives for realizing complex and ordered architectures by
light-emitting nanofibers, such as photonic circuits, and for the precise
positioning and integration of conjugated polymer fibers into light-emitting
devices.
