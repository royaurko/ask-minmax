We seek for a contemporaneous linear transformation for a $p$-variate time
series such that the transformed series is segmented into several
lower-dimensional subseries, and those subseries are uncorrelated with each
other both contemporaneously and serially. The method may be viewed as an
extension of principal component analysis for multiple time series. Technically
it also boils down to an eigenanalysis for a positive definite matrix. When $p$
is large, an additional step is required to perform a permutation in terms of
either maximum cross-correlations or FDR based on multiple tests. The
asymptotic theory is established for both fixed $p$ and diverging $p$ when the
sample size $n$ tends to infinity, reflecting the fact that the method also
applies when the dimension $p$ is large in relation to $n$. Numerical
experiments with both simulated and real datasets indicate that the proposed
method is an effective initial step in analysing multiple time series data,
which leads to substantial dimension-reduction in modelling and forecasting
high-dimensional linear dynamical structures. The method can also be adapted to
segment multiple volatility processes.
