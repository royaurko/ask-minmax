The scaled particle theory is applied to a description of thermodynamic
properties of one-dimensional hard rod fluid in disordered porous media. To
this end, we extended the SPT2 approach, which had been developed previously.
Analytical expressions are obtained for the chemical potential and pressure of
a hard-rod fluid in hard rod and overlapping hard rod matrices. A series of new
approximations for SPT2 are proposed. It is shown that apart from two well
known porosities such as geometrical porosity and specific probe particle
porosity, a new type of porosity defined by the maximum value of packing
fraction of fluid particles in porous medium should be taken into account. The
grand canonical Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to verify the accuracy of
the SPT2 approach in combination with the new approximations. It is observed
that the theoretical description proposed in this study essentially improves
the results up to the highest values of fluid densities.
