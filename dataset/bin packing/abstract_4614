Globular star clusters contain thousands to millions of old stars packed
within a region only tens of light years across. Their high stellar densities
make it very probable that their member stars will interact or collide. There
has been considerable debate about whether black holes should exist in these
star clusters. Some theoretical work suggests that dynamical processes in the
densest inner regions of globular clusters may lead to the formation of black
holes of ~1,000 solar masses. Other numerical simulations instead predict that
stellar interactions will eject most or all black holes that form in globular
clusters. Here we report the X-ray signature of an accreting black hole in a
spectroscopically-confirmed globular cluster in the Virgo Cluster giant
elliptical galaxy NGC 4472. This object has an X-ray luminosity of about
4*10^39 ergs/sec, making it brighter than any non-black hole object can be in
an old stellar population. The X-ray luminosity varies by a factor of 7 in a
few hours, ruling out the possibility that the object is several neutron stars
superposed.
