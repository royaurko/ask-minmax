We focus on the problem of differentially private histogram publication, for
range-sum query answering. Specifically, we derive a histogram from a given
dataset, such that (i) it satisfies $\epsilon$-differential privacy, and (ii)
it achieves high utility for queries that request the sum of contiguous
histogram bins. Existing schemes are distinguished into two categories: fast
but oblivious to utility optimizations that exploit the data characteristics,
and data-aware but slow. We are the first to address this problem with emphasis
on both efficiency and utility. Towards this goal, we formulate a principled
approach, which defines a small set of simple modules, based on which we can
devise a variety of more complex schemes. We first express the state-of-the-art
methods in terms of these modules, which allows us to identify the performance
bottlenecks. Next, we design novel efficient and effective schemes based on
non-trivial module combinations. We experimentally evaluate all mechanisms on
three real datasets with diverse characteristics, and demonstrate the benefits
of our proposals over previous work.
