We consider the fluctuation modes around a hypersurface $\Sigma_c$ in a
$(d+2)$-dimensional product Einstein manifold, with $\Sigma_c$ taken either
near the horizon or at some finite cutoff from the horizon. By mapping the
equations that governs the lowest nontrivial order of the fluctuation modes
into a system of partial differential equations on a flat Newtonian spacetime,
a system of compressible, forced viscous fluid is realized. This result
generalizes the non bulk/boundary holographic duality constructed by us
recently to the case of a different background geometry.
