The macroscopic mechanical properties of colloidal particle gels strongly
depend on the local arrangement of the powder particles. Experiments have shown
that more heterogeneous microstructures exhibit up to one order of magnitude
higher elastic properties than their more homogeneous counterparts at equal
volume fraction. In this paper, packings of spherical particles are used as
model structures to computationally investigate the elastic properties of
coagulated particle gels as a function of their degree of heterogeneity. The
discrete element model comprises a linear elastic contact law, particle bonding
and damping. The simulation parameters were calibrated using a homogeneous and
a heterogeneous microstructure originating from earlier Brownian dynamics
simulations. A systematic study of the elastic properties as a function of the
degree of heterogeneity was performed using two sets of microstructures
obtained from Brownian dynamics simulation and from the void expansion method.
Both sets cover a broad and to a large extent overlapping range of degrees of
heterogeneity. The simulations have shown that the elastic properties as a
function of the degree of heterogeneity are independent of the structure
generation algorithm and that the relation between the shear modulus and the
degree of heterogeneity can be well described by a power law. This suggests the
presence of a critical degree of heterogeneity and, therefore, a phase
transition between a phase with finite and one with zero elastic properties.
