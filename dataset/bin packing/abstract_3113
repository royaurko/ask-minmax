The static and dynamic properties of binary mixtures of hard spheres with a
diameter ratio of $\sigma_B/\sigma_A=0.1$ and a mass ratio of $m_B/m_A=0.001$
are investigated using event driven molecular dynamics. The contact value of
the pair correlation functions are found to compare favourably with recently
proposed theoretical expressions. The transport coefficients of the mixture,
determined from simulation, are compared to the predictions of revised Enskog
theory, using both a third-order Sonine expansion and direct simulation Monte
Carlo. Overall, Enskog theory provides a fairly good description of the
simulation data, with the exception of systems at the smallest mole fraction of
larger spheres ($x_A=0.01$) examined. A "fines effect" was observed at higher
packing fractions, where adding smaller spheres to a system of large spheres
decreases the viscosity of the mixture; this effect is not captured by Enskog
theory.
