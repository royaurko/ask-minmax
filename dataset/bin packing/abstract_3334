Twisted assemblies of filaments in ropes, cables and bundles are essential
structural elements in wide use in macroscopic materials as well as within the
cells and tissues of living organisms. We develop the unique, non-linear
elastic properties of twisted filament bundles that derive from generic
properties of two-dimensional line-ordered materials. Continuum elasticity
reveals a formal equivalence between the elastic stresses induced by bundle
twist and those induced by the positive curvature in thin, elastic sheets.
These geometrically-induced stresses can be screened by 5-fold disclination
defects in lattice packing, and we predict a discrete spectrum elastic energy
groundstates associated with integer numbers of disclinations in cylindrical
bundles. Finally, we show that elastic-energy groundstates are extremely
sensitive to defect position in the cross-section, with off-center
disclinations driving the entire bundle to buckle, adopting globally writhing
configurations.
