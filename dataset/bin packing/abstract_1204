By means of numerical simulations we investigate the configurational
properties of densely and fully packed configurations of loops in the
negative-weight percolation (NWP) model. In the presented study we consider 2d
square, 2d honeycomb, 3d simple cubic and 4d hypercubic lattice graphs, where
edge weights are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. For a given realization of
the disorder we then compute a configuration of loops, such that the
configurational energy, given by the sum of all individual loop weights, is
minimized. For this purpose, we employ a mapping of the NWP model to the
"minimum-weight perfect matching problem" that can be solved exactly by using
sophisticated polynomial-time matching algorithms. We characterize the loops
via observables similar to those used in percolation studies and perform
finite-size scaling analyses, up to side length L=256 in 2d, L=48 in 3d and
L=20 in 4d (for which we study only some observables), in order to estimate
geometric exponents that characterize the configurations of densely and fully
packed loops. One major result is that the loops behave like uncorrelated
random walks from dimension d=3 on, in contrast to the previously studied
behavior at the percolation threshold, where random-walk behavior is obtained
for d>=6.
