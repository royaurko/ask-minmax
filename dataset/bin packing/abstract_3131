We investigate the spatial structure of cohesive granular matter with spheres
floating at an air-liquid interface that form disordered close packings with
pores in between. The interface is slowly lowered in a conical container to
uniformly compress and study the system as a function of area fraction $\phi$.
We find that the free area distributions associated with Voronoi cells show
significant exponential tails indicating greater heterogeneity compared with
random distributions at low $\phi$ with a crossover towards a
$\Gamma$-distribution as $\phi$ is increased. Further, we find significant
short range order as measured by the radial correlation function and the
orientational order parameter even at low and intermediate $\phi$, which is
absent when particles interact only sterically.
