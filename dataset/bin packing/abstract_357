A finite element program is presented to simulate the process of packing and
coiling elastic wires in two- and three-dimensional confining cavities. The
wire is represented by third order beam elements and embedded into a
corotational formulation to capture the geometric nonlinearity resulting from
large rotations and deformations. The hyperbolic equations of motion are
integrated in time using two different integration methods from the Newmark
family: an implicit iterative Newton-Raphson line search solver, and an
explicit predictor-corrector scheme, both with adaptive time stepping. These
two approaches reveal fundamentally different suitability for the problem of
strongly self-interacting bodies found in densely packed cavities. Generalizing
the spherical confinement symmetry investigated in recent studies, the packing
of a wire in hard ellipsoidal cavities is simulated in the frictionless elastic
limit. Evidence is given that packings in oblate spheroids and scalene
ellipsoids are energetically preferred to spheres.
