Sought-after ordered structures of mixtures of hard anisotropic nanoparticles
can often be thermodynamically unfavorable due to the components' geometric
incompatibility to densely pack into regular lattices. A simple
compatibilization rule is identified wherein the particle sizes are chosen such
that the order-disorder transition pressures of the pure components match (and
the entropies of the ordered phases are similar). Using this rule with
representative polyhedra from the truncated-cube family that form
pure-component plastic-crystals, Monte Carlo simulations show the formation of
plastic-solid solutions for all compositions and for a wide range of volume
fractions.
