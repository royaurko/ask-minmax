We compute the large scalar four-point correlation functions in general
single field inflation models, where the inflaton Lagrangian is an arbitrary
function of the inflaton and its first derivative. We find that the leading
order trispectra have four different shapes determined by three parameters. We
study features in these shapes that can be used to distinguish among
themselves, and between them and the trispectra of the local form. For the
purpose of data analyses, we give two simple representative forms for these
"equilateral trispectra". We also study the effects on the trispectra if the
initial state of inflation deviates from the standard Bunch-Davies vacuum.
