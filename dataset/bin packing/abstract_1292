In the previous paper of this series [D. P. Varn, G. S. Canright, and J. P.
Crutchfield, Physical Review B, submitted] we detailed a
procedure--epsilon-machine spectral reconstruction--to discover and analyze
patterns and disorder in close-packed structures as revealed in x-ray
diffraction spectra. We argued that this computational mechanics approach is
more general than the current alternative theory, the fault model, and that it
provides a unique characterization of the disorder present. We demonstrated the
efficacy of computational mechanics on four prototype spectra, finding that it
was able to recover a statistical description of the underlying modular-layer
stacking using epsilon-machine representations. Here we use this procedure to
analyze structure and disorder in four previously published zinc sulphide
diffraction spectra. We selected zinc sulphide not only for the theoretical
interest this material has attracted in an effort to develop an understanding
of polytypism, but also because it displays solid-state phase transitions and
experimental data is available.
