We present three deterministic parameterized algorithms for well-studied
packing and matching problems, namely, Weighted q-Dimensional p-Matching
((q,p)-WDM) and Weighted q-Set p-Packing ((q,p)-WSP). More specifically, we
present an O*(2.85043^{(q-1)p}) time deterministic algorithm for (q,p)-WDM, an
O*(8.04143^p) time deterministic algorithm for the unweighted version of
(3,p)-WDM, and an O*((0.56201\cdot 2.85043^q)^p) time deterministic algorithm
for (q,p)-WSP. Our algorithms significantly improve the previously best known
O* running times in solving (q,p)-WDM and (q,p)-WSP, and the previously best
known deterministic O* running times in solving the unweighted versions of
these problems. Moreover, we present kernels of size O(e^qq(p-1)^q) for
(q,p)-WDM and (q,p)-WSP, improving the previously best known kernels of size
O(q!q(p-1)^q) for these problems.
