Are there credible electromagnetic (EM) EQ precursors? This a question
debated in the scientific community and there may be legitimate reasons for the
critical views. The negative view concerning the existence of EM precursors is
enhanced by features that accompany their observation which are considered as
paradox ones, namely, these signals: (i) are not observed at the time of EQs
occurrence and during the aftershock period, (ii) are not accompanied by large
precursory strain changes, (iii) are not accompanied by simultaneous geodetic
or seismological precursors and (v) their traceability is considered
problematic. In this work, the detected candidate EM precursors are studied
through a shift in thinking towards the basic science findings relative to
granular packings, micron-scale plastic flow, interface depinning, fracture
size effects, concepts drawn from phase transitions, self-affine notion of
fracture and faulting process, universal features of fracture surfaces, recent
high quality laboratory studies, theoretical models and numerical simulations.
Strict criteria are established for the definition of an emerged EM anomaly as
a preseismic one, while, precursory EM features, which have been considered as
paradoxes, are explained. A three-stage model for EQ generation by means of
preseismic fracture-induced EM emissions is proposed. The claim that the
observed EM precursors may permit a real-time and step-by-step monitoring of
the EQ generation is tested.
