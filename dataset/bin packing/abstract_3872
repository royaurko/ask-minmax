Weakening the Euclidean assumption in special relativity and the
coordinate-independence hypothesis in general relativity for the de Sitter
space, we propose a de Sitter invariant special relativity with two universal
constants of speed $c$ and length $R$ based on the principle of relativity and
the postulate of universal constants $c$ and $R$ on de Sitter space with
Beltrami metric. We also propose a postulate on the origin of the inertial
motions and inertial systems as a base of the principle of relativity. We show
that the Beltrami-de Sitter space provides such a model that the origin of
inertia should be determined by the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ if the
length $R$ is linked with $\Lambda$. In addition, via the `gnomonic' projection
the uniform straight-line motion on Beltrami-de Sitter space is linked with the
uniform motion along a great `circle' on de Sitter space embedded in 5-d
Minkowski space.
