The small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, time resolved X-ray small-angle
and wide-angle diffraction coupled with differential scanning calorimetry have
been applied to the investigation of unilamellar and multilamellar
dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles in sucrose buffers with sucrose
concentrations from 0 to 60%. Sucrose buffer decreased vesicle size and
polydispersity and increased an X-ray contrast between phospholipid membrane
and bulk solvent sufficiently. No influence of sucrose on the membrane
thickness or mutual packing of hydrocarbon chains has been detected. The region
of sucrose concentrations 30%-40% created the best experimental conditions for
X-ray small-angle experiments with phospholipid vesicles.
