Dihadron azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$=200
GeV have been explored by using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. In order
to obtain the contributions from jet-medium interactions, the combined harmonic
flow background is subtracted from the raw dihadron correlation functions. The
signals are compared in three associated transverse momentum ($p_{T}^{assoc}$)
bins: 0.2-0.8 GeV/c, 0.8-1.4 GeV/c and 1.4-2.0 GeV/c from central to
semi-peripheral geometries. The medium modifications are observed from changes
in the signal shape and the relative jet contribution has been obtained within
the change in the centrality from peripheral to central one. A strong
$p_{T}^{assoc}$ dependence of the RMS width of jet correlation function is
observed within the central geometry bin, i.e. 0-10$%$.
