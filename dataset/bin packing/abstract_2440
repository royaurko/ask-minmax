We present the results for the measurement of $\phi$ meson production in
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au and pp collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). Using the event mixing technique, spectra and yields are
obtained from the $\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}$ decay channel for five centrality bins
in Au+Au collisions and in pp collisions. We observe that the spectrum shape in
Au+Au collisions depends weakly on the centrality and the shape of the spectrum
in pp collisions is significantly different from that in Au+Au collisions.
