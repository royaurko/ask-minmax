Consider sequential packing of unit balls in a large cube, as in the Renyi
car-parking model, but in any dimension and with Poisson input. We show after
suitable rescaling that the spatial distribution of packed balls tends to that
of a Gaussian field in the thermodynamic limit. We prove analogous results for
related applied models, including ballistic deposition and spatial birth-growth
models.
