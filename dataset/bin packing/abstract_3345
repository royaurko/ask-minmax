An anisotropic fluid with positive energy density and negative pressures is
proposed in the black hole interior. The gravitational field is constant
everywhere inside and is given by the horizon surface gravity. Even though the
geometry is of Rindler type it is curved because of the spherical symmetry used
and is singular at the origin. The Israel junction conditions are studied on
the stretched horizon instead of using a matching process on the null surface
$r = 2M$. The entropy of any inner sphere is mass independent, maximally packed
and unaffected by the outer layers.
