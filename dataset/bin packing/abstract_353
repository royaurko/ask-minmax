The structural properties of dense random packings of identical hard spheres
(HS) are investigated. The bond order parameter method is used to obtain
detailed information on the local structural properties of the system for
different packing fractions $\phi$, in the range between $\phi=0.53$ and
$\phi=0.72$. A new order parameter, based on the cumulative properties of
spheres distribution over the rotational invariant $w_6$, is proposed to
characterize crystallization of randomly packed HS systems. It is shown that an
increase in the packing fraction of the crystallized HS system first results in
the transformation of the individual crystalline clusters into the global
three-dimensional crystalline structure, which, upon further densification,
transforms into alternating planar layers formed by different lattice types.
