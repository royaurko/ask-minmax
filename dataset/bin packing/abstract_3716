The results of astrometric and photometric investigations of the poorly
studied open cluster NGC 1513 are presented. The proper motions of 353 stars
with the root-mean-square error of 1.9 mas/yr were obtained by means of the
automated measuring complex "Fantasy" scanning of 8 astrometric plates covering
the time interval of 101 years. A total of 141 astrometric cluster members have
been identified. BV CCD-photometry was made for the stars in a square size 17
arcmin x 17 arcmin centered on cluster. 33 stars with the high reliability were
considered to be cluster members by two criteria. The estimation of NGC 1513
age is 2.54 E+08 years. Tables 2 and 3 are only available in electronic form at
