Dense packings of nonoverlapping bodies in three-dimensional Euclidean space
are useful models of the structure of a variety of many-particle systems that
arise in the physical and biological sciences. Here we investigate the packing
behavior of congruent ring tori, which are multiply connected nonconvex bodies
of genus 1, as well as horn and spindle tori. We analytically construct a
family of dense periodic packings of unlinked tori guided by the organizing
principles originally devised for simply connected solid bodies [Torquato and
Jiao, PRE 86, 011102 (2012)]. We find that the horn tori as well as certain
spindle and ring tori can achieve a packing density higher than the densest
known packing of both sphere and ellipsoids. In addition, we study dense
packings of cluster of pair-linked ring tori (i.e., Hopf links).
