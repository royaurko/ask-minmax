Experimental results on the position and current control of disruption
generated runaway electrons (RE) in FTU are presented. A scanning
interferometer diagnostic has been used to analyze the time evolution of the RE
beam radial position and its instabilities. Correspondence of the
interferometer time traces, radial profile reconstructed via magnetic
measurements and fission chamber signals are discussed. New RE control
algorithms, which define in real-time updated plasma current and position
references, have been tested in two experimental scenarios featuring disruption
generated RE plateaus: the experimental data confirm the effectiveness of the
control strategies as the RE beam interaction with the plasma facing components
is reduced while the current is ramped-down.
