The Kamioka Liquid scintillator Anti-Neutrino Detector (KamLAND) is sensitive
to the neutrino event spectrum from (mainly Japanese) nuclear reactors in both
the energy domain and the time domain. While the energy spectrum of KamLAND
events allows the determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters, the
time spectrum can be used to monitor known and unknown neutrino sources. By
using available monthly-binned data on event-by-event energies in KamLAND and
on reactor powers in Japan, we perform a likelihood analysis of the neutrino
event spectra in energy and time, and find significant indications in favor of
time variations of the known reactor sources, as compared with the hypothetical
case of constant reactor neutrino flux. We also find that the KamLAND data
place interesting upper limits on the power of a speculative nuclear reactor
operating in the Earth's core (the so-called georeactor); such limits are
strengthened by including solar neutrino constraints on the neutrino mass and
mixing parameters. Our results corroborate the standard interpretation of the
KamLAND signal as due to oscillating neutrinos from known reactor sources.
