We construct a one-parameter family of flat currents in AdS_5 x S^1 and AdS_3
x S^3 Green-Schwarz superstrings, which would naturally lead to a hierarchy of
classical conserved nonlocal charges. In the former case we rewrite the AdS_5 x
S^1 string using a new Z_4-graded base of the superalgebra su(2,2|2). In both
cases the existence of the Z_4 grading in the superalgebras plays a key role in
the construction. As a result, we find that the flat currents, when formally
written in terms of the G_0-gauge invariant lowercase 1-forms, take the same
form as the one in AdS_5 x S^5 case.
