Transverse-mass spectra of protons, pions and kaons produced in collisions of
heavy nuclei are analyzed within the model of 3-fluid dynamics. It was
demonstrated that this model consistently reproduces these spectra in wide
ranges of incident energies E_{lab}, from 4A GeV to 160A GeV, rapidity bins and
centralities of the collisions. In particular, the model describes the
"step-like" dependence of kaon inverse slopes on the incident energy. The key
point of this explanation is interplay of hydrodynamic expansion of the system
with its dynamical freeze-out.
