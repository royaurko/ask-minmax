We study number density distribution and the behavior of time correlation
functions in the density of grains for a quasi-two dimensional system of
vibrated grains. We study the system at various packing fractions, from low to
high. At low densities we recover usual gas like behavior, reflected in a
Poissonian statistics for the number density distribution. At higher densities
we notice effects like formation of cages of the kind that are seen in glass
transition.
