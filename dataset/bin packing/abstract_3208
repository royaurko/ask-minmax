A general Landau's free energy functional is used to study the dynamics of
crystallization during liquid-solid Spinodal Decomposition (SD). The strong
length scale selectivity imposed during the early stage of SD induces the
appearance of small precursors for crystallization with icosahedral order.
These precursors grow in densely packed clusters of tetrahedra through the
addition of new particles. As the average size of the amorphous nuclei becomes
large enough to reduce geometric frustration, crystalline particles with a body
center cubic symmetry (bcc) heterogeneously nucleates on the growing clusters.
The volume fraction of the crystalline phase is strongly dependant on the depth
of quench. At deep quenches, the SD mechanism produces amorphous structures
arranged in dense polytetrahedral aggregates.
