To study heavy ion collisions at energies available from the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider, we have developed a multi-phase transport model that
includes both initial partonic and final hadronic interactions. Specifically,
the parton cascade model ZPC, which uses as input the parton distribution from
the HIJING model, is extended to include the quark-gluon to hadronic matter
transition and also final-state hadronic interactions based on the ART model.
Predictions of the model for central Au on Au collisions at RHIC are reported.
