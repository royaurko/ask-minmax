In this paper, I relate the phase separation transition in binary hard-core
mixtures in the limit of small size ratio to a bond percolation transition. It
allows to estimate the critical packing fraction at the transition as a
function of the size ratio and the composition of the mixture for different
shapes of objects. The theoretical predictions are in excellent quantitative
agreement with numerical simulations of binary parallel hard squares mixtures.
