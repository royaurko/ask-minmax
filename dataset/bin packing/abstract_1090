In this paper we study the chiral phase transition of QCD at ?nite
temperature and density by using the rank-2 con?ning separable gluon propagator
model in the framework of Dyson-Schwinger Equations. The critical end point is
located at (T_CEP, {\mu}_CEP) = (69 MeV, 270.3 MeV). It is also found that the
first order phase transition might not end at one point, but experiences a
two-phase coexisting meta-stable state. A comparison with the results in the
previous literature is given.
