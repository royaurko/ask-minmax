We study a left--right symmetric model which contains only elementary gauge
boson and fermion fields and no scalars. The phenomenologically required
symmetry breaking emerges dynamically leading to a composite Higgs sector with
a renormalizable effective Lagrangian. We discuss the pattern of symmetry
breaking and phenomenological consequences of this scenario. It is shown that a
viable top quark mass can be achieved for the ratio of the VEVs of the
bi--doublet $\tan\beta\equiv\kappa/\kappa'$ =~ 1.3--4. For a theoretically
plausible choice of the parameters the right--handed scale can be as low as
$\sim 20 TeV$; in this case one expects several intermediate and low--scale
scalars in addition to the \SM Higgs boson. These may lead to observable lepton
flavour violation effects including $\mu\to e\gamma$ decay with the rate close
to its present experimental upper bound.
