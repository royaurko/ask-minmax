In this paper we investigate the physical implications of the dynamical
scalar mode in pure Horava-Lifshitz gravity on cosmology. We find that it can
produce a scale-invariant power spectrum in UV era if the detailed balance
condition on the action is relaxed. This indicates that the physical scalar
mode may seed the large scale structure and Horava-Lifshitz cosmology could be
a qualified alternative to inflationary scenario.
