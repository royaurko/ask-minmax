The newly developed "void expansion method" allows for an efficient
generation of porous packings of spherical particles over a wide range of
volume fractions using the discrete element method. Particles are randomly
placed under addition of much smaller "void-particles". Then, the void-particle
radius is increased repeatedly, thereby rearranging the structural particles
until formation of a dense particle packing.
  The structural particles' mean coordination number was used to characterize
the evolving microstructures. At some void radius, a transition from an
initially low to a higher mean coordination number is found, which was used to
characterize the influence of the various simulation parameters. For structural
and void-particle stiffnesses of the same order of magnitude, the transition is
found at constant total volume fraction slightly below the random close packing
limit. For decreasing void-particle stiffness the transition is shifted towards
a smaller void-particle radius and becomes smoother.
