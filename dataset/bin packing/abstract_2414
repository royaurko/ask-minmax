Measurements of the distances to SNe Ia have produced strong evidence that
the Universe is really accelarating, implying the existence of a nearly uniform
component of dark energy with the simplest explanation as a cosmological
constant. In this paper a small changing cosmological term is proposed, which
is a function of a slow-rolling scalar field, by which the de Sitter primordial
black holes' properties, for both charged and uncharged cases, are carefully
examined and the relationship between the black hole formation and the energy
transfer of the inflaton within this cosmological term is eluciated
