J integral based criterion is widely used in elastic-plastic fracture
mechanics. However, it is not rigorously applicable when plastic unloading
appears during crack propagation. One difficulty is that the energy density
with plastic unloading in J integral cannot be defined unambiguously. In this
paper, we alternatively start from the analysis on the power balance, and
propose a surface-forming energy release rate (ERR), which represents the
energy directly dissipated on the surface-forming during the crack propagation
and excludes the loading-mode-dependent plastic dissipation. Therefore the
surface-forming ERR based fracture criterion has wider applicability, including
elastic-plastic crack propagation problems. Several formulae have been derived
for calculating the surface-forming ERR. From the most concise formula, it is
interesting to note that the surface-forming ERR can be computed only by the
stress and deformation of the current moment, and the definition of the energy
density or work density is avoided. When an infinitesimal contour is chosen,
the expression can be further simplified. For any fracture behaviors, the
surface-forming ERR is proven to be path-independent, and the path-independence
of its constituent term, so-called integral, is also investigated. The physical
meanings and applicability of the proposed surface-forming ERR, traditional
ERR, Js integral and J integral are compared and discussed.
