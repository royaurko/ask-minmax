We propose a model for increasing liquid saturation in a granular packing
which can account for liquid redistribution at saturation levels beyond the
well-studied capillary bridge regime. The model is capable of resolving and
combining capillary bridges, menisci and fully saturated pores to form local
liquid clusters of any shape. They can exchange volume due to the local Laplace
pressure gradient via a liquid film on the surfaces of grains. Local
instabilities like Haines jumps trigger the discontinuous evolution of the
liquid front. The applicability of the model is demonstrated and compared to
benchmark experiments on the level of individual liquid structures as well as
on larger systems.
