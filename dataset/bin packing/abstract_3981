An algorithm for creating synthetic telescope images of Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) density fields is presented, which utilises the adaptive
nature of the SPH formalism in full. The imaging process uses Monte Carlo
Radiative Transfer (MCRT) methods to model the scattering and absorption of
photon packets in the density field, which then exit the system and are
captured on a pixelated image plane, creating a 2D image (or a 3D datacube, if
the photons are also binned by their wavelength). The algorithm is implemented
on the density field directly: no gridding of the field is required, allowing
the density field to be described to an identical level of accuracy as the
simulations that generated it. Some applications of the method to star and
planet formation simulations are presented to illustrate the advantages of this
new technique, and suggestions as to how this framework could support a
Radiative Equilibrium algorithm are also given as an indication for future
development.
