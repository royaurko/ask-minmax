Pressure controlled displacement of an oil/water interface is studied in
dense packings of functionalized glass beads with well-defined spatial
wettability correlations. An enhanced dissipation is observed if the typical
extension $\xi$ of the same-type wetting domains is smaller than the average
bead diameter $d$. Three dimensional imaging using X-ray microtomography shows
that the frequency $n(s)$ of residual droplet volumes $s$ for different $\xi$
collapse onto the same curve. This indicates that the additional dissipation
for small $\xi$ is due to contact line pinning rather than an increase of
capillary break-up/coalescence events.
