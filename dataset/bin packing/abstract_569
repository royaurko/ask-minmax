Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ be a rotation and reflection free self-similar
set satisfying the strong separation condition, with dimension $\dim K = s >
1$. Intersecting $K$ with translates of a fixed line, one can study the $(s -
1)$-dimensional Hausdorff and packing measures of the generic non-empty line
sections. In a recent article, T. Kempton gave a necessary and sufficient
condition for the Hausdorff measures of the sections to be positive. In this
paper, I consider the packing measures: it turns out that the generic section
has infinite $(s - 1)$-dimensional packing measure under relatively mild
assumptions.
