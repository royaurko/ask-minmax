We study the effect of thermalization on the rigidity of a randomly packed
soft repulsive sphere system around the jamming point by analyzing the
shear-modulus using the cloned liquid theory with the 1 step replica symmetry
breaking ansatz and molecular dynamics simulations. Contrarily to the usual
harmonic picture for solids, we found that the thermalized jamming system is
anomalously softer than at zero temperature such that the shear-modulus becomes
as small as the pressure down to vanishingly low temperatures.
