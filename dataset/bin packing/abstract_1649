Using a relativistic transport model, we study the azimuthal momentum
asymmetry of kaons with fixed transverse momentum, i.e., the differential flow,
in heavy-ion collisions at beam momentum of 6 GeV/c per nucleon, available from
the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory (BNL). We find that in the absence of kaon potential the kaon
differential flow is positive and increases with transverse momentum as that of
nucleons. The repulsive kaon potential as predicted by theoretical models,
however, reduces the kaon differetnial flow, changing it to negative for kaons
with low momenta. Cancellation between the negative differential flow at low
mementa and the positive one at high momenta is then responsible for the
experimentally observed nearly vanishing in-plane transverse flow of kaons in
heavy ion experiments.
