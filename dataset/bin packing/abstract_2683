In this paper we study thermalization in a strongly coupled system via
AdS/CFT. Initially, the energy is injected into the system by turning on a
spatially homogenous scalar source coupled to a marginal composite operator.
The thermalization process is studied by numerically solving Einstein's
equations coupled to a massless scalar field in the Poincare patch of AdS_5. We
define a thermalization time t_T on the AdS side, which has an interpretation
in terms of a spacelike Wilson loop <W(l =1/T)> in CFT. Here T is the thermal
equilibrium temperature. We study both cases with the source turned on in
short(Delta t <= 1/T) and long(Delta t >= 1/T) durations. In the former case,
the thermalization time t_T = g_t/T <= 1/T and the coefficient g_t = 0.73 in
the limit Delta t <= 0.02/T. In the latter case, we find double- and
multiple-collapse solutions, which may be interpreted as the gravity duals of
two- or multi-stage thermalization in CFT. In all the cases our results
indicate that such a strongly coupled system thermalizes in a typical time
scale t_T=O(1)/T.
