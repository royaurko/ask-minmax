Anomalous diffusion and non-Gaussian statistics are detected experimentally
in a two-dimensional driven-dissipative system. A single-layer dusty plasma
suspension with a Yukawa interaction and frictional dissipation is heated with
laser radiation pressure to yield a structure with liquid ordering. Analyzing
the time series for mean-square displacement (MSD), superdiffusion is detected
at a low but statistically significant level over a wide range of temperature.
The probability distribution function (PDF) fits a Tsallis distribution,
yielding q, a measure of non-extensivity for non-Gaussian statistics.
