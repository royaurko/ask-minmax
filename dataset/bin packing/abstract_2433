We discuss the matrix model in a class of 11D time dependent supersymmetric
backgrounds as obtained in hep-th/0508191 . We construct the matrix model
action through the matrix regularization of the membrane action in the
background. We show that the action is exact to all order of fermionic
coordinates. Furthermore We discuss the fuzzy sphere solutions in this
background.
