The study and understanding of the details of proton-proton collisions is
important since they are the benchmark for the comparison with heavy ion
results. In the present work we have studied the $\Delta\eta\Delta\phi$
correlations as a function of the event multiplicity and transverse sphericity
in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV using PYTHIA 8.180. The results show
large variation in the shape of the correlation as a function of the sphericity
and multiplicity indicating the importance of slicing the data in bins of both
observables to better understand the complexity of the interactions. Motivated
by the radial flow patterns originated by color reconnection (CR), results with
and without CR together with dihadron correlations are discussed.
