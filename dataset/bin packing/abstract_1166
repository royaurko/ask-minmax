Researchers must often estimate income inequality using data that give only
the number of cases (e.g., families or households) whose incomes fall in "bins"
such as $0-9,999, $10,000-14,999,..., $200,000+. We find that popular methods
for estimating inequality from binned incomes are not robust and can produce
infinite or undefined estimates in small samples. We develop robust
alternatives called the robust Pareto midpoint estimator (RPME) and the
multimodel generalized beta estimator (MGBE). In a broad evaluation using US
national, state, and county data from 1970 to 2009, we find that both
estimators produce similar and very good estimates of the mean and Gini, but
are less accurate in estimating the Theil and mean log deviation. The RPME is
much faster, which may be a consideration when many estimates must be obtained
from many datasets. We have made the methods available as the rpme command for
Stata and the binequality package for R.
