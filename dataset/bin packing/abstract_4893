We report on a search for CP violation in tau -> K^0_S pi nu_tau decays using
a data sample of 699 fb^{-1} collected in the Belle experiment at the KEKB
electron-positron asymmetric-energy collider. The CP asymmetry is measured in
four bins of the invariant mass of the K^0_S pi system and found to be
compatible with zero with a precision of O(10^{-3}) in each mass bin. Limits
for the CP violation parameter Im(eta_S) are given at a 90 % confidence level.
These limits are |Im(eta_S)|<0.026 or better, depending on the parameterization
used to describe the hadronic form factors and improve upon previous limits by
one order of magnitude.
