Mott insulator to superfluid quenches have been used by recent experiments to
generate exotic superfluid phases. While the final Hamiltonian following the
sudden quench is that of a superfluid, it is not a priori clear how close the
final state of the system approaches the ground state of the superfluid
Hamiltonian. To understand the nature of the final state we calculate the
temporal evolution of the momentum distribution following a Mott insulator to
superfluid quench. Using the numerical infinite time-evolving block decimation
approach and the analytical rotor model approximation we establish that the one
and two dimensional Mott insulators following the quench equilibriate to
thermal states with spatially short-ranged coherence peaks in the final
momentum distribution and therefore are not strict superfluids. However, in
three dimensions we find a divergence in the momentum distribution indicating
the emergence of true superfluid order.
