The secular evolution of the orbital angular momentum (OAM), the systemic
mass $(M=M_{1}+M_{2})$ and the orbital period of 114 chromospherically active
binaries (CABs) were investigated after determining the kinematical ages of the
sub-samples which were set according to OAM bins. OAMs, systemic masses and
orbital periods were shown to be decreasing by the kinematical ages. The first
order decreasing rates of OAM, systemic mass and orbital period have been
determined as $\dot J = 3.48 \times 10^{-10} yr^{-1}$ per systemic OAM, $\dot M
= 1.30 \times 10^{-10} yr^{-1}$ per systemic mass and $\dot P = 3.96\times
10^{-10} yr^{-1}$ per orbital period respectively from the kinematical ages.
The ratio of $d \log J/ d \log M = 2.68$, which were derived from the
kinematics of the present sample, implies that there must be a mechanism which
amplifies the angular momentum loss $\bar A = 2.68$ times in comparison to
isotropic angular momentum loss of hypothetical isotropic wind from the
components. It has been shown that simple isotropic mass loss from the surface
of a component or both components would increase the orbital period.
