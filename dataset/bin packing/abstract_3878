We show that the diagonal light-like solution with 16 supersymmetries in
eleven-dimensional supergravity derived in our previous paper (hep-th/0509173)
can be generalised to non-diagonal solutions preserving the same number of
supersymmetries. This class of solutions contains a subclass equivalent to the
class of solutions found by Bin Chen that are dependent on the
spatial-coordinates. Utilising these solutions, we construct toroidally
compactified solutions that smoothly connect a static compactified region with
a dynamically decompactifying region along a null hypersurface.
