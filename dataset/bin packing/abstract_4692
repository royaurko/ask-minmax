Following our recent theoretical development of the concept of
nano-inductors, nano-capacitors and nano-resistors at optical frequencies and
the possibility of synthesizing more complex nano-scale circuits, here we
theoretically investigate in detail the problem of optical
nano-transmission-lines (NTL) that can be envisioned by properly joining
together arrays of these basic nano-scale circuit elements. We show how, in the
limit in which these basic circuit elements are closely packed together, the
NTLs can be regarded as stacks of plasmonic and non-plasmonic planar slabs,
which may be designed to effectively exhibit the properties of planar
metamaterials with forward (right-handed) or backward (left-handed) operation.
With the proper design, negative refraction and left-handed propagation are
shown to be possible in these planar plasmonic guided-wave structures,
providing possibilities for sub-wavelength focusing and imaging in planar
optics, and laterally-confined waveguiding at IR and visible frequencies. The
effective material parameters for such NTLs are derived, and the connection and
analogy between these optical NTLs and the double-negative and double-positive
metamaterials are also explored. Physical insights and justification for the
results are also presented.
