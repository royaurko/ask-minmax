Through a combination of X-ray diffraction, electrical transport, magnetic
susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements, we report the effect of La
doping on Sr in the newly discovered SrFBiS2 system. Superconducting transition
with critical temperature Tc of 2.8 K, developed from a semiconducting-like
normal state, was found in Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2. A strong diamagnetic signal and a
clear specific heat anomaly associated with this transition were observed,
confirming bulk superconductivity. The upper critical field Hc2(0) was
estimated to be 1 Tesla by using the Ginzburg-Landau approach. Our experiments
therefore demonstrate that bulk superconductivity can be achieved by electron
doping in the SrFBiS2 system.
