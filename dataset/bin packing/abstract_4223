This work revisits the pentaquark episode, particularly in reference to
lattice QCD, to collect in one place the lessons that have been or should be
learnt. This also examines whether, and if yes, where, there might be any
prospect for future studies of pentaquarks and the role of lattice QCD in it.
Tests such as volume dependence, and hybrid boundary conditions to distinguish
bound and scattering states are identified as the positives to take forward
from this episode. On the other hand it is also observed that pentaquarks with
heavier quark content and in the $SU(3)_f$ limit may still be worth not
forgetting, and in that case lattice QCD may have an important role to play.
