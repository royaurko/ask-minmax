Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been employed to study the
nonequilibrium structure formation of two types of particles in a colloidal
suspension, driven by type-dependent forces. We examined the time evolution of
structure formation as well as the structural properties of the resulting
aggregation by studying the radial distribution function (RDF). The resulting
aggregation is well described by a binary colloidal gelation. We compared the
structural properties to those for one type of particles. From the MD results,
it is evident that there are significant differences between the RDF's of the
two cases. Moreover, we found that the average coordination number is generally
larger in the monodisperse case for all area fractions considered. Thus, by
means of heterogeneous aggregation, it is possible to obtain a wide variety of
structures while more close-packed structures are formed for monodisperse
colloidal aggregation.
