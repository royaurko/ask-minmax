We discuss the calculation of two-point three-loop functions with an
arbitrary number of massive propagators and one large external momentum. The
relevant subdiagrams are generated automatically. The resulting massless
two-point integrals and massive tadpoles are transformed on-line to
FORM-expressions ready to be used by existing FORM packages which calculate
them analytically. As an example we compute the quartic mass corrections to the
photon polarization function.
