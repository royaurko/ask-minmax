We consider the setting of online computation with advice, and study the bin
packing problem and a number of scheduling problems. We show that it is
possible, for any of these problems, to arbitrarily approach a competitive
ratio of $1$ with only a constant number of bits of advice per request. For the
bin packing problem, we give an online algorithm with advice that is
$(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive and uses $O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log
\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \right)$ bits of advice per request. For scheduling on
$m$ identical machines, with the objective function of any of makespan, machine
covering and the minimization of the $\ell_p$ norm, $p >1$, we give similar
results. We give online algorithms with advice which are
$(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive ($(1/(1-\varepsilon))$-competitive for machine
covering) and also use $O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ bits of advice per request. We complement our results by giving a
lower bound showing that for any online algorithm with advice to be optimal,
for any of the above scheduling problems, a non-constant number (namely, at
least $\left(1 - \frac{2m}{n}\right)\log m$, where $n$ is the number of jobs
and $m$ is the number of machines) of bits of advice per request is needed.
