We measure shear response in packings of glass beads by pulling a thin,
rough, metal plate vertically through a bed of volume fraction phi, which is
set, before the plate is pulled, in the range 0.575 to 0.628. The yield stress
is velocity independent over 4 decades and increases exponentially with phi,
with a transition at phi approximately 0.595. An analysis of the measured force
fluctuations indicates that the shear modulus is significantly smaller than the
bulk modulus.
