We have studied scalar perturbations as well as fermion perturbations in pure
de Sitter space-times. For scalar perturbations we have showed that
well-defined quasinormal modes can exist provided that the mass of scalar field
$m>\frac{d-1}{2l}$. The quasinormal frequencies of fermion perturbations in
three and four dimensional cases have also been presented. We found that
different from other dimensional cases, in three dimensional pure de Sitter
spacetime there is no quasinormal mode for the s-wave. This interesting
difference caused by the spacial dimensions is true for both scalar and fermion
perturbations.
