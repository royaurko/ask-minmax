The charge transport of electron doped Mott insulators on a triangular
lattice is investigated within the t-J model based on the partial charge-spin
separation fermion-spin theory. The conductivity spectrum shows a low-energy
peak and the unusual midinfrared band, while the resistivity is characterized
by a crossover from the high temperature metallic-like to the low temperature
insulating-like behavior, in qualitative agreement with experiments. Our
results also show that the mechanism that cause this unusual charge transport
is closely related with a competition between the kinetic energy and magnetic
energy in the system.
