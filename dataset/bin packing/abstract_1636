We construct the colliding plane wave solutions in the higher-dimensional
gravity theory with fluxes and dilaton, with a more general ansatz on the
metric. We consider two classes of solutions to the equations of motions and
after imposing the junction conditions we find that they are all physically
acceptable. In particular, we manage to obtain the higher-dimensional
Bell-Szekeres solutions in the Maxwell-Einstein gravity theory, and the
flux-CPW solutions in the eleven-dimensional supergravity theory. All the
solutions have been shown to develop the late time curvature singularity.
