We re-analyze the conditions for the phenomenon of intermittency
(self-similar fluctuations) to occur in models of multifragmentation. Analyzing
two different mechanisms, the bond-percolation and the ERW (Elattari, Richert
and Wagner) statistical fragmentation models, we point out a common
quasi-gaussian shape of the total multiplicity distribution in the critical
range. The fixed-point property is also observed for the multiplicity of the
second bin. Fluctuations are studied using scaled factorial cumulants instead
of scaled factorial moments. The second-order cumulant displays the
intermittency signal while higher order cumulants are equal to zero, revealing
a large information redundancy in scaled factorial moments. A practical
criterion is proposed to identify the gaussian feature of light-fragment
production, distinguishing between a self-similarity mechanism (ERW) and the
superposition of independent sources (percolation).
