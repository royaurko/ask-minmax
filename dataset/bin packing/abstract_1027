We study the mutual interaction between the dark sectors (dark matter and
dark energy) of the Universe by resorting to the extended thermodynamics of
irreversible processes and constrain the former with supernova type Ia data. As
a byproduct, the present dark matter temperature results in good agreement with
independent estimates of the temperature of the gas of sterile neutrinos.
