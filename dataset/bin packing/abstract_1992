The effect of the anisotropy on the elastoplastic response of two dimensional
packed samples of polygons is investigated here, using molecular dynamics
simulation. We show a correlation between fabric coefficients, characterizing
the anisotropy of the granular skeleton, and the anisotropy of the elastic
response. We also study the anisotropy induced by shearing on the subnetwork of
the sliding contacts. This anisotropy provides an explanation to some features
of the plastic deformation of granular media.
