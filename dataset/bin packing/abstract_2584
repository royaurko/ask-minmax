The latest results of the ZEUS collaboration on the high Q2, the exchanged
boson virtuality, high Bjorken x region up to values of x = 1 are presented.
Differential cross sections in x and Q2 are given for Q2 > 725 GeV2. An
improved reconstruction method and a substantially increased amount of data
allow a finer binning in the high-x region of the neutral current cross section
and lead to a measurement with much improved precision compared to a similar
earlier analysis. The measurements are compared to Standard Model expectations
based on a variety of recent parton distribution functions.
