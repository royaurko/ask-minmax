A high precision and high resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC)
implemented in a 40 nm fabrication process Virtex-6 FPGA is presented in this
paper. The multi-chain measurements averaging architecture is used to overcome
the resolution limitation determined by intrinsic cell delay of the plain
single tapped-delay chain. The resolution and precision are both improved with
this architecture. In such a TDC, the input signal is connected to multiple
tapped-delay chains simultaneously (the chain number is M), and there is a
fixed delay cell between every two adjacent chains. Each tapped-delay chain is
just a plain TDC and should generate a TDC time for a hit input signal, so
totally M TDC time values should be got for a hit signal. After averaging, the
final TDC time is obtained. A TDC with 3 ps resolution (i.e. bin size) and 6.5
ps precision (i.e. RMS) has been implemented using 8 parallel tapped-delay
chains. Meanwhile the plain TDC with single tapped-delay chain yields 24 ps
resolution and 18 ps precision.
