A scenario is proposed to explain the preferential heating of minor ions and
differential streaming velocity between minor ions and protons observed in the
solar corona and in the solar wind. It is demonstrated by test particle
simulations that minor ions can be nearly fully picked up by intrinsic
Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves observed in the solar wind based on the observed wave
energy density. Both high frequency ion-cyclotron waves and low frequency
Alfv\'en waves play crucial roles in the pickup process. A minor ion can first
gain a high magnetic moment through the resonant wave-particle interaction with
ion-cyclotron waves, and then this ion with a large magnetic moment can be
trapped by magnetic mirror-like field structures in the presence of the
lower-frequency Alfv\'en waves. As a result, the ion is picked up by these
Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves. However, minor ions can only be partially picked up
in the corona due to low wave energy density and low plasma beta. During the
pickup process, minor ions are stochastically heated and accelerated by
Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves so that they are hotter and flow faster than protons.
The compound effect of Alfv\'en waves and ion-cyclotron waves is important on
the heating and acceleration of minor ions. The kinetic properties of minor
ions from simulation results are generally consistent with in situ and remote
features observed in the solar wind and solar corona.
