We show that deciding whether a given set of circles can be packed into a
rectangle, an equilateral triangle, or a unit square are NP-hard problems,
settling the complexity of these natural packing problems. On the positive
side, we show that any set of circles of total area 1 can be packed into a
square of size 4/\sqrt{pi}=2.2567... These results are motivated by problems
arising in the context of origami design.
