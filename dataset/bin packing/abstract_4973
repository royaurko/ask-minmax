Using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing code in full general relativity, we calculate
the transport of photons from a geodesic hot spot emitter through a corona of
hot electrons surrounding a black hole. Each photon is followed until it is
either captured by the black hole or is detected by a distant observer. The
source is assumed to be a low-energy thermal emitter (T_em ~ 1 keV), isotropic
in the rest frame of a massive geodesic test particle. The coronal scattering
has two major observable effects: the Comptonization of the photon spectrum due
to the high energy electrons, and the convolution of the time-dependent light
curve as each photon is effectively scattered into a different time bin. Both
of these effects are clearly present in the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
observations of high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in black
hole binaries. These QPOs tend to occur when the system is in the Steep Power
Law spectral state and also show no evidence for significant power at higher
harmonic frequencies, consistent with the smoothing out of the light curve by
multiple random time delays. We present simulated photon spectra and light
curves and compare with RXTE data, allowing us to infer the properties of the
corona as well as the hot spot emitter.
