Nienhuis' truncated O(n) model gives rise to a model of self-avoiding loops
on the hexagonal lattice, each loop having a fugacity of n. We study such loops
subjected to a particular kind of staggered field w, which for n -> infinity
has the geometrical effect of breaking the three-phase coexistence, linked to
the three-colourability of the lattice faces. We show that at T = 0, for w > 1
the model flows to the ferromagnetic Potts model with q=n^2 states, with an
associated fragmentation of the target space of the Coulomb gas. For T>0, there
is a competition between T and w which gives rise to multicritical versions of
the dense and dilute loop universality classes. Via an exact mapping, and
numerical results, we establish that the latter two critical branches coincide
with those found earlier in the O(n) model on the triangular lattice. Using
transfer matrix studies, we have found the renormalisation group flows in the
full phase diagram in the (T,w) plane, with fixed n.<br> Superposing three
copies of such hexagonal-lattice loop models with staggered fields produces a
variety of one or three-species fully-packed loop models on the triangular
lattice with certain geometrical constraints, possessing integer central
charges 0 <= c <= 6. In particular we show that Benjamini and Schramm's RGB
loops have fractal dimension D_f = 3/2.
