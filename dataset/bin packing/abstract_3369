A critical step in the bacteriophage life cycle is genome ejection into host
bacteria. The ejection process for double-stranded DNA phages has been studied
thoroughly \textit{in vitro}, where after triggering with the cellular receptor
the genome ejects into a buffer. The experimental data have been interpreted in
terms of the decrease in free energy of the densely packed DNA associated with
genome ejection. Here we detail a simple model of genome ejection in terms of
the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures inside the phage, a bacterium, and a
buffer solution/culture medium. We argue that the hydrodynamic flow associated
with the water movement from the buffer solution into the phage capsid and
further drainage into the bacterial cytoplasm, driven by the osmotic gradient
between the bacterial cytoplasm and culture medium, provides an alternative
mechanism for phage genome ejection \textit{in vivo}; the mechanism is
perfectly consistent with phage genome ejection \textit{in vitro}.
