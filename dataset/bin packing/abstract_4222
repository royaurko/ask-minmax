We study the LHC signatures of new gauge bosons in the gauge-invariant
minimal Higgsless model. It predicts an extra pair of W_1 and Z_1 bosons which
can be as light as ~400GeV and play a key role in the delay of unitarity
violation. We analyze the W_1 signals in pp --> W_0Z_0Z_0 --> jj4\ell and pp
--> jj W_0Z_0 --> jj3\ell\nu processes at the LHC, including the complete
electroweak and QCD backgrounds. We reveal the complementarity between these
two channels for discovering the W_1 boson, and demonstrate the LHC discovery
potential over the full range of allowed W_1 mass.
