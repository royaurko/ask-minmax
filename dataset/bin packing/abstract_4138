A novel regime is proposed where, employing linearly polarized laser pulses
at intensities $10^{21}\textrm{Wcm}^{-2}$ as two order of magnitude lower than
earlier predicted [T. Esirkepov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 175003 (2004)],
ions are dominantly accelerated from ultrathin foils by the radiation pressure,
and have monoenergetic spectra. In the regime, ions accelerated from the
hole-boring process quickly catch up with the ions accelerated by target normal
sheath acceleration (TNSA), and they then join in a single bunch, undergoing a
hybrid Light-Sail/TNSA acceleration. Under an appropriate coupling condition
between foil thickness, laser intensity and pulse duration, laser radiation
pressure can be dominant in this hybrid acceleration. Two-dimensional PIC
simulations show that $1.26\textrm{GeV}$ quasimonoenergetic $\textrm{C}^{6+}$
beams are obtained by linearly polarized laser pulses at intensities of
$10^{21}\textrm{Wcm}^{-2}$.
