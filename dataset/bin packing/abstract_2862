In a series of recent papers van Gastel et al have presented first
experimental evidence that impure, Indium atoms, embedded into the first layer
of a Cu(001) surface, are not localized within the close-packed surface layers
but make concerted, long excursions visualized in a series of STM images. Such
excursions occur due to continuous reshuffling of the surface following the
position exchanges of both impure and host atoms with the naturally occuring
surface vacancies. Van Gastel et al have also formulated an original
lattice-gas type model with asymmetric exchange probabilities, whose numerical
solution is in a good agreement with the experimental data. In this paper we
propose an exact lattice solution of several versions of this model.
