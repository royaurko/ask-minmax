The predictions from a Galactic Structure and Kinematic model code are
compared to the color counts and absolute proper-motions derived from the
Southern Proper-Motion survey covering more than 700 $\deg^2$ toward the South
Galactic Pole in the range $9 < B_{\rm J} \le 19$. The theoretical assumptions
and associated computational procedures, the geometry for the kinematic model,
and the adopted parameters are presented in detail and compared to other
Galactic Kinematic models of its kind. The data to which the model is compared
consists of more than 30,000 randomly selected stars, and it is best fit by
models with a solar peculiar motion of +5 km s$^{-1}$ in the V-component
(pointing in the direction of Galactic rotation), a large LSR speed of 270 km
s$^{-1}$, and a (disk) velocity ellipsoid that always points towards the
Galactic center. The absolute proper-motions in the U-component indicate a
solar peculiar motion of $11.0 \pm 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$, with no need for a local
expansion or contraction term. The fainter absolute motions show an indication
that the thick-disk must exhibit a rather steep velocity gradient of about -36
km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ with respect to the LSR. We are not able to set
constraints on the overall rotation for the halo, nor on the thick-disk or halo
velocity dispersions. Some substructure in the U & V proper-motions could be
present in the brighter bins $10 < B_{\rm J} < 13$, and it might be indicative
of (disk) moving groups.
