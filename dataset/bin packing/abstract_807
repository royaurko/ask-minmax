We investigate some surfaces of a paradigmatic sp bonded metal--namely,
Al(110), Al(100), and Al(111)--by means of the "electron localization function"
(ELF), implemented in a first-principle pseudopotential framework. ELF is a
ground-state property which discriminates in a very sharp, quantitative, way
between different kinds of bonding. ELF shows that in the bulk of Al the
electron distribution is essentially jelliumlike, while what happens at the
surface strongly depends on packing. At the least packed surface, Al(110), ELF
indicates a free-atom nature of the electron distribution in the outer region.
The most packed surface, Al(111), is instead at the opposite end, and can be
regarded as a jellium surface weakly perturbed by the presence of the ionic
cores.
