The London ground-state energy formula as a function of number density for a
system of identical boson hard spheres, corrected for the reduced mass of a
pair of particles in a sphere-of-influence picture, and generalized to fermion
hard-sphere systems with two and four intrinsic degrees of freedom, has a
double-pole at the ultimate \textit{regular} (or periodic, e.g.,
face-centered-cubic) close-packing density usually associated with a
crystalline branch. Improved fluid branches are contructed based upon exact,
field-theoretic perturbation-theory low-density expansions for many-boson and
many-fermion systems, appropriately extrapolated to intermediate densities, but
whose ultimate density is irregular or \textit{random} closest close-packing as
suggested in studies of a classical system of hard spheres. Results show
substantially improved agreement with the best available Green-function Monte
Carlo and diffusion Monte Carlo simulations for bosons, as well as with ladder,
variational Fermi hypernetted chain, and so-called L-expansion data for
two-component fermions.
