In recent years, several encryption algorithms have been proposed to protect
digital images from cryptographic attacks. These encryption algorithms
typically use a relatively small key space and therefore, provide safe,
especially if they are of a dimension. In this paper proposes an encryption
algorithm for a new image protection scheme based on the rotation of the faces
of a Magic Cube. The original image is divided into six sub-images and these
sub-images are divided amongst a number of blocks and attached to the faces of
a Magic Cube. The faces are then scrambled using rotation of the Magic Cube.
Then the rotated image is fed to the AES algorithm which is applied to the
pixels of the image to encrypt the scrambled image. Finally, experimental
results and security analysis show that the proposed image encryption scheme
not only encrypts the picture to achieve perfect hiding, but the algorithm can
also withstand exhaustive, statistical and differential attacks.
