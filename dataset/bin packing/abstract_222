Using an analytical approach, the sensitivity to sin^2{2theta_13} with
infinite statistics in a spectral analysis is investigated in reactor neutrino
oscillation experiments with one reactor and two identical detectors. We derive
an useful formula for the sensitivity which depends only two parameters
sigma_db/\sqrt{n} (the uncorrelated bin-to-bin systematic error over the
square-root of the number of bins) and sigma_dB (the bin-to-bin correlated
detector specific systematic error).
