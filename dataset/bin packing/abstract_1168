Using a sample of 70,793 early-type galaxies from SDSS DR7, we study the
environmental dependence of the fundamental plane relation. With the help of
the galaxy group catalogue based on SDSS DR7, we calculate the fundamental
planes in different dark matter halo mass bins for central and satellite
galaxies respectively. We find the environmental dependence of the fundamental
plane coefficients are similar in $g$, $r$, $i$ and $z$ bands. The
environmental dependence for central and satellite galaxies is significantly
different. While the fundamental plane coefficients of centrals vary
systematically with the halo mass, those of satellites are similar in different
halo mass bins. The discrepancy between centrals and satellites are significant
in small halos, but negligible in the largest halo mass bins. These results
remain the same when we only keep red galaxies, or galaxies with $b/a>0.6$, or
galaxies in a specific radius range in the sample. After the correction of the
sky background, results are still similar. We suggest that the different
environmental effects of the halo mass on centrals and satellites may arise
from the different quenching processes of them.
