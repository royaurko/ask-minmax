Metallic thin-walled round tubes are widely used as energy absorption
elements. However, lateral splash of the round tubes under impact loadings
reduces the energy absorption efficiency and may cause secondary damages.
Therefore, it is necessary to assemble and fasten round tubes together by
boundary constraints and/or fasteners between tubes, which increases the time
and labor cost and affects the mechanical performance of round tubes. In an
effort to break through this limitation, a novel self-locked energy-absorbing
system has been proposed in this paper. The proposed system is made up of
thin-walled tubes with dumbbell-shaped cross section, which are specially
designed to interlock with each other and thus provide lateral constraint under
impact loadings. Both finite element simulations and impact experiment
demonstrated that without boundary constraints or fasteners between tubes, the
proposed self-locked energy-absorbing system can still effectively attenuate
impact loads while the round tube systems fail to carry load due to the lateral
splashing of tubes. Furthermore, the optimal geometric design for a single
dumbbell-shaped tube and the optimal stacking arrangement for the system are
discussed, and a general guideline on the structural design of the proposed
self-locked energy absorbing system is provided.
