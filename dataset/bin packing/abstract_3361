Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold with negative curvature, and let C_-,
C_+ be two properly immersed closed convex subsets of M. We survey the
asymptotic behaviour of the number of common perpendiculars of length at most s
from C_- to C_+, giving error terms and counting with weights, starting from
the work of Huber, Herrmann, Margulis and ending with the works of the contributors.
We describe the relationship with counting problems in circle packings of
Kontorovich, Oh, Shah. We survey the tools used to obtain the precise
asymptotics (Bowen-Margulis and Gibbs measures, skinning measures). We describe
several arithmetic applications, in particular the ones by the contributors on the
asymptotics of the number of representations of integers by binary quadratic,
Hermitian or Hamiltonian forms.
