We study left-right symmetric models which contain only fermion and gauge
boson fields and no elementary scalars. The Higgs bosons are generated
dynamically through a set of gauge- and parity-invariant 4-fermion operators.
It is shown that in a model with a composite bi-doublet and two triplet scalars
there is no parity breaking at low energies, whereas in the model with two
doublets instead of two triplets parity is broken automatically regardless of
the choice of the parameters of the model. For phenomenologically allowed
values of the right-handed scale a tumbling symmetry breaking mechanism is
realized in which parity breaking at a high scale $\mu_R$ propagates down and
eventually causes the \EW symmetry breaking at the scale $\mu_{EW}\sim
100~GeV$. The model exhibits a number of low and intermediate mass Higgs bosons
with certain relations between their masses. In particular, the components of
the $SU(2)_L$ Higgs doublet $\chi_L$ are pseudo--\GBs of an accidental
(approximate) $SU(4)$ symmetry of the Higgs potential and therefore are
expected to be relatively light.
