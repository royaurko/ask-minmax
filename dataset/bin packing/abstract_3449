A 2D antenna array introduces a new level of control and additional degrees
of freedom in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems particularly for
the so-called "massive MIMO" systems. To accurately assess the performance
gains of these large arrays, existing azimuth-only channel models have been
extended to handle 3D channels by modeling both the elevation and azimuth
dimensions. In this paper, we study the channel correlation matrix of a generic
ray-based 3D channel model, and our analysis and simulation results demonstrate
that the 3D correlation matrix can be well approximated by a Kronecker
production of azimuth and elevation correlations. This finding lays the
theoretical support for the usage of a product codebook for reduced complexity
feedback from the receiver to the transmitter. We also present the design of a
product codebook based on Grassmannian line packing.
