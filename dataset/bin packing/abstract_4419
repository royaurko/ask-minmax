We report the synthesis and characterization of bulk form diluted magnetic
semiconductors I-II-V Li1.1(Zn1-xCrx)As (x = 0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15)with a
cubic crystal structure identical to that of III-V GaAs and II-VI zinc-blende
ZnSe. With p-type carriers created by excess Li, 10% Cr substitution for Zn
results in a ferromagnetic ordering below TC ~ 218 K. Li(Zn,Cr)As represents
another magnetic semiconducting system with the advantage of decoupling
carriers and spins, where carriers are created by adding extra Li and spins are
introduced by Cr substitution for Zn.
