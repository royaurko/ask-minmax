We investigate next nearest neighbor correlations of the contact number in
simulations of polydisperse, frictionless packings in two dimensions. We find
that discs with few contacting neighbors are predominantly in contact with
discs that have many neighbors and vice versa at all packing fractions. This
counter-intuitive result can be explained by drawing a direct analogy to the
Aboav-Weaire law in cellular structures. We find an empirical one parameter
relation similar to the Aboav-Weaire law that satisfies an exact sum rule
constraint. Surprisingly, there are no correlations in the radii between
neighboring particles, despite correlations between contact number and radius.
