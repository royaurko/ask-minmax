Using discrete calculus, we derive the missing stress-geometry equation for
rigid granular materials in two dimensions, in the mean-field approximation. We
show that (i) the equation imposes that the voids cannot carry stress, (ii)
stress transmission is generically elliptic and has a quantitative relation to
anisotropic elasticity, and (iii) the packing fabric plays an essential role.
