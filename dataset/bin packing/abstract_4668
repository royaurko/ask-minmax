The Majorana Experiment is a next-generation Ge-76 double-beta decay search.
It will employ 500 kg of Ge, isotopically enriched to 86% in Ge-76, in the form
of 200 detectors in a close-packed array for high granularity. Each crystal
will be electronically segmented, with each region fitted with pulse-shape
analysis electronics. A half-life sensitivity is predicted of 4.2e27 y or
<m_nu> < 0.02-0.07 eV, depending on the nuclear matrix elements used to
interpret the data.
