We show that all closed symplectic 4-manifolds have the packing stability
property: there are no obstructions beyond volume to embedding a collection of
sufficiently small balls. This generalizes a theorem of Biran which gives the
same result under the assumption that the symplectic form lies in a rational
cohomology class.
