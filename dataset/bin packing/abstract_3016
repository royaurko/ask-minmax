We compute the leading contribution to the E2/M1 mixing ratio of the decay
$\Delta\rightarrow N\gamma$ in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We find
the mixing ratio to be $4\% \ltap |\delta_{\rm E2/M1}| \ltap 11\%$, much larger
than estimates based on the quark model and other hadronic models. We also
compute the mixing ratio for the radiative decay of the hyperon resonances. The
decays $\Sigma^{*+}\rightarrow\Sigma^+\gamma$ and
$\Xi^{*-}\rightarrow\Xi^-\gamma$ provide a particularly sensitive probe of
deviations from heavy baryon spin-flavour SU(6).
