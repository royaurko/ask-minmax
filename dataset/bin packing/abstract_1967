Performing light scattering experiments we show that introducing short-ranged
attraction to a colloidal suspension of nearly hard spheres by addition of free
polymer produces new glass transition phenomena. We observe a dramatic
acceleration of the density fluctuations amounting to the melting of a
colloidal glass. Increasing the strength of the attractions the system freezes
into another nonergodic state sharing some qualitative features with gel states
occurring at lower colloid packing fractions. This reentrant glass transition
is in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions.
