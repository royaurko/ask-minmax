The general concept of entangled photon holes is based on a correlated
absence of photon pairs in an otherwise constant optical background. Here we
consider the specialized case when this background is confined to two
well-defined time bins, which allows the formation of time-bin entangled photon
holes. We show that when the typical coherent state background is replaced by a
true single-photon (Fock state) background, the basic time-bin entangled
photon-hole state becomes equivalent to one of the time-bin entangled
photon-pair states. We experimentally demonstrate these ideas using a
parametric down-conversion photon-pair source, linear optics, and
post-selection to violate a Bell inequality with time-bin entangled photon
holes.
