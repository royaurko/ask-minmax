This paper presents a new highly stable periodic approximant to the Al-based
F-type icosahedral quasicrystals, i-Al-Pd-TM (TM=transition metals). The
structure of this intermetallic Al-Pd-Cr-Fe compound is determined ab initio
using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, where the space group is identified to
be Pa-3 and the lattice constant 40.5 angstrom. The structure is well described
as a dense packing of clusters of two kinds, which are known in the literature
as the pseudo-Mackay type and the Bergman type clusters. The clusters are
centered at the vertices of a canonical cell tiling, in which the parity of
each vertex determines the kind of the associated cluster. Adjacent clusters
can be markedly interpenetrated, while the structure requires no glue atoms to
fill in the gaps between the clusters. It is shown that the crystal can be
designated as a 2x2x2 superstructure of the ordinary cubic 3/2 rational
approximant. The superlattice ordering is shown to be of a different kind from
the P-type superlattice ordering previously reported in i-Al-Pd-Mn. The present
results will greatly improve the understanding of atomic structures of F-type
icosahedral quasicrystals and their approximants.
