We present version 1.0 of the ISOGAL-DENIS Point Source Catalogue (PSC),
containing more than 100,000 point sources detected at 7 and/or 15 micron in
the ISOGAL survey of the inner Galaxy with the ISOCAM instrument on board the
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). These sources are cross-identified, wherever
possible, with near-infrared (0.8-2.2 micron) data from the DENIS survey. The
overall surface covered by the ISOGAL survey is about 16 square degrees, mostly
(95%) distributed near the Galactic plane (|b| < 1 deg), where the source
extraction can become confusion limited and perturbed by the high background
emission. Therefore, special care has been taken aimed at limiting the
photometric error to ~0.2 magnitude down to a sensitivity limit of typically 10
mJy. The present paper gives a complete description of the entries and the
information which can be found in this catalogue, as well as a detailed
discussion of the data processing and the quality checks which have been
completed. The catalogue is available via the VizieR Service at the Centre de
Donn\'ees Astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS,
http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR/) and also via the server at the
Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (http://www-isogal.iap.fr/). A more complete
version of this paper, including a detailed description of the data processing,
is available in electronic form through the ADS service.
