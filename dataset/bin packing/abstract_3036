George Voronoi (1908, 1909) introduced two important reduction methods for
positive quadratic forms: the reduction with perfect forms, and the reduction
with L-type domains, often called domains of Delaunay type. The first method is
important in studies of dense lattice packings of spheres. The second method
provides the key tools for finding the least dense lattice coverings with equal
spheres in lower dimensions. In his investigations Voronoi heavily relied on
that in dimensions less than 6 the partition of the cone of positive quadratic
forms into L-types refines the partition of this cone into perfect domains.
Voronoi conjectured implicitely and Dickson (1972) explicitely that the
L-partition is always a refinement of the partition into perfect domains. This
was proved for n =< 5 (Voronoi, Delaunay, Ryshkov, Baranovskii). We show that
Voronoi-Dickson conjecture fails already in dimension 6.
