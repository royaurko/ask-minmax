We report here results on the long time behaviour of the variable source 4U
1722-30, obtained from INTEGRAL non-continuous observations carried out between
2003 and 2009. During this period 4U 1722-30 shows a general persistent
emission along with several bright outbursts resembling those of transient
X-ray sources/X-ray novae. However the source never switches into a real
quiescent state, with very weak or undetectable flux level, as it normally
occurs in transient sources. We compare here flux ratios and spectral state
variations measured during the different outbursts and highlight the peculiar
character of the 2008 outburst, for which we also propose a specific physical
explanation.
