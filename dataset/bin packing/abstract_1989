The formation of gold nanowires in vacuum at room temperature reveals a
periodic spectrum of exceptionally stable diameters. This is identified as
shell structure similar to that which was recently discovered for alkali metals
at low temperatures. The gold nanowires present two competing `magic' series of
stable diameters, one governed by electronic structure and the other by the
atomic packing.
