We consider realistic long-haul optical links, with linear and nonlinear
impairments, and investigate the application of time-frequency packing with
low-order constellations as a possible solution to increase the spectral
efficiency. A detailed comparison with available techniques from the literature
will be also performed. We will see that this technique represents a feasible
solution to overcome the relevant theoretical and technological issues related
to this spectral efficiency increase and could be more effective than the
simple adoption of high-order modulation formats.
