We present recent developments concerning Higgs production in bottom quark
annihilation and gluon fusion. For bottom quark annihilation, we show the
transverse momentum distribution of the associated jets. Furthermore, we
discuss the distribution of events into n-jet bins for n=0 and n>0 at NNLO and
NLO, respectively. For gluon fusion, the quality of the heavy-top limit for
differential quantities at O(\alpha_s^4) is studied by taking into account
higher order terms in the 1/m_{top} expansion.
