We compute in the instanton vacuum the nucleon matrix elements of the twist-4
QCD operators describing power corrections to the second moments of the
unpolarized structure functions, F_L and F_2. Our approach takes into account
the leading contribution in the packing fraction of the instanton medium, rho /
R << 1. Parametrically leading are the matrix elements of a twist-4 quark-gluon
operator, which are of the order of the inverse instanton size, 1/rho^2 = (600
MeV)^2. The matrix elements of the four-fermion (diquark) operators are
suppressed by a factor (rho / R)^4 and numerically small. These results are in
agreement with the pattern of phenomenological 1/Q^2-corrections to R = sigma_L
/ sigma_T and F_2 found in QCD fits to the data. In particular, the rise of R
at low Q^2 can be obtained from instanton-type vacuum fluctuations at a low
scale.
