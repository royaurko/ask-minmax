We consider several classical results related to the Hausdorff dimension of
exceptional sets of orthogonal projections and try to find out whether they
have reasonable formulations in terms of packing dimension. We also investigate
the existence of category versions for Marstrand and Falconer-Howroyd-type
projection results.
