Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to investigate the diffusion
behavior of penetrable-sphere model fluids characterized by a finite energy
barrier $\epsilon$. The self-diffusion coefficient is evaluated from the
time-dependent velocity autocorrelation function and mean-square displacement.
Detailed insights into the cluster formation for penetrable spheres are gained
from the Enskog factor, the effective particle volume fraction, the mean free
path, and the collision frequency for both the soft-type penetrable and the
hard-type reflective collisions. The simulation data are compared to
theoretical predictions from the Boltzmann kinetic equation and from a simple
extension to finite $\epsilon$ of the Enskog prediction for impenetrable hard
spheres ($\epsilon\to\infty$). A reasonable agreement between theoretical and
simulation results is found in the cases of $\epsilon^*\equiv
\epsilon/k_BT=0.2$, $0.5$, and $1.0$. However, for dense systems (packing
fraction $\phi>0.6$) with a highly repulsive energy barrier ($\epsilon^*=3.0$),
a poorer agreement was observed due to metastable static effects of clustering
formation and dynamic effects of correlated collision processes among these
cluster-forming particles.
