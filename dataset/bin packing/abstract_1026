In this article we study D1-D3 (or $\bar{\textrm{D}3}$) brane systems with
generic constant electric and magnetic fluxes in IIB string theory. We work out
all possible supersymmetric configurations and find out via T-duality all of
them and corresponding supersymmetry conditions could be related to the
supersymmetric intersecting D1-D1 pairs. And we do D1-D3 (or
$\bar{\textrm{D}3}$) open string quantization for a class of configurations. We
find that there are many near massless states in NS sector for near-BPS
configurations. Furthermore we calculate open string pair creation rate in
generic nonsupersymmetric configurations.
