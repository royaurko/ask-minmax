We present photometry of the transient associated with GRB 030329 obtained
with the CTIO 1.3--meter telescope and the ANDICAM instrument, a dual
optical/infrared imager with a dichroic centered at one micron. Without the
need for light curve interpolation to produce snapshot broadband spectra, we
show that the transient spectrum remained statistically achromatic from day 2.7
to day 5.6, during a re-brightening episode. Associating the light in these
early epochs with the GRB afterglow, we infer a modest level of extinction due
to the host galaxy in the line--of--sight toward the GRB: A_V(host) = 0.30 +/-
0.03 mag for beta = -0.5 and A_V(host) < 0.4 mag (3 sigma) for any physically
plausible value of beta (with flux f_nu ~ lambda^-beta). We conclude that the
spectral slope of the afterglow component was more than beta = -0.8 between day
2.7-5.6 after the GRB, excluding the possibility that the synchrotron cooling
break passed through the optical/IR bandpass over that period. Taking
extinction into account, a decomposition of the light curve into an afterglow
and supernova component requires the presence of a supernova similar to that of
SN 1998bw, an afterglow that shows some evidence for a second break around day
8-10, and a fifth re-brightening event around day 15. Assuming an SN
1988bw-like evolution and a contemporaneous GRB and SN event, the peak SN
brightness was M_V = -19.8 +/- 0.4 - 5 log h_65 mag.
