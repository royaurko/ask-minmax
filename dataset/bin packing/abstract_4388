Stochastic transport of a two-dimensional (2D) dusty plasma liquid with a
perpendicular magnetic field is studied. Superdiffusion, which is a type of
non-Fickian transport, is found to occur especially at higher magnetic fields
with $\beta$ of order unity. Here, $\beta = \omega_c / \omega_{pd}$ is the
ratio of the cyclotron and plasma frequencies for dust particles. The
mean-square displacement ${\rm {MSD}} = 4 D_\alpha t^\alpha$ is found to have
an exponent $\alpha > 1$, indicating superdiffusion, with $\alpha$ increasing
monotonically to $1.1$ as $\beta$ increases to unity. The 2D Langevin molecular
dynamics simulation used here also reveals that another indicator of random
particle motion, the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF), has a dominant
peak frequency $\omega_{peak}$ that empirically obeys $\omega_{peak}^2 =
\omega_c^2+ \omega_{pd}^2/4$.
