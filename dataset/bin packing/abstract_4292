We numerically study the evolution of a boost-invariant N=4 SYM medium using
AdS/CFT. We consider a toy model for the collision of gravitational shock
waves, finding that the energy density first increases, reaches a maximum and
then starts to decrease, matching hydrodynamics for late times. For the initial
conditions we consider, the hydrodynamic scale governing the late time
behaviour is to very good approximation determined by the area of the black
hole horizon at initial times. Our results provide a toy model for the early
time evolution of the bulk system in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC.
