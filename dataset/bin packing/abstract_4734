NpT ensemble Monte Carlo simulations were performed for fully flexible
Lennard-Jones chains in the solid phase. The bond length between monomers
within the chains is fixed to $L=\sigma$ and the molecule is free to adopt any
configuration. The solid structure of fully flexible chains is obtained by
randomly locating the bonds of the chain within a face centered cubic close
packed arrangement of atoms. For fully flexible chains it is believed that the
stable solid phase is disordered. Such a solid is considered in this work.
Computer simulations were performed for chains with $m=3, 4$ and 5 monomer
units, and results were obtained for the equation of state and internal energy
of the chains. An extension of Wertheim's TPT1 to the solid phase of
Lennard-Jones chains (C.Vega, F.J.Blas and A.Galindo, J.Chem.Phys.,{\bf
116},7645,2002) has been proposed recently. The simulation results of this work
provide a check on the performance of this theory. It is found that Wertheim's
TPT1 successfully predicts the equation of state and internal energies of fully
flexible LJ chains in the solid phase. Finally, a rigid LJ chain in a linear
configuration has been considered. Computer simulations were also performed for
the rigid chain in an ordered solid structure. It is found that fully flexible
and linear rigid chains present quite different equations of state and
different thermodynamic properties in the solid phase.
