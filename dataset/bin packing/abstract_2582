We study a new anisotropic inflation model, with an inflaton field
nonminimally coupled with the gravity and a vector field. We find that the
anisotropic attractor solution exists not only in the weak curvature coupling
limit, but more interestingly in the strong curvature coupling limit as well.
We show that in the strong curvature coupling limit, the contribution from the
anisotropy is greatly suppressed.
