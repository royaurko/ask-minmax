We consider the fluid dual of $(d+2)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein equation
either with or without a cosmological constant. The background solutions admit
black hole event horizons and the spatial sections of the horizons are
conformally flat. Therefore, a $d$-dimensional flat Euclidean space
$\mathbb{E}^d$ is contained in the conformal class of the spatial section of
the black hole horizon. A compressible, forced, stationary and viscous fluid
system can be constructed on the product (Newtonian) spacetime
$\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{E}^d$ as the lowest order fluctuation modes around
such black hole background. This construction provides the first example of
holographic duality which is beyond the class of bulk/boundary correspondence.
