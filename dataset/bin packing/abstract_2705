In this paper, we introduced a novel approach to computing the fewest-turn
map directions or routes based on the concept of natural roads. Natural roads
are joined road segments that perceptually constitute good continuity. This
approach relies on the connectivity of natural roads rather than that of road
segments for computing routes or map directions. Because of this, the derived
routes posses the fewest turns. However, what we intend to achieve are the
routes that not only possess the fewest turns, but are also as short as
possible. This kind of map direction is more effective and favorable by people,
because they bear less cognitive burden. Furthermore, the computation of the
routes is more efficient, since it is based on the graph encoding the
connectivity of roads, which is significantly smaller than the graph of road
segments. We made experiments applied to eight urban street networks from North
America and Europe in order to illustrate the above stated advantages. The
experimental results indicate that the fewest-turn routes posses fewer turns
and shorter distances than the simplest paths and the routes provided by Google
Maps. For example, the fewest-turn-and-shortest routes are on average 15%
shorter than the routes suggested by Google Maps, while the number of turns is
just half as much. This approach is a key technology behind FromToMap.org - a
web mapping service using openstreetmap data.
