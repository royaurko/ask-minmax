Power spectra of human DNA base C+G frequency distribution in all available
contiguous sections exhibit the universal inverse power law form of the
statistical normal distribution for the 24 chromosomes. Inverse power law form
for power spectra of space-time fluctuations is generic to dynamical systems in
nature and indicate long-range space-time correlations. A recently developed
general systems theory predicts the observed non-local connections as intrinsic
to quantumlike chaos governing space-time fluctuations of dynamical systems.
The model predicts the following. (1) The quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern
for the nested coiled structure of the DNA molecule in the chromosome resulting
in maximum packing efficiency. (2) The DNA molecule functions as a unified
whole fuzzy logic network with ordered two-way signal transmission between the
coding and non-coding regions. Recent studies indicate influence of non-coding
regions on functions of coding regions in the DNA molecule.
