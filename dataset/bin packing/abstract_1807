High-statistics differential cross sections and spin density matrix elements
for the reaction gamma p -> p omega have been measured using the CLAS at
Jefferson Lab for center-of-mass (CM) energies from threshold up to 2.84 GeV.
Results are reported in 112 10-MeV wide CM energy bins, each subdivided into
cos(theta_CM) bins of width 0.1. These are the most precise and extensive omega
photoproduction measurements to date. A number of prominent structures are
clearly present in the data. Many of these have not previously been observed
due to limited statistics in earlier measurements.
