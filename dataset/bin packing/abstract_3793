The flux of neutrino-induced muons has been measured with the MACRO detector.
Different event topologies have been detected, due to neutrino interactions in
the apparatus and in the rock below it. The upward-throughgoing muon sample is
the larger one and is generated by neutrinos with an average energy of ~ 100
GeV. The observed upward-throughgoing muons are 26% fewer than expected and the
zenith angle distribution does not fit with the expected one. Assuming neutrino
oscillations, both measurements suggest maximum mixing and Dm2 of a few times
10-3 eV2. The other event categories due to interactions of low-energy
neutrinos (average energy ~ 4 GeV) have been recently studied and the results
of these new analyses are presented for the first time at this workshop. These
data show a regular deficit of observed events in each angular bin, as expected
assuming neutrino oscillations with maximum mixing, in agreement with the
analysis of the upward-throughgoing muona sample.
