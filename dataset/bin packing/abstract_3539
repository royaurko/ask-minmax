Devising a statistical mechanics framework for jammed granular materials is a
challenging task as those systems do not share some important properties
required to characterize them with statistical thermodynamics tools. In a
recent paper [Asenjo et al. PRL, 2014], a new definition of a granular entropy,
that puts the protocol used to generate the packings at its roots, has been
proposed. Following up these results, it is shown that the protocol used in
[Asenjo et al. PRL, 2014] can be recast as a canonical ensemble with a
particular value of the temperature. Signature of gaussianity for large system
sizes strongly suggests an asymptotic equivalence with a corresponding
microcanonical ensemble where jammed states with certain basin volumes are
sampled uniformly. We argue that this microcanonical ensemble is not Edwards'
microcanonical ensemble and generalize this argument to other protocols.
