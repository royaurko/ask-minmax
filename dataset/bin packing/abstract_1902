Employing density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the
generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSFE) curves along two crystallographic
slips, glide and shuffle, for both pristine graphene and impurity of boron (B)
or nitrogen (N) doped graphene were examined. The effects of B and N doping on
the GSFE were clarified and correlated with local electron interactions and
bonding configurations. The GSFE data were then used to analyze dislocation
dipole and core structure, and subsequently combined with the Peierls-Nabarro
(P-N) model to examine the role of doping on several key characteristics of
dislocations in graphene. We showed that the GSFE curve may be significantly
altered by the presence of dopants, which subsequently leads to profound
modulations of dislocation properties, such as increasing spontaneous
pair-annihilation distance and reducing resistance to dislocation slip. Our
results indicate that doping can play an important role in controlling
dislocation density and microscopic plasticity in graphene, thereby providing
critical insights for dopant-mediated defect engineering in graphene.
