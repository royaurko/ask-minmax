In this paper we introduce the \emph{robust coin flip} problem in which one
must design an abstract tile assembly system (aTAM system) whose terminal
assemblies can be partitioned such that the final assembly lies within either
partition with exactly probability 1/2, regardless of what relative
concentration assignment is given to the tile types of the system. We show that
robust coin flipping is possible within the aTAM, and that such systems can
guarantee a worst case $\mathcal{O}(1)$ space usage. As an application, we then
combine our coin-flip system with the result of Chandran, Gopalkrishnan, and
Reif~\cite{ChaGopRei12} to show that for any positive integer $n$, there exists
a $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ tile system that assembles a constant-width linear
assembly of expected length $n$ that works for all concentration assignments.
We accompany our primary construction with variants that show trade-offs in
space complexity, initial seed size, temperature, tile complexity, bias, and
extensibility, and also prove some negative results. Further, we consider the
harder scenario in which tile concentrations change arbitrarily at each
assembly step and show that while this is not solvable in the aTAM, this
version of the problem can be solved by more exotic tile assembly models from
the literature.
