We propose a simple route to evaluate the static structure, in terms of
average coordination, of completely disordered solids with spherical
constituents, from ca. 55% volume fraction up to random close packing, in the
absence of structural heterogeneities. Based on the current understanding,
according to which the structure-determining interaction in amorphous solids is
the hard-core repulsion while weaker, longer-range interactions are mere
perturbations, the model yields the average coordination in the solid as a
result of a hyperquenching process where the instantaneous structure of the
precursor liquid snapshot is distorted to the same degree required to quench
the hard-sphere liquid into the isostatic jammed state at 64% volume fraction.
The characteristic length of distortion turns out to be about 3% of the
particle diameter. Extrapolating to lower volume fractions, this is thus the
quenching route leading to the most spatially homogeneous states. Thus the
model can be usefully employed to quantitatively assess the degree of
structural inhomogeneity in amorphous solids. When spatial inhomogeneity is
small, as for very dense systems, the model can be used to evaluate
coordination-dependent macroscopic properties (e.g. the elastic moduli) as
shown in parallel works.
