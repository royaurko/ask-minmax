A Monte Carlo program solving Boltzmann equation for partons via cascade
method is presented. At presented, only gluon-gluon elastic scattering is
included. The scattering cross section is regulated by a medium generated
screening mass. Three different geometric modes (3 dimension expansion, 1-d
expansion, and scattering inside a box) are provided for theoretical study of
the parton transport and the applicability of the cascade method. Space cell
division is available to save the number of computer operations. This improves
the speed of the calculation by a large factor and makes the code best
optimized for simulation of parton cascade in ultrarelativistic heavy ion
collisions.
