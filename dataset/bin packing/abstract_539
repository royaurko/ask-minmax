We investigate the unjamming response of disordered packings of frictional
hard disks with the help of computer simulations. First, we generate jammed
configurations of the disks and then force them to move again by local
perturbations. We study the spatial distribution of the stress and displacement
response and find long range effects of the perturbation in both cases. We
record the penetration depth of the displacements and the critical force that
is needed to make the system yield. These quantities are tested in two types of
systems: in ideal homogeneous packings in zero gravity and in packings settled
under gravity. The penetration depth and the critical force are sensitive to
the interparticle friction coefficient. Qualitatively, the same nonmonotonic
friction dependence is found both with and without gravity, however the
location of the extrema are at different friction values. We discuss the role
of the connectivity of the contact network and of the pressure gradient in the
unjamming response.
