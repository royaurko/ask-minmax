Deviations from general relativity in order to explain cosmic acceleration
generically have both time and scale dependent signatures in cosmological data.
We extend our previous work by investigating model independent gravitational
deviations in bins of redshift and length scale, by incorporating further
cosmological probes such as temperature-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy
cross-correlations, and by examining correlations between deviations. Markov
Chain Monte Carlo likelihood analysis of the model independent parameters
fitting current data indicates that at low redshift general relativity deviates
from the best fit at the 99% confidence level. We trace this to two different
properties of the CFHTLS weak lensing data set and demonstrate that COSMOS weak
lensing data does not show such deviation. Upcoming galaxy survey data will
greatly improve the ability to test time and scale dependent extensions to
gravity and we calculate the constraints that the BigBOSS galaxy redshift
survey could enable.
