Using density functional theory with added on-site interactions (DFT+U), we
study the electronic structure of bulk, monolayer, and bilayer of the layered
transition-metal dichalcogenide $1T-TaS_2$. We show that a two-dimensional
spin--$\frac{1}{2}$ Mott-phase exists for the monolayer in the charge-density
wave state (CDW) and that such a phase is systematically destroyed by packing
of the distorted layers leading to a one dimensional metal for bulk,
CDW-distorted TaS$_2$. The latter finding is in contrast with previous DMFT
predictions --disagreement we explain by the weak effective interaction felt by
the electrons in the CDW state. Experimental observations of insulating
behavior may arise from disorder due to stacking faults.
