This note addresses the meander enumeration problem: "Count all topologically
inequivalent configurations of a closed planar non self-intersecting curve
crossing a line through a given number of points". We review a description of
meanders introduced recently in terms of the coupling to gravity of a
two-flavored fully-packed loop model. The subsequent analytic predictions for
various meandric configuration exponents are checked against exact enumeration,
using a transfer matrix method, with an excellent agreement.
