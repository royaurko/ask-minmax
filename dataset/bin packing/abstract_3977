Absolute flux distributions for seven solar analog stars are measured from
0.3 to 2.5 \mu m by HST spectrophotometry.In order to predict the longer
wavelength mid-IR fluxes that are required for JWST calibration, the HST SEDs
are fit with Castelli & Kurucz model atmospheres; and the results are compared
with fits from the MARCS model grid. The rms residuals in 10 broad band bins
are all <0.5% for the best fits from both model grids. However, the fits differ
systematically: The MARCS fits are 40-100 K hotter in T_{eff}, 0.25-0.80 higher
in log g, 0.01-0.10 higher in log z, and 0.008-0.021 higher in the reddening
E(B-V), probably because their specifications include different metal
abundances. Despite these differences in the parameters of the fits, the
predicted mid-IR fluxes differ by only ~1%; and the modeled flux distributions
of these G stars have an estimated ensemble accuracy of 2% out to 30 \mu m.
