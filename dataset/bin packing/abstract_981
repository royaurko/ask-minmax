In this letter, we present the general form of equations that generate a
volume-preserving flow on a symplectic manifold (M, \omega). It is shown that
every volume-preserving flow has some 2-forms acting the role of the
Hamiltonian functions in the Hamiltonian mechanics and the ordinary Hamilton
equations are included as a special case with a 2-form \frac{1}{n-1} H \omega
where H is the corresponding Hamiltonian.
