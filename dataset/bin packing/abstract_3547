Memory devices operating due to the fast proton transfer (PT) process are
proposed by means of the first-principles calculations. Writing an information
is performed using the electrostatic potential of the scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM). Reading an information is based on the effect of the local
magnetization induced at the zigzag graphene nanoribbon (Z-GNR) edge -
saturated with oxygen or hydroxy group - and can be realized with the use of
giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices. The energetic barriers for the
hop-forward and -backward processes can be tuned by the distance and potential
of the STM tip, thus enabling to tailor the non-volatile logic states. The
proposed system enables very dense packing of the logic cells and it could be
used in the random access and flash memory devices.
