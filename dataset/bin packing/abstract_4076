One of the goals of COMPASS experiment is the determination of the gluon
polarisation, \Delta G/G, for a deep understanding of the spin structure of the
nucleon. The gluon polarisation can be measured via the Photon-Gluon-Fusion
(PGF) process. One of the methods to identify this process is selecting high
p_T hadron pairs in the final state. The data used for this analysis were
collected by the COMPASS experiment during the years 2002 to 2006, using a 160
GeV naturally polarised positive muon beam impinging on a polarised nucleon
target. A new result of \Delta G/G from high p_T hadron pairs in events with
Q^2>1 GeV^2 is presented. This result has a better precision due to the
addition of 2006 data and an improved analysis based on a neural network
approach. The gluon polarisation is also presented in three bins of x_G.
