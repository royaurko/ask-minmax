We consider Slepian-Wolf (SW) coding of multiple sources and extend the
packing bound and the notion of perfect code from conventional channel coding
to SW coding with more than two sources. We then introduce Hamming Codes for
Multiple Sources (HCMSs) as a potential solution of perfect SW coding for
arbitrary number of terminals. Moreover, we study the case with three sources
in detail. We present the necessary conditions of a perfect SW code and show
that there exists infinite number of HCMSs. Moreover, we show that for a
perfect SW code with sufficiently long code length, the compression rates of
different sources can be trade-off flexibly. Finally, we relax the construction
procedure of HCMS and call the resulting code generalized HCMS. We prove that
every perfect SW code for Hamming sources is equivalent to a generalized HCMS.
