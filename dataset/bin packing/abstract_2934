Using a version of density-functional theory which combines Onsager
approximation and fundamental-measure theory for spatially nonuniform phases,
we have studied the phase diagram of freely rotating hard rectangles and hard
discorectangles. We find profound differences in the phase behavior of these
models, which can be attributed to their different packing properties.
Interestingly, bimodal orientational distribution functions are found in the
nematic phase of hard rectangles, which cause a certain degree of biaxial
order, albeit metastable with respect to spatially ordered phases. This feature
is absent in discorectangles, which always show unimodal behavior. This result
may be relevant in the light of recent experimental results which have
confirmed the existence of biaxial phases. We expect that some perturbation of
the particle shapes (either a certain degree of polydispersity or even bimodal
dispersity in the aspect ratios) may actually destabilize spatially ordered
phases thereby stabilizing the biaxial phase.
