Experimental analysis of data from particle collisions is typically expressed
as statistical limits on a few benchmark models of particular, often
historical, interest. The implications of the data for other theoretical models
(current or future) may be powerful, but they cannot typically be calculated
from the published information, except in the simplest case of a single-bin
counting experiment. We present a novel solution to this long-standing problem
by expressing the new model as a linear combination of models from published
experimental analysis, allowing for the trivial calculation of limits on a
nearly arbitrary model. We present tests in simple toy experiments, demonstrate
self-consistency by using published results to reproduce other published
results on the same spectrum, and provide a reinterpretation of a search for
chiral down-type heavy quarks ($b'$) in terms of a search for an exotic heavy
quark ($T$) with similar but distinct phenomenology. We find $m_T>419$ GeV at
95% CL, currently the strongest limits if the $T$ quark decays via
$T\rightarrow Wb, T\rightarrow tZ$ and $T\rightarrow tH$.
