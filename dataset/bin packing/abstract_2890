The flow and deposition of polydisperse granular materials is simulated
through the Magnetic Diffusion Limited Aggregation (MDLA) model. The random
walk undergone by an entity in the MDLA model is modified such that the
trajectories are ballistic in nature, leading to a magnetically controlled
ballistic deposition (MBD) model. This allows to obtain important ingredients
about a difficult problem that of the nonequilibrium segregation of
polydisperse sandpiles and heterogeneous adsorption of a binary distribution of
particles which can interact with each other and with an external field. Our
detailed results from many simulations of MBD clusters on a two dimensional
triangular lattice above a flat surface in a vertical finite size box for
binary systems indicates intriguing variations of the density,
''magnetization'', types of clusters, and fractal dimensions. We derive the
field and grain interaction dependent susceptibility and compressibility. We
deduce a completely new phase diagram for binary granular piles and discuss its
complexity inherent to different grain competition and cluster growth
probabilities.
