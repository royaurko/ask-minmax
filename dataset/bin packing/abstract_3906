The kinetic energy of the Skyrmion-Skyrmion system is calculated in the
product ansatz. The energy is expanded in a set of rotationally invariant
quadratic functions of translational and iso-rotational velocities in the
product ansatz and all inertial parameters are evaluated. Most of the iso-spin
dependent parameters are small at separations larger than 1 fm. However, some
parameters of the coupling between the iso-rotational velocities of the
Skyrmions decay slowly, as $1/R$, when zero pion mass is used. Otherwise we
find that the results are not sensitive to the addition of the pion mass term.
