Electropermeabilization is a method by which molecules can be introduced in
living cells through the plasma membrane. Here, we show that
electropermeabilization affects the lateral mobility of Rae-1, a GPi anchored
protein. Our results shows that 10 to 20 % of the membrane surface is occupied
by defaults or pores. Gene electrotransfert also affects the lateral mobility
of Rae-1. Furthermore, we clearly show that once inserted into the plasma
membrane, DNA totaly excludes Rae-1, indicating that DNA molecules are tightly
packed together to forms huge aggregates.
