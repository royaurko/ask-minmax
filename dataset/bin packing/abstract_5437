We construct the rest-frame 2--10 keV intrinsic X-ray luminosity function of
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) from a combination of X-ray surveys from the
all-sky Swift BAT survey to the Chandra Deep Field-South. We use ~3200 AGNs in
our analysis, which covers six orders of magnitude in flux. The inclusion of
the XMM and Chandra COSMOS data has allowed us to investigate the detailed
behavior of the XLF and evolution. In deriving our XLF, we take into account
realistic AGN spectrum templates, absorption corrections, and probability
density distributions in photometric redshift. We present an analytical
expression for the overall behavior of the XLF in terms of the
luminosity-dependent density evolution, smoothed two power-law expressions in
11 redshift shells, three-segment power-law expression of the number density
evolution in four luminosity classes, and binned XLF. We observe a sudden
flattening of the low luminosity end slope of the XLF slope at z>~0.6. Detailed
structures of the AGN downsizing have been also revealed, where the number
density curves have two clear breaks at all luminosity classes above log LX>43.
The two break structure is suggestive of two-phase AGN evolution, consisting of
major merger triggering and secular processes.
