Versions of the Damn Yankee Controller (DYC) have been used to read out
digitizers on the Fermilab E791, E835, FOCUS, SELEX, and KTeV experiments. The
DYC accepts 16-bit data and control signals from 10 MHz Emitter Coupled Logic
(ECL) PORT digitizing modules such as LeCroy CAMAC PCOS latches and FERA Analog
to Digital Converters (ADCs). Data is packed into First In First Out (FIFO)
memories as 32-bit longwords. Complete events including data, a leading word
count, and an Event Synchronization Number are transmitted to a data
destination. The DYC described here was meant to be simple and fast and was
designed and built in a period of three weeks.
