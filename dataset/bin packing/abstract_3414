The calculation of multivariate normal probabilities is of great importance
in many statistical and economic applications. This paper proposes a spherical
Monte Carlo method with both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.
First, the multivariate normal probability is rewritten via an inner radial
integral and an outer spherical integral by the spherical transformation. For
the outer spherical integral, we apply an integration rule by randomly rotating
a predetermined set of well-located points. To find the desired set, we derive
an upper bound for the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator and propose a set
which is related to the kissing number problem in sphere packings. For the
inner radial integral, we employ the idea of antithetic variates and identify
certain conditions so that variance reduction is guaranteed. Extensive Monte
Carlo experiments on some probabilities calculation confirm these claims.
