We have designed a medium deep large area X-ray survey with XMM - the XMM
Large Scale Structure survey, XMM-LSS - with the scope of extending the
cosmological tests attempted using ROSAT cluster samples to two redshift bins
between 0<z<1 while maintaining the precision of earlier studies. Two main
goals have constrained the survey design: the evolutionary study of the
cluster-cluster correlation function and of the cluster number density. The
results are promising and, so far, in accordance with our predictions as to the
survey sensitivity and cluster number density. The feasibility of the programme
is demonstrated and further X-ray coverage is awaited in order to proceed with
a truly significant statistical analysis. (Abridged)
