Waves play a crucial role in diagnosing the plasma properties of various
structures in the solar corona and coronal heating. Slow magneto-acoustic (MA)
waves are one of the important magnetohydrodynamic waves. In past decades,
numerous slow MA waves were detected above the active regions and coronal
holes, but rarely found elsewhere. Here, we investigate a `tornado'-like
structure consisting of quasi-periodic streaks within a dark cavity at about
40--110 Mm above the quiet-Sun region on 2011 September 25. Our analysis
reveals that these streaks are actually slow MA wave trains. The properties of
these wave trains, including the phase speed, compression ratio, kinetic energy
density, etc., are similar to those of the reported slow MA waves, except that
the period of these waves is about 50 s, much shorter than the typical reported
values (3--5 minutes).
