The conjunction of insights from structural biology, solution biochemistry,
genetics and single molecule biophysics has provided a renewed impetus for the
construction of quantitative models of biological processes. One area that has
been a beneficiary of these experimental techniques is the study of viruses. In
this paper we describe how the insights obtained from such experiments can be
utilized to construct physical models of processes in the viral life cycle. We
focus on dsDNA bacteriophages and show that the bending elasticity of DNA and
its electrostatics in solution can be combined to determine the forces
experienced during packaging and ejection of the viral genome. Furthermore, we
quantitatively analyze the effect of fluid viscosity and capsid expansion on
the forces experienced during packaging. Finally, we present a model for DNA
ejection from bacteriophages based on the hypothesis that the energy stored in
the tightly packed genome within the capsid leads to its forceful ejection. The
predictions of our model can be tested through experiments in vitro where DNA
ejection is inhibited by the application of external osmotic pressure.
