This paper theoretically analyzes the optical transmission characteristics of
an optical waveguide when coupling to a micro cavity array. The results showed
that not only were there sharp peaks on the transmission and reflection
spectra, but also that a certain system configuration can produce a backward
wave to obtain a phase shift in the small detuning range between the incident
wave and the micro cavities. Based on a discussion of the relationship between
the transmission and the number and the dissipation coefficients of each
coupled micro cavity, the paper proposes a high efficiency all-optical switch
model.
