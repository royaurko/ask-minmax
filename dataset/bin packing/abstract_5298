The issues of energy and environment are the main constraint of sustainable
development in worldwide. Nuclear energy source is one important optional
choice for long term sustainable development. The nuclear energy consists of
fusion energy and fission energy. Compared with fission, inertial confinement
fusion (ICF) is a kind of clean fusion energy and can generate large energy and
little environmental pollution. ICF mainly consists of peripheral driver unit
and target. The cooling arm is an important component of the target, which
cools the hohlraum to maintain the required temperature and positions the
thermal-mechanical package (TMP) assembly. This paper mainly investigates the
cooling arm, including the structural design, the verticality of sidewall and
the mechanical properties. The TMP assembly is uniformly clamped in its radial
when using (111) crystal orientation silicon to fabricate cooling arm. The
finite element method is used to design the structure of cooling arm with 16
clamping arms, and the MEMS technologies are employed to fabricate the
micro-size cooling arm structure with high vertical sidewall. Finally, the
mechanical test of cooling arm is taken, and the result can meet the
requirement of positioning TMP assembly.
