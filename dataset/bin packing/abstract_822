Granular packings of hard discs are investigated by means of contact dynamics
which is an appropriate technique to explore the allowed force-realizations in
the space of contact forces. Configurations are generated for given values of
the friction coefficient, and then an ensemble of equilibrium forces is found
for fixed contacts. We study the force fluctuations within this ensemble. In
the limit of zero friction the fluctuations vanish in accordance with the
isostaticity of the packing. The magnitude of the fluctuations has a
non-monotonous friction dependence. The increase for small friction can be
attributed to the opening of the angle of the Coulomb cone, while the decrease
as friction increases is due to the reduction of connectivity of the
contact-network, leading to local, independent clusters of indeterminacy. We
discuss the relevance of indeterminacy to packings of deformable particles and
to the mechanical response properties.
