We introduce a deductive statistical mechanics approach for granular
materials which is formally built from few realistic physical assumptions. The
main finding is an universal behavior for the distribution of the density
fluctuations. Such a distribution is the equivalent of the Maxwell-Boltzmann's
distribution in the kinetic theory of gasses. The comparison with a very
extensive set of experimental and simulation data for packings of monosized
spherical grains, reveals a remarkably good quantitative agreement with the
theoretical predictions for the density fluctuations both at the grain level
and at the global system level. Such agreement is robust over a broad range of
packing fractions and it is observed in several distinct systems prepared by
using different methods. The equilibrium distributions are characterized by
only one parameter ($k$) which is a quantity very sensitive to changes in the
structural organization. The thermodynamical equivalent of $k$ and its relation
with the `granular temperature' are also discussed.
