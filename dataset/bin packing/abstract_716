A lower bound on the minimum required code length of binary codes is
obtained. The bound is obtained based on observing a close relation between the
Ulam's liar game and channel coding. In fact, Spencer's optimal solution to the
game is used to derive this new bound which improves the famous Sphere-Packing
Bound.
