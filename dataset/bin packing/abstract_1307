The distribution P(F) of contact forces F in a homogeneous isotropic
disordered granular sample subject to uniform triaxial stress field is studied
using a model where forces propagate and collide. Collisions occur at grain and
obey given rules which allow satisfying local static equilibrium. Analogy with
Boltzmann's equation of density evolution is drawn and used to derive the
parameters that control the distribution Ps(F) of contact forces F in the
stationary state in case of a packing of mono-disperse spheres. Using symmetry
argument and mean field approximation, it is found that stationarity is
achieved when the density Ps(F) of force can be written as the product of
exponentials of quantities whose sums are preserved during collisions. This
introduces 3 parameters in 2d and 6 in 3d which are the mean force components
{Fxo, Fyo, Fzo}, and the mean torques of the force on a grain {Mxo, Myo, Mzo}
>. Astonishingly, it seems that the theory cannot include distribution of
contact orientation implicitly. Extension of the model is possible with some
care to case of anisotropic packing. Pacs # : 5.40 ; 45.70 ; 62.20 ; 83.70.Fn
