We use a random matrix model to study chiral symmetry breaking in QCD at
finite chemical potential $\mu$. We solve the model and compute the eigenvalue
density of the Dirac matrix on a complex plane. A naive ``replica trick'' fails
for $\mu\neq0$: we find that quenched QCD is not a simple $n\to0$ limit of QCD
with $n$ quarks. It is the limit of a theory with $2n$ quarks: $n$ quarks with
original action and $n$ quarks with conjugate action. The results agree with
earlier studies of lattice QCD at $\mu\neq0$ and provide a simple analytical
explanation of a long-standing puzzle.
