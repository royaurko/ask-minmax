Based on the ideas of cyclotomic cosets, idempotents and Mattson-Solomon
polynomials, we present a new method to construct GF(2^m), where m>0 cyclic
low-density parity-check codes. The construction method produces the dual code
idempotent which is used to define the parity-check matrix of the low-density
parity-check code. An interesting feature of this construction method is the
ability to increment the code dimension by adding more idempotents and so
steadily decrease the sparseness of the parity-check matrix. We show that the
constructed codes can achieve performance very close to the
sphere-packing-bound constrained for binary transmission.
