Densely-packed, all-digital aperture arrays form a key area of technology
development required for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope. The
design of real-time signal processing systems for digital aperture arrays is
currently a central challenge in pathfinder projects worldwide. We describe
interim results of such work; an heirarchical, frequency-domain beamforming
architecture for synthesising a sky beam from the wideband antenna feeds of
digital aperture arrays.
