Evidence implies that basic laws of thermodynamics must be tested by
experiments. In this paper, an experiment is designed to measure the entropy of
a system with at least one known (measurable) equation of state, especially the
gas systems. Since the entropy can be measured now, the formulae related to the
second law of thermodynamics can be examined by other experiments.
