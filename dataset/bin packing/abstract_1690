Initial principles of a method of analysis of the luminous matter spatial
distribution with sizes about thousands Mpc are presented. The method is based
on an analysis of the photometric redshift distribution N(z) in the deep fields
with large redshift bins \Deltaz=0.1{\div}0.3. Number density fluctuations in
the bins are conditioned by the Poisson's noise, the correlated structures and
the systematic errors of the photo-z determination. The method includes
covering of a sufficiently large region on the sky by a net of the deep
multiband surveys with the sell size about 10^{\circ}x10^{\circ} where
individual deep fields have angular size about 10'x10' and may be observed at
telescopes having diameters 3-10 meters. The distributions of photo-z within
each deep field will give information about the radial extension of the super
large structures while a comparison of the individual radial distributions of
the net of the deep fields will give information on the tangential extension of
the super large structures. A necessary element of the method is an analysis of
possible distortion effects related to the methodic of the photo-z
determination.
