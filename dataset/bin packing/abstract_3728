We show that the microquasar LSI+61303 is running away from its birth place
in a young complex of massive stars. The supernova explosion that formed the
compact object shot out the x-ray binary with a linear momentum of 430 +/- 140
Msun km/s, which is comparable to the linear momenta found in solitary runaway
neutron stars and millisecond pulsars. The properties of the binary system and
its runaway motion of 27 +/- 6 km/s imply that the natal supernova was
asymmetric and that the upper limit for the mass that could have been suddenly
ejected in the explosion is ~2 Msun. The initial mass of the progenitor star of
the compact object that is inferred depends on whether the formation of massive
stars in the parent stellar cluster was coeval or a sequential process.
