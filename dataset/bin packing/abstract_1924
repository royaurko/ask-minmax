In this paper we present the optical and near-infrared identifications of the
1054 radio sources detected in the 20cm deep radio survey down to a 5sigma flux
limit of about 80 microJy obtained with the VLA in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey
VVDS-02h deep field. Using U,B,V,R,I and K data, we identified 718 radio
sources (~74% of the whole sample). The photometric redshift analysis shows
that, in each magnitude bin, the radio sample has a higher median photometric
redshift than the whole optical sample, while the median (V-I) color of the
radio sources is redder than the median color of the whole optical sample.
These results suggest that radio detection is preferentially selecting galaxies
with higher intrinsic optical luminosity. From the analysis of the optical
properties of the radio sources as function of the radio flux, we found that
while about 35% of the radio sources are optically unidentified in the higher
radio flux bin (S> 1.0 mJy), the percentage of unidentified sources decreases
to about 25% in the faintest bins (S< 0.5 mJy). The median I magnitude for the
total sample of radio sources,i.e. including also the unidentified ones, is
brighter in the faintest radio bins than in the bin with higher radio flux.
This suggests that most of the faintest radio sources are likely to be
associated to relatively lower radio luminosity objects at relatively modest
redshift, rather than radio-powerful, AGN type objects at high redshift.
