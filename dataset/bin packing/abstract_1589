In this paper, we consider a stochastic balance law with a Lipschitz flux and
gain the uniqueness for stochastic entropy solutions. The argument is supported
by the stochastic kinetic formulation, the It\^{o} formula and the
regularization techniques. Furthermore, as an application, we derive the
uniqueness of stochastic entropy solutions for stochastic porous media type
equations.
