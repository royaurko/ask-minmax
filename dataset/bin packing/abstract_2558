We study the locally unextendible non-maximally entangled basis (LUNMEB) in
$H^{d}\bigotimes H^{d}$. We point out that there exists an error in the proof
of the main result of LUNMEB [Quant. Inf. Comput. 12, 0271(2012)], which claims
that there are at most $d$ orthogonal vectors in a LUNMEB, constructed from a
given non-maximally entangled state. We show that both the proof and the main
result are not correct in general. We present a counter example for $d=4$, in
which five orthogonal vectors from a specific non-maximally entangled state are
constructed. Besides, we completely solve the problem of LUNMEB for the case of
$d=2$.
