A densely packed granular system is an example of an out-of-equilibrium
system in the jammed state. It has been a longstanding problem to determine
whether this class of systems can be described by concepts arising from
equilibrium statistical mechanics, such as an ``effective temperature'' and
``compactivity''. The measurement of the effective temperature is realized in
the laboratory by slowly shearing a closely-packed ensemble of spherical beads
confined by an external pressure in a Couette geometry. All the probe particles
considered in this study, independent of their characteristic features,
equilibrate at the same temperature, given by the packing density of the
system.
