A transport approach including a leakage effect for J/psi's in the transverse
phase space is used to calculate the ratios between the J/psi transverse
momentum distributions in several centrality bins for Pb-Pb collisions at E/A =
160 GeV. From the comparison with the CERN-SPS data, where the centrality is
characterized by the transverse energy Et, the leakage effect is extremely
important in the region of high transverse momentum and high transverse energy,
and both the threshold and the comover models can describe the ratio well for
all centrality bins except the most central one (Et < 100 GeV), for which the
comover model calculation is considerably better than the threshold one.
