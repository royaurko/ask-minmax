Mesoscopic theory for soft-matter systems that combines density functional
and statistical field theory is derived from the microscopic theory by a
systematic coarse-graining procedure. Within the framework of this theory we
obtain the universal sequence of phases: disordered, bcc, hexagonal, lamellar,
inverted hexagonal, inverted bcc, disordered, for increasing density well below
the close-packing density. In addition to the above phases, more complex phases
may appear depending on the interaction potentials. For a particular form of
the short-range attraction long-range repulsion potential we find the
bicontinuous gyroid phase (Ia3d symmetry) that may be related to a network
forming cluster of colloids in a mixture of colloids and nonadsorbing polymers.
