We study the dual fluid on a finite cutoff surface outside the black brane
horizon in the third order Lovelock gravity. Using nonrelativistic
long-wavelength expansion, we obtain the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
of dual fluid with external force density on the finite cutoff surface. The
viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ is independent of cutoff surface
and does not get modification from the third order Lovelock gravity influence.
The obtained ratio agrees with the results obtained by using other methods,
such as the Kubo formula at the AdS boundary and the membrane paradigm at the
horizon in the third order Lovelock gravity. These results can be related by
Wilson renormalization group flow. However the kinematic viscosity receives
correction from the third order Lovelock term. We show that the equivalence
between the isentropic flow of the fluid and the radial component of the
gravitational equation observed in the Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravities also
holds in the third order Lovelock gravity. This generalization brings more
understandings of relating the gravity theory to the dual fluid.
