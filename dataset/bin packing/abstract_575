In this paper we study the locally optimal geodesic ball packings with equal
balls to the $\mathbf{S}^2\!\times\!\mathbf{R}$ space groups having rotation
point groups and their generators are screw motions. We determine and visualize
the densest simply transitive geodesic ball arrangements for the above space
groups, moreover we compute their optimal densities and radii. The densest
packing is derived from the $\mathbf{S}^2\!\times\!\mathbf{R}$ space group
$\mathbf{3qe.~I.~3}$ with packing density $\approx 0.7278$.
  E. Moln\'ar has shown, that the Thurston geometries have an unified
interpretation in the real projective 3-sphere $\mathcal{PS}^3$. In our work we
shall use this projective model of $\mathbf{S}^2\!\times\!\mathbf{R}$ geometry.
