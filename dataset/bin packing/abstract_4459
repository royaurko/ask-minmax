The primary motivation and application in this article come from brain
imaging studies on cognitive impairment in elderly subjects with brain
disorders. We propose a regularized Haar wavelet-based approach for the
analysis of three-dimensional brain image data in the framework of functional
data analysis, which automatically takes into account the spatial information
among neighboring voxels. We conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate
the prediction performance of the proposed approach and its ability to identify
related regions to the outcome of interest, with the underlying assumption that
only few relatively small subregions are truly predictive of the outcome of
interest. We then apply the proposed approach to searching for brain subregions
that are associated with cognition using PET images of patients with
Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and normal
controls.
