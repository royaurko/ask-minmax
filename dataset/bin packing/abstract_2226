The mode-coupling theory for ideal glass transitions in simple systems is
generalized to a theory for the glassy dynamics of molecular liquids using the
density fluctuations of the sites of the molecule's constituent atoms as the
basic structure variables. The theory is applied to calculate the liquid-glass
phase diagram and the form factors for the arrested structure of a system of
symmetric dumbbells of fused hard spheres. The static structure factors, which
enter the equations of motion as input, are calculated as function of the
packing fraction $\phi$ and the molecule's elongation $\zeta$ within the
reference-interaction-site-model and Percus-Yevick theories. The critical
packing fraction $\phi_{c}$ for the glass transition is obtained as
non-monotone function of $\zeta$ with a maximum near $\zeta = 0.43$. A
transition line is calculated separating a small-$\zeta$-glass phase with
ergodic dipole motion from a large-$\zeta$-glass phase where also the
reorientational motion is arrested. The Debye-Waller factors at the transition
are found to be somewhat larger for sufficiently elongated systems than those
for the simple hard-sphere system, but the wave-number dependence of the
glass-form factors is quite similar. The dipole reorientations for $\zeta \ge
0.6$ are arrested as strongly as density fluctuations with wave vectors at the
position of the first sharp diffraction peak.
