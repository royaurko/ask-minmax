We present a clustering analysis of near ultraviolet (NUV) - optical color
selected luminosity bin samples of green valley galaxies. These galaxy samples
are constructed by matching the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 with
the latest Galaxy Evolution Explorer source catalog which provides NUV
photometry. We present cross-correlation function measurements and determine
the halo occupation distribution of these transitional galaxies using a new
multiple tracer analysis technique.
  We extend the halo-occupation formalism to model the cross-correlation
function between a galaxy sample of interest and multiple tracer populations
simultaneously. This method can be applied to commonly used luminosity
threshold samples as well as to color and luminosity bin selected galaxy
samples, and improves the accuracy of clustering analyses for sparse galaxy
populations.
  We confirm the previously observed trend that red galaxies reside in more
massive halos and are more likely to be satellite galaxies than average
galaxies of similar luminosity. While the change in central galaxy host mass as
a function of color is only weakly constrained, the satellite fraction and
characteristic halo masses of green satellite galaxies are found to be
intermediate between those of blue and red satellite galaxies.
