By molecular dynamics simulation, discovered is a strange rigid-like nature
for a hexagonally packed domain of short chain molecules. In spite of the
non-bonded short-range interaction potential (Lennard-Jones potential) among
chain molecules, the packed domain gives rise to a resultant global moment of
inertia. Accordingly, as two domains encounter obliquely, they rotate so as to
be parallel to each other keeping their overall structures as if they were
rigid bodies.
