Digital watermarking is the process to hide digital pattern directly into a
digital content. Digital watermarking techniques are used to address digital
rights management, protect information and conceal secrets. An invisible
non-blind watermarking approach for gray scale images is proposed in this
paper. The host image is decomposed into 3-levels using Discrete Wavelet
Transform. Based on the parent-child relationship between the wavelet
coefficients the Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) compression
algorithm is performed on the LH3, LH2, HL3 and HL2 subbands to find out the
significant coefficients. The most significant coefficients of LH2 and HL2
bands are selected to embed a binary watermark image. The selected significant
coefficients are modulated using Noise Visibility Function, which is considered
as the best strength to ensure better imperceptibility. The approach is tested
against various image processing attacks such as addition of noise, filtering,
cropping, JPEG compression, histogram equalization and contrast adjustment. The
experimental results reveal the high effectiveness of the method.
