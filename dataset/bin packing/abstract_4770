Microwave emissivity models of sea ice are poorly validated empirically.
Typical validation studies involve using averaged or stereotyped profiles of
ice parameters against averaged radiance measurements. Measurement sites are
rarely matched and even less often point-by-point. Because of saline content,
complex permittivity of sea ice is highly variable and difficult to predict.
Therefore, to check the validity of a typical, plane-parallel,
radiative-transfer-based ice emissivity model, we apply it to fresh water ice
instead of salt-water ice. Radiance simulations for lake ice are compared with
measurements over Lake Superior from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer
on EOS (AMSR-E). AMSR-E measurements are also collected over Antarctic icepack.
For each pixel, a thermodynamic model is driven by four years of European
Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data and the
resulting temperature profiles used to drive the emissivity model. The results
suggest that the relatively simple emissivity model is a good fit to the data.
Both cases, however, show large discrepencies whose most likely explanation is
scattering both within the ice sheet as well as by cloudy atmospheres.
Scattering is neglected by the model. Further work is needed to refine the
scattering component of ice emissivity models and to generate accurate
estimates of complex permittivities within sea ice.
