This paper describes a method for quantitatively comparing an N-body model
with a sample of discrete kinematic data. The comparison has two stages: (i)
finding the optimum scaling and orientation of the model relative to the data;
and (ii) calculating a goodness of fit, and hence assessing the plausibility of
the model in vew of the data. The method derives from considering the data and
model both as samples from some underlying binned distribution function, and
applying probability theory arguments. As an example, I consider a published
N-body model for the Galactic bulge and disc, and fictitious l,b,v
measurements, and recover (with error estimates) the spatial and velocity
scales of the model and the orientation of the bar. The fictitious data are
actually derived from the model by assuming the mass scale and the solar
position, but their size and extent mimics a recent survey of OH/IR stars. The
results indicate that mass of the bulge and our viewing angle of the bar are
usefully estimable from current surveys.
