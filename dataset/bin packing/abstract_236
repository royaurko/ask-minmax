We develop an analogue for sphere packing of the linear programming bounds
for error-correcting codes, and use it to prove upper bounds for the density of
sphere packings, which are the best bounds known at least for dimensions 4
through 36. We conjecture that our approach can be used to solve the sphere
packing problem in dimensions 8 and 24.
