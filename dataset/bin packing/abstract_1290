A typical protein structure is a compact packing of connected alpha-helices
and/or beta-strands. We have developed a method for generating the ensemble of
compact structures a given set of helices and strands can form. The method is
tested on structures composed of four alpha-helices connected by short turns.
All such natural four-helix bundles that are connected by short turns seen in
nature are reproduced to closer than 3.6 Angstroms per residue within the
ensemble. Since structures with no natural counterpart may be targets for ab
initio structure design, the designability of each structure in the ensemble --
defined as the number of sequences with that structure as their lowest energy
state -- is evaluated using a hydrophobic energy. For the case of four
alpha-helices, a small set of highly designable structures emerges, most of
which have an analog among the known four-helix fold families, however several
novel packings and topologies are identified.
