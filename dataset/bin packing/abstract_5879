We describe work in progress by a collaboration of astronomers and
statisticians developing a suite of Bayesian data analysis tools for extrasolar
planet (exoplanet) detection, planetary orbit estimation, and adaptive
scheduling of observations. Our work addresses analysis of stellar reflex
motion data, where a planet is detected by observing the "wobble" of its host
star as it responds to the gravitational tug of the orbiting planet. Newtonian
mechanics specifies an analytical model for the resulting time series, but it
is strongly nonlinear, yielding complex, multimodal likelihood functions; it is
even more complex when multiple planets are present. The parameter spaces range
in size from few-dimensional to dozens of dimensions, depending on the number
of planets in the system, and the type of motion measured (line-of-sight
velocity, or position on the sky). Since orbits are periodic, Bayesian
generalizations of periodogram methods facilitate the analysis. This relies on
the model being linearly separable, enabling partial analytical
marginalization, reducing the dimension of the parameter space. Subsequent
analysis uses adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and adaptive importance
sampling to perform the integrals required for both inference (planet detection
and orbit measurement), and information-maximizing sequential design (for
adaptive scheduling of observations). We present an overview of our current
techniques and highlight directions being explored by ongoing research.
