Paper cutting is a simple process of slicing large rolls of paper,
jumbo-reels, into various sub-rolls with variable widths based on demands risen
by customers. Since the variability is high due to collected various orders
into a pool, the process turns to be production scheduling problem, which
requires optimisation so as to minimise the final remaining amount of paper
wasted. The problem holds characteristics similar one-dimensional bin-packing
problem to some extends and differs with some respects. This paper introduces a
modelling attempt as a scheduling problem with an integer programming approach
for optimisation purposes. Then, a constructive heuristic algorithm revising
one of well-known approaches, called Best-fit algorithm, is introduced to solve
the problem. The illustrative examples provided shows the near optimum solution
provided with very low complexity .
