We investigate transport in weakly-coupled metal nanoparticle arrays,
focusing on the regime where tunneling is competing with strong single electron
charging effects. This competition gives rise to an interplay between two types
of charge transport. In sequential tunneling, transport is dominated by
independent electron hops from a particle to its nearest neighbor along the
current path. In inelastic cotunneling, transport is dominated by cooperative,
multi-electron hops that each go to the nearest neighbor but are synchronized
to move charge over distances of several particles. In order to test how the
temperature-dependent cotunnel distance affects the current-voltage ($I-V$)
characteristics we perform a series of systematic experiments on
highly-ordered, close-packed nanoparticle arrays. The arrays consist of $\sim
5.5$nm diameter gold nanocrystals with tight size dispersion, spaced $\sim
1.7$nm apart by interdigitating shells of dodecanethiol ligands. We present
$I-V$ data for mono-, bi-, tri- and tetralayer arrays. For stacks 2-4 layers
thick we compare in-plane measurements with data for vertical transport,
perpendicular to the array plane. Our results support a picture whereby
transport inside the Coulomb blockade regime occurs by inelastic cotunneling,
while sequential tunneling takes over at large bias above the global Coulomb
blockade threshold $V_t(T)$, and at high temperatures.
