A hadronic rescattering model with the proper hadronization time width as the
free parameter is compared with charged pion and charged and neutral kaon
femtoscopy measurements from the LHC ALICE experiment for sqrt{s}=7 TeV
proton-proton collisions. Comparisons between the model and measurements are
made for one-dimensional source parameters in several charged multiplicity and
transverse particle pair momentum bins. It is found that a reasonable
description of the measured source parameters by the model is obtained for a
hadronization proper time width of 0.4 +- 0.1 fm/c, which is in agreement with
an estimate based on the uncertainty principle. The model calculations also
suggest that 1) some form of collectivity is necessary to describe the
multiplicity dependence of the measured radius parameters, and 2) the
underlying physical size and timescale of the collision is significantly larger
than what the extracted radius parameters and hadronization proper time width
would imply.
