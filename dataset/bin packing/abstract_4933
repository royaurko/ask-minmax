The large-scale structure of high-redshift galaxies produces correlated
anisotropy in the far-infrared background (FIRB). In regions of the sky where
the thermal emission from Galactic dust is well below average, these
high-redshift correlations may be the most significant source of angular
fluctuation power over a wide range of angular scales, from about 7' to about 3
degrees, and frequencies, from about 400 to about 1000 GHz. The strength of
this signal should allow detailed studies of the statistics of the FIRB
fluctuations, including the shape of the angular power spectrum at a given
frequency and the degree of coherence between FIRB maps at different
frequencies. The FIRB correlations depend upon and hence constrain the
redshift-dependent spectral energy distributions, number counts, and clustering
bias of the galaxies and active nuclei that contribute to the background. We
quantify the accuracy to which Planck and a newly proposed balloon-borne
mission EDGE could constrain models of the high-redshift universe through the
measurement of FIRB fluctuations. We conclude that the average bias of
high-redshift galaxies could be measured to an accuracy of less than
approximately 1% or, for example, separated into 4 redshift bins with about 10%
accuracy.
