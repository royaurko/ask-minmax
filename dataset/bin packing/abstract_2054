We address the stability of multipole-mode solitons in nonlocal Kerr-type
nonlinear media. Such solitons comprise several out-of-phase peaks packed
together by the forces acting between them. We discover that dipole-, triple-,
and quadrupole-mode solitons can be made stable, whereas all higher-order
soliton bound states are unstable.
