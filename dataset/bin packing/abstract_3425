ECH capacities give obstructions to symplectically embedding one symplectic
four-manifold with boundary into another. We compute the ECH capacities of a
large family of symplectic four-manifolds with boundary, called "concave toric
domains". Examples include the (nondisjoint) union of two ellipsoids in
$\mathbb{R}^4$. We use these calculations to find sharp obstructions to certain
symplectic embeddings involving concave toric domains. For example: (1) we
calculate the Gromov width of every concave toric domain; (2) we show that many
inclusions of an ellipsoid into the union of an ellipsoid and a cylinder are
"optimal"; and (3) we find a sharp obstruction to ball packings into certain
unions of an ellipsoid and a cylinder.
