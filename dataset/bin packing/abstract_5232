In this paper we study the Z channel with side information non-causally
available at the encoders. We use Marton encoding along with Gelfand-Pinsker
random binning scheme and Chong-Motani-Garg-El Gamal (CMGE) jointly decoding to
find an achievable rate region. We will see that our achievable rate region
gives the achievable rate of the multiple access channel with side information
and also degraded broadcast channel with side information. We will also derive
an inner bound and an outer bound on the capacity region of the state-dependent
degraded discrete memoryless Z channel and also will observe that our outer
bound meets the inner bound for the rates corresponding to the second
transmitter. Also, by assuming the high signal to noise ratio and strong
interference regime, and using the lattice strategies, we derive an achievable
rate region for the Gaussian degraded Z channel with additive interference
non-causally available at both of the encoders. Our method is based on lattice
transmission scheme, jointly decoding at the first decoder and successive
decoding at the second decoder. Using such coding scheme we remove the effect
of the interference completely.
