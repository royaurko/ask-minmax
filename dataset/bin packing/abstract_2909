The goal of our work has been the incorporation of single wall carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs) in Langmuir-Blodgett organic multilayers. We deposited
multilayers consisting of six cadmium behenate (CdBe) layers alternated with
one layer of SWCNTs. SWCNTs and CdBe molecules were spread at the air/water
interface and deposited at a fixed compression pressure for CdBe (27mN/m) and
two different compression pressures for the nanotubes, 15 and 45mN/m,
respectively. Low angle X-ray measurements exhibited distinct satellite peaks
in all the samples demonstrating that the periodicity of the LB CdBe reference
sample was conserved when SWCNTs were inserted in the structure. In agreement
with the observations at optical and electronic microscopes, the samples
deposited at the higher compression pressure (45mN/m) presented more
densely-packed and more uniform coverage of nanotubes.
