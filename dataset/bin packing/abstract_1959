Fluids consisting of hard platelike particles near a hard wall are
investigated using density functional theory. The density and orientational
profiles as well as the surface tension and the excess coverage are determined
and compared with those of a fluid of rodlike particles. Even for low densities
slight orientational packing effects are found for the platelet fluid due to
larger intermolecular interactions between platelets as compared with those
between rods. A net depletion of platelets near the wall is exhibited by the
excess coverage, whereas a change of sign of the excess coverage of hard-rod
fluids is found upon increasing the bulk density.
