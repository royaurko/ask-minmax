We study the gravity duals of supercurrent solutions in the AdS black hole
background with general phase structure to describe both the first and the
second order phase transitions at finite temperature in strongly interacting
systems. We argue that the conductivity and the pair susceptibility can be
possible phenomenological indications to distinguish the order of phase
transitions. We extend our discussion to the AdS soliton configuration.
Different from the black hole spacetime, in the probe limit the first order
phase transition cannot be brought by introducing the spatial component of the
vector potential of the gauge field in the AdS soliton background.
