This note concerns non-autonomous dynamics of rational functions and, more
precisely, the fractal behavior of the Julia sets under perturbation of
non-autonomous systems. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for
holomorphic stability which leads to H\"older continuity of dimensions of
hyperbolic non-autonomous Julia sets with respect to the $l^\infty$-topology on
the parameter space. On the other hand we show that, for some particular
family, the Hausdorff and packing dimension functions are not differentiable at
any point and that these dimensions are not equal on an open dense set of the
parameter space still with respect to the $l^\infty$-topology.
