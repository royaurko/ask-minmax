Carrier-independent ferromagnetism of chromium doped topological insulator
$Bi_xSb_{2-x}Te_3$ thin films,which cannot be explained by current theory of
dilute magnetic semiconductor, has been reported recently. To study if it is
related to the distinctive surface state of topological insulator, we studied
the structural, magnetic and transport characters of
$Cr_{0.2}Bi_xSb_{1.8-x}Te_3$ single crystals. The Curie temperature $T_c$,
which is determined from magnetization and anomalous Hall effect measurements
by Arrott plots, is found to be proportional to $p^{1/3}$, where p is the hole
density. This fact supports a scenario of RKKY interaction with mean-field
approximation. This carrier density dependent nature enables tuning and
controlling of the magnetic properties by applying a gate voltage in the future
science researches and spintronics applications.
