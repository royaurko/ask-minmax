We explore the unique and fascinating structure of neutron stars. Although
neutron stars are of interest in many areas of Physics, our aim is to provide
an intellectual bridge between Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics. We argue
against the naive perception of a neutron star as a uniform assembly of
neutrons packed to enormous densities. Rather, by focusing on the many exotic
phases that are speculated to exist in a neutron star, we show how the reality
is different and far more interesting.
