As holographic description of BPS Wilson loops in ${\cal N}=3$ flavored ABJM
theory with $N_f=k=1$, BPS M2-branes in $AdS_4\times N(1, 1)$ are studied in
details. Two $1/3$-BPS membrane configurations are found. One of them is dual
to the $1/3$-BPS Wilson loop of Gaiotto-Yin type. The regulated membrane action
captures precisely the leading exponential behavior of the vacuum expectation
values of $1/3$-BPS Wilson loops in the strong coupling limit, which was
computed before using supersymmetric localization technique. Moreover, there is
no BPS membrane with more supersymmetries in the background, under quite
natural assumption on the membrane worldvolume. This suggests that there is no
Wilson loop preserving more than 1/3 supersymmetries in such flavored ABJM
theory.
