Consider the random sequential packing model with infinite input and in any
dimension. When the input consists of non-zero volume convex solids we show
that the total number of solids accepted over cubes of volume $\lambda$ is
asymptotically normal as $\lambda \to \infty$. We provide a rate of
approximation to the normal and show that the finite dimensional distributions
of the packing measures converge to those of a mean zero generalized Gaussian
field. The method of proof involves showing that the collection of accepted
solids satisfies the weak spatial dependence condition known as stabilization.
