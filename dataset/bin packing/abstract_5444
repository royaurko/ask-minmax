GRB 060614 was a unique burst straddling both long and short duration
gamma-ray bursts and its physical origin is still debated. Here we re-examine
the afterglow data of GRB 060614 and find a significant F814W-band excess at
$t\sim 13.6$ day after the burst observed by the {\it Hubble Space Telescope
(HST)}. This corresponds to an extremely-low luminosity $\sim 3\times
10^{40}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. The excess component has a very red spectrum and a
rapid decline, both unexpected within the present theoretical framework of
afterglow. We examine two possible sources of this signal$-$a very weak
supernova and a Li-Paczynski Macronova/kilonova. We find that the observed
signal is incompatible with a weak supernova. However, it is compatible with
the ejection of $\sim 0.03-0.1~M_\odot$ of $r-$process material. If this
interpretation is correct GRB 060614 arose from a compact binary (most likely a
black hole$-$neutron star but also possibly a double neutron star) merger.
