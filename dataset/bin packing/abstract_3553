We explore the nature of glass-formation in variable spatial dimensionality
($d$) based on the generalized entropy theory, a synthesis of the Adam-Gibbs
model with direct computation of the configurational entropy of polymer fluids
using an established statistical mechanical model. We find that structural
relaxation in the fluid state asymptotically becomes Arrhenius in the
$d\rightarrow\infty$ limit and that the fluid transforms upon sufficient
cooling above a critical dimension near $d=8$ into a dense amorphous state with
a finite positive residual configurational entropy. Direct computations of the
isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient, taken to be
physical measures of packing frustration, demonstrate that these fluid
properties strongly correlate with the fragility of glass-formation.
