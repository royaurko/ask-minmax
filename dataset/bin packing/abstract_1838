We study the (super-)symmetries of classical solutions in the higher spin
(super-)gravity in AdS$_3$. We show that the symmetries of the solutions are
encoded in the holonomy around the spatial circle. When the spatial holonomies
of the solutions are trivial, they preserve maximal symmetries of the theory,
and are actually the smooth conical defects. We find all the smooth conical
defects in the $sl(N), so(2N+1),sp(2N), so(2N), g_2$, as well as in $sl(N|N-1)$
and $osp(2N+1|2N)$ Chern-Simons gravity theories. In the bosonic higher spin
cases, there are one-to-one correspondences between the smooth conical defects
and the highest weight representations of Lie group. Furthermore we investigate
the higher spin black holes in $osp(3|2)$ and $sl(3|2)$ higher spin
(super-)gravity and find that they are only partially symmetric. In general,
the black holes break all the supersymmetries, but in some cases they preserve
part of the supersymmetries.
