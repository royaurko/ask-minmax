Jet vetoes are a prominent part of the signal selection in various analyses
at the LHC. We discuss jet vetoes for which the transverse momentum of a jet is
weighted by a smooth function of the jet rapidity. With a suitable choice of
the rapidity-weighting function, such jet-veto variables can be factorized and
resummed allowing for precise theory predictions. They thus provide a
complementary way to divide phase space into exclusive jet bins. In particular,
they provide a natural and theoretically clean way to implement a tight veto on
central jets with the veto constraint getting looser for jets at increasingly
forward rapidities. We mainly focus our discussion on the 0-jet case in
color-singlet processes, using Higgs production through gluon fusion as a
concrete example. For one of our jet-veto variables we compare the resummed
theory prediction at NLL'+NLO with the recent differential cross section
measurement by the ATLAS experiment in the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ channel, finding
good agreement. We also propose that these jet-veto variables can be measured
and tested against theory predictions in other SM processes, such as Drell-Yan,
diphoton, and weak diboson production.
