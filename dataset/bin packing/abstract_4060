In the present work, we perform time-series analysis on the latitude bins of
the solar full disk (SFD) images of Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 17 GHz.
The flux modulation method traces the passage of radio features over the solar
disc and the autocorrelation analysis of the time-series data of SFD images
(one per day) for the period 1999-2001 gives the rotation period as a function
of latitude extending from 60 degree S to 60 degree N. The results show that
the solar corona rotates less differentially than the photosphere and
chromosphere, i.e., it has smaller gradient in the rotation rate.
