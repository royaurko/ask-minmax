We studied the kinematic evolution of the 8 October 2007 CME in the corona
based on Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI)
onboard satellite B of Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO). The
observational results show that this CME obviously deflected to a lower
latitude region for about 30$^\circ$ at the beginning. After this, the CME
propagated radially. We also analyze the influence of the background magnetic
field on the deflection of this CME. We find that the deflection of this CME at
an early stage may be caused by the nonuniform distribution of the background
magnetic field energy density and that the CME tended to propagate to the
region with lower magnetic energy density. In addition, we found that the
velocity profile of this gradual CME shows multiphased evolution during its
propagation in COR1-B FOV. The CME velocity first kept at a constant of
23.1km.s-1. Then, it accelerated continuously with a positive acceleration of
7.6m.s-2.
