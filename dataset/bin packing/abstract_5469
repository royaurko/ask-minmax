Two classes of GRBs have been identified thus far without doubt and are
prescribed to different physical scenarios -- NS-NS or NS-BH mergers, and
collapse of massive stars, for short and long GRBs, respectively. The existence
of two distinct populations was inferred through a bimodal distribution of the
observed durations $T_{90}$, and the commonly applied $2\,{\rm s}$ limit
between short and long GRBs was obtained by fitting a parabola between the two
peaks in binned data from BATSE 1B. Herein, by means of a maximum likelihood
(ML) method a mixture of two Gaussians is fitted to the datasets from BATSE,
$Swift$, $BeppoSAX$, and $Fermi$ in search for a local minimum that might serve
as a new, more proper, limit for the two GRB classes. It is found that $Swift$
and $BeppoSAX$ distributions are unimodal, hence no local minimum is present,
$Fermi$ is consistent with the conventional limit, whereas BATSE gives the
limit significantly longer (equal to $3.38\pm 0.27\,{\rm s}$) than $2\,{\rm
s}$. These new values change the fractions of short and long GRBs in the
samples examined, and imply that the observed $T_{90}$ durations are detector
dependent, hence no universal limiting value may be applied to all satellites
due to their different instrument specifications. Because of this, and due to
the strong overlap of the two-Gaussian components, the straightforward
association of short GRBs to mergers and long ones to collapsars is ambiguous.
