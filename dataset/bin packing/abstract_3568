Here, we report wafer scale fabrication of densely packed Fe nanostripe-based
magnetic thin films on a flexible substrate and their magnetic anisotropy
properties. We find that Fe nanostripes exhibit large in-plane uniaxial
anisotropy and nearly square hysteresis loops with energy products (BH)max
exceeding 3 MGOe at room temperature. High density Fe nanostripes were
fabricated on 70 nm flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) gratings, which
were made by roll-to-roll (R2R) UV nanoimprintlithography technique. Observed
large in-plane uniaxial anisotropies along the long dimension of nanostripes
are attributed to the shape. Temperature dependent hysteresis measurements
confirm that the magnetization reversal is driven by non-coherent rotation
reversal processes.
