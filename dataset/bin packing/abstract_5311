The mid-infrared to ultraviolet (0.1 -- 10 $\mu m$) spectral energy
distribution (SED) shapes of 407 X-ray-selected radio-quiet type 1 AGN in the
wide-field ``Cosmic Evolution Survey" (COSMOS) have been studied for signs of
evolution. For a sub-sample of 200 radio-quiet quasars with black hole mass
estimates and host galaxy corrections, we studied their mean SEDs as a function
of a broad range of redshift, bolometric luminosity, black hole mass and
Eddington ratio, and compared them with the Elvis et al. (1994, E94) type 1 AGN
mean SED. We found that the mean SEDs in each bin are closely similar to each
other, showing no statistical significant evidence of dependence on any of the
analyzed parameters. We also measured the SED dispersion as a function of these
four parameters, and found no significant dependencies. The dispersion of the
XMM-COSMOS SEDs is generally larger than E94 SED dispersion in the ultraviolet,
which might be due to the broader ``window function'' for COSMOS quasars, and
their X-ray based selection.
