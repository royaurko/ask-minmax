I do not remember when was the first time that I met Leo, but I have a clear
memory of going to Leo's office on the 4th floor of Evans Hall to talk to him
in my second year in Berkeley's Ph.D. program in 1986. The details of the
conversation are not retained but a visual image of his clean and orderly
office remains, in a stark contrast to a high entropy state of the same office
now being used by myself.
