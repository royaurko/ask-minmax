This paper is our third step towards developing a theory of testing monomials
in multivariate polynomials and concentrates on two problems: (1) How to
compute the coefficients of multilinear monomials; and (2) how to find a
maximum multilinear monomial when the input is a $\Pi\Sigma\Pi$ polynomial. We
first prove that the first problem is \#P-hard and then devise a $O^*(3^ns(n))$
upper bound for this problem for any polynomial represented by an arithmetic
circuit of size $s(n)$. Later, this upper bound is improved to $O^*(2^n)$ for
$\Pi\Sigma\Pi$ polynomials. We then design fully polynomial-time randomized
approximation schemes for this problem for $\Pi\Sigma$ polynomials. On the
negative side, we prove that, even for $\Pi\Sigma\Pi$ polynomials with terms of
degree $\le 2$, the first problem cannot be approximated at all for any
approximation factor $\ge 1$, nor {\em "weakly approximated"} in a much relaxed
setting, unless P=NP. For the second problem, we first give a polynomial time
$\lambda$-approximation algorithm for $\Pi\Sigma\Pi$ polynomials with terms of
degrees no more a constant $\lambda \ge 2$. On the inapproximability side, we
give a $n^{(1-\epsilon)/2}$ lower bound, for any $\epsilon >0,$ on the
approximation factor for $\Pi\Sigma\Pi$ polynomials. When terms in these
polynomials are constrained to degrees $\le 2$, we prove a $1.0476$ lower
bound, assuming $P\not=NP$; and a higher $1.0604$ lower bound, assuming the
Unique Games Conjecture.
