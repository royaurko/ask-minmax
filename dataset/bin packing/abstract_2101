Cannon, Floyd and Parry have studied the modulus of finite subdivision rules
extensively. We investigate the properties of the modulus of subdivision rules
with linear and exponential growth at every vertex, using barycentric
subdivision and a subdivision rule for the Borromean rings as examples. We show
that the subdivision rule arising from the Borromean rings is conformal, and
conjecture that the subdivision rules for all alternating links are conformal.
We show that the 1,2,3-tile criterion of Cannon, Floyd, and Parry is sufficient
to prove conformality for linear growth, but not exponential growth. We show
that the criterion gives a weaker form of conformality for subdivision rules of
exponential growth at each vertex. We contrast this with the known,
bounded-valence case, and illustrate our results with circle packings using Ken
Stephenson's Circlepack.
