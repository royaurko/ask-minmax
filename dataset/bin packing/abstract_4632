From glycosylated cell surfaces to sterically stabilized liposomes, polymers
attached to membranes attract biological and therapeutic interest. Can the
scaling laws of polymer "brushes" describe the physical properties of these
coats? We delineate conditions where the Alexander - de Gennes theory of
polymer brushes successfully describes the intermembrane distance vs. applied
osmotic stress data of Kenworthy et al. for PEG-grafted multilamellar liposomes
[Biophys. J. (1995) 68:1921]. We establish that the polymer density and size in
the brush must be high enough that, in a bulk solution of equivalent density,
the polymer osmotic pressure is independent of polymer molecular weight (the
des Cloizeaux semi-dilute regime of bulk polymer solutions). The condition that
attached polymers behave as semi-dilute bulk solutions offers a rigorous
criterion for brush scaling-law behavior. There is a deep connection between
the behaviors of polymer solutions in bulk and polymers grafted to a surface at
a density such that neighbors pack to form a uniform brush. In this regime,
two-parameter unconstrained fits of the Alexander - de Gennes brush scaling
laws yield effective monomer lengths of 3.3 to 3.5 AA, which agree with
structural predictions. The fitted distances between grafting sites are larger
than expected from the nominal content of PEG-lipids; the chains apparently
saturate the surface. Osmotic stress measurements can be used to estimate the
actual densities of membrane-grafted polymers.
