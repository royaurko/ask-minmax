The Andreev-Thurston Circle Packing Theorem is generalized to packings of
convex bodies in planar simply connected domains. This turns out to be a useful
tool for constructing conformal and quasiconformal mappings with interesting
geometric properties. We attempt to illustrate this with a few results about
uniformizations of finitely connected planar domains. For example, the
following variation of a theorem by Courant, Manel and Shiffman is proved and
generalized. If $G$ is an $n+1$-connected bounded planar domain, $H$ is a
simply connected bounded planar domain, and $P_1,P_2,...,P_n$ are (compact)
planar convex bodies, then sets $P_j'$ can be found so that $G$ is conformally
equivalent to $H-\cup_{j=1}^n P_j'$, and each $P_j'$ is either a point, or is
positively homothetic to $P_j$.
