Mutual information is a nonlinear measure used in time series analysis in
order to measure the linear and non-linear correlations at any lag $\tau$. The
aim of this study is to evaluate some of the most commonly used mutual
information estimators, i.e. estimators based on histograms (with fixed or
adaptive bin size), $k$-nearest neighbors and kernels. We assess the accuracy
of the estimators by Monte-Carlo simulations on time series from nonlinear
dynamical systems of varying complexity. As the true mutual information is
generally unknown, we investigate the existence and rate of consistency of the
estimators (convergence to a stable value with the increase of time series
length), and the degree of deviation among the estimators. The results show
that the $k$-nearest neighbor estimator is the most stable and less affected by
the method-specific parameter.
