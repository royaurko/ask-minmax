We present the NNLO corrections to top pair production in the quark-antiquark
channel proportional to the number of light quark flavors $N_l$. While the
double real corrections were derived previously, here we compute the
real-virtual and virtual-virtual contributions in this partonic channel. Using
the antenna subtraction formalism, we show that the subtraction terms correctly
approximate the real-virtual contributions in all their infrared limits.
Combined with the integrated forms of the double real and real-virtual
subtraction terms, we show analytically that the explicit infrared poles cancel
at the real-virtual and virtual-virtual levels respectively, thereby
demonstrating the validity of the massive extension of the NNLO antenna
formalism. These NNLO corrections are implemented in a Monte Carlo parton level
generator providing full kinematical information on an event-by event basis.
With this program, NNLO differential distributions in the form of binned
histograms are obtained and presented here.
