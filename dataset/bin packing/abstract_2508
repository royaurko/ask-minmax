Supersymmetry in the gauge sector could be realized as N=1 or N=2
Supersymmetry, but the current LHC searches assume an N=1 realization. In this
paper we show that squarks could be as light as few hundreds of GeV for N=2. We
also describe an experimental procedure to count the number of supersymmetries,
i.e. to distinguish between N=1 and N=2 supersymmetry, based on counting bins
with different jet multiplicities and number of leptons.
