Conjectures for analytical expressions for correlations in the dense O$(1)$
loop model on semi infinite square lattices are given. We have obtained these
results for four types of boundary conditions. Periodic and reflecting boundary
conditions have been considered before. We give many new conjectures for these
two cases and review some of the existing results. We also consider boundaries
on which loops can end. We call such boundaries ''open''. We have obtained
expressions for correlations when both boundaries are open, and one is open and
the other one is reflecting. Also, we formulate a conjecture relating the
ground state of the model with open boundaries to Fully Packed Loop models on a
finite square grid. We also review earlier obtained results about this relation
for the three other types of boundary conditions. Finally, we construct a
mapping between the ground state of the dense O$(1)$ loop model and the XXZ
spin chain for the different types of boundary conditions.
