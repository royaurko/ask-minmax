We show that it is possible to equate the intensity reduction of a light wave
caused by weak absorption with a geometrical reduction in intensity caused by a
"transverse" conformal transformation of the spacetime metric in which the wave
travels. We are consequently able to modify Gordon's optical metric to account
for electromagnetic properties of ponderable material whose properties include
both refraction and absorption. Unlike refraction alone however, including
absorption requires a modification of the optical metric that depends on the
eikonal of the wave itself. We derive the distance-redshift relation from the
modified optical metric for Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes
whose cosmic fluid has associated refraction and absorption coefficients. We
then fit the current supernovae data and provide an alternate explanation
(other than dark energy) of the apparent acceleration of the universe.
