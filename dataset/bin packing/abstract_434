Given a finite connected graph G, place a bin at each vertex. Two bins are
called a pair if they share an edge of G. At discrete times, a ball is added to
each pair of bins. In a pair of bins, one of the bins gets the ball with
probability proportional to its current number of balls raised by some fixed
power a>0. We characterize the limiting behavior of the proportion of balls in
the bins.
  The proof uses a dynamical approach to relate the proportion of balls to a
vector field. Our main result is that the limit set of the proportion of balls
is contained in the equilibria set of the vector field. We also prove that if
a<1 then there is a single point v=v(G,a) with nonzero entries such that the
proportion converges to v almost surely.
  A special case is when G is regular and a is at most 1. We show e.g. that if
G is non-bipartite then the proportion of balls in the bins converges to the
uniform measure almost surely.
