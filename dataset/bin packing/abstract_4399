MCgrid is a software package that provides access to the APPLgrid
interpolation tool for Monte Carlo event generator codes, allowing for fast and
flexible variations of scales, coupling parameters and PDFs in cutting edge
leading and next-to-leading-order QCD calculations. This is achieved by
providing additional tools to the Rivet analysis system for the construction of
MCgrid enhanced Rivet analyses. The interface is based around a one-to-one
correspondence between a Rivet histogram class and a wrapper for an APPLgrid
interpolation grid. The Rivet system provides all of the analysis tools
required to project a Monte Carlo weight upon an observable bin, and the MCgrid
package provides the correct conversion of the event weight to an APPLgrid
?fill call. MCgrid has been tested and designed for use with the SHERPA event
generator, however as with Rivet the package is suitable for use with any code
which can produce events in the HepMC event record format.
