The solution of QCD equations for generating functions of {\it parton}
multiplicity distributions reveals new peculiar features of cumulant moments
oscillating as functions of their rank. It happens that experimental data on
{\it hadron} multiplicity distributions in $e^{+}e^{-}, hh, AA$ collisions
possess the similar features. However, the "more regular" models like $\lambda
\phi ^3$ behave in a different way. Evolution of the moments at smaller phase
space bins and zeros of the truncated generating functions are briefly
discussed.
