We study the influence of composition changes on the glass transition of
binary hard disc and hard sphere mixtures in the framework of mode coupling
theory. We derive a general expression for the slope of a glass transition
line. Applied to the binary mixture in the low concentration limits, this new
method allows a fast prediction of some properties of the glass transition
lines. The glass transition diagram we find for binary hard discs strongly
resembles the random close packing diagram. Compared to 3D from previous
studies, the extension of the glass regime due to mixing is much more
pronounced in 2D where plasticization only sets in at larger size disparities.
For small size disparities we find a stabilization of the glass phase quadratic
in the deviation of the size disparity from unity.
