It is well known that CMB temperature anisotropies and polarization can be
used to probe the metric perturbations in the early universe. Presently, there
exist neither any observational detection of tensor modes of primordial metric
perturbations nor of primordial non-Gaussianity. In such a scenario, primordial
power spectrum of scalar metric perturbations is the only correlation function
of metric perturbations (presumably generated during inflation) whose effects
can be directly probed through various observations. To explore the possibility
of any deviations from the simplest picture of the era of cosmic inflation in
the early universe, it thus becomes extremely important to uncover the
amplitude and shape of this (only available) correlation sufficiently well. In
the present work, we attempt to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum of
scalar metric perturbations using the binned (uncorrelated) CMB temperature
anisotropies data using the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to solve the
corresponding inverse problem. Our analysis shows that, given the current CMB
data, there are no convincing reasons to believe that the primordial power
spectrum of scalar metric perturbations has any significant features.
