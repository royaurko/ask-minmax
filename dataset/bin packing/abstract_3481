We consider several families of combinatorial polytopes associated with the
following NP-complete problems: maximum cut, Boolean quadratic programming,
quadratic linear ordering, quadratic assignment, set partition, set packing,
stable set, 3-assignment. For comparing two families of polytopes we use the
following method. We say that a family $P$ is affinely reduced to a family $Q$
if for every polytope $p\in P$ there exists $q\in Q$ such that $p$ is affinely
equivalent to $q$ or to a face of $q$, where $\dim q = O((\dim p)^k)$ for some
constant $k$. Under this comparison the above-mentioned families are splitted
into two equivalence classes. We show also that these two classes are simpler
(in the above sence) than the families of poytopes of the following problems:
set covering, traveling salesman, 0-1 knapsack problem, 3-satisfiability, cubic
subgraph, partial ordering. In particular, Boolean quadratic polytopes appear
as faces of polytopes in every of the mentioned families.
