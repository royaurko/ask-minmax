Gamma-ray binaries are X-ray binaries with gamma-ray emissions. Their
multi-wavelength emissions range from radio, optical, X-ray and to very high
energy (TeV). X-ray emissions are crucial to understand the nature of gamma-ray
binaries. INTEGRAL and RXTE have covered and monitored most of the gamma-ray
binaries in hard and soft X-rays. Here we report the results of several
gamma-ray binaries and possible gamma-ray binaries from INTEGRAL and RXTE.
