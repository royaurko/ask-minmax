We report on experimental studies of divergence of proton beams from
nanometer thick diamond-like carbon (DLC) foils irradiated by an intense laser
with high contrast. Proton beams with extremely small divergence (half angle)
of 2 degree are observed in addition with a remarkably well-collimated feature
over the whole energy range, showing one order of magnitude reduction of the
divergence angle in comparison to the results from micrometer thick targets. We
demonstrate that this reduction arises from a steep longitudinal electron
density gradient and an exponentially decaying transverse profile at the rear
side of the ultrathin foils. Agreements are found both in an analytical model
and in particle-in-cell simulations. Those novel features make nm foils an
attractive alternative for high flux experiments relevant for fundamental
research in nuclear and warm dense matter physics.
