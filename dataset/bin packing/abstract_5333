Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are a prime opportunity to probe
astrophysical particle acceleration by combining in-situ measurements of
particles in space with remote sensing of the hard X-ray (HXR) and \gamma-ray
emitting particles in the solar atmosphere. For the space environment SEPs are
among the biggest hazards, particularly for spacecraft and human exploration of
the solar system. Unfortunately our current understanding of the acceleration
and transport of SEPs is weak. With the increasing onset of the space age it is
vitally important that we increase our knowledge of the physical mechanisms
related to SEPs. In this direction, the SEPServer project aims at building an
on-line server that will provide the space research community with SEP data and
related observations of solar electromagnetic emission. INTEGRAL/SPI acquires
observations from many X-ray/\gamma-ray flares associated with SEP events. To
make this data accessible for SEP studies we have undertaken a major effort to
specify the solar observing conditionS of INTEGRAL through Monte-Carlo
simulations of its BGO-detector response for several flares associated with
selected SEP events.
