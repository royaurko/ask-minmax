The quasiparticle scattering interference phenomenon characterized by the
peaks in the local density of states is studied within the kinetic energy
driven superconducting mechanism in the presence of a single impurity. By
calculation of the Fourier transformed ratio of the local density of states at
opposite energy, it is shown that the quasiparticle scattering interference
phenomenon can be described qualitatively by a single impurity in the kinetic
energy driven homogeneous d-wave superconducting state. The amplitude of the
peak increases with increasing energy at the low energy, and reaches a maximum
at the intermediate energy, then diminishes to zero at the high energy. The
theory also predicts that with increasing doping, the position of the peak
along the nodal direction moves towards to the center of the Brillouin zone,
while the position of the peak along the antinodal direction is shifted to
large momentum region.
