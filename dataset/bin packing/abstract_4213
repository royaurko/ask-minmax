LOFT, the Large Observatory for X-ray Timing, is a new space mission concept
devoted to observations of Galactic and extra-Galactic sources in the X-ray
domain with the main goals of probing gravity theory in the very strong field
environment of black holes and other compact objects, and investigating the
state of matter at supra-nuclear densities in neutron stars. The instruments
on-board LOFT, the Large area detector and the Wide Field Monitor combine for
the first time an unprecedented large effective area (~10 m2 at 8 keV)
sensitive to X-ray photons mainly in the 2-30 keV energy range and a spectral
resolution approaching that of CCD-based telescopes (down to 200 eV at 6 keV).
LOFT is currently competing for a launch of opportunity in 2022 together with
the other M3 mission candidates of the ESA Cosmic Vision Program.
