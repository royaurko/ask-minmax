We use the measurement of gamma-ray burst (GRB) distances to constrain dark
energy cosmological model parameters. We employ two methods for analyzing GRB
data - fitting luminosity relation of GRBs in each cosmology and using distance
measures computed from binned GRB data. Current GRB data alone cannot tightly
constrain cosmological parameters and allow for a wide range of dark energy
models.
