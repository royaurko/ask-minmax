It has recently been shown that one-dimensional Ising problems can have
degenerate, disordered ground states (GSs) over a finite range of coupling
onstants, ie, without `fine tuning'. The disorder is however of a special kind,
consisting of arbitrary mixtures of a short-period structure and its
symmetry-degenerate partner or partners. In this exploratory study, we assume
that the energetics of close-packed polytypes can be represented by an Ising
Hamiltonian (which includes, in principle, all terms allowed by symmetry), and
that (for simplicity) the close-packed triangular layers are unfaulted and
monatomic. We then calculate the diffraction patterns along the stacking
direction for the various possible kinds of disordered GSs. We find that some
disordered GSs give diffraction patterns which are only weakly distinguished
from their periodic counterparts, while in others the disorder is more clearly
evident beneath the delta functions. Finally, in some cases, the long-ranged
order of the layers is destroyed by the interference among the short-period
structures and their symmetry-related partners, giving a diffraction spectrum
which is purely continuous.
