We analyze shallow water wind waves in Currituck Sound, North Carolina and
experimentally confirm, for the first time, the presence of $soliton$
$turbulence$ in ocean waves. Soliton turbulence is an exotic form of nonlinear
wave motion where low frequency energy may also be viewed as a $dense$
$soliton$ $gas$, described theoretically by the soliton limit of the
Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation, a $completely$ $integrable$ $soliton$
$system$: Hence the phrase "soliton turbulence" is synonymous with "integrable
soliton turbulence." For periodic/quasiperiodic boundary conditions the
$ergodic$ $solutions$ of KdV are exactly solvable by $finite$ $gap$ $theory$
(FGT), the basis of our data analysis. We find that large amplitude measured
wave trains near the energetic peak of a storm have low frequency power spectra
that behave as $\sim\omega^{-1}$. We use the linear Fourier transform to
estimate this power law from the power spectrum and to filter $densely$
$packed$ $soliton$ $wave$ $trains$ from the data. We apply FGT to determine the
$soliton$ $spectrum$ and find that the low frequency $\sim\omega^{-1}$ region
is $soliton$ $dominated$. The solitons have $random$ $FGT$ $phases$, a
$soliton$ $random$ $phase$ $approximation$, which supports our interpretation
of the data as soliton turbulence. From the $probability$ $density$ $of$ $the$
$solitons$ we are able to demonstrate that the solitons are $dense$ $in$ $time$
and $highly$ $non$ $Gaussian$.
