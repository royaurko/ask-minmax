Many models in natural and social sciences are comprised of sets of
inter-acting entities whose intensity of interaction decreases with distance.
This often leads to structures of interest in these models composed of dense
packs of entities. Fast Multipole Methods are a family of methods developed to
help with the calculation of a number of computable models such as described
above. We propose a method that builds upon FMM to detect and model the dense
structures of these systems.
