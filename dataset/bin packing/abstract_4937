We present Chandra data from a 31.7 ks observation of the Centaurus cluster,
using the ACIS-S detector. Images of the X-ray emission show a plume-like
feature at the centre of the cluster, of extent 60 arcsec (20 kpc in
projection). The feature has the same metallicity as gas at a similar radius,
but is cooler. Using adaptive binning, we generate temperature, abundance and
absorption maps of the cluster core. The radial abundance profile shows that
the previously known, steep abundance gradient peaks with a metallicity of
1.3-1.8 Zsolar at a radius of about 45 arcsec (15 kpc), before falling back to
0.4 Zsolar at the centre of the cluster. A radial temperature profile shows
that the temperature decreases inwards. We determine the spatial distributions
of each of two temperature components, where applicable. The radiative cooling
time of the cooler component within the inner 10 arcsec (3 kpc) is less than
2x10^7 yr. X-ray holes in the image coincident with the radio lobes are seen,
as well as two outer sharp temperature drops, or cold fronts. The origin of the
plume is unclear. The existence of the strong abundance gradient is a strong
constraint on extensive convection or gas motion driven by a central radio
source.
