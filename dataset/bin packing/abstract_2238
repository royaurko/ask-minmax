Recently we have studied, using numerical simulations, a limited valency
model, i.e. an attractive square well model with a constraint on the maximum
number of bonded neighbors. Studying a large region of temperatures $T$ and
packing fractions $\phi$, we have estimated the location of the liquid-gas
phase separation spinodal and the loci of dynamic arrest, where the system is
trapped in a disordered non-ergodic state. Two distinct arrest lines for the
system are present in the system: a {\it (repulsive) glass} line at high
packing fraction, and a {\it gel} line at low $\phi$ and $T$. The former is
essentially vertical ($\phi$-controlled), while the latter is rather horizontal
($T$-controlled) in the $(\phi-T)$ plane. We here complement the molecular
dynamics results with mode coupling theory calculations, using the numerical
structure factors as input. We find that the theory predicts a repulsive glass
line -- in satisfactory agreement with the simulation results -- and an
attractive glass line which appears to be unrelated to the gel line.
