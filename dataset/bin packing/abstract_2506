The algebras for all possible Lorentzian and Euclidean kinematics with
$\frak{so}(3)$ isotropy except static ones are re-classified. The geometries
for algebras are presented by contraction approach. The relations among the
geometries are revealed. Almost all geometries fall into pairs. There exists $t
\leftrightarrow 1/(\nu^2t)$ correspondence in each pair. In the viewpoint of
differential geometry, there are only 9 geometries, which have right signature
and geometrical spatial isotropy. They are 3 relativistic geometries, 3
absolute-time geometries, and 3 absolute-space geometries.
