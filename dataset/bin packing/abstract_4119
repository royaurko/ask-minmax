aims: It is well known that the azimuthal and meridional shifts of sunspots
are correlated and that the correlation exhibits a latitudinal distribution,
which is expected due to the Coriolis effect. We study the temporal behaviour
of this latitudinal distribution. methods: We analyze the daily positions of
sunspot groups, provided by the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data and the
Greenwich Photoheliographic Results and correlation values, which were mapped
in 5 deg latitudinal bins. The latitudinal distributions were examined for each
year. results: We derive a sunspot-motion correlation that exhibits a
Coriolis-type latitudinal distribution on long timescales, which are typical
for the yearly distributions; at cycle maximum, however, unexpected distortions
can occur. conclusions: The causes of the weakening of the Coriolis-pattern
remain unclear. Possible relations of the phenomenon to the Gnevyshev-gap, the
polarity reversal of the main magnetic field, and some mid-period fluctuations
are discussed.
