We study the transition of a granular packing from liquid to solid bonding in
the course of drying. The particles are initially wetted by a liquid brine and
the cohesion of the packing is ensured by capillary forces, but the
crystallization of the solute transforms the liquid bonds into partially
cemented bonds. This transition is evidenced experimentally by measuring the
compressive strength of the samples at regular intervals of times. Our
experimental data reveal three regimes: 1) Up to a critical degree of
saturation, no solid bonds are formed and the cohesion remains practically
constant; 2) The onset of cementation occurs at the surface and a front spreads
towards the center of the sample with a nonlinear increase of the cohesion; 3)
All bonds are partially cemented when the cementation front reaches the center
of the sample, but the cohesion increases rapidly due to the consolidation of
cemented bonds. We introduce a model based on a parametric cohesion law at the
bonds and a bond crystallization parameter. This model predicts correctly the
phase transition and the relation between microscopic and macroscopic cohesion.
