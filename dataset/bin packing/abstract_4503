We present the results of an analysis of the large angular scale distribution
of the arrival directions of cosmic rays with energy above 4 EeV detected at
the Pierre Auger Observatory including for the first time events with zenith
angle between $60^\circ$ and $80^\circ$. We perform two Rayleigh analyses, one
in the right ascension and one in the azimuth angle distributions, that are
sensitive to modulations in right ascension and declination, respectively. The
largest departure from isotropy appears in the $E > 8$ EeV energy bin, with an
amplitude for the first harmonic in right ascension $r_1^\alpha =(4.4 \pm
1.0){\times}10^{-2}$, that has a chance probability $P(\ge
r_1^\alpha)=6.4{\times}10^{-5}$, reinforcing the hint previously reported with
vertical events alone.
