We present R=550 to 1200 near infrared H and K spectra for a magnitude
limited sample of 79 asymptotic giant branch and cool supergiant stars in the
central ~ 5 pc (diameter) of the Galaxy. We use a set of similar spectra
obtained for solar neighborhood stars with known Teff and Mbol that is in the
same range as the Galactic center (GC) sample to derive Teff and Mbol for the
GC sample. We then construct the Hertzsprung--Russell (HRD) diagram for the GC
sample. Using an automated maximum likelihood routine, we derive a coarse star
formation history of the GC. We find (1) roughly 75% of the stars formed in the
central few pc are older than 5 Gyr; (2) the star formation rate (SFR) is
variable over time, with a roughly 4 times higher star formation rate in the
last 100 Myr compared to the average SFR; (3) our model can only match
dynamical limits on the total mass of stars formed by limiting the IMF to
masses above 0.7 M$_\odot$. This could be a signature of mass segregation or of
the bias toward massive star formation from the unique star formation
conditions in the GC; (4) blue supergiants account for 12 % of the total sample
observed, and the ratio of red to blue supergiants is roughly 1.5; (5) models
with isochrones with [Fe/H] = 0.0 over all ages fit the stars in our HRD better
than models with lower [Fe/H] in the oldest age bins, consistent with the
finding of Ramirez et al. (2000) that stars with ages between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr
have solar [Fe/H].
