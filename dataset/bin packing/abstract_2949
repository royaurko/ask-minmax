Discrete numerical simulations are performed to study the evolution of the
micro-structure and the response of a granular packing during successive
loading-unloading cycles, consisting of quasi-static rotations in the gravity
field between opposite inclination angles. We show that internal variables,
e.g., stress and fabric of the pile, exhibit hysteresis during these cycles due
to the exploration of different metastable configurations. Interestingly, the
hysteretic behaviour of the pile strongly depends on the maximal inclination of
the cycles, giving evidence of the irreversible modifications of the pile state
occurring close to the unjamming transition. More specifically, we show that
for cycles with maximal inclination larger than the repose angle, the weak
contact network carries the memory of the unjamming transition. These results
demonstrate the relevance of a two-phases description -strong and weak contact
networks- for a granular system, as soon as it has approached the unjamming
transition.
