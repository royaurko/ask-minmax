Glasses have a large excess of low-frequency vibrational modes in comparison
with continuous elastic body, the so-called Boson Peak, which appears to
correlate with several crucial properties of glasses, such as transport or
fragility. I review recent results showing that the Boson Peak is a necessary
consequence of the weak connectivity of the solid. I explain why in assemblies
repulsive spheres the boson peak shifts up to zero frequency as the pressure is
lowered toward the jamming threshold, and derive the corresponding exponent. I
show how these ideas capture the main low-frequency features of the vibrational
spectrum of amorphous silica. These results extend arguments of Phillips on the
presence of floppy modes in under-constrained covalent networks to glasses
where the covalent network is rigid, or when interactions are purely radial.
