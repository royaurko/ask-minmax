We study tagged particle diffusion at large packing fractions, for a model of
particles interacting with a generalized Lennard-Jones 2n-n potential, with
large n. The resulting short-range potential mimics interactions in colloidal
systems. In agreement with previous calculations for short-range potential, we
observe a diffusivity maximum as a function of temperature. By studying the
temperature dependence of the configurational entropy -- which we evaluate with
two different methods -- we show that a configurational entropy maximum is
observed at a temperature close to that of the diffusivity maximum. Our
findings suggest a relationbetween dynamics and number of distinct states for
short-range potentials.
