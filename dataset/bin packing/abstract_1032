We study the scalar perturbation in the background of the charged
Kaluza-Klein black holes with squashed horizons. We find that the position of
infinite discontinuities of the heat capacities can be reflected in quasinormal
spectrum. This shows the possible non-trivial relation between the
thermodynamical and dynamical properties of black holes.
