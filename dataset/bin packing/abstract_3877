We consider a brane cosmological model with energy exchange between brane and
bulk. Parameterizing the energy exchange term by the scale factor and Hubble
parameter, we are able to exactly solve the modified Friedmann equation on the
brane. In this model, the equation of state for the effective dark energy has a
transition behavior changing from $w_{de}^{eff}>-1$ to $w_{de}^{eff}<-1$, while
the equation of state for the dark energy on the brane has $w>-1$. Fitting data
from type Ia supernova, Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe, our universe is predicted now in the state of
super-acceleration with $w_{de0}^{eff}=-1.21$.
