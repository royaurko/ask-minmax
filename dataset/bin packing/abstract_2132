Using the finite element method we investigate plasmon-mediated transmission
in a periodically modulated metal-insulator-metal (MIM) grating. We compute the
eigenmodes of a silver-silica-silver conformal coating atop an array of
close-packed silica rods, and correlate them with extinction and transmission
characteristics of the structure. We observe efficient coupling of impinging
plane-waves to gap plasmon modes, allowing control of both bandwidth and
intensity of the transmitted radiation.
