A measurement of the CP asymmetry in B0 -> K*0 mu+ mu- decays is presented,
based on 1.0fb-1 of pp collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment during
2011. The measurement is performed in six bins of invariant mass squared of the
mu+ mu- pair, excluding the J/psi and psi(2S) resonance regions. Production and
detection asymmetries are removed using the B0 -> J/Psi K*0 decay as a control
mode. The integrated CP asymmetry is found to be -0.072 +- 0.040 (stat.) +-
0.005 (syst.), consistent with the Standard Model.
