High-Tc Type-II ceramic-superconductor at temperature T < Tc, under presence
of magnetic-field B becomes non-superconducting if B exceeds a critical value
Bc2. Thus at T < Tc, by application/absence of critical magnetic- field as a
controlling device, these non-superconducting/superconductor states can be
achieved for current-flow to two corresponding states of block/pass or off/on
or 0/1. Thus it appears that there is a possibility of a new breed of
transistors purely with high-Tc Type-II ceramic-superconductor; compact and
without junctions & complexities. The proposed
ceramic-superconductor-transistor (CST) seems in-principle to work well for
switching purpose, but its use could also be extended for other
electronic/computer devices too. The CST, being junction-less thus
diffusion-less, could possibly be packed more closely (at nano-level) than the
semi-conductor devices which has a limitation due to
diffusion-layer-overlapping. A similar superconductor-device named Cryotron was
invented at MIT half-a-century ago, but could not survive against
semiconductor. CST is a rebirth of cryotron in different disguise & in new
perspective.
