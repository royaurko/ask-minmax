We present results of molecular simulations that predict the phases formed by
the self-assembly of model nanospheres functionalized with a single polymer
"tether", including double gyroid, perforated lamella and crystalline bilayer
phases. We show that microphase separation of the immiscible tethers and
nanospheres causes confinement of the nanoparticles, which promotes local
icosahedral packing that stabilizes the gyroid and perforated lamella phases.
We present a new metric for determining the local arrangement of particles
based on spherical harmonic "fingerprints", which we use to quantify the extent
of icosahedral ordering.
