Magnetic chains of hollow cobalt nanoparticles (450-750 nm) have been
synthesized by using poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as a template in an ethylene
glycol solution. In this process, CoCl2.6H2O was reduced by N2H4.H2O in the
presence of PVP. All of the Co nanoparticles are hollow with a shell of 40 nm
and self-assembled into a chainlike structure that is as long as ~10 micron. At
300 K, the branched hollow Co nanoparticle chains exhibit a saturation
magnetization of 37.5 emu/g, a remnant magnetization of approximately 1.55
emu/g, and a coercivity of about 66 Oe, which is more than an order of
magnitude larger than that of the bulk
