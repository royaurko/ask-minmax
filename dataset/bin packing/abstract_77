We introduce an orthoplicial Apollonian sphere packing, which is a sphere
packing obtained by successively inverting a configuration of 8 spheres with
4-orthplicial tangency graph. We will show that there are such packings in
which the bends of all constituent spheres are integral, and establish the
asymptotic local-global principle for the set of bends in these packings.
