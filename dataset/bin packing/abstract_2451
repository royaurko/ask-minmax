The electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in an $N$ configuration is
studied under both resonant and off-resonant conditions. In a certain
off-resonant condition the dark state of the four level system, which is almost
the same as the resonant dark state in $\Lambda$ configuration, is rebuilt. The
actual system with damping is examined using optical Bloch equation, both
numerically and analytically. Based on this detuned dark state, some new
applications with frequency shifts can be realized.
