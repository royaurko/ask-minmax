We numerically investigate the transport behavior of a quasi one-dimension
(1D) square loop device containing the Rashba spin-orbital interaction in the
presence of a magnetic flux. The conductance versus the magnetic field shows
the Al'tshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS) and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations. We
focus on the oscillatory amplitudes, and find that both of them are strongly
dependent on the spin precession angle (i.e. the strength of the spin-orbit
interaction) and exhibit no-periodic oscillations, which are well in agreement
with a recent experiment by Koga et al. [cond-mat/0504743(unpublished)].
However, our numerical results for the ideal 1D square loop device for the node
positions of the amplitudes of the AB and AAS oscillations are found to be of
some discrepancies comparing with quasi-1D square loop with a finite width. In
the presence of disorder and taking the disorder ensemble average, the AB
oscillation in the conductance will disappear, while the time-reversal
symmetric AAS oscillation still remains. Furthermore, the node positions of the
AAS oscillatory amplitude remains the same.
