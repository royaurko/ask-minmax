We report a measurement of time-integrated CP-violation asymmetries in the
resonant substructure of the three-body decay D0 to Ks pi+ pi- using CDF II
data corresponding to 6.0 invfb of integrated luminosity from Tevatron ppbar
collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. The charm mesons used in this analysis come
from D*+(2010) to D0 pi+ and D*-(2010) to D0bar pi-, where the production
flavor of the charm meson is determined by the charge of the accompanying pion.
We apply a Dalitz-amplitude analysis for the description of the dynamic decay
structure and use two complementary approaches, namely a full Dalitz-plot fit
employing the isobar model for the contributing resonances and a
model-independent bin-by-bin comparison of the D0 and D0bar Dalitz plots. We
find no CP-violation effects and measure an asymmetry of ACP = (-0.05 +- 0.57
(stat) +- 0.54 (syst))% for the overall integrated CP-violation asymmetry,
consistent with the standard model prediction.
