Let $K$ be an uncountable compact metric space and let $C(K,\mathbb{R}^d)$
denote the set of continuous maps $f\colon K \to \mathbb{R}^d$ endowed with the
maximum norm. The goal of this paper is to determine various fractal dimensions
of the graph of the prevalent $f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^d)$.
  As the main result of the paper we show that if $K$ has finitely many
isolated points then the lower and upper box dimension of the graph of the
prevalent $f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^d)$ are $\underline{\dim}_B K+d$ and
$\overline{\dim}_B K+d$, respectively. This generalizes a theorem of Gruslys,
Jonu\v{s}as, Mijovi\`c, Ng, Olsen, and Petrykiewicz.
  We also prove that the packing dimension of the graph of the prevalent $f\in
C(K,\mathbb{R}^d)$ is $\dim_P K+d$, generalizing a result of Balka, Darji, and
Elekes.
  Balka, Darji, and Elekes proved that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of
the prevalent $f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^d)$ equals $\dim_H K+d$. We give a simpler
proof for this statement based on a method of Fraser and Hyde.
