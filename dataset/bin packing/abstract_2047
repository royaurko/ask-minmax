We establish Gaussian limits for general measures induced by binomial and
Poisson point processes in d-dimensional space. The limiting Gaussian field has
a covariance functional which depends on the density of the point process. The
general results are used to deduce central limit theorems for measures induced
by random graphs (nearest neighbor, Voronoi and sphere of influence graph),
random sequential packing models (ballistic deposition and spatial birth-growth
models) and statistics of germ-grain models.
