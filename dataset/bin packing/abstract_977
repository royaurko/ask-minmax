We have studied the wave dynamics and the Hawking radiation for the scalar
field as well as the brane-localized gravitational field in the background of
the braneworld black hole with tidal charge containing information of the extra
dimension. Comparing with the four-dimensional black holes, we have observed
the signature of the tidal charge which presents the signals of the extra
dimension both in the wave dynamics and the Hawking radiation.
