Using the basin-hopping Monte Carlo minimization approach we report the
global minima for aluminium, gold and platinum metal clusters modelled by the
Voter-Chen version of the embedded-atom model potential containing up to 80
atoms. The virtue of the Voter-Chen potentials is that they are derived by
fitting to experimental data of both diatomic molecules and bulk metals
simultaneously. Therefore, it may be more appropriate for a wide range of the
size of the clusters. This is important since almost all properties of the
small clusters are size dependent. The results show that the global minima of
the Al, Au and Pt clusters have structures based on either octahedral,
decahedral, icosahedral or a mixture of decahedral and icosahedral packing. The
54-atom icosahedron without a central atom is found to be more stable than the
55-atom complete icosahedron for all of the elements considered in this work.
The most of the Al global minima are identified as some fcc structures and many
of the Au global minima are found to be some low symmetric structures, which
are both in agreement with the previous experimental studies.
