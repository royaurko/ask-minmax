Nowadays, user authentication is one of the important topics in information
security. Text based strong password schemes could provide with certain degree
of security. However, the fact that strong passwords being difficult to
memorize often leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save
them in a computer file. Graphical user authentication (GUA) has been proposed
as a possible alternative solution to text based authentication, motivated
particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. In
recent years, many networks, computer systems and Internet based environments
try used GUA technique for their users authentication. All of GUA algorithms
have two different aspects which are usability and security. Unfortunately,
none of graphical algorithms were being able to cover both of these aspects at
the same time. This paper presents a wide range survey on the pure and cued
recall based algorithms in GUA, based on ISO standards for usability and attack
patterns standards for security. After explain usability ISO standards and
attack patterns international standards, we try to collect the major attributes
of usability and security in GUA. Finally, try to make comparison tables among
all recall based algorithms based on usability attributes and attack patterns
those we found.
