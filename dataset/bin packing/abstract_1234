We prove the Razumov--Stroganov conjecture relating ground state of the O(1)
loop model and counting of Fully Packed Loops in the case of certain types of
link patterns. The main focus is on link patterns with three series of nested
arches, for which we use as key ingredient of the proof a generalization of the
Mac Mahon formula for the number of plane partitions which includes three
series of parameters.
