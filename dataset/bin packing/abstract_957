Quantum-classical escape rate transition has been studied for uniaxial
antiferromagnetic particles with an arbitrarily directed magnetic field. In the
case that the transverse and longitudinal fileds coexist, we calculate the
phase boundary line between first- and second-order transitions, from which
phase diagrams can be obtained. It is shown that the effects of the applied
longitudinal magnetic field on quantum-classical transition vary greatly for
different relative magnitudes of the non-compensation.
