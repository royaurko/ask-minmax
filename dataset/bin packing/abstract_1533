The Broad Line Region of Active Galactic Nuclei is characterized by broad
Balmer emission lines in their optical spectra. The broad Balmer emission lines
are found to be asymmetric, some blue sided and others red sided in their
asymmetry. One of the components behind the asymmetry is thought to be an
accretion disk wind. We probe the accretion disk wind using the broad balmer
emission line profiles.
  This asymmetry of the broad balma emission line profiles is measured in
velocity space after a measurement of the line shift at percentiles from 0, in
increaments of 10, up to 90. In addition, the Kurtosis Index is obtained at
appropriate points of the emission lines' profiles. This study is based on many
hundreds of SDSS spectra, starting with low redshift high signal to noise ratio
spectra. We also consider a definite number in each bin of their FWHM, in bins
of 1000 km/s (atleast 40 per bin), starting from 1000km/s to the very broad
emission lines.
  We present how strong the asymmetry (by plotting Asymmetry Index as a
function of percentile) of the broad/narrow lines (in percent) is, what the
Kurtosis $(R20, 80)$ is. We also present what the Asymmetry Index as a function
of line width (FWHM), luminosity (V-band), core-radio flux and Ionization
Degree.
