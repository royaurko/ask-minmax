In this work we study the magnitude-redshift relation of a non-standard
cosmological model. The model under consideration was firstly investigated
within a special case of metric-affine gravity (MAG) and was recently recovered
via different approaches by two other groups. Apart from the usual cosmological
parameters for pressure-less matter $\Omega_{\rm m}$, cosmological
constant/dark energy $\Omega_{\lambda}$, and radiation $\Omega_{\rm r}$ a new
density parameter $\Omega_\psi$ emerges. The field equations of the model
reduce to a system which is effectively given by the usual Friedmann equations
of general relativity, supplied by a correction to the energy density and
pressure in form of $\Omega_\psi$, which is related to the non-Riemannian
structure of the underlying spacetime. We search for the best-fit parameters by
using recent SN Ia data sets and constrain the possible contribution of a new
dark-energy like component at low redshifts, thereby we put an upper limit on
the presence of non-Riemannian quantities in the late stages of the universe.
In addition the impact of placing the data in redshift bins of variable size is
studied. The numerical results of this work also apply to several anisotropic
cosmological models which, on the level of the field equations, exhibit a
similar scaling behavior of the density parameters like our non-Riemannian
model.
