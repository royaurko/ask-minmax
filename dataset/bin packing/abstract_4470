We describe three in-field data collection efforts yielding a large database
of RSSI values vs. time or distance from vehicles communicating with each other
via DSRC. We show several data processing schemes we have devised to develop
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) propagation models from such data. The database is
limited in several important ways, not least, the presence of a high noise
floor that limits the distance over which good modeling is feasible. Another is
the presence of interference from multiple active transmitters. Our methodology
makes it possible to obtain, despite these limitations, accurate models of
median path loss vs. distance, shadow fading, and fast fading caused by
multipath. We aim not to develop a new V2V model, but to show the methods
enabling such a model to be obtained from in-field RSSI data.
