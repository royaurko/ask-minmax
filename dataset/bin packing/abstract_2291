We carry out numerical simulations of soft, U-shaped, frictionless particles
in $d=2$ dimensions in order to explore the effects of complex particle shape
on the jamming transition. We consider both cases of uniform compression-driven
and shear-driven jamming as packing fraction $\phi$ and compression or shear
rate is varied. Upon slow compression, jamming is found to occur when the
isostatic condition is satisfied. Under driven steady state shearing, jamming
occurs at a higher packing fraction $\phi_J$ than observed in compression. A
growing relaxation time and translational correlation length is found as $\phi$
increases towards $\phi_J$. We consider the orientational ordering and rotation
of particles induced by the shear flow. Both nematic and tetratic ordering are
found, but these decrease as $\phi$ increases to $\phi_J$. At the jamming
transition, the nematic ordering further decreases, while the tetratic ordering
increases, but the orientational correlation lengths remain small throughout.
The average angular velocity of the particles is found to increase as $\phi$
increases, saturating to a plateau just below $\phi_J$, but then increasing
again as $\phi$ increases above $\phi_J$.
