A unified picture of nucleon antinucleon annihilation into pions emerges from
a classical description of the pion wave produced in annihilation and the
subsequent quantization of that wave as a coherent state. When the constraints
of energy-momentum and iso-spin conservation are imposed on the coherent state,
the pion number distribution and charge ratios are found to be in excellent
agreement with experiment.
