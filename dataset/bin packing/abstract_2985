In an attempt to extend the range of model jamming transitions, we simulate
systems of athermal particles which attract when slightly overlapping.
Following from recent work on purely repulsive systems, dynamics are neglected
and relaxation performed via a potential energy minimisation algorithm. Our
central finding is of a transition to a low-density tensile solid which is
sharp in the limit of infinite system size. The critical density depends on the
range of the attractive regime in the pair-potential. Furthermore, solidity is
shown to be related to the coordination number of the packing according to the
approximate constraint-counting scheme known as Maxwell counting, although more
corrections need to be considered than with the repulsive-only case, as
explained. We finish by discussing how the numerical difficulties encountered
in this work could be overcome in future studies.
