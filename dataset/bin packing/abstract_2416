We demonstrate that the azimuthal dependence of central meson production in
hadronic collisions, when suitably binned, provides unambiguous tests of
whether the Pomeron couples like a conserved vector-current to protons. We
discuss the possibility of discriminating between q-qbar and glueball
production in such processes. Our predictions apply also to meson production in
tagged two-photon events at electron--positron colliders and to vector-meson
production in ep collisions at HERA.
