We consider the evolution of a scalar field coupled to curvature in
topological black hole spacetimes. We solve numerically the scalar wave
equation with different curvature-coupling constant $\xi$ and show that a rich
spectrum of wave propagation is revealed when $\xi$ is introduced. Relations
between quasinormal modes and the size of different topological black holes
have also been investigated.
