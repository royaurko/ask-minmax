The electrical properties 2D of packed metallic pentagons have been studied.
The characterization of such metallic pentagon heaps (like $i-V$ measurements)
has been achieved and has allowed to point out two distinct conduction regimes.
They are separated by a transition line along which the system exhibits a
memory effect behavior due to the irreversible improvement of electrical
contacts between pentagons (hot spots). A limit current density has been found.
