A major experimental program is presently underway worldwide to determine the
fundamental soft functions, the Sivers, Boer-Mulders and transversity
distributions, which are vital for an understanding of the internal structure
of the nucleon. To this end we consider the measurement of the Sivers,
B\"oer-Mulders and transversity \emph{difference} asymmetries for hadrons with
opposite charges, in SIDIS reactions with unpolarized and transversely
polarized targets: l+N\to l'+h+X, h=\pi^\pm,K^\pm,h^\pm. We show that on a
deuteron target the expressions for these asymmetries are particularly simple
and that, in principle, such measurements determine the Q_V=u_V+d_V
valence-quark transverse momentum dependent distributions, without any
contributions from the strange and other sea-quarks.
  At present many simplifying assumptions are used in extracting the
fundamental soft functions from the data. If the binning in Q^2 is small enough
so that Q^2-evolution can be neglected inside a bin, we obtain stringent tests
of these assumptions. Failure to satisfy these tests implies that the presently
extracted soft functions are unreliable.
