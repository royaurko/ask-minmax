We report experiments on aluminum nanowires in ultra-high vacuum at room
temperature that reveal a periodic spectrum of exceptionally stable structures.
Two "magic" series of stable structures are observed: At low conductance, the
formation of stable nanowires is governed by electronic shell effects whereas
for larger contacts atomic packing dominates. The crossover between the two
regimes is found to be smooth. A detailed comparison of the experimental
results to a theoretical stability analysis indicates that while the main
features of the observed electron-shell structure are similar to those of
alkali and noble metals, a sequence of extremely stable wires plays a unique
role in Aluminum. This series appears isolated in conductance histograms and
can be attributed to "superdeformed" non-axisymmetric nanowires.
