Electronic structures of MC where M is the alkali and alkaline earth metals
with the rocksalt structure are calculated by full potential density functional
codes. We find that the spin magnetic moment in the compounds is mainly
contributed by the spin polarized p-orbitals of carbon. The large distance
between the carbon makes the p-orbitals localized, which induces magnetic
instability according to the Stoner criterion. The electronic structure can be
mapped to the rigid band model. SrC, BaC and RaC are half-metals, while KC, RbC
and CsC are magnetic semiconductors
