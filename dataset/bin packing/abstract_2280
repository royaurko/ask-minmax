The growing correlation length observed in supercooled liquids as their
temperature is lowered has been studied with the aid of a single occupancy cell
model. This model becomes more accurate as the density of the system is
increased. One of its advantages is that it permits a simple mapping to a spin
system and the effective spin Hamiltonian is easily obtained for smooth
interparticle potentials. For a binary liquid mixture the effective spin
Hamiltonian is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. No
phase transition at finite temperatures is therefore expected and the
correlation length will stay finite right down to zero temperature. For binary
mixtures of hard disks and spheres we were not able to obtain the effective
spin Hamiltonian analytically, but have done simulations to obtain its form. It
again is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. However,
in this case the effective field can be shown to go to zero at the density of
maximum packing in the model, (which is close to that of random close packing),
which means that the correlation length will diverge as the density approaches
its maximum. The exponent nu describing the divergence is related in d
dimensions to the Ising spin glass domain wall energy exponent theta.
