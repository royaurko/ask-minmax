We simulate the tapping of a bed of hard disks in a rectangular box by using
a pseudo dynamic algorithm. In these simulations, arches are unambiguously
defined and we can analyze their properties as a function of the tapping
amplitud. We find that an order--disorder transition occurs within a narrow
range of tapping amplitudes as it has been seen by others. Arches are always
present in the system althought they exhibit regular shapes in the ordered
regime. Interestingly, an increase in the number of arches does not always
correspond to a reduction in the packing fraction. This is in contrast with
what is found in three-dimensional systems.
