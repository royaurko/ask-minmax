We present the first systematic algorithm to estimate the maximum packing
density of spheres when the grain sizes are drawn from an arbitrary size
distribution. With an Apollonian filling rule, we implement our technique for
disks in 2d and spheres in 3d. As expected, the densest packing is achieved
with power-law size distributions. We also test the method on homogeneous and
on empirical real distributions, and we propose a scheme to obtain
experimentally accessible distributions of grain sizes with low porosity. Our
method should be helpful in the development of ultra-strong ceramics and high
performance concrete.
