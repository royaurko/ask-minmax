We present the design and implementation of a custom GPU-based compute
cluster that provides the correlation X-engine of the CHIME Pathfinder radio
telescope. It is among the largest such systems in operation, correlating
32,896 baselines (256 inputs) over 400MHz of radio bandwidth. Making heavy use
of consumer-grade parts and a custom software stack, the system was developed
at a small fraction of the cost of comparable installations. Unlike existing
GPU backends, this system is built around OpenCL kernels running on
consumer-level AMD GPUs, taking advantage of low-cost hardware and leveraging
packed integer operations to double algorithmic efficiency. The system achieves
the required 105TOPS in a 10kW power envelope, making it among the most
power-efficient X-engines in use today.
