The incremental stress-strain relation of dense packings of polygons is
investigated here by using molecular dynamics simulations. The comparison of
the simulation results to the continuous theories is performed using explicit
expressions for the averaged stress and strain over a representative volume
element. The discussion of the incremental response raises two important
questions of soil deformation: Is the incrementally non-linear theory
appropriate to describe the soil mechanical response? Does a purely elastic
regime exists in the deformation of granular materials?. In both cases our
answer will be "no". The question of stability is also discussed in terms of
the Hill condition of stability for non-associated materials.
