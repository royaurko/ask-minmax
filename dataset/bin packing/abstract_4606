The mm-wave continuum sources (MCS) in Ophiuchus have mutual collision rates
less than their collapse rates by a factor of 10 to 100, suggesting most will
form stars without further interactions. However, this ratio of rates would
have exceeded unity in the past if the MCS were 2.5 times larger than they are
now. Such a high previous ratio was not likely, suggesting that the MCS grew
from smaller sizes at a constant high density, possible behind turbulent
shocks. Proximity constraints are even more important in massive clusters,
where massive stars with the same or greater space density are more strongly
interacting than the Ophiuchus MCS. As a result, the density contrast for MCS
must be larger in massive clusters than it is in Ophiuchus, or significant
coalescence will occur in the protostellar phase, possible forming a massive
black hole. A proportionality to the second power of the Mach number allows the
MCS cores to collapse independently. These results suggest that stars in dense
clusters generally form on a dynamical time by the continuous collection and
rapid collapse of turbulence-shocked gas. Implications of proximity constraints
on the initial stellar mass function are also discussed.
