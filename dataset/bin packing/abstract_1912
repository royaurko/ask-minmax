The compliance matrix for a general anisotropic material is usually expressed
in an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system, which brings some confusion or
inconvenience in identifying independent elastic material constants and
comparing elastic properties between different materials. In this paper, a
unique stiffest orientation based standardized (STF-OS) compliance matrix is
established, and 18 independent elastic material constants are clearly shown.
During the searching process for stiffest orientation, it is interesting to
find from our theoretical analysis and an example that a material with
isotropic tensile stiffness does not definitely possess isotropic elasticity.
Therefore the ratio between the maximum and minimum tensile stiffnesses is not
a correct measure of anisotropy degree. Alternatively, a simple and correct
measure of anisotropy degree based on the maximum shear-extension coupling
coefficient in all orientations is proposed.
