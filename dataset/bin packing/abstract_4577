This paper considers magnitude, asymptotics and duration of drawdowns for
some L\'evy processes. First, we revisit some existing results on the magnitude
of drawdowns for spectrally negative L\'evy processes using an approximation
approach. For any spectrally negative L\'evy process whose scale functions are
well-behaved at $0+$, we then study the asymptotics of drawdown quantities when
the threshold of drawdown magnitude approaches zero. We also show that such
asymptotics is robust to perturbations of additional positive compound Poisson
jumps. Finally, thanks to the asymptotic results and some recent works on the
running maximum of L\'evy processes, we derive the law of duration of drawdowns
for a large class of L\'evy processes (with a general spectrally negative part
plus a positive compound Poisson structure). The duration of drawdowns is also
known as the "Time to Recover" (TTR) the historical maximum, which is a widely
used performance measure in the fund management industry. We find that the law
of duration of drawdowns qualitatively depends on the path type of the
spectrally negative component of the underlying L\'evy process.
