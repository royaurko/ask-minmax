We study the relationship between the sizes of two sets $B,
S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ when $B$ contains either the whole boundary, or the four
vertices, of a square with axes-parallel sides and center in every point of
$S$, where size refers to one of cardinality, Hausdorff dimension, packing
dimension, or upper or lower box dimension. Perhaps surprinsingly, the results
vary depending on the notion of size under consideration. For example, we
construct a compact set $B$ of Hausdorff dimension $1$ which contains the
boundary of an axes-parallel square with center in every point $[0,1]^2$, but
prove that such a $B$ must have packing and lower box dimension at least
$\tfrac{7}{4}$, and show by example that this is sharp. For more general sets
of centers, the answers for packing and box counting dimensions also differ.
These problems are inspired by the analogous problems for circles that were
investigated by Bourgain, Marstrand and Wolff, among others.
