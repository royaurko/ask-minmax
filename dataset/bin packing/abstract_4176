Many regenerative arguments in stochastic processes use random times which
are akin to stopping times, but which are determined by the future as well as
the past behaviour of the process of interest. Such arguments based on
"conditioning on the future" are usually developed in an ad-hoc way in the
context of the application under consideration, thereby obscuring underlying
structure. In this paper we give a simple, unified and more general treatment
of such conditioning theory. We further give a number of novel applications to
various particle system models, in particular to various flavours of contact
processes and to infinite-bin models. We give a number of new results for
existing and new models. We further make connections with the theory of Harris
ergodicity.
