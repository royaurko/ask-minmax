The question of what can be computed, and how efficiently, are at the core of
computer science. Not surprisingly, in distributed systems and networking
research, an equally fundamental question is what can be computed in a
distributed fashion. More precisely, if nodes of a network must base their
decision on information in their local neighborhood only, how well can they
compute or approximate a global (optimization) problem? In this paper we give
the first substantial lower bound on such local computation for (optimization)
problems including minimum vertex cover, minimum (connected) dominating set,
maximum matching, maximal independent set, and maximal matching. In addition we
present a new distributed algorithm for solving general covering and packing
linear programs. For some problems this algorithm is tight with the lower
bounds, for others it is a distributed approximation scheme. Together, our
lower and upper bounds establish the local computability and approximability of
a large class of problems, characterizing how much local information is
required to solve these tasks.
