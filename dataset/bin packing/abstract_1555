Using approximations, we give several characterizations of separability of
bimodules. We also discuss how separability properties can be used to transfer
some representation theoretic properties from one ring to another one:
contravariant finiteness of the subcategory of (finitely generated) left
modules with finite projective dimension, finitistic dimension, finite
representation type, Auslander algebra, tame or wild representation type.
