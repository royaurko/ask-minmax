The observational properties of globular cluster systems (GCSs) are vital
tools to investigate the violent star formation histories of their host
galaxies. This violence is thought to have been triggered by galaxy
interactions or mergers. The most basic properties of a GCS are its luminosity
function (number of clusters per luminosity bin) and color distributions. A
large number of observed GCS show bimodal color distributions, which can be
translated into a bimodality in either metallicity and/or age. An additional
uncertainty comes into play when one considers extinction. These effects can be
disentangled either by obtaining spectroscopic data for the clusters or by
imaging observations in at least four passbands. This allows us then to
discriminate between various formation scenarios of GCSs, e.g. the merger
scenario by Ashman & Zepf, and the multi-phase collapse model by Forbes et.
al.. Young and metal-rich star cluster populations are seen to form in
interacting and merging galaxies. We analyse multiwavelength broad-band
observations of these young cluster systems provided by the ASTROVIRTEL
project.
