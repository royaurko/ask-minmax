Evidence of a special chiral nematic phase is provided using numerical
simulation and Onsager theory for systems of hard helical particles. This phase
appears at the high density end of the nematic phase, when helices are well
aligned, and is characterized by the C$_2$ symmetry axes of the helices
spiraling around the nematic director with periodicity equal to the particle
pitch. This coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom
allows a more efficient packing and hence an increase of translational entropy.
Suitable order parameters and correlation functions are introduced to identify
this screw-like phase, whose main features are then studied as a function of
radius and pitch of the helical particles. Our study highlights the physical
mechanism underlying a similar ordering observed in colloidal helical flagella
[E. Barry et al. \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} \textbf{96}, 018305 (2006)] and
raises the question of whether it could be observed in other helical particle
systems, such as DNA, at sufficiently high densities.
