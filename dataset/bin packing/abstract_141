The contact graph of an arbitrary finite packing of unit balls in Euclidean
3-space is the (simple) graph whose vertices correspond to the packing elements
and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two
packing elements touch each other. One of the most basic questions on contact
graphs is to find the maximum number of edges that a contact graph of a packing
of n unit balls can have. In this paper, improving earlier estimates, we prove
that the number of touching pairs in an arbitrary packing of n unit balls in
Euclidean 3-space is always less than $6n-0.926n^{2/3}$. Moreover, as a natural
extension of the above problem, we propose to study the maximum number of
touching triplets (resp., quadruples) in an arbitrary packing of n unit balls
in Euclidean 3-space. In particular, we prove that the number of touching
triplets (resp., quadruples) in an arbitrary packing of n unit balls in
Euclidean 3-space is at most $25/3n$ (resp., $11/4n$).
