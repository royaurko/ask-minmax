We present 0.5 -160 micron Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of galaxies,
detected at 70microns with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS),
using broadband imaging data from Spitzer and ground-based telescopes.
Spectroscopic redshifts, in the range 0.2<z<1.5, have been measured as part of
the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe2 (DEEP2) project. Based on the SEDs
we explore the nature and physical properties of the sources. Using the optical
spectra we derive Hbeta and [OII]-based Star Formation Rates (SFR) which are
10-100 times lower than SFR estimates based on IR and radio. The median offset
in SFR between optical and IR is reduced by a factor of ~3 when we apply a
typical extinction corrections. We investigate mid-to-far infrared correlations
for low redshift (>0.5) and high redshift (0.5<z<1.2) bins. Using this unique
``far-infrared'' selected sample we derive an empirical mid to far-infrared
relationship that can be used to estimate the infrared energy budget of
galaxies in the high-redshift universe. Our sample can be used as a template to
translate far-infrared luminosities into bolometric luminosities for high
redshift objects.
