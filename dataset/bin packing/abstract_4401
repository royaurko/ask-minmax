We obtain a new class of rotating black holes for Einstein theory with
perfect fluid source in (2+1) dimensions. We conclude that these black hole
solutions only depend on variable angular velocity $m(r)$. Some examples of
these black holes are given explicitly. In particular, the unknown static black
hole in this special background is obtained. In addition, the general
properties including the horizon structure, energy conditions and equation of
state, mass and angular momentum are explained in detail.
