Using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the percolation
behavior of a square well fluid with an ultra-short range of attraction in
three dimension (3D) and in confined geometry. The latter is defined through
two parallel and structureless walls (slit-pore). We focus on temperatures
above the critical temperature of the (metastable) condensation transition of
the 3D system. Investigating a broad range of systems sizes, we first determine
the percolation thresholds, i. e., the critical packing fraction for
percolation $\eta_{c}$. For the slit-pore systems, $\eta_{c}$ is found to vary
with the wall separation $L_{z}$ in a continuous but non-monotonic way,
$\eta_{c}(L_{z}\rightarrow\infty)=\eta_{c}^{\text{3D}}$. We also report results
for critical exponents of the percolation transition, specifically, the
exponent $\nu$ of the correlation length $\xi$ and the two fisher exponents
$\tau$ and $\sigma$ of the cluster-size distribution. These exponents are
obtained from a finite-size analysis involving the cluster-size distribution
and the radii of gyration distribution at the percolation threshold. Within the
accuracy of our simulations, the values of the critical exponents of our 3D
system are comparable to those of 3D random percolation theory. For narrow
slit-pores, the estimated exponents are found to be close to those obtained
from the random percolation theory in two dimensions.
