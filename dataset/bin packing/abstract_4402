We study the entanglement entropy as a probe of the proximity effect of a
superconducting system by using the gauge/gravity duality in a fully
back-reacted gravity system. While the entanglement entropy in the
superconducting phase is less than the entanglement entropy in the normal
phase, we find that near the contact interface of the superconducting to normal
phase the entanglement entropy has a different behavior due to the leakage of
Cooper pairs to the normal phase. We verify this behavior by calculating the
conductivity near the boundary interface.
