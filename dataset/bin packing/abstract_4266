We report novel graphene nanoribbon (GNR)/semiconductor nanowire (SNW)
heterojunction light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for the first time. The GNR and SNW
have a face-to-face contact structure, which has the merit of bigger active
region. ZnO, CdS, and CdSe NWs were employed in our case. At forward biases,
the GNR/SNW heterjunction LEDs could emit light with wavelengths varying from
ultraviolet (380 nm) to green (513 nm) to red (705 nm), which were determined
by the band-gaps of the involved SNWs. The mechanism of light emitting for the
GNR/SNW heterojunction LED was discussed. Our approach can easily be extended
to other semiconductor nano-materials. Moreover, our achievement opens the door
to next-generation display technologies, including portable, "see-through", and
conformable products.
