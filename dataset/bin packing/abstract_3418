This paper organizes McMillan-Mayer theory, the potential distribution
approach, and quasi-chemical theory to provide theory for the thermodynamic
effects associated with longer spatial scales involving longer time scales,
thus helping to define a role for AIMD simulation directly on the time and
space scales typical of those demanding methods. The theory treats composition
fluctuations which would be accessed by larger-scale calculations, and also
longer-ranged interactions that are of special interest for electrolyte
solutions. The quasi-chemical organization breaks-up governing free energies
into physically distinct contributions: packing, outer-shell, and chemical
contributions. Here we study specifically the outer-shell contributions that
express electrolyte screening. For that purpose we adopt a primitive model
suggested by observation of ion-pairing in tetra-ethylammonium
tetra-fluoroborate dissolved in propylene carbonate. Gaussian statistical
models are shown to be effective physical models for outer-shell contributions,
and they are conclusive for the free energies within the quasi-chemical
formulation. With the present data-set the gaussian physical approximation
obtains more accurate mean activity coefficients than does the Bennett direct
evaluation of that free energy.
