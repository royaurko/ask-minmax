Acrylic acid (AA) is a monomer commonly employed in emulsion polymerization
to provide electrostatic colloidal stability and improve specific film
performance. The addition of AA not only modifies the kinetics of the
polymerization, but also it takes part in the interaction between colloidal
particles, which has a strong influence on their packing and consequent latex
film properties. In this contribution a theoretical modeling of the latex film
formation is presented and compared to experimental results: water vapor
permeability and latex film capacitance are studied as a function of AA
content. It has been shown that water uptake is mainly affected by film
morphology which in turn is defined by intercolloidal interaction and drying
rate.
