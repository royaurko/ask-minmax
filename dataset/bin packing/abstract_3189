The Minkowski operators (addition and substraction of sets in vectorial
spaces) has been extensively used for Computer Graphics and Image Processing to
represent complex shapes. Here we propose to apply those mathematical concepts
to extend the Molecular Dynamics (MD) Methods for simulations with
complex-shaped particles. A new concept of Voronoi-Minkowski diagrams is
introduced to generate random packings of complex-shaped particles with tunable
particle roundness. By extending the classical concept of Verlet list we
achieve numerical efficiencies that do not grow quadratically with the body
number of sides. Simulations of dissipative granular materials under shear
demonstrate that the method complies with the first law of thermodynamics for
energy balance.
