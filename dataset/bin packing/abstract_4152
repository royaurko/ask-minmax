We present next-to-leading order predictions for final states containing
leptons produced through the decay of a Z boson in association with either a
photon and a jet, or a pair of photons. The effect of photon radiation from the
final state leptons is included and we also allow for contributions arising
from fragmentation processes. Phenomenological studies are presented for the
LHC in the case of final states containing charged leptons and in the case of
neutrinos. We also use the procedure introduced by Stewart and Tackmann to
provide a reliable estimate of the scale uncertainty inherent in our
theoretical calculations of jet-binned Z gamma cross sections. These
computations have been implemented in the public code MCFM.
