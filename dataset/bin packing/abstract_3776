This paper investigates the problem of the dynamic balance control of
multi-arm free-floating space robot during capturing an active object in close
proximity. The position and orientation of space base will be affected during
the operation of space manipulator because of the dynamics coupling between the
manipulator and space base. This dynamics coupling is unique characteristics of
space robot system. Such a disturbance will produce a serious impact between
the manipulator hand and the object. To ensure reliable and precise operation,
we propose to develop a space robot system consisting of two arms, with one arm
(mission arm) for accomplishing the capture mission, and the other one (balance
arm) compensating for the disturbance of the base. We present the coordinated
control concept for balance of the attitude of the base using the balance arm.
The mission arm can move along the given trajectory to approach and capture the
target with no considering the disturbance from the coupling of the base. We
establish a relationship between the motion of two arm that can realize the
zeros reaction to the base. The simulation studies verified the validity and
efficiency of the proposed control method.
