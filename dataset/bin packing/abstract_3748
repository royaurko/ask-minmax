Using the Multimission Archives at Space Telescope (MAST), we have extracted
spectra and determined continuum light curves for 175 Seyfert Galaxies that
have been observed with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and the
Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). To obtain
the light curves as a function of Julian Date, we used fix bins in the object's
rest frame, and measured small regions (between 30 and 60 Angstroms) of each
spectrum's continuum flux in the range 1150 Angstroms to 3200 Angstroms. We
provide access to the UV light curves and other basic information about the
observations in tabular and graphical form via the Internet at
