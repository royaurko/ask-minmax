Stimulus-responsive shape memory materials have attracted tremendous research
interests recently, with much effort focused on improving their mechanical
actuation. Driven by the needs of nanoelectromechnical devices, materials with
large mechanical strain particularly at nanoscale are therefore desired. Here
we report on the discovery of a large shape memory effect in BiFeO3 at the
nanoscale. A maximum strain of up to ~14% and a large volumetric work density
can be achieved in association with a martensitic-like phase transformation.
With a single step, control of the phase transformation by thermal activation
or electric field has been reversibly achieved without the assistance of
external recovery stress. Although aspects such as hysteresis, micro-cracking
etc. have to be taken into consideration for real devices, the large shape
memory effect in this oxide surpasses most alloys and therefore demonstrates
itself as an extraordinary material for potential use in state-of-art
nano-systems.
