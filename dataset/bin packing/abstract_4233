This paper reports on the most comprehensive data set obtained on
differential and fully integrated cross sections for the process $e p \to e' p
\pi^{+} \pi^{-} $. The data were collected with the CLAS detector at Jefferson
Laboratory. Measurements were carried out in the so-far unexplored kinematic
region of photon virtuality 0.2 $<$ $Q^{2}$ $<$ 0.6 GeV$^{2}$ and invariant
mass of the final hadron system $W$ from 1.3 to 1.57 GeV. For the first time,
nine independent 1-fold differential cross sections were determined in each bin
of $W$ and $Q^{2}$ covered by the measurements. A phenomenological analysis of
the data allowed us to establish the most significant mechanisms contributing
to the reaction. The non-resonant mechanisms account for a major part of
cross-sections. However, we find sensitivity to s-channel excitations of
low-mass nucleon resonances, especially to the $N(1440)P_{11}$ and
$N(1520)D_{13}$ states in kinematical dependencies of the 1-fold differential
cross-sections.
