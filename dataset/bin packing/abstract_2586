Recently measured centrality dependence of high energy jets in proton-lead
collisions at the LHC is investigated. We hypothesize that events with jets of
very high energy (a few hundred GeV) are characterized by a suppressed number
of soft particles thus shifting these events into more peripheral bins. This
naturally results in the suppression (enhancement) of the nuclear modification
factor, $R_{pA}$, in central (peripheral) collisions. Our calculations suggest
that a moderate suppression of the order of $20\%$ can quantitatively reproduce
the experimental data. We further propose an independent experimental test to
verify this hypothesis.
