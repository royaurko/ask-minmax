Using random walk simulations we explore diffusive transport through
monodisperse sphere packings over a range of packing fractions, $\phi$, in the
vicinity of the jamming transition at $\phi_{c}$. Various diffusion properties
are computed over several orders of magnitude in both time and packing
pressure. Two well-separated regimes of normal, "Fickian" diffusion, where the
mean squared displacement is linear in time, are observed. The first
corresponds to diffusion inside individual spheres, while the latter is the
long-time bulk diffusion. The intermediate anomalous diffusion regime and the
long-time value of the diffusion coefficient are both shown to be controlled by
particle contacts, which in turn depend on proximity to $\phi_{c}$. The time
required to recover normal diffusion $t^*$ scales as $(\phi-\phi_c)^{-0.5}$ and
the long-time diffusivity $D_\infty \sim (\phi - \phi_c)^{0.5}$, or $D_\infty
\sim 1/t^*$. It is shown that the distribution of mean first passage times
associated with the escape of random walkers between neighboring particles
controls both $t^*$ and $D_\infty$ in the limit $\phi \rightarrow \phi_c$.
