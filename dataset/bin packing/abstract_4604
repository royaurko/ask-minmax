The next generation all-sky monitor operating at TeV (0.1 - 30 TeV) energies
should be capable of performing a continuous high sensitivity sky survey, and
detecting transient sources, such as AGN flares, with high statistical
significance on timescales of hours to days. We describe an instrument concept
for a large area, wide aperture, TeV ground-based Gamma-ray telescope. The
conceptual design is comprised of 20000 sqm scintillator-based pixels arranged
in a densely packed mosaic. In addition to fast timing, the dense array of
pixels also provides a unique imaging capability; the shower image, the spatial
distribution of secondary particles at ground level, can be exploited to
identify and reject hadronic backgrounds. The good angular resolution and
background rejection capabilities lead directly to high sensitivity, while
retaining a large field of view, large effective area, and high duty cycle. An
instrument such as the one described here complements the narrow field of view
air-Cherenkov telescopes and could, in conjunction with future space-based
instruments, extend the energy range for continuous monitoring of the Gamma-ray
sky from MeV through TeV energies.
