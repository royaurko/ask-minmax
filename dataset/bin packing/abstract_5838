Aims: We aim to measure the starspot rotation periods of active stars in the
Kepler field as a function of spectral type and to extend reliable rotation
measurements from F-, G-, and K-type to M-type stars.
  Methods: Using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram we searched more than 150 000
stellar light curves for periodic brightness variations. We analyzed periods
between 1 and 30 days in eight consecutive Kepler quarters, where 30 days is an
estimated maximum for the validity of the PDC_MAP data correction pipeline. We
selected stable rotation periods, i.e., periods that do not vary from the
median by more than one day in at least six of the eight quarters. We averaged
the periods for each stellar spectral class according to B - V color and
compared the results to archival vsini data, using stellar radii estimates from
the Kepler Input Catalog.
  Results: We report on the stable starspot rotation periods of 12 151 Kepler
stars. We find good agreement between starspot velocities and vsini data for
all F-, G- and early K-type stars. The 795 M-type stars in our sample have a
median rotation period of 15.4 days. We find an excess of M-type stars with
periods less than 7.5 days that are potentially fast-rotating and fully
convective. Measuring photometric variability in multiple Kepler quarters
appears to be a straightforward and reliable way to determine the rotation
periods of a large sample of active stars, including late-type stars.
