A cryogenic horizontal single loop target has been designed, built, tested
and operated for the G$^0$ experiment in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. The target
cell is 20 cm long, the loop volume is 6.5 l and the target operates with the
cryogenic pump fully immersed in the fluid. The target has been designed to
operate at 30 Hz rotational pump speed with either liquid hydrogen or liquid
deuterium. The high power heat exchanger is able to remove 1000 W of heat from
the liquid hydrogen, while the nominal electron beam with current of 40 $\mu$A
and energy of 3 GeV deposits about 320 W of heat into the liquid. The increase
in the systematic uncertainty due to the liquid hydrogen target is negligible
on the scale of a parity violation experiment. The global normalized yield
reduction for 40 $\mu$A beam is about 1.5 % and the target density fluctuations
contribute less than 238 ppm (parts per million) to the total asymmetry width,
typically about 1200 ppm, in a Q$^2$ bin.
