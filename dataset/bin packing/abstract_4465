In this work, a likelihood encoder is studied in the context of lossy source
compression. The analysis of the likelihood encoder is based on the
soft-covering lemma. It is demonstrated that the use of a likelihood encoder
together with the soft-covering lemma yields simple achievability proofs for
classical source coding problems. The cases of the point-to-point
rate-distortion function, the rate-distortion function with side information at
the decoder (i.e. the Wyner-Ziv problem), and the multi-terminal source coding
inner bound (i.e. the Berger-Tung problem) are examined in this paper.
Furthermore, a non-asymptotic analysis is used for the point-to-point case to
examine the upper bound on the excess distortion provided by this method. The
likelihood encoder is also compared, both in concept and performance, to a
recent alternative technique using properties of random binning.
