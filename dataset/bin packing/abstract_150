We investigate the existence of random close and random loose packing limits
in two-dimensional packings of monodisperse hard disks. A statistical mechanics
approach-- based on several approximations to predict the probability
distribution of volumes-- suggests the existence of the limiting densities of
the jammed packings according to their coordination number and compactivity.
This result has implications for the understanding of disordered states in the
disk packing problem as well as the existence of a putative glass transition in
two dimensional systems.
