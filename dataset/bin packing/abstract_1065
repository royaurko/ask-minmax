For the present analysis, simulations are carried out for thousand of events
for the reaction of 79Au197 + 79Au197 at semi-central geometry using a hard
equation of state. The whole of the analysis is performed for light charged
particles (LCP's). The transition from in-plane to out-of-plane is observed
only when the mid-rapidity region is included in the rapidity bin otherwise no
transition is observed. The transition energy is found to be strongly dependent
on the size of the rapidity bin. The transition energy is parameterized with a
straight line interpolation.
