We study several aspects of generalized Janus configuration, which includes a
theta term. We investigate the vacuum structure of the theory and find that
unlike the Janus configuration without theta term there is no nontrivial
vacuum. We also discuss BPS soliton configuration both by supersymmetry
analysis and from energy functional. The half BPS configurations could be
realized by introducing transverse (p,q)-strings in original brane
configuration corresponding to generalized Janus configuration. It turns out
the BPS soliton could be taken as modified dyon. We discuss the solution of
half BPS equations for the sharp interface case. Moreover we construct less
supersymmetric Janus configuration with theta term.
