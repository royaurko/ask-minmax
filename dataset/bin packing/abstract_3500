The triangle graph of a graph $G$, denoted by ${\cal T}(G)$, is the graph
whose vertices represent the triangles ($K_3$ subgraphs) of $G$, and two
vertices of ${\cal T}(G)$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding
triangles of $G$ share an edge. In this paper, we characterize graphs $G$ whose
triangle graph is a cycle and then extend the result to obtain a
characterization of $C_n$-free triangle graphs. As a consequence, we give a
forbidden subgraph characterization for graphs $G$ whose ${\cal T}(G)$ is a
tree, a chordal graph, or a perfect graph. For the class of graphs whose ${\cal
T}(G)$ is perfect, we also prove a conjecture of the third contributor concerning
the packing and covering of triangles.
