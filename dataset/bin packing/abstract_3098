The aging of aggregated structures of monoglycerides in hydrophobic medium is
described by a set of different techniques. Polarized microscopy was used to
study the mesomorphic behavior as a function of time. Differential scanning
calorimetry was utilized to quantitatively monitor changes in the latent heat
in different phase transformations that take place in the aging system.
Infrared spectroscopy was applied to detect the formation of hydrogen bonding
between surfactants. The X-ray diffraction patterns fingerprinted the molecular
arrangement in different emerging phases. Infra-red spectroscopy was used to
monitor the state of hydrogen bonding in the system. We conclude that in both
inverted-lamellar and sub-alpha crystalline phases, monoglyceride molecules
inevitably lose their emulsified ability in the hydrophobic solutions through
the gradual change in hydrogen bonding patterns. On aging, the formation of
intermolecular hydrogen bonding between glycerol groups causes the segregation
of chiral (D and L) isomers within the bilayers. Therefore all structures were
eventually forced to reorder into the beta-crystalline state, distinguishing
between the D and L layers. Accordingly, the highly ordered packing of aged
structures weakened the emulsifying ability and finally leaded the collapse of
the percolating gel network.
