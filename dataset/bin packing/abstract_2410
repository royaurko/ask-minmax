Multiplicity distribution in small bins is studied within the Ginzburg-Landau
description for first-order quark-hadron phase transition. Direct comparison of
the distribution with a Poisson one (with the same average) is made. Dynamical
factor $d_q$ for the distributionand ratio $D_q\equiv d_q/d_1$ are studied, and
novel scaling behaviors between $D_q$ are found which can be used to detect the
formation of quark-gluon plasma.
