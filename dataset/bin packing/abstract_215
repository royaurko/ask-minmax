We consider three problems about cities from Alcuin's_Propositiones ad
acuendos juvenes_. These problems can be considered as the earliest packing
problems difficult also for modern state-of-the-art packing algorithms. We
discuss the Alcuin's solutions and give the known (to the contributor) best
solutions to these problems.
