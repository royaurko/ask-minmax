A piecewise flat manifold is a triangulated manifold given a geometry by
specifying edge lengths (lengths of 1-simplices) and specifying that all
simplices are Euclidean. We consider the variation of angles of piecewise flat
manifolds as the geometry varies in a particular way, which we call a conformal
variation. This variation generalizes variations within the class of circles
with fixed intersection angles (such as circle packings) as well as other
formulations of conformal variation of piecewise flat manifolds previously
suggested. We describe the angle derivatives of the angles in two and three
dimensional piecewise flat manifolds, giving rise to formulas for the
derivatives of curvatures. The formulas for derivatives of curvature resemble
the formulas for the change of scalar curvature under a conformal variation of
Riemannian metric. They allow us to explicitly describe the variation of
certain curvature functionals, including Regge's formulation of the
Einstein-Hilbert functional (total scalar curvature), and to consider convexity
of these functionals. They also allow us to prove rigidity theorems for certain
analogues of constant curvature and Einstein manifolds in the piecewise flat
setting.
