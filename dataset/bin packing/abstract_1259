Saturated random packing of particles built of two identical, relatively
shifted spheres in two and three dimensional flat and homogeneous space was
studied numerically using random sequential adsorption algorithm. The shift
between centers of spheres varied from 0.0 to 8.0 sphere diameters. Numerical
simulations allowed determine random sequential adsorption kinetics, saturated
random coverage ratio as well as available surface function and density
autocorrelation function.
