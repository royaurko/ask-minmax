Tag clouds provide an aggregate of tag-usage statistics. They are typically
sent as in-line HTML to browsers. However, display mechanisms suited for
ordinary text are not ideal for tags, because font sizes may vary widely on a
line. As well, the typical layout does not account for relationships that may
be known between tags. This paper presents models and algorithms to improve the
display of tag clouds that consist of in-line HTML, as well as algorithms that
use nested tables to achieve a more general 2-dimensional layout in which tag
relationships are considered. The first algorithms leverage prior work in
typesetting and rectangle packing, whereas the second group of algorithms
leverage prior work in Electronic Design Automation. Experiments show our
algorithms can be efficiently implemented and perform well.
