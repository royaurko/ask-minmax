We use deep Swift UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) near-ultraviolet (1600A to
4000A) imaging of the Chandra Deep Field South to measure the rest-frame far-UV
(FUV; 1500A) luminosity function (LF) in four redshift bins between z=0.2 and
1.2. Our sample includes 730 galaxies with u < 24.1 mag. We use two methods to
construct and fit the LFs: the traditional V_max method with bootstrap errors
and a maximum likelihood estimator. We observe luminosity evolution such that
M* fades by ~2 magnitudes from z~1 to z~0.3 implying that star formation
activity was substantially higher at z~1 than today. We integrate our LFs to
determine the FUV luminosity densities and star formation rate densities from
z=0.2 to 1.2. We find evolution consistent with an increase proportional to
(1+z)^1.9 out to z~1. Our luminosity densities and star formation rates are
consistent with those found in the literature, but are, on average, a factor of
~2 higher than previous FUV measurements. In addition, we combine our UVOT data
with the MUSYC survey to model the galaxies' ultraviolet-to-infrared spectral
energy distributions and estimate the rest-frame FUV attenuation. We find that
accounting for the attenuation increases the star formation rate densities by
~1 dex across all four redshift bins.
