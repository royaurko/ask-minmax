In this note we investigate the normality of closures of orthogonal and
symplectic nilpotent orbits in positive characteristic. We prove that the
closure of such a nilpotent orbit is normal provided that neither type d nor
type e minimal irreducible degeneration occurs in the closure, and conversely
if the closure is normal, then any type e minimal irreducible degeneration does
not occur in it. Here, the minimal irreducible degenerations of a nilpotent
orbit are introduced by W. Hesselink in [6] ( or see [11] from which we take
Table 1 for the complete list of all minimal irreducible degenerations). Our
result is a weak version in positive characteristic of [11, Theorem 16.2(ii)],
one of the main results of [11] over complex numbers.
