Inter- or intramolecular coupling processes between chromophores such as
excimer formation or H- and J-aggregation are crucial to describing the
photophysics of closely packed films of conjugated polymers. Such coupling is
highly distance dependent, and should be sensitive to both fluctuations in the
spacing between chromophores as well as the actual position on the chromophore
where the exciton localizes. Single-molecule spectroscopy reveals these
intrinsic fluctuations in well-defined bi-chromophoric model systems of
cofacial oligomers. Signatures of interchromophoric interactions in the excited
state - spectral red-shifting and broadening, and a slowing of
photoluminescence decay - correlate with each other but scatter strongly
between single molecules, implying an extraordinary distribution in coupling
strengths. Furthermore, these excimer-like spectral fingerprints vary with
time, revealing intrinsic dynamics in the coupling strength within one single
dimer molecule, which constitutes the starting point for describing a molecular
solid. Such spectral sensitivity to sub-Angstrom molecular dynamics could prove
complementary to conventional FRET-based molecular rulers.
