We measure the two-point correlation of free Voronoi volumes in binary disc
packings, where the packing fraction $\phi_{\rm avg}$ ranges from 0.8175 to
0.8380. We observe short-ranged correlations over the whole range of $\phi_{\rm
avg}$ and anti-correlations for $\phi_{\rm avg}>0.8277$. The spatial extent of
the anti-correlation increases with $\phi_{\rm avg}$ while the position of the
maximum of the anti-correlation and the extent of the positive correlation
shrink with $\phi_{\rm avg}$. We conjecture that the onset of anti-correlation
corresponds to dilatancy onset in this system.
