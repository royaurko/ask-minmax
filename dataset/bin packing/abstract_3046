We give a general existence result for interacting particle systems with
local interactions and bounded jump rates but noncompact state space at each
site. We allow for jump events at a site that affect the state of its
neighbours. We give a law of large numbers and functional central limit theorem
for additive set functions taken over an increasing family of subcubes of
$Z^d$. We discuss application to marked spatial point processes with births,
deaths and jumps of particles, in particular examples such as continuum and
lattice ballistic deposition and a sequential model for random loose sphere
packing.
