Inspired by the recently discovered holographic duality between N=2 SCFTs and
half-BPS M-theory backgrounds, we study probe M5-branes. Though our main focus
is supersymmetric M5-branes whose worldvolume has an AdS_n factor, we also
consider some other configurations. Of special mention is the identification of
AdS_5 and AdS_3 probes preserving supersymmetry, with only the latter
supporting a self-dual field strength.
