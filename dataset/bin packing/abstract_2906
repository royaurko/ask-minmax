The electrical resistance decay of a metallic granular packing has been
measured as a function of time. This measurement gives information about the
size of the conducting cluster formed by the well connected grains. Several
regimes have been encountered. Chronologically, the first one concerns the
growth of the conducting cluster and is identified to belong to diffusion
processes through a stretched exponential behavior. The relaxation time is
found to be simply related to the initial injected power. This regime is
followed by a reorganisation process due to thermal dilatation. For the long
term behavior of the decay, an aging process occurs and enhances the electrical
contacts between grains through microsoldering.
