The structure of nanoclusters is complex to describe due to their
noncrystallinity, even though bonding and packing constraints limit the local
atomic arrangements to only a few types. A computational scheme is presented to
extract coordination motifs from sample atomic configurations. The method is
based on a clustering analysis of multipole moments for atoms in the first
coodination shell. Its power to capture large-scale structural properties is
demonstrated by scanning through the ground state of the Lennard-Jones and
C$_{60}$ clusters collected at the Cambridge Cluster Database.
