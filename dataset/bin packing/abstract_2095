Ordered arrays of magnetic nanowires are commonly synthesized by
electrodeposition in nanoporous alumina templates. Due to their dense packing,
strong magnetostatic interactions prevent the manipulation of wires
individually. Using atomic layer deposition we reduce the diameter of the pores
prior to electrodeposition. This reduces magnetostatic interactions, yielding
fully remanent hysteresis loops. This is a first step towards the use of such
arrays for magnetic racetrack memories.
