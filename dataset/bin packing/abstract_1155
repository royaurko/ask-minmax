Tests of local hidden variable theories using measurements with continuous
variable (CV) outcomes are developed, and a comparison of different methods is
presented. As examples, we focus on multipartite entangled GHZ and cluster
states. We suggest a physical process that produces the states proposed here,
and investigate experiments both with and without binning of the continuous
variable. In the former case, the Mermin-Klyshko inequalities can be used
directly. For unbinned outcomes, the moment-based CFRD inequalities are
extended to functional inequalities by considering arbitrary functions of the
measurements at each site. By optimising these functions, we obtain more robust
violations of local hidden variable theories than with either binning or
moments. Recent inequalities based on the algebra of quaternions and octonions
are compared with these methods. Since the prime advantage of CV experiments is
to provide a route to highly efficient detection via homodyne measurements, we
analyse the effect of noise and detection losses in both binned and unbinned
cases. The CV moment inequalities with an optimal function have greater
robustness to both loss and noise. This could permit a loophole-free test of
Bell inequalities.
