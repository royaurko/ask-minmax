The problem of packing boxes into a large box is often a part of a larger
problem. For example in furniture supply chain applications, one needs to
decide what trucks to use to transport furniture between production sites and
distribution centers and stores, such that the furniture fits inside. Such
problems are often formulated and sometimes solved using general-purpose
integer programming solvers.
  This chapter studies the problem of identifying a compact formulation of the
multi-dimensional packing component in a general instance of integer linear
programming, reformulating it using the discretisation of
Allen--Burke--Marecek, and and solving the extended reformulation. Results on
instances of up to 10000000 boxes are reported.
