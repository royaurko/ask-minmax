We introduce a new dynamic light scattering method, termed photon correlation
imaging, which enables us to resolve the dynamics of soft matter in space and
time. We demonstrate photon correlation imaging by investigating the slow
dynamics of a quasi two-dimensional coarsening foam made of highly packed,
deformable bubbles and a rigid gel network formed by dilute, attractive
colloidal particles. We find the dynamics of both systems to be determined by
intermittent rearrangement events. For the foam, the rearrangements extend over
a few bubbles, but a small dynamical correlation is observed up to macroscopic
length scales. For the gel, dynamical correlations extend up to the system
size. These results indicate that dynamical correlations can be extremely
long-ranged in jammed systems and point to the key role of mechanical
properties in determining their nature.
