We present an experimental investigation of the probability distribution of
normal contact forces, $P(F)$, at the bottom boundary of static three
dimensional packings of compressible granular materials. We find that the
degree of deformation of individual grains plays a large role in determining
the form of this distribution. For small amounts of deformation we find a small
peak in $P(F)$ below the mean force with an exponential tail for forces larger
than the mean force. As the degree of deformation is increased the peak at the
mean force grows in height and the slope of the exponential tail increases.
