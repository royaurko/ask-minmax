The performance of single folding predictors and combination scores is
critically evaluated. We test mean packing, mean pairwise energy and the new
index gVSL2 on a dataset of 743 folded proteins and 81 natively unfolded
proteins. These predictors have an individual performance comparable or even
better than other proposed methods. We introduce here a strictly unanimous
score S_{SU} that combines them but leaves undecided those sequences
differently classified by two single predictors. The performance of the single
predictors on a dataset purged from the proteins left unclassified by S_{SU},
significantly increases, indicating that unclassified proteins are mainly false
predictions. Amino acid composition is the main determinant considered by these
predictors, therefore unclassified proteins have a composition compatible with
both folded and unfolded status. This is why purging a dataset from these
ambiguous proteins increases the performance of single predictors. The
percentage of proteins predicted as natively unfolded by S_{SU} in the three
kingdoms are: 4.1% for Bacteria, 1.0% for Archaea and 20.0% for Eukarya;
compatible with previous determinations. Evidence is given of a scaling law
relating the number of natively unfolded proteins with the total number of
proteins in a genome; a first estimate of the critical exponent is 1.95 +- 0.21
