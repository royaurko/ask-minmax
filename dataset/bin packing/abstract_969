Experimental aspects of the use of bunching parameters are discussed. Special
attention is paid to the behavior expected for the case of purely statistical
fluctuations. We studied bin-averaged bunching parameters and propose a
generalization of bunching parameters, making use of the interparticle
distance-measure technique. The proposed method opens up the possibility of
carrying out a comprehensive and sensitive investigation of multiplicity
fluctuations inside jets.
