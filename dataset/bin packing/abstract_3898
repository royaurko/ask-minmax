We present STAR measurements of charged hadron production as a function of
centrality in Au + Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 130 GeV. The measurements
cover a phase space region of 0.2 < p_T < 6.0 GeV/c in transverse momentum and
-1 < eta < 1 in pseudorapidity. Inclusive transverse momentum distributions of
charged hadrons in the pseudorapidity region 0.5 < |eta| < 1 are reported and
compared to our previously published results for |eta| < 0.5. No significant
difference is seen for inclusive p_T distributions of charged hadrons in these
two pseudorapidity bins. We measured dN/deta distributions and truncated mean
p_T in a region of p_T > p_T^cut, and studied the results in the framework of
participant and binary scaling. No clear evidence is observed for participant
scaling of charged hadron yield in the measured p_T region. The relative
importance of hard scattering process is investigated through binary scaling
fraction of particle production.
