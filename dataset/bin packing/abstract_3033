Analogues of stepping--stone models are considered where the site--space is
continuous, the migration process is a general Markov process, and the
type--space is infinite. Such processes were defined in previous work of the
second contributor by specifying a Feller transition semigroup in terms of
expectations of suitable functionals for systems of coalescing Markov
processes. An alternative representation is obtained here in terms of a limit
of interacting particle systems. It is shown that, under a mild condition on
the migration process, the continuum--sites stepping--stone process has
continuous sample paths. The case when the migration process is Brownian motion
on the circle is examined in detail using a duality relation between coalescing
and annihilating Brownian motion. This duality relation is also used to show
that a random compact metric space that is naturally associated to an infinite
family of coalescing Brownian motions on the circle has Hausdorff and packing
dimension both almost surely equal to 1/2 and, moreover, this space is capacity
equivalent to the middle--1/2 Cantor set (and hence also to the Brownian zero
set).
