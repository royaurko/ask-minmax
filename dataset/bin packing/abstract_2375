The coefficient functions for heavy-flavour production in deeply inelastic
electron-hadron scattering have been calculated previously. Analytic
expressions are impossible to publish due to their length. Therefore we have
tabulated them as two-dimensional arrays as is often done for the
scale-dependent parton densities. Using this computer program we present event
rates for charm production at HERA in bins of $x$ and $Q^2$. These rates are
insensitive to variations in the factorization and renormalization scale $\mu$.
