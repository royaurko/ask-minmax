We analyze the time dependent response of strongly scattering media (SSM) to
ultra-short pulses of light. A random walk technique is used to model the
optical scattering of ultra-short pulses of light propagating through media
with random shapes and various packing densities. The pulse spreading was found
to be strongly dependent on the average particle size, particle size
distribution, and the packing fraction. We also show that the intensity as a
function of time-delay can be used to analyze the particle size distribution
and packing fraction of an optically thick sample independently of the presence
of absorption features. Finally, we propose an all new way to measure the shape
of ultra-short pulses that have propagated through a SSM.
