Kinetic theory is used to check the applicability of parton cascade in 1
dimensional expansion. Using the information provided by 3 dimensional parton
cascade, we model the transverse expansion by an effective area. With this
model, kinetic theory is able to give prediction of the time development of
transverse energy which is in good agreement with the parton cascade results.
