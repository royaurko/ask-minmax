We present a new local method for optimally estimating the local effects of
magnification from weak gravitational lensing, using a comparison of number
counts in an arbitrary region of space to the expected unmagnified number
counts. This method has equivalent statistical power to the optimally-weighted
correlation function method previously employed to measure magnification, but
has the potential to be used for purposes such as mass mapping, and is also
significantly computationally faster. We present a proof-of-principle test of
this method on data from the CFHTLenS, showing that its calculated
magnification signals agree with predictions from model fits to shear data.
Finally, we investigate how magnification data can be used to supplement shear
data in determining the best-fit model mass profiles for galaxy dark matter
haloes. We find that at redshifts greater than z~0.6, the inclusion of
magnification can often significantly improve the constraints on the components
of the mass profile which relate to galaxies' local environments relative to
shear alone, and in high-redshift, low-mass bins, it can have a higher
signal-to-noise than the shear signal.
