We calculate the free volume distributions of nearly jammed packings of
monodisperse and bidisperse hard sphere configurations. These distributions
differ qualitatively from those of the fluid, displaying a power law tail at
large free volumes, which constitutes a distinct signature of nearly jammed
configurations, persisting for moderate degrees of decompression. We reproduce
and explain the observed distribution by considering the pair correlation
function within the first coordination shell for jammed hard sphere
configurations. We analyze features of the equation of state near jamming, and
discuss the significance of observed asphericities of the free volumes to the
equation of state.
