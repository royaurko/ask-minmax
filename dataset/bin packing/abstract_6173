Measurements of the anisotropy parameter v_2 of identified hadrons (pions,
kaons, and protons) as a function of centrality, transverse momentum p_T, and
transverse kinetic energy KE_T at midrapidity (|\eta|<0.35) in Au+Au collisions
at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV are presented. Pions and protons are identified up to
p_T = 6 GeV/c, and kaons up to p_T = 4 GeV/c, by combining information from
time-of-flight and aerogel Cherenkov detectors in the PHENIX Experiment. The
scaling of v_2 with the number of valence quarks (n_q) has been studied in
different centrality bins as a function of transverse momentum and transverse
kinetic energy. A deviation from previously observed quark-number scaling is
observed at large values of KE_T/n_q in noncentral Au+Au collisions (20--60%),
but this scaling remains valid in central collisions (0--10%).
