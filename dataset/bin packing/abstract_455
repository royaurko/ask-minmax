We show that near densest-packing the perturbations of the HCP structure
yield higher entropy than perturbations of any other densest packing. The
difference between the various structures shows up in the correlations between
motions of nearest neighbors. In the HCP structure random motion of each sphere
impinges slightly less on the motion of its nearest neighbors than in the other
structures.
