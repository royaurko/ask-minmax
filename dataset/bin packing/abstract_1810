Low-temperature specific heat was measured on the BaFe1.9Ni0.1As2 single
crystals with critical transi-tion temperature Tc = 20.1 K. A clear specific
heat jump with the value \DeltaC/T|Tc \approx 23 mJ/mol K^2 has been observed.
In addition, a roughly linear magnetic field dependence of the electronic
specific heat coefficient \Delta\gamma(H) is found in the zero-temperature
limit, suggesting that at least one Fermi pocket, probably the hole derivative
one, is fully gapped with a small anisotropy in the present sample. A slight
curvature of the curve \Delta\gamma(H) may suggest a complex gap structure
(anisotropic gap or nodes) at other Fermi surfaces.
