Beam position monitor (BPM) can easily reinforce the handling of beam orbits
and measure the absolute beam position [1]. Its data can be used to optimize
and correct beam in both first turn and closed orbit mode. In order to set the
absolute center position of Button-type BPM, and formulate the offset between
mechanic and electronic center precisely, we mounted BPM together with solenoid
on a vertical rotated test-bench when its calibration takes out, and developed
transform software to calculate the offset. This paper describes the method and
process of collaborate calibration: the assembly and alignment of BPM itself on
the designed work-bench; the mechanic calibration of bundle BPM-Solenoid, and
the alignment of mechanic to the wire center used by Laser Tracker and Portable
coordinate measurement machine (CMM) jointly; the connection of coaxial cable
and read-out for electronics; the electronic calibration of bundle
BPM-Solenoid. Form the above four steps, the contributor analyses the error sources,
measures and subtracts the offset values, and formulate the position
calculation formula of offset. At last, the residual offset is nearly 20um.The
total accuracy of calibration is 0.1mm.
