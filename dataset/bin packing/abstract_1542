In this paper, we present a nonparametric estimation procedure for the
multivariate Hawkes point process. The timeline is cut into bins and---for each
component process---the number of points in each bin is counted. The
distribution of the resulting "bin-count sequences" can be approximated by an
integer-valued autoregressive model known as the (multivariate) INAR($p$)
model. We represent the INAR($p$) model as a standard vector-valued linear
autoregressive time series with white-noise innovations (VAR($p$)). We
establish consistency and asymptotic normality for conditional least-squares
estimation of the VAR($p$), respectively, the INAR($p$) model. After an
appropriate scaling, these time series estimates yield estimates for the
underlying multivariate Hawkes process as well as formulas for their asymptotic
distribution. All results are presented in such a way that computer
implementation, e.g., in R, is straightforward. Simulation studies confirm the
effectiveness of our estimation procedure. Finally, we present a data example
where the method is applied to bivariate event-streams in financial
limit-order-book data. We fit a bivariate Hawkes model on the joint process of
limit and market order arrivals. The analysis exhibits a remarkably asymmetric
relation between the two component processes: incoming market orders excite the
limit order flow heavily whereas the market order flow is hardly affected by
incoming limit orders.
