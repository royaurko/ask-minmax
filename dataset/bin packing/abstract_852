We present results from four independent models of a granular assembly
subjected to tapping. We find that the steady-state packing fraction as a
function of the tapping intensity is nonmonotonic. In particular, for high
tapping intensities, we observe an increase of the packing fraction with
tapping strength. This finding challenges the current understanding of
compaction of granular media since the steady-state packing fraction is
believed to decrease monotonically with increasing tapping intensity. We
propose an explanation of our results based on the properties of the arches
formed by the particles.
