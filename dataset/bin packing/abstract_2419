The influence of pure statistical fluctuations on $K/\pi$ ratio is
investigated in an event-by-event way. Poisson and the modified negative
binomial distributions are used as the multiplicity distributions since they
both have statistical background. It is shown that the distributions of the
ratio in these cases are Gaussian, and the mean and relative variance are given
analytically.
