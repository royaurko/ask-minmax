The macroscopic mechanical properties of densely packed coagulated colloidal
particle gels strongly depend on the local arrangement of the powder particles
on length scales of a few particle diameters. Heterogeneous microstructures
exhibit up to one order of magnitude higher elastic properties and yield
strengths than their homogeneous counterparts. The microstructures of these
gels are analyzed by the straight path method quantifying quasi-linear particle
arrangements of particles. They show similar characteristics than force chains
bearing the mechanical load in granular material. Applying this concept to gels
revealed that heterogeneous colloidal microstructures show a significantly
higher straight paths density and exhibit longer straight paths than their
homogeneous counterparts.
