259 new instances of hypergeometric 3F2(1) evaluations are obtained by
systematically testing three-part transformations among these functions,
against the previously known database of 133 such evaluations. A complete
database of 447 evaluations is listed in a series of appendices, including one
appendix where all cases are given in the form of packed pseudo-code, suitable
for pasting as input instructions, to a computer algebra code.
