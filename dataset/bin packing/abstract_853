The contact dynamics method (CD) is an efficient simulation technique of
dense granular media where unilateral and frictional contact problems for a
large number of rigid bodies have to be solved. In this paper we present a
modified version of the contact dynamics to generate homogeneous random
packings of rigid grains. CD is coupled to an external pressure bath, which
allows the variation of the size of a periodically repeated cell. We follow the
concept of the Andersen dynamics and show how it can be applied within the
framework of the contact dynamics method. The main challenge here is to handle
the interparticle interactions properly, which are based on constraint forces
in CD. We implement the proposed algorithm, perform test simulations and
investigate the properties of the final packings.
