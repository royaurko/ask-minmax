We consider growing spheres seeded by random injection in time and space.
Growth stops when two spheres meet leading eventually to a jammed state. We
study the statistics of growth limited by packing theoretically in d dimensions
and via simulation in d=2, 3, and 4. We show how a broad class of such models
exhibit distributions of sphere radii with a universal exponent. We construct a
scaling theory that relates the fractal structure of these models to the decay
of their pore space, a theory that we confirm via numerical simulations. The
scaling theory also predicts an upper bound for the universal exponent and is
in exact agreement with numerical results for d=4.
