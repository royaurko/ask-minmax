We summarize the status of the analysis of the 4-body angular distribution $B
\to K^*(\to K \pi) \mu^+\mu^-$ using a basis of optimized observables. We
provide a New Physics interpretation of the pattern of deviations observed in
the 1fb$^{-1}$ dataset with the coefficient of the semileptonic operator $O_9$
being the main responsible for this pattern. Also other scenarios involving
more Wilson coefficients are briefly discussed. Further, we present a detailed
description of each of the hadronic uncertainties entering our predictions and
suggest possible tests for alternative hadronic explanations. Our most accurate
SM predictions for the optimized observables in various bins including all
uncertainties are also provided.
