Analysis of the \textit{Kepler} $\delta$\,Sct star KIC\,7106205 showed
amplitude modulation in a single pressure mode, whilst all other pressure and
gravity modes remained stable in amplitude and phase over the 1470\,d length of
the dataset. The \textit{Kepler} dataset was divided into a series with time
bins of equal length for which consecutive Fourier transforms were calculated.
An optimum fixed frequency, calculated from a least-squares fit of all data,
allowed amplitude and phase of each pulsation mode for each time bin to be
tracked. The single pressure mode at $\nu$\,=\,13.3942\,d$^{-1}$ changed
significantly in amplitude, from 5.16\,$\pm$\,0.03 to 0.53\,$\pm$\,0.06\,mmag,
but also varied quasi-sinusoidally in phase, with a characteristic period
similar to the length of the dataset. All other p and g\,modes were stable in
both amplitude and phase, which is clear evidence that the visible pulsation
mode energy is not conserved within this star. Possible causes of the observed
amplitude and phase modulation and the missing mode energy are discussed.
