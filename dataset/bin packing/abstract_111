We describe a new numerical procedure for generating dense packings of disks
and spheres inside various geometric shapes. We believe that in some of the
smaller cases, these packings are in fact optimal. When applied to the
previously studied cases of packing n equal disks in a square, the procedure
confirms all the previous record packings except for n = 32, 37, 48, and 50
disks, where better packings than those previously recorded are found. For n =
32 and 48, the new packings are minor variations of the previous record
packings. However, for n = 37 and 50, the new patterns differ substantially.
For example, they are mirror-symmetric, while the previous record packings are
not.
