The signatures of the creation of a disoriented chiral condensate in
heavy-ion collisions are studied in the Ginzburg-Landau description of chiral
phase transition. Scaling properties are found that characterize the
fluctuations of charged particles. There exists also an explicitly calculable
measure that can directly be measured. Experimental procedures needed to find
the signatures are discussed.
