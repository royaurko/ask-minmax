We analytically and numerically characterize the structure of hard-sphere
fluids in order to review various geometrical frustration scenarios of the
glass transition. We find generalized polytetrahedral order to be correlated
with increasing fluid packing fraction, but to become increasingly irrelevant
with increasing dimension. We also find the growth in structural correlations
to be modest in the dynamical regime accessible to computer simulations.
