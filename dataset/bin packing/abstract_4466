This paper describes the solution of Bazinga Team for Tmall Recommendation
Prize 2014. With real-world user action data provided by Tmall, one of the
largest B2C online retail platforms in China, this competition requires to
predict future user purchases on Tmall website. Predictions are judged on
F1Score, which considers both precision and recall for fair evaluation. The
data set provided by Tmall contains more than half billion action records from
over ten million distinct users. Such massive data volume poses a big
challenge, and drives competitors to write every single program in MapReduce
fashion and run it on distributed cluster. We model the purchase prediction
problem as standard machine learning problem, and mainly employ regression and
classification methods as single models. Individual models are then aggregated
in a two-stage approach, using linear regression for blending, and finally a
linear ensemble of blended models. The competition is approaching the end but
still in running during writing this paper. In the end, our team achieves
F1Score 6.11 and ranks 7th (out of 7,276 teams in total).
