We describe observations at frequencies near 15 GHz of the second 2x2 degree
field imaged with the Cambridge Cosmic Anisotropy Telescope (CAT). After the
removal of discrete radio sources, structure is detected in the images on
characteristic scales of about half a degree, corresponding to spherical
harmonic multipoles in the approximate range l= 330--680. A Bayesian analysis
confirms that the signal arises predominantly from the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation for multipoles in the lower half of this range; the
average broad-band power in a bin with centroid l=422 (theta = 51') is
estimated to be Delta_T/T=2.1^{+0.4}_{-0.5} x 10^{-5}. For multipoles centred
on l=615 (theta =35'), we find contamination from Galactic emission is
significant, and constrain the CMB contribution to the measured power in this
bin to be Delta_T/T <2.0 x 10^{-5} (1-sigma upper limit). These new results are
consistent with the first detection made by CAT in a completely different area
of sky. Together with data from other experiments, this new CAT detection adds
weight to earlier evidence from CAT for a downturn in the CMB power spectrum on
scales smaller than 1 degree. Improved limits on the values of H_0 and Omega
are determined using the new CAT data.
