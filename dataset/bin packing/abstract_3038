Let $(M, \dr M)$ be a 3-manifold with incompressible boundary that admits a
convex co-compact hyperbolic metric. We consider the hyperbolic metrics on $M$
such that $\dr M$ looks locally like a hyperideal polyhedron, and we
characterize the possible dihedral angles.
  We find as special cases the results of Bao and Bonahon on hyperideal
polyhedra, and those of Rousset on fuchsian hyperideal polyhedra. Our results
can also be stated in terms of circle configurations on $\dr M$, they provide
an extension of the Koebe theorem on circle packings.
  The proof uses some elementary properties of the hyperbolic volume, in
particular the Schl\"afli formula and the fact that the volume of (truncated)
hyperideal simplices is a concave function of the dihedral angles.
