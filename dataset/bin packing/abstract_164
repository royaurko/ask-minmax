Using an athermal quasistatic simulation protocol, we study the distribution
of free volumes in sheared hard-particle packings close to, but below, the
random-close packing threshold. We show that under shear, and independent of
volume fraction, the free volumes develop features similar to close-packed
systems -- particles self-organize in a manner as to mimick the isotropically
jammed state. We compare athermally sheared packings with thermalized packings
and show that thermalization leads to an erasure of these structural features.
The temporal evolution, in particular the opening-up and the closing of
free-volume patches is associated with the single-particle dynamics, showing a
crossover from ballistic to diffusive behavior.
