Microfluidics integrated with sol-gel processes is introduced in preparing
monodispersed MOX nuclear fuel microspheres using nonactive cerium as a
surrogate for uranium or plutonium. The detailed information about microfluidic
devices and sol-gel processes are provided. The effects of viscosity and flow
rate of continuous and dispersed phase on size and size distribution of CeO2
microspheres have been investigated. A comprehensive characterization of the
CeO2 microspheres has been conducted, including XRD pattern, SEM, density, size
and size distribution. The size of prepared monodisperse particles can be
controlled precisely in range of 10{\mu}m to 1000{\mu}m and the particle CV is
below 3%.
