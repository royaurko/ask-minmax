We provide a new proof of a theorem whose proof was sketched by Sullivan
('82), namely that if the Poincar\'e exponent of a geometrically finite
Kleinian group $G$ is strictly between its minimal and maximal cusp ranks, then
the Patterson--Sullivan measure of $G$ is not proportional to the Hausdorff or
packing measure of any gauge function. This disproves a conjecture of Stratmann
('97, '06).
