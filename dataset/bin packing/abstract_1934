To study the effect of slow heat conduction during phase separation, we
discuss the relaxation properties of an $O(N)$ symmetric model with Phase field
type dynamics, where a non conserved order parameter field couples bilinearly
to a diffusive field. In the limit $N\to\infty$ we obtain an exact solution.
The analysis reveals three different types of growth regimes and a very rich
dynamical behavior. Finally the connection with the Mullins-Sekerka instability
is expounded.
