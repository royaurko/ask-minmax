In this paper, we study the real-time correlators in Kerr/CFT, in the low
frequency limit of generic non-extremal Kerr(-Newman) black holes. From the low
frequency scattering of Kerr-Newman black holes, we show that for the uncharged
scalar scattering, there exists hidden conformal symmetry on the solution
space. Similar to Kerr case, this suggests that the Kerr-Newman black hole is
dual to a two-dimensional CFT with central charges $c_L=c_R=12J$ and
temperatures $T_L=\frac{(r_++r_-)-Q^2/M}{4\pi a}, T_R=\frac{r_+-r_-}{4\pi a}$.
Using the Minkowski prescription, we compute the real-time correlators of
charged scalar and find perfect match with CFT prediction. We further discuss
the low-frequency scattering of photons and gravitons by Kerr black hole and
find that their retarded Green's functions are in good agreement with CFT
prediction. Our study supports the idea that the hidden conformal symmetry in
the solution space is essential to Kerr/CFT correspondence.
