We study top quark pair productions at a polarized photon collider from an
e(+)e(-) linear collider (LC) in various improved technicolor model, namely,
the one-family walking technicolor model, the top-color-assisted technicolor
model, and the top-color-assisted multiscale technicolor model. Recent
constraint on the top-pion mass from the precision data of R(b) is considered.
It is shown that, considering only the statistical errors, a polarized photon
collider from a 500 GeV LC with an integrated luminosity of 500 inverse fb is
sufficient for distinguishing the three improved technicolor models
experimentally.
