The NASA Kepler mission has revealed an abundant class of Systems with
Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs). The current paradigm for planet formation
suggests that small planetesimals will quickly spiral into the host star due to
aerodynamic drag, preventing rocky planet formation. In contrast, we find that
aerodynamic drift, when acting on an ensemble of solids, can concentrate mass
at short orbital periods in gaseous disks. Sublimation fronts may further aid
this process. Kepler data suggest that the innermost known planets are found
near the silicate sublimation zone. STIP planets should have a wide range of
volatile fractions due to aerodynamic drift and H2 dissociation-driven gas
accretion. We further propose that the low mass of Mars is evidence that the
Solar System was once a proto-STIP.
