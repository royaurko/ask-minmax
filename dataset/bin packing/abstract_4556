With the imminent slowing down of DRAM scaling, Phase Change Memory (PCM) is
emerging as a lead alternative for main memory technology. While PCM achieves
low energy due to various technology-specific advantages, PCM is significantly
slower than DRAM (especially for writes) and can endure far fewer writes before
wearing out. Previous work has proposed to use a large, DRAM-based hardware
cache to absorb writes and provide faster access. However, due to ineffectual
caching where blocks are evicted before sufficient number of accesses, hardware
caches incur significant overheads in energy and bandwidth, two key but scarce
resources in modern multicores. Because using hardware for detecting and
removing such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and
complexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose. We
propose a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory architecture where the OS migrates pages on
demand from the PCM to DRAM. We call the DRAM part of our memory as
MigrantStore which includes two ideas. First, to reduce the energy, bandwidth,
and wear overhead of ineffectual migrations, we propose migration hysteresis.
Second, to reduce the software overhead of good replacement policies, we
propose recently- accessed-page-id (RAPid) buffer, a hardware buffer to track
the addresses of recently-accessed MigrantStore pages.
