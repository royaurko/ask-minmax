Germs of meromorphic functions with linear poles at zero naturally arise in
various contexts in mathematics and physics. We provide a decomposition of the
algebra of such germs into the holomorphic part and a linear complement by
means of an inner product using our results on cones and associated fractions
in an essential way. Using this decomposition, we generalize the graded residue
on germs of meromorphic functions in one variable to a graded residue on germs
of meromorphic fractions in several variables with linear poles at zero and
prove that it is independent of the chosen inner product. When this residue is
applied to exponential discrete sums on lattice cones, we obtain exponential
integrals, giving a first relation between exponential sums and exponential
integrals on lattice cones. On the other hand, this decomposition of
meromorphic germs also provides a key ingredient in the Birkhoff-Hopf type
factorization~\cite{GPZ3} through which we revisited Berline and Vergne's
Euler-Maclaurin formula on lattice cones, establishing another relation between
exponential sums and integrals.
