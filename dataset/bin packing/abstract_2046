We use Stein's method to obtain bounds on the rate of convergence for a class
of statistics in geometric probability obtained as a sum of contributions from
Poisson points which are exponentially stabilizing, i.e. locally determined in
a certain sense. Examples include statistics such as total edge length and
total number of edges of graphs in computational geometry and the total number
of particles accepted in random sequential packing models. These rates also
apply to the 1-dimensional marginals of the random measures associated with
these statistics.
