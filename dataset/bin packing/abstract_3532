The fluid phase diagram of trimer particles composed of one central
attractive bead and two repulsive beads was determined as a function of simple
geometric parameters using flat-histogram Monte Carlo methods. A variety of
self-assembled structures were obtained including spherical micelle-like
clusters, elongated clusters and densely packed cylinders, depending on both
the state conditions and shape of the trimer. Advanced simulation techniques
were employed to determine transitions between self-assembled structures and
macro- scopic phases using thermodynamic and structural definitions. Simple
changes in particle geometry yield dramatic changes in phase behavior, ranging
from macroscopic fluid phase separation to molecular-scale self- assembly. In
special cases, both self-assembled, elongated clusters and bulk fluid phase
separation occur simultaneously. Our work suggests that tuning particle shape
and interactions can yield superstructures with controlled architecture.
