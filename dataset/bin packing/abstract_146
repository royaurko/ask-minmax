We propose a theoretical framework for predicting the protocol dependence of
the jamming transition for frictionless spherical particles that interact via
purely repulsive contact forces. We study isostatic jammed disk packings
obtained via two protocols: isotropic compression and simple shear. We show
that for frictionless systems, all jammed packings can be obtained via either
protocol. However, the probability to obtain a particular jammed packing
depends on the packing-generation protocol. We predict the average shear strain
required to induce jamming in initially unjammed packings from the measured
probability to jam at packing fraction $\phi$ from isotropic compression. We
compare our predictions to results from numerical simulations of jamming and
find quantitative agreement. We also show that the packing fraction range, over
which strain-induced jamming occurs, tends to zero in the large system limit
for frictionless packings with overdamped dynamics.
