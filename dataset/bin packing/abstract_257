In this paper we prove a theorem that provides an upper bound for the density
of packings of congruent copies of a given convex body in $\R^n$; this theorem
is a generalization of the linear programming bound for sphere packings. We
illustrate its use by computing an upper bound for the maximum density of
packings of regular pentagons in the plane. Our computational approach is
numerical and uses a combination of semidefinite programming, sums of squares,
and the harmonic analysis of the Euclidean motion group. We show how, with some
extra work, the bounds so obtained can be made rigorous.
