A new method for correcting charged-particle spectra for thick target effects
is described. Starting with a trial function, inverse response functions are
found by an iterative procedure. The variances corresponding to the measured
spectrum are treated similiarly and in parallel. Oscillations of the solution
are avoided by rebinning the data to finer bins during a correction iteration
and back to the original or wider binning after each iteration. This
thick-target correction method has been used for data obtained with the MEDLEY
facility at the The Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden, and is here presented
in detail and demonstrated for two test cases.
