Metasurfaces with subwavelength thickness have exhibited unconventional
phenomena in ways that could not be mimicked by traditional materials. Here we
report the analytical design and experimental realizations of acoustic
metasurface with hitherto inaccessible functionality of manipulating the
reflected waves arbitrarily. By suitably designing the phase shift profile
covering 2 range induced by labyrinthine units, the metasurface can reflect
acoustic waves in an unusual yet controllable manner. Anomalous reflection and
ultrathin planar lens with adjustable focal point were both demonstrated with
carefully designed metasurfaces. Remarkably, the free manipulation of phase
shifts offers great flexibility in the design of non-paraxial or paraxial
acoustic self-accelerating beams with arbitrary trajectories. With the
extraordinary wave-steering ability, the metasurface should open exciting
possibilities for designing compact acoustic components with versatile
potential and may find a variety of applications ranging from ultrasound
imaging to field caustic engineering.
