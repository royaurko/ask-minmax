We demonstrate here a method to fabricate CdSe photonic crystal from a very
cheap fabrication route of templated self-assembly. The hexagonal close-packed
photonic crystals are formed by the electrochemical growth of CdSe through the
interstitial spaces between polymer nano/micro sphere templates. The confocal
voids containing photonic crystals can be made either interconnected or well
separated, with high uniformity. Structural and optical characterization
confirms the good quality of electrochemically grown CdSe. These cheaply
fabricated 2D photonic crystals provide a wide range of opportunities for
optoelectronic devices.
