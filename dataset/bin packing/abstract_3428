Pair distributions of fluids confined between two surfaces at close distance
are of fundamental importance for a variety of physical, chemical, and
biological phenomena, such as interactions between macromolecules in solution,
surface forces, and diffusion in narrow pores. However, in contrast to bulk
fluids, properties of inhomogeneous fluids are seldom studied at the
pair-distribution level. Motivated by recent experimental advances in
determining anisotropic structure factors of confined fluids, we analyze
theoretically the underlying anisotropic pair distributions of the archetypical
hard-sphere fluid confined between two parallel hard surfaces using
first-principles statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous fluids. For this
purpose, we introduce an experimentally accessible ensemble-averaged local
density correlation function and study its behavior as a function of confining
slit width. Upon increasing the distance between the confining surfaces, we
observe an alternating sequence of strongly anisotropic versus more isotropic
local order. The latter is due to packing frustration of the spherical
particles. This observation highlights the importance of studying inhomogeneous
fluids at the pair-distribution level.
