Jamming is a common feature of out of equilibrium systems showing slow
relaxation dynamics. Here we review our efforts in understanding jamming in
granular materials using experiments and computer simulations. We first obtain
an estimation of an effective temperature for a slowly sheared granular
material very close to jamming. The measurement of the effective temperature is
realized in the laboratory by slowly shearing a closely-packed ensemble of
spherical beads confined by an external pressure in a Couette geometry. All the
probe particles, independent of their characteristic features, equilibrate at
the same temperature, given by the packing density of the system. This suggests
that the effective temperature is a state variable for the nearly jammed
system. Then we investigate numerically whether the effective temperature can
be obtained from a flat average over the jammed configuration at a given energy
in the granular packing, as postulated by the thermodynamic approach to grains.
