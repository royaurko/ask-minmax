We consider Standard Model Higgs boson production in association with a Z
boson in hadron collisions. We present a fully exclusive computation of QCD
radiative corrections up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). Our
calculation includes the Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks (b) in
next-to-leading order QCD and the leptonic decay of the Z boson with
finite-width effects and spin correlations. The computation is implemented in a
parton level Monte Carlo program that makes possible to consider arbitrary
kinematical cuts on the final-state leptons, the b jets and the associated QCD
radiation, and to compute the corresponding distributions in the form of bin
histograms. We assess the impact of QCD radiative effects in the boosted
kinematics at the LHC and show that the inclusion of the NNLO corrections is
crucial to control the pT spectrum of the Higgs boson candidate.
