The 64-channel Multianode Photo Multiplier (MaPMT) has been evaluated as a
candidate for the LHCb Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) photo detectors. We
present result from data taken with a 3x3 array of closely packed MaPMTs
mounted onto the RICH 1 prototype vessel, exposed to charged particle beams at
CERN, and read out at LHC speed. Using a LED light source, we have performed
spatial light scans to study the light collection efficiency of the MaPMTs We
have also measured the performance of the MaPMTs as a function of the applied
high voltage. Different dynode resistor chains have been used to study the
tubes at low gains. In addition, we have studied the behaviour of the MaPMT in
magnetic fields.
