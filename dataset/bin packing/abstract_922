We study algorithms based on local improvements for the $k$-Set Packing
problem. The well-known local improvement algorithm by Hurkens and Schrijver
has been improved by Sviridenko and Ward from $\frac{k}{2}+\epsilon$ to
$\frac{k+2}{3}$, and by Cygan to $\frac{k+1}{3}+\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$.
In this paper, we achieve the approximation ratio $\frac{k+1}{3}+\epsilon$ for
the $k$-Set Packing problem using a simple polynomial-time algorithm based on
the method by Sviridenko and Ward. With the same approximation guarantee, our
algorithm runs in time singly exponential in $\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$, while the
running time of Cygan's algorithm is doubly exponential in
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$. On the other hand, we construct an instance with locality
gap $\frac{k+1}{3}$ for any algorithm using local improvements of size
$O(n^{1/5})$, here $n$ is the total number of sets. Thus, our approximation
guarantee is optimal with respect to results achievable by algorithms based on
local improvements.
