Recent simulation studies have drawn attention to the shoulder which forms in
the second peak of the radial distribution function of hard-spheres at
densities close to freezing and which is associated with local crystalline
ordering in the dense fluid. We address this structural precursor to freezing
using an inhomogeneous integral equation theory capable of describing local
packing constraints to a high level of accuracy. The addition of a short-range
attractive interaction leads to a well known broadening of the fluid-solid
coexistence region as a function of attraction strength. The appearence of a
shoulder in our calculated radial distribution functions is found to be
consistent with the broadened coexistence region for a simple model potential,
thus demonstrating that the shoulder is not exclusively a high density packing
effect.
