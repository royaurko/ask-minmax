We investigate the multi-electron dynamics in high-order harmonic generation
(HHG) from N2 molecules. Clear spectral minima are observed in the cutoff
region at all three mid-infrared wavelengths (i.e., 1300, 1400 and 1500 nm)
chosen in our experiment. It is found that the positions of the spectral minima
do not depend on the alignment angles of molecules. In addition, the spectral
minima shift almost linearly with the increasing laser intensity at all three
wavelengths, which provides a strong evidence on the dynamic multi-channel
interference origin of these minima. The advantages of observation of dynamic
multi-channel interference based on HHG driven by long wavelength lasers are
discussed.
