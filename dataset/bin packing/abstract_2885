We introduce a three-dimensional lattice gas model to study the glass
transition. In this model the interactions come from the excluded volume and
particles have five arms with an asymmetrical shape, which results in geometric
frustration that inhibits full packing. Each particle has two degrees of
freedom, the position and the orientation of the particle. We find a second
order phase transition at a density $\rho\approx 0.305$, this transition
decouples the orientation of the particles which can rotate without interaction
in this degree of freedom until $\rho=0.5$ is reached. Both the inverse
diffusivity and the relaxation time follow a power law behavior for densities
$\rho\le 0.5$. The crystallization at $\rho=0.5$ is avoided because frustration
lets to the system to reach higher densities, then the divergencies are
overcome. For $\rho > 0.5 $ the orientations of the particles are coupled and
the dynamics is governed by both degrees of freedom.
