We present initial results from observations and numerical analyses aimed at
characterizing main-belt comet P/2012 T1 (PANSTARRS). Optical monitoring
observations were made between October 2012 and February 2013 using the
University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope, the Keck I telescope, the Baade and Clay
Magellan telescopes, Faulkes Telescope South, the Perkins Telescope at Lowell
Observatory, and the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope. The
object's intrinsic brightness approximately doubles from the time of its
discovery in early October until mid-November and then decreases by ~60%
between late December and early February, similar to photometric behavior
exhibited by several other main-belt comets and unlike that exhibited by
disrupted asteroid (596) Scheila. We also used Keck to conduct spectroscopic
searches for CN emission as well as absorption at 0.7 microns that could
indicate the presence of hydrated minerals, finding an upper limit CN
production rate of QCN<1.5x10^23 mol/s, from which we infer a water production
rate of QH2O<5x10^25 mol/s, and no evidence of the presence of hydrated
minerals. Numerical simulations indicate that P/2012 T1 is largely dynamically
stable for >100 Myr and is unlikely to be a recently implanted interloper from
the outer solar system, while a search for potential asteroid family
associations reveal that it is dynamically linked to the ~155 Myr-old Lixiaohua
asteroid family.
