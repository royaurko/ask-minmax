We present analytical calculation of the first seven moments of the heavy
quark vacuum polarization function in the three-loop order. The obtained
results are compared against the asymptotic formulas following from the
threshold singularities. We also discuss the $\mu$ dependence of the moments
within the BLM procedure.
