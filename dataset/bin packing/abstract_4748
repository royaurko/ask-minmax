The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Experiment is a second-generation
highsensitivity gamma-ray and cosmic-ray detector that builds on the experience
and technology of the Milagro observatory. Like Milagro, HAWC utilizes the
water Cherenkov technique to measure extensive air showers. Instead of a pond
filled with water (as in Milagro) an array of closely packed water tanks is
used. The event direction will be reconstructed using the times when the PMTs
in each tank are triggered. Therefore, the timing calibration will be crucial
for reaching an angular resolution as low as 0.25 degrees.We propose to use a
laser calibration system, patterned after the calibration system in Milagro.
Like Milagro, the HAWC optical calibration system will use ~1 ns laser light
pulses. Unlike Milagro, the PMTs are optically isolated and require their own
optical fiber calibration. For HAWC the laser light pulses will be directed
through a series of optical fan-outs and fibers to illuminate the PMTs in
approximately one half of the tanks on any given pulse. Time slewing
corrections will be made using neutraldensity filters to control the light
intensity over 4 orders of magnitude. This system is envisioned to run
continuously at a low rate and will be controlled remotely. In this paper, we
present the design of the calibration system and first measurements of its
performance.
