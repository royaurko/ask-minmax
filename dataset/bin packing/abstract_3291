This paper is about cubic sand grains moving around on nicely packed columns
in one dimension (the physical sand pile is two dimensional, but the support of
sand columns is one dimensional). The Kadanoff Sand Pile Model is a discrete
dynamical system describing the evolution of a finite number of stacked grains
--as they would fall from an hourglass-- to a stable configuration. Grains move
according to the repeated application of a simple local rule until reaching a
stable configuration from which no rule can be applied, namely a fixed point.
  The main interest of the model relies in the difficulty of understanding its
behavior, despite the simplicity of the rule. We are interested in describing
the shape of fixed point configurations according to the number of initially
stacked sand grains. In this paper, we prove the emergence of a wavy shape on
fixed points, i.e., a regular pattern is (nearly) periodically repeated on
fixed points. Interestingly, the regular pattern does not cover the entire
fixed point, but eventually emerges from a seemingly highly disordered segment.
Fortunately, the relative size of the part of fixed points non-covered by the
pattern repetition is asymptotically null.
