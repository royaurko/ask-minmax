Media composed of colliding hard disks (2D) or hard spheres (3D) serve as
good approximations for the collective hydrodynamic description of gases,
liquids and granular media. In the present study, the compressible
hydrodynamics and shock dynamics are studied for a two-dimensional hard-disk
medium at both the continuum and discrete particle level descriptions. For the
continuum description, closed form analytical expressions for the inviscid
hydrodynamic description, shock Hugoniot, isentropic exponent and shock jump
conditions were obtained using the Helfand equation of state. The closed-form
analytical solutions permitted us to gain physical insight on the role of the
material's density on its compressibility, i.e. how the medium compresses under
mechanical loadings and sustains wave motion. Furthermore, the predictions were
found in excellent agreement with calculations using the Event Driven Molecular
Dynamic method involving 30,000 particles over the entire range of
compressibility spanning the dilute ideal gas and liquid phases. In all cases,
it was found that the energy imparted by the piston motion to the thermalized
medium behind the propagating shock was quasi-independent of the medium's
packing fraction, with a correction vanishing with increasing shock Mach
numbers.
