The production of forward jets of transverse momentum $p_T(j)\approx Q$ and
large momentum fraction $x_{jet}\gg x$ probes the onset of BFKL dynamics at
HERA. A full ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ calculation of the inclusive forward jet
cross section is presented and compared to the expected BFKL cross section. The
kinematical region populated by these events and the scale dependence of the
fixed order perturbative QCD cross sections are discussed.
