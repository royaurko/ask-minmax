We present a cylindrically curved GaAs x-ray spectrometer with energy
resolution $\Delta E/E = 1.1\cdot 10^{-4}$ and wave-number resolution of
$\Delta k/k = 3\cdot 10^{-3}$, allowing plasmon scattering at the resolution
limits of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) x-ray free-electron laser. It
spans scattering wavenumbers of 3.6 to $5.2/$\AA\ in 100 separate bins, with
only 0.34\% wavenumber blurring. The dispersion of 0.418~eV/$13.5\,\mu$m agrees
with predictions within 1.3\%. The reflection homogeneity over the entire
wavenumber range was measured and used to normalize the amplitude of scattering
spectra. The proposed spectrometer is superior to a mosaic HAPG spectrometer
when the energy resolution needs to be comparable to the LCLS seeded bandwidth
of 1~eV and a significant range of wavenumbers must be covered in one exposure.
