Considering a general input distribution, using Gel'fand-Pinsker full binning
scheme and the Han- Kobayashi (HK) jointly decoding strategy, we obtain a new
achievable rate region for the cognitive radio channel (CRC) and then derive a
simplified description for the region, by a combination of Cover superposition
coding, binning scheme and the HK decoding technique. Our rate region (i) has
an interesting interpretation, i.e., any rate in the region, as expected, has
generally three additional terms in comparison with the KH region for the
interference channel (IC): one term due to the input correlation, the other
term due to binning scheme and the third term due to the interference dependent
on the inputs, (ii) is really a generalization of the HK region for the IC to
the CRC by the use of binning scheme, and as a result of this generalization we
see that different versions of our region for the CRC are reduced to different
versions of the previous results for the IC, and (iii) is a generalized and
improved version of previous results ,i.g., the Devroye-Mitran-Tarokh (DMT)
region.
