Due to an ever growing shortage of conventional energy sources, there is an
increasingly intense interest in harnessing solar energy. The instant invention
can contribute to the goal of achieving environmentally clean solar energy to
be competitive with conventional energy sources. A novel method is described
for manufacturing a transparent sheet with an embedded array of mirrored
spheroidal micro-balls for use in a solar energy concentrator, and analogous
applications such as optical switches and solar rocket assist. The micro-balls
are covered with a thin spherical shell of lubricating liquid so that they are
free to rotate in an almost frictionless encapsulation in the sheet. Novel
method and apparatus are presented for producing the preferred embodiment of a
close-packed monolayer of the array of mirrored micro-balls.
