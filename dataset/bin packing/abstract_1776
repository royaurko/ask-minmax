The Quark-Gluon Plasma can be produced in high energy heavy ion collisions
and how it equilibrates is important for the extraction of the properties of
strongly interacting matter. A radiative transport model can be used to reveal
interesting characteristics of Quark-Gluon Plasma thermalization. For example,
screened parton interactions always lead to partial pressure isotropization.
Systems with different initial pressure anisotropies evolve toward the same
asymptotic evolution. In particular, radiative processes are crucial for the
chemical equilibration of the system. Matrix elements under the soft and
collinear approximation for these processes, as first derived by Gunion and
Bertsch, are widely used. A different approach is to start with the exact
matrix elements for the two to three and its inverse processes. General
features of this approach will be reviewed and the results will be compared
with the Gunion-Bertsch results. We will comment on the possible implications
of the exact matrix element approach on Quark-Gluon Plasma thermalization.
