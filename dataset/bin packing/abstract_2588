We report on an experimental measurement of the pulse front tilt (PFT) of
spatiotemporally focused femtosecond laser pulses in the focal plane in both
air and bulk transparent materials, which is achieved by examination of the
interference pattern between the spatiotemporally focused pulse and a
conventional focused reference pulse as a function of time delay between the
two pulses. Our simulation results agree well with the experimental
observations.
