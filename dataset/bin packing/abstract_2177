We are interested in maximizing the number of pairwise unrelated copies of a
poset $P$ in the family of all subsets of $[n]$. We prove that for any $P$ the
maximum number of unrelated copies of $P$ is asymptotic to a constant times the
largest binomial coefficient. Moreover, the constant has the form
$\frac{1}{c(P)}$, where $c(P)$ is the size of the smallest convex closure over
all embeddings of $P$ into the Boolean lattice.
