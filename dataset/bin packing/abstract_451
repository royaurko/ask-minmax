We study 2-dimensional binary mixtures of parallel squares as well as of
disks. A recent cluster algorithm allows us to establish an entropic demixing
transition between a homogeneously packed fluid phase and a demixed phase of a
practically close-packed aggregate of large squares surrounded by a fluid of
small squares.
