Differential cross sections for the gamma p -> pi^0 p reaction have been
measured with the A2 tagged-photon facilities at the Mainz Microtron, MAMI C,
up to the center-of-mass energy W=1.9 GeV. The new results, obtained with a
fine energy and angular binning, increase the existing quantity of pi^0
photoproduction data by ~47%. Owing to the unprecedented statistical accuracy
and the full angular coverage, the results are sensitive to high partial-wave
amplitudes. This is demonstrated by the decomposition of the differential cross
sections in terms of Legendre polynomials and by further comparison to model
predictions. A new solution of the SAID partial-wave analysis obtained after
adding the new data into the fit is presented.
