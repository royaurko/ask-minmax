The competition between toroidal and rod-like conformations as possible
ground states for DNA condensation is studied as a function of the stiffness,
the length of the DNA and the form of the long-range interactions between
neighboring molecules, using analytical theory supported by Monte Carlo
simulations. Both conformations considered are characterized by a local nematic
order with hexagonal packing symmetry of neighboring DNA molecules, but differ
in global configuration of the chain and the distribution of its curvature as
it wraps around to form a condensate. The long-range interactions driving the
DNA condensation are assumed to be of the form pertaining to the attractive
depletion potential as well as the attractive counterion induced soft
potential. In the stiffness-length plane we find a transition between rod-like
to toroid condensate for increasing stiffness at a fixed chain length $L$.
Strikingly, the transition line is found to have a $L^{1/3}$ dependence
irrespective of the details of the long-range interactions between neighboring
molecules. When realistic DNA parameters are used, our description reproduces
rather well some of the experimental features observed in DNA condensates.
