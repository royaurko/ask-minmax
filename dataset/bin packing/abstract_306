In this note we re-examine the classic Janssen theory for stresses in bins,
including a randomness in the friction coefficient. The Janssen analysis relies
on assumptions not met in practice; for this reason, we numerically solve the
PDEs expressing balance of momentum in a bin, again including randomness in
friction.
