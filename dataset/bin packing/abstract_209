Apollonian circle packings arise by repeatedly filling the interstices
between four mutually tangent circles with further tangent circles. Such
packings can be described in terms of the Descartes configurations they
contain. It observed there exist infinitely many types of integral Apollonian
packings in which all circles had integer curvatures, with the integral
structure being related to the integral nature of the Apollonian group. Here we
consider the action of a larger discrete group, the super-Apollonian group,
also having an integral structure, whose orbits describe the Descartes
quadruples of a geometric object we call a super-packing. The circles in a
super-packing never cross each other but are nested to an arbitrary depth.
Certain Apollonian packings and super-packings are strongly integral in the
sense that the curvatures of all circles are integral and the
curvature$\times$centers of all circles are integral. We show that (up to
scale) there are exactly 8 different (geometric) strongly integral
super-packings, and that each contains a copy of every integral Apollonian
circle packing (also up to scale). We show that the super-Apollonian group has
finite volume in the group of all automorphisms of the parameter space of
Descartes configurations, which is isomorphic to the Lorentz group $O(3, 1)$.
