Existing feedback communication schemes are either specialized to particular
channels (Schalkwijk--Kailath, Horstein), or apply to general channels but have
high coding complexity (block feedback schemes) or are difficult to analyze
(posterior matching). This paper introduces a feedback coding scheme that
combines features from previous schemes in addition to a new randomization
technique. We show that our scheme achieves the capacity for all discrete
memoryless channels and establish a bound on its error exponent that approaches
the sphere packing bound as the rate approaches the capacity. These benefits
are attained with only O(n log n) coding complexity.
