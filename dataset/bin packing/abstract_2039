Iku Nakamura [Hilbert schemes of Abelian group orbits, J. Alg. Geom. 10
(2001), 757--779] introduced the G-Hilbert scheme for a finite subgroup G in
SL(3,C), and conjectured that it is a crepant resolution of the quotient C^3/G.
He proved this for a diagonal Abelian group A by introducing an explicit
algorithm that calculates A-Hilb C^3. This note calculates A-Hilb C^3 much more
simply, in terms of fun with continued fractions plus regular tesselations by
equilateral triangles.
