We study statistical and structural properties of extreme lattices, which are
the local minima in the density landscape of lattice sphere packings, in
$d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, we ascertain the
distributions of densities, kissing numbers and numbers of symmetries of the
packings across a wide range of dimensions using the stochastic Voronoi
algorithm. The degree to which the packings decorrelate as well as the
correlations between the density maxima as the space dimension increases is
also investigated. We find that the extreme lattices decorrelate with
increasing dimension, the least symmetric lattices decorrelate faster. The
extreme lattices in a fixed dimension of space $d$ ($d\geq 8$) are dominated by
typical lattices that have similar packing properties, like packing densities
and kissing numbers, while the best and the worst packers are in the long tails
of the distribution of the extreme lattices.
