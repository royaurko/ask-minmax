We have used the MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of STars)
microsatellite to obtain four weeks of contiguous high-precision broadband
visual photometry of the O7.5III(n)((f)) star {\xi} Persei in November 2011.
This star is well known from previous work to show prominent DACs (Discrete
Absorption Components) on time-scales of about 2 d from UV spectroscopy and NRP
(Non Radial Pulsation) with one (l = 3) p-mode oscillation with a period of 3.5
h from optical spectroscopy. Our MOST-orbit (101.4 min) binned photometry fails
to reveal any periodic light variations above the 0.1 mmag 3-sigma noise level
for periods of hours, while several prominent Fourier peaks emerge at the 1
mmag level in the two-day period range. These longer-period variations are
unlikely due to pulsations, including gravity modes. From our simulations based
upon a simple spot model, we deduce that we are seeing the photometric
modulation of several co-rotating bright spots on the stellar surface. In our
model, the starting times (random) and lifetimes (up to several rotations) vary
from one spot to another yet all spots rotate at the same period of 4.18 d, the
best-estimated rotation period of the star. This is the first convincing
reported case of co-rotating bright spots on an O star, with important
implications for drivers of the DACs (resulting from CIRs - Corotating
Interaction Regions) with possible bright-spot generation via a breakout at the
surface of a global magnetic field generated by a subsurface convection zone.
