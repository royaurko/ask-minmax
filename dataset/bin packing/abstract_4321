We present a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the population of the hot
branch of the white dwarf luminosity function. We used the most up-to-date
stellar evolutionary models and we implemented a full description of the
observational selection biases. Our theoretical results are compared with the
luminosity function of hot white dwarfs obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), for both DA and non-DA white dwarfs. For non-DA white dwarfs we
find an excellent agreement with the observational data, while for DA white
dwarfs our simulations show some discrepancies with the observations for the
brightest luminosity bins, those corresponding to L>= 10 L_sun.
