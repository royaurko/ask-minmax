We numerically calculate the configurational entropy S_conf of a binary
mixture of hard spheres, by using a perturbed Hamiltonian method trapping the
system inside a given state, which requires less assumptions than the previous
methods [R.J. Speedy, Mol. Phys. 95, 169 (1998)]. We find that S_conf is a
decreasing function of packing fraction f and extrapolates to zero at the
Kauzmann packing fraction f_K = 0.62, suggesting the possibility of an ideal
glass-transition for hard spheres system. Finally, the Adam-Gibbs relation is
found to hold.
