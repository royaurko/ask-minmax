We present a stochastic model of dynamically interacting grains in one
dimension, in the presence of a low vibrational intensity, to investigate the
effect of shape on the statics and dynamics of the compaction process.
Regularity and irregularity in grain shapes are shown to be centrally important
in determining the statics of close-packing states, as well as the nature of
zero- and low-temperature dynamics in this columnar model.
