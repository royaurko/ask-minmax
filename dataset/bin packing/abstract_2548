In this paper the Output Statistics of Random Binning (OSRB) framework is
used to prove a new inner bound for the problem of secure channel simulation.
Our results subsume some recent results on the secure function computation. We
also provide an achievability result for the problem of simultaneously
simulating a channel and creating a shared secret key. A special case of this
result generalizes the lower bound of Gohari and Anantharam on the source model
to include constraints on the rates of the public discussion.
