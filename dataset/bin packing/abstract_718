Using probabilistic ideas, we prove that the packing dimension of a mean
porous measure is strictly smaller than the dimension of the ambient space.
Moreover, we give an explicit bound for the packing dimension, which is
asymptotically sharp in the case of small porosity. This result was stated in
[D. B. Beliaev and S. K. Smirnov, "On dimension of porous measures", Math. Ann.
323 (2002) 123-141], but the proof given there is not correct. We also give
estimates on the dimension of weakly mean porous measures, which improve
another result of Beliaev and Smirnov.
