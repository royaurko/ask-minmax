In the Page parking (or packing) model on a discrete interval (also known as
the discrete R{\'e}nyi packing problem or the unfriendly seating problem), cars
of length two successively park uniformly at random on pairs of adjacent
places, until only isolated places remain. We give a probabilistic proof of the
(known) fact that the proportion of the interval covered by cars goes to
1-exp(-2) , when the length of the interval goes to infinity. We obtain some
new consequences, and also study a version of this process defined on the
infinite line.
