The remarkable discrepancy between theory and data on the p_t distribution of
J/psi polarization in the process pp -> J/psi+X has been standing as a puzzle
for a long time. Our early work indicates that if only considering the
color-singlet state, NLO corrections may drastically change the distribution,
but are not sufficient to accommodate the data. The color-octet intermediate
state was suggested to make up the gap. Therefore a direct motivation is to
evaluate if the NLO corrections to the J/psi production via a color-octet can
indeed remedy the problem. Unfortunately, our results show that even the NLO
corrections to both color-singlet and octet states are accounted, the data
cannot be understood yet in the framework of the present theory, but there, as
observed, still a small window remains, namely a P-wave octet might
substantially contribute.
