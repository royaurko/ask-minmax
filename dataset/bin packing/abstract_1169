We study the ballistic deposition and the grain deposition models on
two-dimensional substrates. Using the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) ansatz for
height fluctuations, we show that the main contribution to the intrinsic width,
which causes strong corrections to the scaling, comes from the fluctuations in
the height increments along deposition events. Accounting for this correction
in the scaling analysis, we obtained scaling exponents in excellent agreement
with the KPZ class. We also propose a method to suppress these corrections,
which consists in divide the surface in bins of size $\varepsilon$ and use only
the maximal height inside each bin to do the statistics. Again, scaling
exponents in remarkable agreement with the KPZ class were found. The binning
method allowed the accurate determination of the height distributions of the
ballistic models in both growth and steady state regimes, providing the
universal underlying fluctuations foreseen for KPZ class in 2+1 dimensions. Our
results provide complete and conclusive evidences that the ballistic model
belongs to the KPZ universality class in $2+1$ dimensions. Potential
applications of the methods developed here, in both numerics and experiments,
are discussed.
