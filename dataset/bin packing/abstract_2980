We present fully atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulation results on a
main-chain polymer, 1,4-Polybutadiene, in the merging region of the $\alpha$-
and $beta$-relaxations. A real space analysis reveals the occurrence of
localized motions (``$\beta$-like'') in addition to the diffusive structural
relaxation. A molecular approach provides a direct connection between the local
conformational changes reflected in the atomic motions and the secondary
relaxations in this polymer. Such local processes occur just in the time window
where the $\beta$-process of the Mode Coupling Theory is expected. We show that
the application of this theory is still possible, and yields an unusually large
value of the exponent parameter. This result might originate from the
competition between two mechanisms for dynamic arrest: intermolecular packing
and intramolecular barriers for local conformational changes
(``$\beta$-like'').
