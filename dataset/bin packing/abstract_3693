We reanalyse the spectra used by D.-E. Liebscher (no relation) et al with the
same goal -- determining the cosmological parameters -- and basically the same
assumptions but with a different statistical method, which does not rely on
binning the data. Also, we correct for selection effects. We basically confirm
their result, with somewhat larger but still very small (formal) errors.
However, all world models within the 99% confidence region are ruled out
because a firm lower limit on $\Omega_{0}$ is significantly larger. This
directly demonstrates for the first time the existence of intrinsic evolution
in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest.
