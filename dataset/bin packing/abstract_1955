We predict new forms of carbon consisting of one and two dimensional networks
of interlinked single wall carbon nanotubes, some of which are energetically
more stable than van der Waals packing of the nanotubes on a hexagonal lattice.
These interlinked nanotubes are further transformed with higher applied
external pressures to more dense and complicated stable structures, in which
curvature-induced carbon sp$^{3}$ re-hybridizations are formed. We also discuss
the energetics of the bond formation between nanotubes and the electronic
properties of these predicted novel structures.
