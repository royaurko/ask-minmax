We compute the leading contributions to the magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole moments of the baryon decuplet in chiral perturbation theory. The
measured value for the magnetic moment of the $\Omega^-$ is used to determine
the local counterterm for the magnetic moments. We compare the chiral
perturbation theory predictions for the magnetic moments of the decuplet with
those of the baryon octet and find reasonable agreement with the predictions of
the large--$N_c$ limit of QCD. The leading contribution to the quadrupole
moment of the $\Delta$ and other members of the decuplet comes from one--loop
graphs. The pionic contribution is shown to be proportional to $I_z$ (and so
will not contribute to the quadrupole moment of $I=0$ nuclei), while the
contribution from kaons has both isovector and isoscalar components. The chiral
logarithmic enhancement of both pion and kaon loops has a coefficient that
vanishes in the $SU(6)$ limit. The third allowed moment, the magnetic octupole,
is shown to be dominated by a local counterterm with corrections arising at two
loops. We briefly mention the strange counterparts of these moments.
