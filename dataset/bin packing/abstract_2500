We employ the variational method for the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem
to analytically investigate the properties of the holographic superconductors.
We find that the analytic method is still powerful when the backreaction is
turned on. Reducing step size in the iterative procedure, we observe that the
consistency of results between the analytic and numerical computations can be
further improved. The obtained analytic result can be used to back up the
numerical computations in the holographic superconductor in the fully
backreacted spacetime.
