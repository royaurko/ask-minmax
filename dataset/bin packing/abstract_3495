Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF; Chatterjee & Tan 2014, hereafter CT14) is
a scenario for sequential in situ planet formation at the pressure traps of
retreating dead zone inner boundaries (DZIBs) motivated to explain the many
systems with tightly packed inner planets (STIPs) discovered by Kepler. The
scenario involves build-up of a pebble-dominated protoplanetary ring, supplied
by radial drift of pebbles from the outer disk. It may also involve further
build-up of planetary masses to gap-opening scales via continued pebble
accretion. Here we study radial drift & growth of pebbles delivered to the DZIB
in fiducial IOPF disk models.
