This is the editorial for the special issue on "data-intensive geospatial
computing", which I guest edited with the International Journal of Geographical
Information Science (Taylor & Francis). As remarked in the editorial, the
special issue is particularly special in the sense that all source and data are
published together with the published papers. This editorial elaborates on
scholarly communication, with particular attention to publishing data alongside
papers and the emergence of open access journals, in order to make our research
more open access.
