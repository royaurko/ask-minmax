Consider a bin containing $n$ balls colored with two colors. In a $k$-query,
$k$ balls are selected by a questioner and the oracle's reply is related
(depending on the computation model being considered) to the distribution of
colors of the balls in this $k$-tuple; however, the oracle never reveals the
colors of the individual balls. Following a number of queries the questioner is
said to determine the majority color if it can output a ball of the majority
color if it exists, and can prove that there is no majority if it does not
exist. We investigate two computation models (depending on the type of replies
being allowed). We give algorithms to compute the minimum number of 3-queries
which are needed so that the questioner can determine the majority color and
provide tight and almost tight upper and lower bounds on the number of queries
needed in each case.
