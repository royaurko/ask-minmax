We study the emergence of discontinuous shear-thickening (DST) in cornstarch,
by combining macroscopic rheometry with local Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
measurements. We bring evidence that macroscopic DST is observed only when the
flow separates into a low-density flowing and a high-density jammed region. In
the shear-thickened steady state, the local rheology in the flowing region, is
not DST but, strikingly, is often shear-thinning. Our data thus show that the
stress jump measured during DST, in cornstach, does not capture a secondary,
high-viscosity branch of the local steady rheology, but results from the
existence of a shear jamming limit at volume fractions quite significantly
below random close packing.
