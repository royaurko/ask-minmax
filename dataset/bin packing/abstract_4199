We present the archive of the INTEGRAL data developed and maintained at
INAF-IASF Milano. The archive comprises all the public data currently available
(revolutions 0026-1079, i.e., December 2002 - August 2011). INTEGRAL data are
downloaded from the ISDC Data Centre for Astrophysics, Geneva, on a regular
basis as they become public and a customized analysis using the OSA 9.0
software package is routinely performed on the IBIS/ISGRI data. The scientific
products include individual pointing images and the associated detected source
lists in the 17-30, 30-50, 17-50 and 50-100 keV energy bands, as well as
light-curves binned over 100 s in the 17-30 keV band for sources of interest.
Dedicated scripts to handle such vast datasets and results have been developed.
We make the analysis tools to build such an archive publicly available. The
whole database (raw data and products) enables an easy access to the hard X-ray
long-term behavior of a large sample of sources.
