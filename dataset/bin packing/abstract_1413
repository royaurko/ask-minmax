In 2005, Wyart et al. (Europhys. Lett., 72 (2005) 486) showed that the low
frequency vibrational properties of jammed amorphous sphere packings can be
understood in terms of a length scale, called l*, that diverges as the system
becomes marginally unstable. Despite the tremendous success of this theory, it
has been difficult to connect the counting argument that defines l* to other
length scales that diverge near the jamming transition. We present an alternate
derivation of l* based on the onset of rigidity. This phenomenological approach
reveals the physical mechanism underlying the length scale and is relevant to a
range of systems for which the original argument breaks down. It also allows us
to present the first direct numerical measurement of l*.
