The aim of this short paper is to summarize my recent preprint
(arXiv:1209.1112), in which I proposed a novel and probably controversial view
about cognitive mapping; that is, the image of the city out of the underlying
scaling of city artifacts or locations. The scaling refers to a recurring
structure of far more small things than large ones. In this paper, I attempt to
further clarify the central argument, and identify some possible areas of
misunderstanding for readers.
