In this paper we study the integral properties of Apollonian-3 circle
packings, which are variants of the standard Apollonian circle packings.
Specifically, we study the reduction theory, formulate a local-global
conjecture, and prove a density one version of this conjecture. Along the way,
we prove a uniform spectral gap for congruence towers of the symmetry group.
