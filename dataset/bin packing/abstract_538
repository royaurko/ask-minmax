We study the dependence of the pair-correlation function, $g(r)$, and
particle mobility on packing fraction in a dense three-dimensional packing of
soft colloids made of poly N-isopropyl acrylamide (pNIPAM), a thermo-sensitive
gel. We find that $g(r)$ for our samples is qualitatively like that of a liquid
at all packing fractions. There is a peak in $g_{1}$, the height of the first
peak of $g(r)$, as a function of packing fraction. This peak is identified as
the thermal remnant of the T=0 divergence found at the jamming transition in
simulations of soft frictionless spheres at zero-temperature. Near where there
is a peak in $g_{1}$ the particles become arrested on the time scale of the
experiment.
