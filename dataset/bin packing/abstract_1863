Metagenomics enables the reconstruction of microbial genomes in complex
microbial communities without the need for culturing. Since assembly typically
results in fragmented genomes the grouping of genome fragments (contigs)
belonging to the same genome, a process referred to as binning, remains a major
informatics challenge. Here we present CONCOCT, a computer program that
combines three types of information - sequence composition, coverage across
multiple sample, and read-pair linkage - to automatically bin contigs into
genomes. We demonstrate high recall and precision rates of the program on
artificial as well as real human gut metagenome datasets.
