We test the accuracy of the revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
exchange-correlation density functional (PBEsol) for metallic bulk and surface
systems. It is shown that, on average, PBEsol yields equilibrium volumes and
bulk moduli in close agreement with the former generalized gradient
approximation (PBE) and two gradient level functionals derived from model
system approach (LAG and AM05). On the other hand, for close-packed metal
surfaces, PBEsol has the same performance as AM05, giving significantly larger
surface energies than PBE and LAG.
