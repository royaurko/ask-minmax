The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is an international
radio telescope under construction in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
ALMA is situated on a dry site at 5000 m elevation, allowing excellent
atmospheric transmission over the instrument wavelength range of 0.3 to 10 mm.
ALMA will consist of two arrays of high-precision antennas. One, of up to 64
12-m diameter antennas, is reconfigurable in multiple patterns ranging in size
from 150 meters up to ~15 km. A second array is comprised of a set of four 12-m
and twelve 7-m antennas operating in one of two closely packed configurations
~50 m in diameter. The instrument will provide both interferometric and
total-power astronomical information on atomic, molecular and ionized gas and
dust in the solar system, our Galaxy, and the nearby to high-redshift universe.
In this paper we outline the scientific drivers, technical challenges and
planned progress of ALMA.
