We are interested in obstructions to the FIRST order deformation of a pair of
a smooth hypersurface $f_0$ and a smooth curve $C_0$ contained in $f_0$. In the
first half of the paper, we give necessary conditions for the pair to deform in
the first order. In particular, for a rational curve $C_0$, this necessary
condition is $$H^1(N_{C_0}f_0(1))=0.$$ In the second half, we apply the
necessary conditions from the first half of the paper to study the geometry of
smooth curves in hypersurfaces. The main application is for the case where
$C_0$ is a rational curve.
