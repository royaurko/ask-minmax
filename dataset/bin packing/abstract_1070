We analyze the forward-backward multiplicity correlation coefficient as
measured by STAR. We show that in the most central Au+Au collisions bins
located symmetrically around \eta = 0 with large separation in pseudorapidity
are more strongly correlated than bins located asymmetrically with smaller
separation. In proton-proton collisions the opposite effect is observed. It
suggests a qualitatively different behavior of the two-particle correlation as
a function of pseudorapidity sum in p+p and Au+Au collisions.
