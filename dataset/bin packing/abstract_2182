The nucleation kinetics of the rotator phase in hard cuboctahedra, truncated
octahedra, and rhombic dodecahedra is simulated via a combination of Forward
Flux Sampling and Umbrella Sampling. For comparable degree of supersaturation,
the polyhedra are found to have significantly lower free-energy barriers and
faster nucleation rates than hard spheres. This difference primarily stems from
localized orientational ordering, which steers polyhedral particles to pack
more efficiently. Orientational order hence fosters here the growth of
orientationally disordered nuclei.
