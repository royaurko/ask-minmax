By using multi-bands BCS theory, we have calculated the superconductivity
energy gap and the critical temperature of a thin-film metallic superconductor.
The thermodynamic superconducting characteristics such as critical magnetic
field, specific heat, as well as the tunneling conductance are investigated for
varying film thickness and temperature. We find the oscillation of
thermodynamic superconducting properties with the film thickness, including the
thermodynamic critical field $H_c$, the specific heat of normal,
superconducting state, and position of the differential tunneling conductance
peak. The two universal constants the nth sub-band energy gap $\Delta_n$ at
temperature $T=0K$ over $k_BT_c$, and the specific heat jump at $T_c$ over
normal state specific heat at $T_c$ are independent of the film thickness.
Their values are the same as in the bulk superconductor.
