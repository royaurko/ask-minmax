The synthesis, infra-red, Raman and NMR spectra and crystal structure of 2,
4, 4- trimethyl-4, 5- dihydro-3H-benzo[b] [1, 4] diazepin-1-ium
tetrachlorocadmate, [C12H17N2]2CdCl4 and benzene-1,2-diaminium
decachlorotricadmate(II) [C6H10N2]2Cd3Cl10 are reported.
  The [C12H17N2]2CdCl4 compound crystallizes in the triclinic system (P-1 space
group) with Z = 2 and the following unit cell dimensions: a = 9.6653(8)
angstrom, b = 9.9081(9) angstrom, c = 15.3737(2) angstrom, alpha =
79.486(1)degrees, beta = 88.610(8)degrees and gamma = 77.550(7)degrees. The
structure was solved by using 4439 independent reflections down to R value of
0.029. In crystal structure, the tetrachlorocadmiate anion is connected to two
organic cations through N-H...Cl hydrogen bonds and Van Der Waals interaction
as to build cation-anion-cation cohesion. The [C6H10N2]2Cd3Cl10 crystallizes in
the triclinic system (P-1 space group). The unit cell dimensions are a = 6.826
(5)angstrom, b = 9.861 (7)angstrom, c = 10.344 (3)angstrom, alpha = 103.50
(1)degrees, beta = 96.34 (4)degrees and gamma = 109.45 (3)degrees, Z=2. The
final R value is 0.053 (Rw=0.128). Its crystal structure consists of organic
cations and polymeric chains of [Cd3Cl10]4- anions running along the [011]
direction, In The [C6H10N2]2Cd3Cl10 compounds hydrogen bond interactions
between the inorganic chains and the organic cations, contribute to the crystal
packing.
