We report a search for the $h_c$ meson via the decay chain $B^{\pm}\to h_c
K^{\pm}$, $\etac \gamma$ with $\eta_c \to K_S^0 K^{\pm} \pi^{\mp}$ and
$p\bar{p}$. No significant signals are observed. We obtain upper limits on the
branching fractions for $B^{\pm} \to \eta_c\gamma K^{\pm}$ in bins of the
$\eta_c\gamma$ invariant mass. The results are based on an analysis of 253
fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+e^-$
collider.
