In this letter, we propose parallel SC (Successive Cancellation) decoder and
parallel SC-List decoder for polar codes. The parallel decoder is composed of
M=2^m(m>=1) component decoders working in parallel and each component decoder
decodes a Polar code of a block size of 1/M of the original Polar code.
Therefore the parallel decoder has M times faster decoding speed. Our
simulation results show that the parallel decoder has almost the same
error-rate performance as the conventional non-parallel decoder.
