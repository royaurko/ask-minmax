In this paper, we address the design of high spectral-efficiency Barnes-Wall
(BW) lattice codes which are amenable to low-complexity decoding in additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. We propose a new method of constructing
complex BW lattice codes from linear codes over polynomial rings, and show that
the proposed construction provides an explicit method of bit-labeling complex
BW lattice codes. To decode the code, we adapt the low-complexity sequential BW
lattice decoder (SBWD) recently proposed by Micciancio and Nicolosi. First, we
study the error performance of SBWD in decoding the infinite lattice, wherein
we analyze the noise statistics in the algorithm, and propose a new upper bound
on its error performance. We show that the SBWD is powerful in making correct
decisions well beyond the packing radius. Subsequently, we use the SBWD to
decode lattice codes through a novel noise-trimming technique. This is the
first work that showcases the error performance of SBWD in decoding BW lattice
codes of large block lengths.
