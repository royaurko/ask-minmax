We consider three-dimensional clusters of identical bubbles packed around a
central bubble and calculate their energy and optimal shape. We obtain the
surface area and bubble pressures to improve on existing growth laws for
three-dimensional bubble clusters. We discuss the possible number of bubbles
that can be packed around a central one: the ``kissing problem'', here adapted
to deformable objects.
