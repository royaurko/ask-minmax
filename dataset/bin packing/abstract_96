We study random packings of frictionless particles at T=0.
  The packing fraction where the pressure becomes nonzero is the same as the
jamming threshold, where the static shear modulus becomes nonzero. The
distribution of threshold packing fractions narrows and its peak approaches
random close-packing as the system size increases. For packing fractions within
the peak, there is no self-averaging, leading to exponential decay of the
interparticle force distribution.
