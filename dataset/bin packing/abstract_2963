We present an experimental study of the compaction dynamics for
two-dimensional anisotropic granular systems. Compaction dynamics is measured
at three different scales : (i) the macroscopic scale through the packing
fraction $\rho$, (ii) the mesoscopic scale through both fractions of aligned
grains $\phi_{a}$ and ideally ordered grains $\phi_{io}$, and (iii) the
microscopic scale through both rotational and translational grain mobilities
$\mu_{r,t}$. The effect of the grain rotations on the compaction dynamics has
been measured. At the macroscopic scale, we have observed a discontinuity in
the late stages of the compaction curve. At the mesoscopic scale, we have
observed the formation and the growth of domains made of aligned grains. From a
microscopic point of view, measurements reveal that the beginning of the
compaction process is essentially related to translational motion of the
grains. The grains rotations drive mainly the process during the latest stages
of compaction.
