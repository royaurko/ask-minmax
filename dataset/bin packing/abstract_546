We compare the structural and mechanical properties of static packings
composed of frictionless convex (ellipses) and concave (rigid dimers) particles
in two dimensions. We employ numerical simulations to generate static packings
and measure the shear stress in response to applied simple shear strain as a
function of the aspect ratio and amount of compression. We find that the
behavior near jamming is significantly different for ellipses and dimers even
though both shapes are roughly characterized by the aspect ratio and possess
the same number of translational and rotational degrees of freedom per
particle. For example, we find that ellipse packings are hypostatic (not
isostatic as found for dimers), display novel power-law scaling of the static
linear shear modulus and contact number with the amount of compression, and
possess stress-strain relations that are qualitatively different from that for
dimers. Thus, we observe that important macroscopic properties of static
packings of anisotropic particles can depend on the microscale geometrical
features of individual particles.
