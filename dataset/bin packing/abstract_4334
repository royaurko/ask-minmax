We discuss the gravitational dual of a holographic superconductor consisting
of a U(1) gauge field, a complex scalar field coupled to a charged AdS black
hole and a higher-derivative coupling between the U(1) gauge field and the
scalar with coupling constant \eta. In the presence of a magnetic field, the
system possesses localized spatially dependent droplet solutions which, in the
low temperature limit, have smaller critical temperature for \eta>0 than the
droplet solutions without the interaction term (\eta=0). In the weak magnetic
field limit, the opposite behavior is observed: the critical temperature
increases as we increase \eta. We also calculate the energy gap in the probe
limit and find that it is larger for \eta<0 than the energy gap in the
conventional case (\eta=0).
