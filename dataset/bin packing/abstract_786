During directional solidification of the solvent in a colloidal suspension,
the colloidal particles segregate from the growing solid, forming
high-particle-density regions with structure on a hierarchy of length scales
ranging from that of the particle-scale packing to the large-scale spacing
between these regions. Previous work has concentrated mostly on the medium- to
large-length scale structure, as it is the most accessible and thought to be
more technologically relevant. However, the packing of the colloids at the
particle-scale is an important component not only in theoretical descriptions
of the segregation process, but also to the utility of freeze-cast materials
for new applications. Here we present the results of experiments in which we
investigated this structure across a wide range of length scales using a
combination of small angle x-ray scattering and direct optical imaging. As
expected, during freezing the particles were concentrated into regions between
ice dendrites forming a microscopic pattern of high- and low-particle-density
regions. X-ray scattering indicates that the particles in the high density
regions were so closely packed as to be touching. However, the arrangement of
the particles does not conform to that predicted by standard inter-particle
pair potentials, suggesting that the particle packing induced by freezing
differs from that formed during equilibrium densification processes.
