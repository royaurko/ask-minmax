Virial coefficients for the two-dimensional hard-disk fluid, when expressed
in powers of density relative to maximum close packing, lead to an accurate
closed equation-of-state for the equilibrium fluid, analogous to that recently
found for hard spheres. The 2D series also converges for all densities up to a
negative pole at close packing density. The virial pressure begins to deviate
from the thermodynamic fluid in the approach to the ordering transition.
