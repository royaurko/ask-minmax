Finding out statistically significant words in DNA and protein sequences
forms the basis for many genetic studies. By applying the maximal entropy
principle, we give one systematic way to study the nonrandom occurrence of
words in DNA or protein sequences. Through comparison with experimental
results, it was shown that patterns of regulatory binding sites in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast) genomes tend to occur significantly in the
promoter regions. We studied two correlated gene family of yeast. The method
successfully extracts the binding sites varified by experiments in each family.
Many putative regulatory sites in the upstream regions are proposed. The study
also suggested that some regulatory sites are a ctive in both directions, while
others show directional preference.
