The entropy of anti-de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is found to be
stored in the material which gathers to form it and equals to $A/4$ regardless
of material states. Extending the study to two kinds of extreme black holes, we
find different entropy results for the first kind of extreme black hole due to
different material states. However for the second kind of extreme black hole
the results of entropy are uniform independently of the material states.
Relations between these results and the stability of two kinds of extreme black
holes have been addressed.
