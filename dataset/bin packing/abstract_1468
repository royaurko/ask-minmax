The underlying structural order that transcends the liquid, glass and
crystalline states is identified using an efficient genetic algorithm (GA). GA
identifies the most common energetically favorable packing motif in crystalline
structures close to the alloy's Al-10 at.% Sm composition. These motifs are in
turn compared to the observed packing motifs in the actual liquid structures
using a cluster-alignment method which reveals the average topology.
Conventional descriptions of the short-range order, such as Voronoi
tessellation, are too rigid in their analysis of the configurational poly-types
when describing the chemical and topological ordering during transition from
undercooled metallic liquids to crystalline phases or glass. Our approach here
brings new insight into describing mesoscopic order-disorder transitions in
condensed matter physics.
