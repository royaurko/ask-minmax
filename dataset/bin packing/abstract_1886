Inspired by the study of mild transient reductions in the speed of sound of
the adiabatic mode during inflation, we search for a primordial localized
feature imprinted in cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure
formation observables. We find some common oscillatory patterns both in the
Planck CMB temperature-temperature power spectrum and the WiggleZ galaxy
spectrum. By performing independent searches with these two data sets, we find
a coincidence in the most significant mode previously found by Ach\'ucarro et
al. 2013 by using only Planck data. Furthermore, the joint data analysis shows
that the oscillation frequency of the feature gets better constrained, and the
amplitude marginally deviates from zero, unlike what was observed using only
Planck data. Besides the parameter estimation, we also discuss the Bayesian
evidence. The addition of WiggleZ data mildly enhances the significance of the
best mode found in the Planck data.
