The Powder-In-Tube process has been employed to fabricate tape-like
conductors with a strong metallic sheath and based on the newly discovered MgB2
superconducting phase. Long superconducting tapes have been prepared by packing
reacted MgB2 powders inside pure Ag, Cu and Ni tubes which are then cold worked
by drawing and rolling. Such tapes have shown transport properties as good as
bulk MgB2 samples sintered in high pressure and high temperature conditions. At
4.2 K, the highest critical current density of 100000 A/cm2 has been achieved
on Nickel-sheathed single-filament conductors. A direct correlation between the
sheath tensile strength and the critical current of the unsintered tape has
been observed.
