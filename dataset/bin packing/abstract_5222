We revisit an analytical model to describe the halo-matter cross-power
spectrum and the halo auto-power spectrum in the weakly nonlinear regime, by
combining the perturbation theory (PT) for matter clustering, the local bias
model, and the halo bias. Nonlinearities in the power spectra arise from the
nonlinear clustering of matter as well as the nonlinear relation between the
matter and halo density fields. By using the "renormalization" approach, we
express the nonlinear power spectra by a sum of the two contributions: the
nonlinear matter power spectrum with the effective linear bias parameter, and
the higher-order PT spectra having the halo bias parameters as the
coefficients. The halo auto-power spectrum includes the residual shot noise
contamination that needs to be treated as additional free parameter. The
term(s) of the higher-order PT spectra and the residual shot noise cause a
scale-dependent bias function relative to the nonlinear matter power spectrum
in the weakly nonlinear regime. We show that the model predictions are in good
agreement with the spectra measured from a suit of high-resolution $N$-body
simulations up to $k\simeq 0.2 h$/Mpc at $z=0.35$, for different halo mass
bins.
