Jamming in hard-particle packings has been the subject of considerable
interest in recent years. In a paper by Torquato and Stillinger [J. Phys. Chem.
B, 105 (2001)], a classification scheme of jammed packings into hierarchical
categories of locally, collectively and strictly jammed configurations has been
proposed. They suggest that these jamming categories can be tested using
numerical algorithms that analyze an equivalent contact network of the packing
under applied displacements, but leave the design of such algorithms as a
future task. In this work we present a rigorous and efficient algorithm to
assess whether a hard-sphere packing is jammed according to the afformentioned
categories. The algorithm is based on linear programming and is applicable to
regular as well as random packings of finite size with hard-wall and periodic
boundary conditions. If the packing is not jammed, the algorithm yields
representative multi-particle unjamming motions. We have implemented this
algorithm and applied it to ordered lattices as well as random packings of
disks and spheres under periodic boundary conditions. Some representative
results for ordered and disordered packings are given, but more applications
are anticipated for the future. One important and interesting result is that
the random packings that we tested were strictly jammed in three dimensions,
but not in two dimensions. Numerous interactive visualization models are
provided on the contributors' webpage.
