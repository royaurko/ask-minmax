We report the influence of uniaxial tensile mechanical strain in the range
0-2.2% on the phonon spectra and bandstructures of monolayer and bilayer
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) two-dimensional crystals. First, we employ Raman
spectroscopy to observe phonon softening with increased strain, breaking the
degeneracy in the E' Raman mode of MoS2, and extract a Gr\"uneisen parameter of
~1.06. Second, using photoluminescence spectroscopy we measure a decrease in
the optical band gap of MoS2 that is roughly linear with strain, ~45 meV%
strain for monolayer MoS2 and ~120 meV% strain for bilayer MoS2. Third, we
observe a pronounced strain-induced decrease in the photoluminescence intensity
of monolayer MoS2 that is indicative of the direct-to-indirect transition of
the character of the optical band gap of this material at applied strain of
~1.5%, a value supported by first-principles calculations that include
excitonic effects. These observations constitute the first demonstration of
strain engineering the band structure in the emergent class of two-dimensional
crystals, transition-metal dichalcogenides.
