The second-order spatial and temporal interference patterns with two
independent single-mode He-Ne lasers are observed in a Hong-Ou-Mandel
interferometer. Two-photon interference in Feynman's path integral theory is
employed to interpret the experimental results. The conditions to observe the
second-order interference pattern with two independent single-mode continuous
wave lasers are discussed. It is concluded that two-photon interference exists
for not only identical photons, but also photons with different spectrums if
the detection system can not distinguish them in principle. The second-order
temporal beating with two independent lasers can be employed to measure the
coherence time and frequency of one laser if the properties of the other laser
were known.
