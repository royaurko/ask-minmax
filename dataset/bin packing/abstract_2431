We calculate the semi-inclusive decay rate of an average string state with
compactification both in the bosonic string theory and in the superstring
theory. We also apply this calculation to a brane-inflation model in a warped
geometry and find that the decay rate is greatly suppressed if final strings
are all massive and enhanced with one final string massless, which may pose a
challenge to this class of models.
