We consider the problem of determining whether the union of two infinite
matroids is a matroid. We introduce a superclass of the finitary matroids, the
nearly finitary matroids, and prove that the union of two nearly finitary
matroids is a nearly finitary matroid.
  On the other hand, we prove that the union of two arbitrary infinite matroids
is not necessarily a matroid. Indeed, we show (under a weak additional
assumption) that the nearly finitary matroids are essentially the largest class
of matroids for which one can have a union theorem.
  We then extend the base packing theorem for finite matroids to finite
families of co-finitary matroids. This, in turn, yields a matroidal proof for
the tree-packing results for infinite graphs due to Diestel and Tutte.
