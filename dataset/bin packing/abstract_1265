The maximum possible number of non-overlapping unit spheres that can touch a
unit sphere in $n$ dimensions is called kissing number. The problem for finding
kissing numbers is closely connected to the more general problems of finding
bounds for spherical codes and sphere packings. We survey old and recent
results on the kissing numbers keeping the generality of spherical codes.
