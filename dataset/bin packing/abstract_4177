Recent studies suggest that in the Kerr/CFT correspondence, much universal
information of the dual CFT, including the central charges and the
temperatures, is fully encoded in the thermodynamics of the outer and inner
horizons of the Kerr(-Newman) black holes. In this paper, we study holographic
descriptions of Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes in arbitrary dimensions
by using the thermodynamics method.We refine the thermodynamics method proposed
in arXiv:1206.2015 by imposing the "quantization" condition so that we can fix
the ambiguity in determining the central charges of the dual CFT of RN black
holes. Using the refined thermodynamics method, we find the holographic CFT
duals for the RN black holes, and confirm these pictures by using conventional
analysis of asymptotic symmetry group and the hidden conformal symmetry in the
low-frequency scattering. In particular, we revisit the four-dimensional dyonic
RN black hole and find a novel magnetic picture, besides the known electric CFT
dual picture. We show how to generate a class of dual dyonic pictures by
$SL(2,Z)$ transformations.
