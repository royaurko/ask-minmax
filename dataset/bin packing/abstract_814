We study growth limited by packing for irregular objects in two dimensions.
We generate packings by seeding objects randomly in time and space and allowing
each object to grow until it collides with another object. The objects we
consider allow us to investigate the separate effects of anisotropy and
non-unit aspect ratio. By means of a connection to the decay of pore-space
volume, we measure power law exponents for the object size distribution. We
carry out a scaling analysis, showing that it provides an upper bound for the
size distribution exponent. We find that while the details of the growth
mechanism are irrelevant, the exponent is strongly shape dependent. Potential
applications lie in ecological and biological environments where sessile
organisms compete for limited space as they grow.
