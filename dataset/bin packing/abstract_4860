ANAIS (Annual modulation with NAI Scintillators) experiment aims to look for
dark matter annual modulation with 250 kg of ultrapure NaI(Tl) scintillators at
the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC), in order to confirm the DAMA/LIBRA
positive signal in a model-independent way. The detector will consist in an
array of close-packed single modules, each of them coupled to two high
efficiency Hamamatsu photomultipliers. Two 12.5 kg each NaI(Tl) crystals
provided by Alpha Spectra are currently taking data at the LSC. These modules
have shown an outstanding light collection efficiency (12-16 phe/keV), about
the double of that from DAMA/LIBRA phase 1 detectors, which could enable
reducing the energy threshold down to 1 keVee. ANAIS crystal radiopurity goals
are fulfilled for 232Th and 238U chains, assuming equilibrium, and in the case
of 40K, present crystals activity (although not at the required 20 ppb level)
could be acceptable. However, a 210Pb contamination out-of-equilibrium has been
identified and its origin traced back, so we expect it will be avoided in next
prototypes. Finally, current status and prospects of the experiment considering
several exposure and background scenarios are presented.
