A source-channel separation theorem for a general channel has recently been
shown by Aggrawal et. al. This theorem states that if there exist a coding
scheme that achieves a maximum distortion level d_{max} over a general channel
W, then reliable communication can be accomplished over this channel at rates
less then R(d_{max}), where R(.) is the rate distortion function of the source.
The source, however, is essentially constrained to be discrete and memoryless
(DMS). In this work we prove a stronger claim where the source is general,
satisfying only a "sphere packing optimality" feature, and the channel is
completely general. Furthermore, we show that if the channel satisfies the
strong converse property as define by Han & verdu, then the same statement can
be made with d_{avg}, the average distortion level, replacing d_{max}. Unlike
the proofs there, we use information spectrum methods to prove the statements
and the results can be quite easily extended to other situations.
