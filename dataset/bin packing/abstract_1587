The newly presented $(k+2,k)$ Hadamard minimum storage regenerating (MSR)
code is the first class of high rate storage code with optimal repair property
for all single node failures. In this paper, we propose a new simple repair
strategy, which can considerably reduces the computation load of the node
repair in contrast to the original one.
