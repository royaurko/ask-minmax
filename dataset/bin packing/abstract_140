Random packings of granular chains are presented as a model polymer system to
investigate the contribution of entanglements to strain-stiffening in the
absence of Brownian motion. The chain packings are sheared in triaxial
compression experiments. For short chain lengths, these packings yield when the
shear stress exceeds a the scale of the confining pressure, similar to packings
of spherical particles. In contrast, packings of chains which are long enough
to form loops exhibit strain-stiffening, in which the effective stiffness of
the material increases with strain, similar to many polymer materials. The
latter packings can sustain stresses orders-of-magnitude greater than the
confining pressure, and do not yield until the chain links break. X-ray
tomography measurements reveal that the strain-stiffening packings contain
system-spanning clusters of entangled chains.
