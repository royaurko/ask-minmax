We study the effects of chirality at the segment scale on the thermodynamics
of block copolymer melts using self consistent field theory. In linear diblock
melts where segments of one block prefer a twisted, or cholesteric, texture, we
show that melt assembly is critically sensitive to the ratio of random coil
size to the preferred pitch of cholesteric twist. For weakly-chiral melts
(large pitch), mesophases remain achiral, while below a critical value of
pitch, two mesocopically chiral phases are stable: an undulated lamellar phase;
and a phase of hexagonally-ordered helices. We show that the non-linear
sensitivity of meso-scale chiral order to preferred pitch derives specifically
from the geometric and thermodynamic coupling of the helical mesodomain shape
to the twisted packing of chiral segments within the core, giving rise to a
second-order cylinder-to-helix transition.
