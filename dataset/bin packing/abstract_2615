We present the B-band luminosity function and comoving space and luminosity
densities for a sample of 2779 I-band selected field galaxies based on
multi-color data from the CADIS survey. The sample is complete down to I_815 =
22 without correction and with completeness correction extends to I_815=23.0.
By means of a new multi-color analysis the objects are classified according to
their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and their redshifts are determined
with typical errors of delta z <= 0.03. We have split our sample into four
redshift bins between z=0.1 and z=1.04 and into three SED bins E-Sa,Sa-Sc and
starbursting (emission line) galaxies. The evolution of the luminosity function
is clearly differential with SED. The normalization phi* of luminosity function
for the E-Sa galaxies decreases towards higher redshift, and we find evidence
that the comoving galaxy space density decreases with redshift as well. In
contrast, we find phi* and the comoving space density increasing with redshift
for the Sa-Sc galaxies. For the starburst galaxies we find a steepening of the
luminosity function at the faint end and their comoving space density increases
with redshift.
