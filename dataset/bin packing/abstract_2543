We study random walks on a family of treelike regular fractals with a trap
fixed on a central node. We obtain all the eigenvalues and their corresponding
multiplicities for the associated stochastic master equation, with the
eigenvalues being provided through an explicit recursive relation. We also
evaluate the smallest eigenvalue and show that its reciprocal is approximately
equal to the mean trapping time. We expect that our technique can also be
adapted to other regular fractals with treelike structures.
