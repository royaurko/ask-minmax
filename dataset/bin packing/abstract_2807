Subgraph Isomorphism is a very basic graph problem, where given two graphs
$G$ and $H$ one is to check whether $G$ is a subgraph of $H$. Despite its
simple definition, the Subgraph Isomorphism problem turns out to be very broad,
as it generalizes problems such as Clique, $r$-Coloring, Hamiltonicity, Set
Packing and Bandwidth. However, for all of the mentioned problems
$2^{\mathcal{O}(n)}$ time algorithms exist, so a natural and frequently asked
question in the past was whether there exists a $2^{\mathcal{O}(n)}$ time
algorithm for Subgraph Isomorphism. In the monograph of Fomin and Kratsch
[Springer'10] this question is highlighted as an open problem, among few
others.
  Our main result is a reduction from 3-SAT, producing a subexponential number
of sublinear instances of the Subgraph Isomorphism problem. In particular, our
reduction implies a $2^{\Omega(n \sqrt{\log n})}$ lower bound for Subgraph
Isomorphism under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. This shows that there exist
classes of graphs that are strictly harder to embed than cliques or Hamiltonian
cycles.
  The core of our reduction consists of two steps. First, we preprocess and
pack variables and clauses of a 3-SAT formula into groups of logarithmic size.
However, the grouping is not arbitrary, since as a result we obtain only a
limited interaction between the groups. In the second step, we overcome the
technical hardness of encoding evaluations as permutations by a simple, yet
fruitful scheme of guessing the sizes of preimages of an arbitrary mapping,
reducing the case of arbitrary mapping to bijections. In fact, when applying
this step to a recent independent result of Fomin et al.[arXiv:1502.05447
(2015)], who showed hardness of Graph Homomorphism, we can transfer their
hardness result to Subgraph Isomorphism, implying a nearly tight lower bound of
$2^{\Omega(n \log n / \log \log n)}$.
