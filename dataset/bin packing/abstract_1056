Novel materials with tunable magnetic states play a significant role in the
development of next-generation spintronic devices. In this paper, we examine
the role of biaxial strain on the electronic properties of vacancy-decorated
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) monolayers using density functional theory
calculations. We found that the strain can lead to switching of the magnetic
state for h-BN monolayers with boron vacancy or divacancy. Our findings promise
a new route for the operation of low-dimensional spintronic devices.
