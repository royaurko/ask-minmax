Single-beam, single-target, and double-spin asymmetries for hard exclusive
photon production on the proton $\vec{e}\vec{p} \to e' p'\gamma$ are presented.
The data were taken at Jefferson Lab using the CLAS detector and a
longitudinally polarized ${}^{14}$NH$_3$ target. The three asymmetries were
measured in 165 4-dimensional kinematic bins, covering the widest kinematic
range ever explored simultaneously for beam and target-polarization observables
in the valence quark region. The kinematic dependences of the obtained
asymmetries are discussed and compared to the predictions of models of
Generalized Parton Distributions. The measurement of three DVCS spin
observables at the same kinematic points allows a quasi-model-independent
extraction of the imaginary parts of the $H$ and $\tilde{H}$ Compton Form
Factors, which give insight into the electric and axial charge distributions of
valence quarks in the proton.
