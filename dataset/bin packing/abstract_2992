We numerically study the distribution P(f) of contact forces in frictionless
bead packs, by averaging over the ensemble of all possible force network
configurations. We resort to umbrella sampling to resolve the asymptotic decay
of P(f) for large f, and determine P(f) down to values of order 10^{-45} for
ordered and disordered systems in two and three dimensions. Our findings
unambiguously show that, in the ensemble approach, the force distributions
decay much faster than exponentially: P(f) ~ exp(-f^{\alpha}), with alpha
\approx 2.0 for 2D systems, and alpha \approx 1.7 for 3D systems.
