By using totally isotropic subspaces in an orthogonal space Omega^{+}(2i,2),
several infinite families of packings of 2^k-dimensional subspaces of real
2^i-dimensional space are constructed, some of which are shown to be optimal
packings. A certain Clifford group underlies the construction and links this
problem with Barnes-Wall lattices, Kerdock sets and quantum-error-correcting
codes.
