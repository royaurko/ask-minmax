We investigate the M5-brane description of the Wilson surface operators in
six-dimensional (2,0) superconformal field theory from AdS/CFT correspondence.
We consider the Wilson surface operators in high-dimensional representation,
whose description could be M5-brane string soliton solutions in $AdS_7\times
S^4$ background. We construct such string soliton solutions from the covariant
M5-brane equations of motion and discuss their properties. The supersymmetry
analysis shows that these solutions are half-BPS. We also discuss the subtle
issue on the boundary terms.
