A number of transition metal hydrides with close-packed metal sublattices of
fcc or hcp structures with hydrogen in octahedral interstitial positions were
obtained by the high-pressure hydrogen technique described by Ponyatovskii et
al, Sov. Phys. Usp. 25 (1982) 596. In this paper we consider volume increase of
metals by hydrogenation and possible crystal structure of gold hydride in
relation with the structure of mercury, the nearest neighbor of Au in the
Periodic table. Suggested structure of AuH has a basic tetragonal body-centered
cell that is very similar to the mercury structure Hg-tI2. The reasons of
stability for this structure are discussed within the model of Fermi sphere -
Brillouin zone interactions.
