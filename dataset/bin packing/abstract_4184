Recently, in the Einstein gravity, Majhi and Padmanabhan proposed a
straightforward and transparent way in obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
by using the approach based on the Virasoro algebra and central charge. In this
work, we generalize their approach to the modified gravity with higher
curvature corrections and show that their approach can successfully lead to the
corresponding Wald entropy in the higher curvature gravity. Our result shows
that the approach is physically general.
