We study extension spaces, cotorsion pairs and their mutations in the cluster
category of a marked surface without punctures. Under the one-to-one
correspondence between the curves, valued closed curves in the marked surface
and the indecomposable objects in the associated cluster category, we prove
that the dimension of extension space of two indecomposable objects in the
cluster categories equals to the intersection number of the corresponding
curves. By using this result, we prove that there are no non-trivial
$t-$structures in the cluster categories when the surface is connected. Based
on this result, we give a classification of cotorsion pairs in these
categories. Moreover we define the notion of paintings of a marked surface
without punctures and their rotations. They are a geometric model of cotorsion
pairs and of their mutations respectively.
