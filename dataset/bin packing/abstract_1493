A Hamilton cycle in a digraph is a cycle passes through all the vertices,
where all the arcs are oriented in the same direction. The problem of finding
Hamilton cycles in directed graphs is well studied and is known to be hard. One
of the main reasons for this, is that there is no general tool for finding
Hamilton cycles in directed graphs comparable to the so called Pos\'a
'rotation-extension' technique for the undirected analogue. Let ${\mathcal
D}(n,p)$ denote the random digraph on vertex set $[n]$, obtained by adding each
directed edge independently with probability $p$. Here, we present a general
and a very simple method, using known results, to attack problems of packing
and counting Hamilton cycles in random directed graphs, for every
edge-probability $p>\log^C(n)/n$. Our results are asymptotically optimal with
respect to all parameters and apply equally well to the undirected case.
