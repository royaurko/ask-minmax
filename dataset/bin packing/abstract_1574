[Draft] In this paper, the redundancy of Slepian Wolf coding is revisited.
Applying the random binning and converse technique in \cite{yang}, the same
results in \cite{he} are obtained with much simpler proofs. Moreover, our
results reflect more details about the high-order terms of the coding rate. The
redundancy is investigated for both fixed-rate and variable-rate cases. The
normal approximation (or dispersion) can also be obtained with minor
modification.
