This paper studies cooperative schemes for the inter-cell interference
control in orthogonal-frequency-divisionmultiple- access (OFDMA) cellular
systems. The downlink transmission in a simplified two-cell system is examined,
where both cells simultaneously access the same frequency band using OFDMA. The
joint power and subcarrier allocation over the two cells is investigated for
maximizing their sum throughput with both centralized and decentralized
implementations. Particularly, the decentralized allocation is achieved via a
new cooperative interference control approach, whereby the two cells
independently implement resource allocation to maximize individual throughput
in an iterative manner, subject to a set of mutual interference power
constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed decentralized resource
allocation schemes achieve the system throughput close to that by the
centralized scheme, and provide substantial throughput gains over existing
schemes.
