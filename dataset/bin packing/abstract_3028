The strongly repulsive core of the short-range nucleon-nucleon interaction
leads to the existence of high-momentum nucleons in nuclei. Inclusive electron
scattering can be used to probe these high-momentum nucleons and study the
nature of the corresponding short-range correlations in nuclei. With recent
data from Jefferson Lab we have begun to map out the strength of two-nucleon
correlations in nuclei, while upcoming experiments should allow us to isolate
the presence of multi-nucleon correlations. In addition to their importance in
describing nuclear structure, these configurations of correlated nucleons
represent high density 'droplets' of hadronic matter. As the density of
hadronic matter increases there should be a weakening of quark confinement,
similar to the onset of deconfinement expected at extremely high temperatures.
While there have been hints of non-hadronic structure in nuclei, future
measurements will allow us to directly probe the quark distributions of high
density configurations in nuclei. A modified quark structure in these closely
packed nucleons would provide a clear signature of exotic components to the
structure of nuclei.
