We investigate the laws of thermodynamics in an accelerating universe driven
by dark energy with a time-dependent equation of state. In the case we consider
that the physically relevant part of the Universe is that envelopped by the
dynamical apparent horizon, we have shown that both the first law and second
law of thermodynamics are satisfied. On the other hand, if the boundary of the
Universe is considered to be the cosmological event horizon the thermodynamical
description based on the definitions of boundary entropy and temperature breaks
down. No parameter redefinition can rescue the thermodynamics laws from such a
fate, rendering the cosmological event horizon unphysical from the point of
view of the laws of thermodynamics.
