A measurement of the Higgs boson mass is presented based on the combined data
samples of the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC in the $H \rightarrow
\gamma\gamma$ and $H \rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 4\ell$ decay channels. The
results are obtained from a simultaneous fit to the reconstructed invariant
mass peaks in the two channels and for the two experiments. The measured masses
from the individual channels and the two experiments are found to be consistent
among themselves. The combined measured mass of the Higgs boson is $m_{H} =
125.09\pm0.21\,\mathrm{(stat.)}\pm0.11\,\mathrm{(syst.)}~\mathrm{GeV}$.
