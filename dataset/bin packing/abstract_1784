The work of Jaffe, Jenkins and Kimchi [Phys. Rev. D79, 065014 (2009)] is
revisited to see if indeed the region of congeniality found in their analysis
survives further restrictions from nucleosynthesis. It is observed that much of
their congenial region disappears when imposing conditions required to produce
the correct and required abundances of the primordial elements as well as
ensure that stars can continue to burn hydrogen nuclei to form helium as the
first step in forming heavier elements in stellar nucleosynthesis. The
remaining region is a very narrow slit reduced in width from around 29 MeV
found by Jaffe et al. to only about 2.2 MeV in the difference of the
nucleon/quark masses. Further bounds on $\delta m_q /m_q$ seem to reduce even
this narrow slit to the physical point itself.
