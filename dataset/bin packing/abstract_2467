We present in the work two intriguing results in the entanglement
classification of pure and true tripartite entangled state of $2\times M\times
N$ under stochastic local operation and classical communication. (i) the
internal symmetric properties of the nonlocal parameters in the continuous
entangled class; (ii) the analytic expression for the total numbers of the true
and pure entangled class $2\times M \times N$ states. These properties help
people to know more of the nature of the $2\times M\times N$ entangled system.
