We study the structure and kinematics of the OH-streamer and the +80 km/s
cloud and their interactions with the circumnuclear disk (CND) and with other
molecular clouds in the vicinity of the Galactic centre (GC), and we map OH
absorption at about 6" resolution at R $\le$ 10 pc from the GC, with about 9
km/s velocity resolution. The VLA was used to map OH line absorption at the
1665 and 1667 MHz lambda doublet main lines towards the Sagittarius A complex.
Strong OH absorption was found in the OH-streamer, the southern streamer (SS),
the +20, +50, and +80 km/s molecular clouds, the molecular belt, the CND, the
expanding molecular ring (EMR), and the high negative velocity gas (HNVG). The
OH-streamer was found to comprise three parts, head, middle, and tail, and to
interact with the SS/+20, +80 km/s clouds and the CND. Optical depths and
column densities have been calculated for the OH-streamer and the +80 km/s
cloud. The OH-streamer, the SS, the +20 and +80 km/s clouds, and the CND are
intimately related in position and velocity space. The OH-streamer was found to
be a clumpy object stretching in projection from the inner radius of the CND at
about 1.8 pc from Sgr A* towards and partly engulfing Sgr A*. As a side result
of our data, a possible link between the near side of the EMR and the CND's
southwest lobe was found. Additionally, we found OH absorption against all four
of the previously known Compact HII Regions A-D, located east of Sgr A East,
indicating their close association with the +50 km/s cloud.
