This paper proposes an efficient technique for partitioning large biometric
database during identification. In this technique feature vector which
comprises of global and local descriptors extracted from offline signature are
used by fuzzy clustering technique to partition the database. As biometric
features posses no natural order of sorting, thus it is difficult to index them
alphabetically or numerically. Hence, some supervised criteria is required to
partition the search space. At the time of identification the fuzziness
criterion is introduced to find the nearest clusters for declaring the identity
of query sample. The system is tested using bin-miss rate and performs better
in comparison to traditional k-means approach.
