We derive a Menta Carlo method to simulate kinetic equilibrium ensemble, and
get the same sea-quark flavor asymmetry as the linear equations method in
statistical model. In the recent paper, we introduce the spilt factors to
indicate the quarks' or gluons' spilt $g\rightarrow q\bar{q}(gg)$ and
$q\rightarrow qg$ ability. We obtain the almost fixed asymmetry value
$0.12-0.16$ which consists with experimental measurements for proton, when the
spilt factors vary in a very wide range over four orders of magnitude. So, we
proof the sea quark asymmetry can be derived from statistic principle and not
sensitively dependents on the dynamics details of quarks and gluons in proton.
We also apply the Menta Carlo method of statistical model to predict the
sea-quark asymmetry values for $K$ mesons, octet baryons $\Sigma$,$\Xi$ and
$\Delta$ baryons, even for exotic pentaquark states. All these asymmetry values
just only dependent on the valence quarks numbers in those hadrons.
