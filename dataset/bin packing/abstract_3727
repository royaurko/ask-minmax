We present a refined angular power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) anisotropies using the Archeops last flight data. The
estimation of the Cl described here is performed using Xspect, a method which
uses the cross-power spectra of the maps of 6 different detectors. It covers
multipole range from l=10 to l=700 in 25 bins and confirms a strong evidence of
a plateau followed by the presence of two Doppler peaks. Archeops was conceived
as a precursor of the Planck HFI instrument by using the same optical design
and the same technology for the detectors and their cooling. Since last
publication, specific methods have been developed, extra bolometers were used
and the sky coverage, of about 20%, is almost twice larger. We also present a
comparison with first-year WMAP data both using individually spectra and by
computing the cross-power spectrum of the two experiments.
