Adsorption of submonolayer amounts of Ag on vicinal Cu(111) induces periodic
faceting. The equilibrium structure is characterized by Ag-covered facets that
alternate with clean Cu stripes. In the atomic scale, the driving force is the
matching of Ag(111)-like packed rows with Cu(111) terraces underneath. This
determines the preference for the facet orientation and the evolution of
different phases as a function of coverage. Both Cu and Ag stripe widths can be
varied smoothly in the 3-30 nm range by tuning Ag coverage, allowing to test
theoretical predictions of elastic theories.
