The known extrasolar multiple-planet systems share a surprising dynamical
attribute: they cluster just beyond the Hill stability boundary. Here we show
that the planet-planet scattering model, which naturally explains the observed
exoplanet eccentricity distribution, can reproduce the observed distribution of
dynamical configurations. We calculated how each of our scattered systems would
appear over an appropriate range of viewing geometries; as Hill stability is
weakly dependent on the masses, the mass-inclination degeneracy does not
significantly affect our results. We consider a wide range of initial planetary
mass distributions and find that some are poor fits to the observed systems. In
fact, many of our scattering experiments overproduce systems very close to the
stability boundary. The distribution of dynamical configurations of two-planet
systems actually may provide better discrimination between scattering models
than the distribution of eccentricity. Our results imply that, at least in
their inner regions which are weakly affected by gas or planetesimal disks,
planetary systems should be "packed", with no large gaps between planets.
