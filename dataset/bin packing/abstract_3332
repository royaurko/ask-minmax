We investigate the 3D structure and drying dynamics of complex mixtures of
emulsion droplets and colloidal particles, using confocal microscopy. Air
invades and rapidly collapses large emulsion droplets, forcing their contents
into the surrounding porous particle pack at a rate proportional to the square
of the droplet radius. By contrast, small droplets do not collapse, but remain
intact and are merely deformed. A simple model coupling the Laplace pressure to
Darcy's law correctly estimates both the threshold radius separating these two
behaviors, and the rate of large-droplet evacuation. Finally, we use these
systems to make novel hierarchical structures.
