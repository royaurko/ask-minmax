We present the B-band Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) of 60 late-type galaxies
with redshifts 0.1-1. The galaxies were selected from the FORS Deep Field with
a limiting magnitude of R=23. Spatially resolved rotation curves were derived
from spectra obtained with FORS2 at the VLT. High-mass galaxies with v_max>=150
km/s show little evolution, whereas the least massive systems in our sample are
brighter by about 1-2 mag compared to their local counterparts. For the entire
distant sample, the TFR slope is flatter than for local field galaxies
(-5.77+-0.45 versus -7.92+-0.18). Thus, we find evidence for evolution of the
slope of the TFR with redshift on the 3-sigma level. This is still true when we
subdivide the sample into three redshift bins. We speculate that the flatter
tilt of our sample is caused by the evolution of luminosities and an additional
population of blue galaxies at z>=0.2. The mass dependence of the TFR evolution
also leads to variations for different galaxy types in magnitude-limited
samples, suggesting that selection effects can account for the discrepant
results of previous TFR studies on the luminosity evolution of late-type
galaxies.
