Put n nonoverlapping squares inside the unit square. Let f(n) and g(n) denote
the maximum values of the sum of the edge lengths of the n small squares, where
in the case of f(n) the maximum is taken over all arbitrary packings of the
unit square, and in the case of g(n) it is taken over all tilings of the unit
square (i.e., the total area of the n small squares is 1). Benton and Tyler
asked for which values of n we have f(n)=g(n). We show that f(8)>g(8). More
precisely, we show that g(8)=13/5; it is known that f(8) is at least 8/3.
