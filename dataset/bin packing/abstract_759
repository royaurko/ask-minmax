We realize the Apollonian group associated to an integral Apollonian circle
packings, and some of its generalizations, as a group of automorphisms of an
algebraic surface. Borrowing some results in the theory of orbit counting, we
study the asymptotic of the growth of degrees of elements in the orbit of a
curve on an algebraic surface with respect to a geometrically finite group of
its automorphisms.
