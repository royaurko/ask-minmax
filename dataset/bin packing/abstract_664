The problem of the orientational ordering transition for lattice-gas models
of liquid crystals is discussed in the low-dimensional case $d=1,2$. For
isotropic short-range interactions, orientational long-range order at finite
temperature is excluded for any packing of molecules on the lattice $Z^d$; on
the other hand, for reflection-positive long-range isotropic interactions, we
prove existence of an orientational ordering transition for high packing ($\mu
> \mu_0$) and low temperatures ($\beta > \beta_c(\mu)$).
