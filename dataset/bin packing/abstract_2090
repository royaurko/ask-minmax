Graphene, a flat monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a
two-dimensional honeycomb lattice (a one atom thick graphite sheet), is
presently the hottest material in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Its
challenging hypothetical reflection in the silicon world is coined silicene;
Here, we have demonstrated that the silicon nano-wires self-aligned in a
massively parallel array recently observed by STM on Ag(110), are true silicene
nano-ribbons. Our calculations using density functional theory clearly show
that Si atoms tends to form hexagons on top the silver substrate in a
honeycomb, graphene-like arrangement.
