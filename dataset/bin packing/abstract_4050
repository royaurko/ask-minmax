We investigate the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics
on the $(n-1)$-dimensional brane embedded in the $(n+1)$-dimensional bulk. We
examine the evolution of the apparent horizon entropy extracted through
relation between gravitational equation and the first law of thermodynamics
together with the matter field entropy inside the apparent horizon. We find
that the apparent horizon entropy extracted through connection between gravity
and the first law of thermodynamics satisfies the generalized second law of
thermodynamics. This result holds regardless of whether there is the intrinsic
curvature term on the brane or a cosmological constant in the bulk. The
observed satisfaction of the generalized second law provides further support on
the thermodynamical interpretation of gravity based on the profound connection
between gravity and thermodynamics.
