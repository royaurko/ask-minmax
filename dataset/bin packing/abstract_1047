In this letter, we propose an adaptive SC (Successive Cancellation)-List
decoder for polar codes with CRC. This adaptive SC-List decoder iteratively
increases the list size until the decoder outputs contain at least one survival
path which can pass CRC. Simulation shows that the adaptive SC-List decoder
provides significant complexity reduction. We also demonstrate that polar code
(2048, 1024) with 24-bit CRC decoded by our proposed adaptive SC-List decoder
with very large list size can achieve a frame error rate FER=0.001 at
Eb/No=1.1dB, which is about 0.2dB from the information theoretic limit at this
block length.
