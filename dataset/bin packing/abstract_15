Packing problems are in general NP-hard, even for simple cases. Since now
there are no highly efficient algorithms available for solving packing
problems. The two-dimensional bin packing problem is about packing all given
rectangular items, into a minimum size rectangular bin, without overlapping.
The restriction is that the items cannot be rotated. The current paper is
comparing a greedy algorithm with a hybrid genetic algorithm in order to see
which technique is better for the given problem. The algorithms are tested on
different sizes data.
