We report the results of an experimental investigation of segregation in a
binary mixture of dry particles subjected to horizontal oscillatory excitation.
The thin layer of particles was driven by the stick--slip frictional
interaction with the surface of a horizontal tray. As the packing fraction of
the mixture was increased the evolution of distinct phases was observed. We
identified them as a binary gas, segregation liquid and segregation crystal and
provide both microscopic and macroscopic measures to identify their properties.
Finally, we draw some analogies between segregation in our granular system and
self-assembly in binary colloidal mixtures.
