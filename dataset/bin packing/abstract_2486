In mixed strategy 2\times2 population games, the realization of maximum
entropy (Maxent) is of the theoretical expectation. We evaluate this
theoretical prediction in the experimental economics game data. The data
includes 12 treatments and 108 experimental sessions in which the random match
human subjects pairs make simultaneous strategy moves repeated 200 rounds. Main
results are (1) We confirm that experimental entropy value fit the prediction
from Maxent well; and (2) In small proportion samples, distributions are
deviated from Maxent expectations; interesting is that, the deviated patterns
are significant more concentrated. These experimental findings could enhance
the understanding of social game behavior with the natural science rule ---
Maxent.
