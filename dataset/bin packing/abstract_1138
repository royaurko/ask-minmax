We have studied the centrality bin size dependence of charged particle
forward-backward multiplicity correlation strength in 5%, 0-5%, and 0-10% most
central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_NN}}$=200 GeV with a parton and hadron
cascade model, PACIAE based on PYTHIA. The real (total), statistical, and NBD
(Negative Binomial Distribution) correlation strengths are calculated by the
real events, the mixed events, and fitting the charged particle multiplicity
distribution to the NBD, respectively. It is turned out that the correlation
strength increases with increasing centrality bin size monotonously. If the
discrepancy between real (total) and statistical correlation strengths is
identified as dynamical one, the dynamical correlation may just be a few
percent of the total (real) correlation.
