Parton cascade is a microscopic transport approach for the study of the
space-time evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in relativistic heavy
ion collisions and its experimental manifestations. In the following, parton
cascade calculations on elliptic flow and thermalization will be discussed.
Dynamical evolution is shown to be important for the production of elliptic
flow including the scaling and the breaking of the scaling of elliptic flow.
The degree of thermalization is estimated using both an elastic parton cascade
and a radiative transport model. A longitudinal to transverse pressure ratio,
$P_L/P_T\approx 0.8$, is shown to be expected in the central cell in central
collisions. This provides information on viscous corrections to the ideal
hydrodynamical approach.
