We study the attractive interactions between rod-like charged polymers in
solution that appear in the presence of multi-valence counterions. The
counterions condensed to the rods exhibit both a strong transversal
polarization and a longitudinal crystalline arrangement. At short distances
between the rods, the fraction of condensed counterions increases, and the
majority of these occupy the region between the rods, where they minimize their
repulsive interactions by arranging themselves into packing structures. The
attractive interaction is strongest for multivalent counterions. Our model
takes into account the hard-core volume of the condensed counterions and their
angular distribution around the rods. The hard core constraint strongly
suppresses longitudinal charge fluctuations.
