I describe ongoing work developing Bayesian methods for flexible modeling of
arrival time series data without binning, aiming to improve detection and
measurement of X-ray and gamma-ray pulsars, and of pulses in gamma-ray bursts.
The methods use parametric and semiparametric Poisson point process models for
the event rate, and by design have close connections to conventional
frequentist methods currently used in time-domain astronomy.
