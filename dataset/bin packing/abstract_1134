The recently introduced backward Monte-Carlo method [Johan Carlsson,
arXiv:math.NA/0010118] is validated, benchmarked, and compared to the
conventional, forward Monte-Carlo method by analyzing the error in the
Monte-Carlo solutions to a simple model equation. In particular, it is shown
how the backward method reduces the statistical error in the common case where
the solution is of interest in only a small part of phase space. The forward
method requires binning of particles, and linear interpolation between the bins
introduces an additional error. Reducing this error by decreasing the bin size
increases the statistical error. The backward method is not afflicted by this
conflict. Finally, it is shown how the poor time convergence can be improved
for the backward method by a minor modification of the Monte-Carlo equation of
motion that governs the stochastic particle trajectories. This scheme does not
work for the conventional, forward method.
