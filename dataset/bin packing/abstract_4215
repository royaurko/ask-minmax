In the upgrade project of Hefei Light Source (HLS II), a new digital
longitudinal bunch-by-bunch feedback system will be developed to suppress the
coupled bunch instabilities in the storage ring effectively. We design a new
waveguide overloaded cavity longitudinal feedback kicker as the feedback
actuator. The beam pipe of the kicker is racetrack shape so as to avoid a
transition part to the octagonal vacuum chamber. The central frequency and the
bandwidth of the kicker have been simulated and optimized to achieve design
goals by the HFSS code. The higher shunt impedance can be obtained by using a
nose cone to reduce the feedback power requirement. Before the kicker cavity
was installed in the storage ring, a variety of measurements were carried out
to check its performance. All these results of simulation and measurement are
presented.
