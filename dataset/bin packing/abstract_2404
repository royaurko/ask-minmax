The scaling behavior of factorial moments of the differences in
multiplicities between well separated bins in heavy-ion collisions is proposed
as a probe of quark-hadron phase transition. The method takes into account some
of the physical features of nuclear collisions that cause some difficulty in
the application of the usual method. It is shown in the Ginzburg-Landau theory
that a numerical value $\gamma$ of the scaling exponent can be determined
independent of the parameters in the problem. The universality of $\gamma$
characterizes quark-hadron phase transition, and can be tested directly by
appropriately analyzed data.
