We calculated the entropy of a class of inhomogeneous dust universes.
Allowing spherical symmetry, we proposed a holographic principle by reflecting
all physical freedoms on the surface of the apparent horizon. In contrast to
flat homogeneous counterparts, the principle may break down in some models,
though these models are not quite realistic. We refined fractal parabolic
solutions to have a reasonable entropy value for the present observable
universe and found that the holographic principle always holds in the realistic
cases.
