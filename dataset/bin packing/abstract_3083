The phase behavior of the system of parallel rigid triblock copolymers is
examined using the second-virial density functional theory. The triblock
particle consists of two identical infinitely thin hard rods of finite lengths
on the opposite ends of one central hard cylinder with nonzero length and
diameter. Stability analyses and free energy calculations show that the system
of parallel particles can form not only uniform nematic and smectic A phases,
but a smectic-C phase too. The stability and structure of the tilted structure
is controlled by only the diameter and the length of the central cylinder
segment. Interestingly, the diameter effects only the layer tilting and the
periodicity, but not the packing fraction of the nematic to smectic-C
transition. For all values of cylinder length the usual smectic-A and smectic-C
transitions compete with each other and no nematic-columnar transition is
observed. At low and high cylinder length the smectic-A phase is stabilized
first, while the smectic C is the most stable for intermediate length values.
