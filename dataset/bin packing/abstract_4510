In this Letter we show that an interaction between dark matter and dark
energy is favored by the most recent large scale structure observations. The
result presented by the BOSS-SDSS collaboration measuring the baryon acoustic
oscillations of the Ly-$\alpha$ forest from high redshift quasars indicates a
$2.5\sigma$ departure from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This is the first
time that the evolution of dark energy at high redshifts has been measured and
the current results cannot be explained by simple generalizations of the
cosmological constant. We show here that a simple phenomenological interaction
in the dark sector provides a good explanation for this deviation, naturally
accommodating the Hubble parameter obtained by BOSS, $H(z=2.34)=222 \pm 7
~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, for two of the proposed models with a positive
coupling constant and rejecting the null interaction at more than $2\sigma$.
For this we used the adjusted values of the cosmological parameters for the
interacting models from the current observational data sets. This small and
positive value of the coupling constant also helps alleviate the coincidence
problem.
