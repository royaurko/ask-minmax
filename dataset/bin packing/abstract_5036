Low-energy pi+ (E < 35 MeV) from 12C+197Au collisions at incident energies
from 300 to 1800 MeV per nucleon were detected with the Si-Si(Li)-CsI(Tl)
calibration telescopes of the INDRA multidetector. The inclusive angular
distributions are approximately isotropic, consistent with multiple
rescattering in the target spectator. The multiplicity correlations of the
low-energy pions and of energetic protons (E > 150 MeV) with intermediate-mass
fragments were determined from the measured coincidence data. The deduced
correlation functions 1 + R \approx 1.3 for inclusive event samples reflect the
strong correlations evident from the common impact-parameter dependence of the
considered multiplicities. For narrow impact-parameter bins (based on
charged-particle multiplicity), the correlation functions are close to unity
and do not indicate strong additional correlations. Only for pions at high
particle multiplicities (central collisions) a weak anticorrelation is
observed, probably due to a limited competition between these emissions.
Overall, the results are consistent with the equilibrium assumption made in
statistical multifragmentation scenarios. Predictions obtained with
intranuclear cascade models coupled to the Statistical Multifragmentation Model
are in good agreement with the experimental data.
