The results of DFT supercell calculations of oxygen behavior upon the UN
(001) and (110) surfaces as well as at the tilt grain boundary are presented.
Oxygen adsorption, migration, incorporation into the surface N vacancies on
(001) and (110) surfaces have been modeled using 2D slabs of different
thicknesses and supercell sizes. The temperature dependences of the N vacancy
formation energies and oxygen incorporation energies are calculated. We
demonstrate that O atoms easily penetrate into UN surfaces and grain boundaries
containing N vacancies, due to negative incorporation energies and a small
energy barrier. The Gibbs free energies of N vacancy formation and O atom
incorporation therein at the two densely-packed surfaces and tilt grain
boundaries are compared. It has been also shown that the adsorbed oxygen atoms
are highly mobile which, combined with easy incorporation into surface N
vacancies, explains efficient (but unwanted) oxidation of UN surfaces. The
atomistic mechanism of UN oxidation via possible formation of oxynitrides is
discussed.
