We map out the solid-state morphologies formed by model soft-pearl-necklace
polymers as a function of bending stiffness $k_b$ spanning the range from fully
flexible to rodlike chains. The ratio of Kuhn length to bead diameter
($l_K/r_0$) increases monotonically with increasing $k_b$ and yields a
one-parameter model that relates chain shape to bulk morphology and yields
insights into the packing of anisotropic particles. In the flexible limit,
monomers occupy the sites of close-packed crystallites while chains retain
random-walk-like order. In the rodlike limit, nematic chain ordering typical of
lamellar precursors coexists with close-packing. At intermediate values of
bending stiffness the competition between random-walk-like and nematic chain
ordering produces glass-formation; the range of $k_b$ over which this occurs
increases with the thermal cooling rate $|\dot{T}|$ implemented in our
molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, values of $k_b$ between the
glass-forming and rodlike ranges produce complex ordered phases such as
close-packed spirals. Our results should prove useful for rational design of
dense colloidal-polymer phases with desired morphologies.
