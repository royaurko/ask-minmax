We study a general family of facility location problems defined on planar
graphs and on the 2-dimensional plane. In these problems, a subset of $k$
objects has to be selected, satisfying certain packing (disjointness) and
covering constraints. Our main result is showing that, for each of these
problems, the $n^{O(k)}$ time brute force algorithm of selecting $k$ objects
can be improved to $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ time. The algorithm is based on an idea
that was introduced recently in the design of geometric QPTASs, but was not yet
used for exact algorithms and for planar graphs. We focus on the Voronoi
diagram of a hypothetical solution of $k$ objects, guess a balanced separator
cycle of this Voronoi diagram to obtain a set that separates the solution in a
balanced way, and then recurse on the resulting subproblems. We complement our
study by giving evidence that packing problems have $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ time
algorithms for a much more general class of objects than covering problems
have.
