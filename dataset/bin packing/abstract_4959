We present CCD broad band photometric observations in the fields of the Third
Galactic Quadrant open clusters NGC 2580 and NGC 2588 ($V(I)_C$ and $UBV(RI)_C$
respectively). From the analysis of our data we found that NGC 2580 is located
at a distance of about 4 kpc and its age is close to 160 Myr. As for NGC 2588,
it is placed at about 5 kpc from the Sun and is 450 Myr old. This means that
NGC 2588 belongs to the extension of the Perseus arm, whereas NGC 2580 is
closer to the local arm structure. The luminosity functions (LFs) have been
constructed for both clusters down to $V \sim 20$ together with their initial
mass functions (IMFs) for stars with masses above $M \sim 1-1.5 M_{\sun}$. The
IMF slopes for the most massive bins yielded values of $x \approx 1.3$ for NGC
2580 and $x \approx 2$ for NGC 2588. In the case of this latter cluster we
found evidence of a core-corona structure produced probably by dynamical
effect. In the main sequences of both clusters we detected gaps, which we
suggest could be real features.
