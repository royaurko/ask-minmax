In terms of the fully relativistic screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method we
investigate the variation in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of
hexagonal close-packed cobalt with the addition of platinum impurities. In
particular, we perform calculations on a bulk cobalt system in which one of the
atomic layers contains a fractional, substitutional platinum impurity. Our
calculations show that at small concentrations of platinum the MAE is reduced,
while at larger concentrations the MAE is enhanced. This change of the MAE can
be attributed to an interplay between on-site Pt MAE contributions and induced
MAE contributions on the Co sites. The latter ones are subject to pronounced,
long-ranged Friedel-oscillations that can lead to significant size effects in
the experimental determination of the MAE of nano-sized samples.
