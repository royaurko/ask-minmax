In this paper, we study the problem of coordinating two nodes which can only
exchange information via a relay at limited rates. The nodes are allowed to do
a two-round interactive two-way communication with the relay, after which they
should be able to generate i.i.d. copies of two random variables with a given
joint distribution within a vanishing total variation distance. We prove inner
and outer bounds on the coordination capacity region for this problem. Our
inner bound is proved using the technique of "output statistics of random
binning" that has recently been developed by Yassaee, et al.
