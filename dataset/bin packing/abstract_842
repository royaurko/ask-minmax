We present PackLib^2, the first fully integrated benchmark library for
multi-dimensional packing instances. PackLib^2 combines a systematic collection
of all benchmark instances from previous literature with a well-organized set
of new and challenging large instances. The XML format allows linking basic
benchmark data with other important properties, like bibliographic information,
origin, best known solutions, runtimes, etc. Transforming instances into a
variety of existing input formats is also quite easy, as the XML format lends
itself to easy conversion; for this purpose, a number of parsers are provided.
Thus, PackLib^2 aims at becoming a one-stop location for the packing and
cutting community: In addition to fair and easy comparison of algorithmic work
and ongoing measurement of scientific progress, it poses numerous challenges
for future research.
