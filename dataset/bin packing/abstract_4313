We test the recent claim by Hu et al. (2008) that FeII emission in Type 1 AGN
shows a systematic redshift relative to the local source rest frame and
broad-line Hbeta. We compile high s/n median composites using SDSS spectra from
both the Hu et al. sample and our own sample of the 469 brightest DR5 spectra.
Our composites are generated in bins of FWHM Hbeta and FeII strength as defined
in our 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) formalism. We find no evidence for a systematic
FeII redshift and consistency with previous assumptions that FeII shift and
width (FWHM) follow Hbeta shift and FWHM in virtually all sources. This result
is consistent with the hypothesis that FeII emission (quasi-ubiquitous in type
1 sources) arises from a broad-line region with geometry and kinematics the
same as that producing the Balmer lines.
