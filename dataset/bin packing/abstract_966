Perturbations around black holes have been an intriguing topic in the last
few decades. They are particularly important today, since they relate to the
gravitational wave observations which may provide the unique fingerprint of
black holes' existence. Besides the astrophysical interest, theoretically
perturbations around black holes can be used as testing grounds to examine the
proposed AdS/CFT and dS/CFT correspondence.
