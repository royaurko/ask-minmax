In this paper, static spacetimes with a topological structure of R^2 \times N
is studied, where N is an arbitrary manifold. Well known Schwarzschild
spacetime and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime are special cases. It is shown that
the existence of a constant and positive surface gravity $\kappa$ ensures the
existence of the Killing horizon, with the cross section homeomorphic to N.
