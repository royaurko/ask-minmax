We study the large-scale angular correlation signatures of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations from WMAP data in several
spherical cap regions of the celestial sphere, outside the Kp0 or Kp2 cut-sky
masks. We applied a recently proposed method to CMB temperature maps, which
permits an accurate analysis of their angular correlations in the celestial
sphere through the use of normalized histograms of the number of pairs of such
objects with a given angular separation versus their angular separation. The
method allows for a better comparison of the results from observational data
with the expected CMB angular correlations of a statistically isotropic
Universe, computed from Monte Carlo maps according to the WMAP best-fit Lambda
CDM model. We found that the, already known, anomalous lack of large-scale
power in full-sky CMB maps are mainly due to missing angular correlations of
quadrupole-like signature. This result is robust with respect to frequency CMB
maps and cut-sky masks. Moreover, we also confirm previous results regarding
the unevenly distribution in the sky of the large-scale power of WMAP data. In
a bin-to-bin correlations analyses, measured by the full covariance matrix
chi^2 statistic, we found that the angular correlations signatures in opposite
Galactic hemispheres are anomalous at the 98%-99% confidence level.
