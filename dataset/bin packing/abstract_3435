Employing molecular dynamics simulations of jammed soft particles, we study
microscopic responses of force-chain networks to quasi-static isotropic
(de)compressions. We show that not only contacts but also interparticle gaps
between the nearest neighbors must be considered for the stochastic evolution
of the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of forces, where the mutual
exchange of contacts and interparticle gaps, i.e. opening and closing contacts,
are also crucial to the incremental system behaviors. By numerically
determining the transition rates for all changes of contacts and gaps, we
formulate a Master equation for the PDFs of forces, where the insight one gets
from the transition rates is striking: The mean change of forces reflects
non-affine system response, while their fluctuations obey uncorrelated Gaussian
statistics. In contrast, interparticle gaps are reacting mostly affine in
average, but imply multi-scale correlations according to a wider stable
distribution function.
