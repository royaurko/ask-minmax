We report the synthesis and characterization of bulk form diluted magnetic
semiconductors Ba(Zn1-2xMnxCox)2As2 (0 <= x <= 0.15) with a crystal structure
identical to that of 122-type Fe-based superconductors. Mn and Co co-doping
into the parent compound BaZn2As2 results in a ferromagnetic ordering below TC
~ 80 K. Hall effect measurements indicate that the carrier are n-type with the
density of ~10^17/cm3. The common crystal structure and excellent lattice
matching between the p-type ferromagnetic (Ba1-yKy)(Zn1-xMnx)2As2, the n-type
ferromagnetic Ba(Zn1-2xMnxCox)2As2, the antiferrmagnetic BaMn2As2 and the
superconducting Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 systems make it possible to make various
junctions between these systems through the As layer.
