For any valued quiver, by using BGP-reflection functors, an injection from
the set of preprojective objects in the cluster category to the set of cluster
variables of the corresponding cluster algebra is given, the images are called
preprojective cluster variables. It is proved that all preprojective cluster
variables have denominators $u^{\underline{dim}M}$ in their irreducible
fractions of integral polynomials, where $M$ is the corresponding preprojective
module or preinjective module. If the quiver is of Dynkin type, we generalize
the denominator theorem in [FZ2] to any seed, and also generalize the
corresponding results in [CCS1] [CCS2] [CK1] to non-simply-laced case. Given a
finite quiver (with trivial valuations) without oriented cycles, fixed a
tilting seed $(V, B_V)$, it is proved that the existence and uniqueness of a
bijection (abstractly, not in explicit form, compare [CK2]) from the set of
exceptional indecomposable objects in the cluster categories to the set of
cluster variables associated to $B_V$ which sends $ V_i[1]$ to $u_i$ and sends
cluster tilting objects to clusters.
