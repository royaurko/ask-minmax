Successful modern generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) are biased
toward atomic energies. Restoration of the first-principles gradient expansion
for exchange over a wide range of density gradients eliminates this bias. We
introduce PBEsol, a revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA that improves
equilibrium properties of densely-packed solids and their surfaces.
