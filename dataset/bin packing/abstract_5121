A sample of 20 powerful extended radio galaxies with redshifts between zero
and two were used to determine constraints on global cosmological parameters.
Data for six radio sources were obtained from the VLA archive, analyzed, and
combined with the sample of 14 radio galaxies used previously by Guerra & Daly
to determine cosmological parameters. The results are consistent with our
previous results, and indicate that the current value of the mean mass density
of the universe is significantly less than the critical value. A universe with
$\Omega_m$ of unity is ruled out at 99.0% confidence, and the best fitting
values of $\Omega_m$ in matter are $0.10^{+0.25}_{-0.10}$ and
$-0.25^{+0.35}_{-0.25}$ assuming zero space curvature and zero cosmological
constant, respectively. Note that identical results obtain when the low
redshift bin, which includes Cygnus A, is excluded; these results are
independent of whether the radio source Cygnus A is included. The method does
not rely on a zero-redshift normalization.
  The radio properties of each source are also used to determine the density of
the gas in the vicinity of the source, and the beam power of the source. The
six new radio sources have physical characteristics similar to those found for
the original 14 sources. The density of the gas around these radio sources is
typical of gas in present day clusters of galaxies. The beam powers are
typically about $10^{45} \hbox{erg s}^{-1}$.
