A three-axis Hall transducer based on GaAs/AlGaAs/InGaAs microtubes has been
fabricated. The possibility of simultaneous measurement of all the three
magnetic field components with such a transducer was demonstrated. It was also
shown possible to pack the free-standing parts of the transducer with
polydimethylsiloxane for protection of those parts from mechanical actions.
