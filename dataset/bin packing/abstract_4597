Nano-scale molecular communication is a viable way of exchanging information
between nano-machines. In this letter, a low-complexity and non-coherent signal
detection technique is proposed to mitigate the inter-symbol-interference (ISI)
and additive noise. In contrast to existing coherent detection methods of high
complexity, the proposed non-coherent signal detector is more practical when
the channel conditions are hard to acquire accurately or hidden from the
receiver. The proposed scheme employs the concentration difference to detect
the ISI corrupted signals and we demonstrate that it can suppress the ISI
effectively. The concentration difference is a stable characteristic,
irrespective of the diffusion channel conditions. In terms of complexity, by
excluding matrix operations or likelihood calculations, the new detection
scheme is particularly suitable for nano-scale molecular communication systems
with a small energy budget or limited computation resource.
