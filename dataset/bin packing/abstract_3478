The recently developed evolutionary algorithm USPEX proved to be a tool that
enables accurate and reliable prediction of structures for a given chemical
composition. Here we extend this method to predict the crystal structure of
polymers by performing constrained evolutionary search, where each monomeric
unit is treated as one or several building blocks with fixed connectivity. This
greatly reduces the search space and allows the initial structure generation
with different sequences and packings using these blocks. The new constrained
evolutionary algorithm is successfully tested and validated on a diverse range
of experimentally known polymers, namely polyethylene (PE), polyacetylene (PA),
poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), poly(oxymethylene)
(POM), poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO), and poly (p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS). By
fixing the orientation of polymeric chains, this method can be further extended
to predict all polymorphs of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and the complex
linear polymer crystals, such as nylon-6 and cellulose. The excellent agreement
between predicted crystal structures and experimentally known structures
assures a major role of this approach in the efficient design of the future
polymeric materials.
