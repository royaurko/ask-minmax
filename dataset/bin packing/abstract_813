Largely due to its role in nucleation and crystal-growth, the free energy of
the crystal-melt interfacial free energy is an object of considerable interest
across a number of scientific disciplines, especially in the materials-,
colloid- and atmospheric sciences. Over fifty years ago, Turnbull observed that
the interfacial free energies (scaled by the mean interfacial area per
particle) of a variety of metallic elements exhibit a linear correlation with
the enthalpy of fusion. This correlation provides an important empirical
"rule-of-thumb" for estimating interfacial free energies, but lacks a
compelling physical explanation. In this work we show that the interfacial free
energies for close-packed metals are linearly correlated with the melting
temperature, and are therefore primarily entropic in origin. We also show that
the slope of this linear relationship can be determined with quantitative
accuracy using a hard-sphere model, and that the correlation with the enthalpy
of fusion reported by Turnbull follows as a consequence of the fact that the
entropy of fusion for close-packed metals is relatively constant.
