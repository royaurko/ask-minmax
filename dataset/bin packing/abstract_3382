We define a capacity which measures the size of Weinstein tubular
neighbourhoods of Lagrangian submanifolds. In symplectic vector spaces this
leads to bounds on the codisc radius for any closed Lagrangian submanifold in
terms of Viterbo's isoperimetric inequality. Moreover, we prove a
generalization of Gromov's packing inequality concerning symplectic embeddings
of the boundaries of two balls of equal radius into the open unit ball. If the
interior components of the image spheres are disjoint, then the radii are less
than the square root of one half. Furthermore, we introduce the spherical
variant of the relative Gromov radius and prove finiteness for monotone
Lagrangian tori in symplectic vector spaces.
