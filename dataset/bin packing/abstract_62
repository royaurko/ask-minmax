Cloud resource management has been a key factor for the cloud datacenters
development. Many cloud datacenters have problems in understanding and
implementing the techniques to manage, allocate and migrate the resources in
their premises. The consequences of improper resource management may result
into underutilized and wastage of resources which may also result into poor
service delivery in these datacenters. Resources like, CPU, memory, Hard disk
and servers need to be well identified and managed. In this Paper, Dynamic
Resource Management Algorithm(DRMA) shall limit itself in the management of CPU
and memory as the resources in cloud datacenters. The target is to save those
resources which may be underutilized at a particular period of time. It can be
achieved through Implementation of suitable algorithms. Here, Bin packing
algorithm can be used whereby the best fit algorithm is deployed to obtain
results and compared to select suitable algorithm for efficient use of
resources.
