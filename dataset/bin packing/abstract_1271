Computer simulations suggest that ultrathin metal wires should develop
exotic, non-crystalline stable atomic structures, once their diameter decreases
below a critical size of the order of a few atomic spacings. The new
structures, whose details depend upon the material and the wire thickness, may
be dominated by icosahedral packings. Helical, spiral-structured wires with
multi-atom pitches are also predicted. The phenomenon, analogous to the
appearance of icosahedral and other non-crystalline shapes in small clusters,
can be rationalized in terms of surface energy anisotropy and optimal packing.
