Allowing the input auxiliary random variables to be correlated and using the
binning scheme, the Han- Kobayashi (HK) rate region for general interference
channel is improved. The obtained new achievable rate region (i) is shown to
encompass the HK region and its simplified description, i.e., Chong-Motani-Garg
(CMG) region,considering a detailed and favorable comparison between different
versions of the regions, and (ii) has an interesting and easy interpretation:
as expected, any rate in our region has generally two additional terms in
comparison with the HK region (one due to the input correlation and the other
as a result of the binning scheme).
