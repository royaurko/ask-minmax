Our earlier Monte Carlo simulations of metastable supercooled-liquid and
glass phases of Lennard-Jones atoms found several distinct signatures for
identifying the glass transition boundary; i.e., the density, enthalpy, and
pair distribution function dependences on temperature and pressure are
different for the two phases (F. F. Abraham, J. Chem. Phys., 72, 359 (1980)).
In this extension of that study, we base our analysis on the Ackland-Jones
(A-J) method for determining the local crystal packing about each atom (G.
Ackland & A. Jones, PRB 73, 054104 (2006)). It focuses on the angular
distribution of the local atoms surrounding each individual atom and compares
it with the known FCC, HCP, BCC, icosahedron packings within a specified
uncertainly from perfect packing. Remarkably, the A-J method to our simulated
glass states indicates that the local atomic packings of the individual atoms
are predominantly crystalline; i.e., quasi FCC, HCP or BCC.
