We compare the three main types of high-order one-step initial value solvers:
extrapolation, spectral deferred correction, and embedded Runge--Kutta pairs.
We consider orders four through twelve, including both serial and parallel
implementations. We cast extrapolation and deferred correction methods as
fixed-order Runge--Kutta methods, providing a natural framework for the
comparison. The stability and accuracy properties of the methods are analyzed
by theoretical measures, and these are compared with the results of numerical
tests. In serial, the 8th-order pair of Prince and Dormand (DOP8) is most
efficient. But other high order methods can be more efficient than DOP8 when
implemented in parallel. This is demonstrated by comparing a parallelized
version of the well-known ODEX code with the (serial) DOP853 code. For an
$N$-body problem with $N=400$, the experimental extrapolation code is as fast
as the tuned Runge--Kutta pair at loose tolerances, and is up to two times as
fast at tight tolerances.
