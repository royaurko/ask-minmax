The POINT-AGAPE collaboration surveyed M31 with the primary goal of optical
detection of microlensing events, yet its data catalogue is also a prime source
of lightcurves of variable and transient objects, including classical novae
(CNe). A reliable means of identification, combined with a thorough survey of
the variable objects in M31, provides an excellent opportunity to locate and
study an entire galactic population of CNe. This paper presents a set of 440
neural networks, working in 44 committees, designed specifically to identify
fast CNe. The networks are developed using training sets consisting of
simulated novae and POINT-AGAPE lightcurves, in a novel variation on K-fold
cross-validation. They use the binned, normalised power spectra of the
lightcurves as input units. The networks successfully identify 9 of the 13
previously identified M31 CNe within their optimal working range (and 11 out of
13 if the network error bars are taken into account). They provide a catalogue
of 19 new candidate fast CNe, of which 4 are strongly favoured.
