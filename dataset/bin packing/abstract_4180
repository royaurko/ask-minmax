In this paper we present our recent timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray
pulsar 4U 1907+09. Our X-ray data consist of an extended set of RXTE & INTEGRAL
observations that were analyzed before ({\c{S}}ahiner et al. 2012). From the
X-ray observations we extend the pulse period history of the source and obtain
a revised orbital distribution of the X-ray dips. Using ROTSE IIId optical
observations, we present the long term optical light curve of the source to
have an understanding of long term optical behaviour.
