The PANDA experiment will be built at the FAIR facility at Darmstadt
(Germany) to perform accurate tests of the strong interaction through bar pp
and bar pA annihilation's studies. To track charged particles, two systems
consisting of a set of planar, closed-packed, self-supporting straw tube layers
are under construction. The PANDA straw tubes will have also unique
characteristics in term of material budget and performance. They consist of
very thin mylar-aluminized cathodes which are made self-supporting by means of
the operation gas-mixture over-pressure. This solution allows to reduce at
maximum the weight of the mechanical support frame and hence the detector
material budget. The PANDA straw tube central tracker will not only reconstruct
charged particle trajectories, but also will help in low momentum (< 1 GeV)
particle identification via dE/dx measurements. This is a quite new approach
that PANDA tracking group has first tested with detailed Monte Carlo
simulations, and then with experimental tests of detector prototypes. This
paper addresses the design issues of the PANDA straw tube trackers and the
performance obtained in prototype tests.
