We redefine BS-dimension for Caratheodory structure by packing method. We
have the same dimension properties with respect to the cover method and check
the Bowen's equation for the new dimension as well. Besides, we consider the
relation between the new BS-dimension and upper and lower BS-density
respectively. We extend the variational principles of entropy to BS dimension.
