We present a state-of-the-art linear redshift distortion analysis of the
recently published IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey (PSCz). The
procedure involves linear compression into 4096 Karhunen-Loeve modes culled
from a potential pool of about 3 x 10^5 modes, followed by quadratic
compression into three separate power spectra, the galaxy-galaxy,
galaxy-velocity, and velocity-velocity power spectra. Least squares fitting to
the decorrelated power spectra yields a linear redshift distortion parameter
beta = Omega_m^0.6/b = 0.41(+0.13,-0.12).
