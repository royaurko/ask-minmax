In this paper we present a nonconforming finite element method for solving
fourth order curl equations in three dimensions arising from
magnetohydrodynamics models. We show that the method has an optimal error
estimate for a model problem involving both curl^2 and curl^4 operators. The
element has a very small number of degrees of freedom and it imposes the
inter-element continuity along the tangential direction which is appropriate
for the approximation of magnetic fields. We also provide explicit formulae of
basis functions for this element.
