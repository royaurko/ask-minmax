I present a precise measurement of W boson mass measurement in electron decay
channel using data collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider. A binned likelihood fit method is used to extract the mass
information from the transverse mass, the electron transverse momentum and
missing transverse energy distributions. I also present a precise direct
measurement of W boson width using the events with large transverse mass. The W
mass result can be used to put stringent indirect limits on the Standard Model
Higgs boson mass.
