We present a detailed observational strategy for finding Near Earth Objects
(NEOs) with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) telescope. We investigate
strategies in normal, unbinned mode as well as binning the CCDs 2x2 or 3x3,
which affects the sky coverage rate and the limiting apparent magnitude. We
present results from 1 month, 3 year and 10 year simulations of such surveys.
For each cadence and binning mode, we evaluate the possibility of achieving the
Spaceguard goal of detecting 90% of 1 km NEOs (absolute magnitude H <= 18 for
an albedo of 0.1). We find that an unbinned survey is most effective at
detecting H <= 20 NEOs in our sample. However, a 3x3 binned survey reaches the
Spaceguard Goal after only seven years of operation. As the proposed large
survey telescopes (PanStarss; LSST) are at least 5-10 years from operation, an
SDSS NEO survey could make a significant contribution to the detection and
photometric characterization of the NEO population.
