This paper presents a search for standard model Higgs boson production in
association with a $W$ boson using events recorded by the CDF experiment in a
dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.6 fb-1. The search is
performed using a matrix element technique in which the signal and background
hypotheses are used to create a powerful discriminator. The discriminant output
distributions for signal and background are fit to the observed events using a
binned likelihood approach to search for the Higgs boson signal. We find no
evidence for a Higgs boson, and 95% confidence level (C.L.) upper limits are
set on the Higgs boson production rate. The observed limits range from 3.5 to
37.6 relative to the standard model expectation for Higgs boson masses between
100 and 150 GeV. The 95% C.L. expected limit is estimated from the median of an
ensemble of simulated experiments and varies between 2.9 and 32.7 relative to
the production rate predicted by the standard model over the Higgs boson mass
range studied.
