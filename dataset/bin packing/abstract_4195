This letter analyzes the scaling property of nanowire (NW) phase change
memory (PCM) using analytic and numerical methods. The scaling scenarios of the
three widely-used NW PCM peration schemes (constant electric field, voltage,
and current) are studied and compared. It is shown that if the device size is
downscaled by a factor of 1/k (k>1), the peration energy (current) will be
reduced by more than k3 (k) times, and the operation speed will be increased by
k2 times. It is also shown that more than 90% of operation energy is wasted as
thermal flux into substrate and electrodes. We predict that, if the wasted
thermal flux is effectively reduced by heat confinement technologies, the
energy consumed per RESET operation can be decreased from about 1 pJ to less
than 100 fJ. It is shown that reducing NW aspect ratio (AR) helps decreasing
PCM energy consumption. It is revealed that cross-cell thermal proximity
disturbance is counter-intuitively alleviated by scaling, leading to a
desirable scaling scenario.
