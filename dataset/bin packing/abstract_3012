CUORE is a proposed tightly packed array of 1000 TeO_{2} bolometers, each
being a cube 5 cm on a side with a mass of 750 gms. The array consists of 25
vertical towers, arranged in a square, of 5 towers by 5 towers, each containing
10 layers of 4 crystals. The design of the detector is optimized for ultralow-
background searches for neutrinoless double beta decay of ^{130}Te (33.8%
abundance), cold dark matter, solar axions, and rare nuclear decays. A
preliminary experiment involving 20 crystals of various sizes (MIBETA) has been
completed, and a single CUORE tower is being constructed as a smaller scale
experiment called CUORICINO. The expected performance and sensitivity, based on
Monte Carlo simulations and extrapolations of present results, are reported.
