Obtaining general relations between macroscopic properties of random
assemblies, such as density, and the microscopic properties of their
constituent particles, such as shape, is a foundational challenge in the study
of amorphous materials. By leveraging our deep understanding of the random
close packing of hard spherical particles, we estimate the random-close-packing
density for all sufficiently spherical shapes. Our method uses the distribution
of coordination shells in a random-close-packing configuration of spheres to
obtain a linear-order approximation for non-spherical shapes. The calculation
predicts that all sufficiently spherical shapes pack more densely than spheres.
We use simulation data for spheres to calculate numerical estimates for
nonspherical particles and compare these estimates to simulations.
