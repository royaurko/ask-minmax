A measurement of the ZZ production cross section in proton-proton collisions
at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV using data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large
Hadron Collider is presented. In a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 4.6 fb-1 collected in 2011, events are selected that are
consistent either with two Z bosons decaying to electrons or muons or with one
Z boson decaying to electrons or muons and a second Z boson decaying to
neutrinos. The ZZ*->llll and ZZ->llnunu cross sections are measured in
restricted phase-space regions. These results are then used to derive the total
cross section for ZZ events produced with both Z bosons in the mass range 66 to
116 GeV, sigmaZZtot = 6.7 +-0.7 +0.4-0.3 +-0.3 pb, which is consistent with the
Standard Model prediction of 5.89+0.22-0.18 pb calculated at next-to-leading
order in QCD. The normalized differential cross sections in bins of various
kinematic variables are presented. Finally, the differential event yield as a
function of the transverse momentum of the leading Z boson is used to set
limits on anomalous neutral triple gauge boson couplings in ZZ production.
