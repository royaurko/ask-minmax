We propose to characterize heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic
energies by using fluctuations of energy density and temperature. Temperature
fluctuations on an event-by-event basis have been studied both in terms of
global temperature of the event, and locally by constructing fluctuation maps
in small phase space bins in each event. Global temperature fluctuations
provide an estimation of the specific heat of the system. Local temperature
fluctuations of the event may be ascribed to the remnants of initial energy
density fluctuations. Together these two observables give an insight into the
system created in heavy-ion collisions and its evolution. Event-by-event
hydrodynamic calculations indeed provide adequate theoretical basis for
understanding the origin of the fluctuations. We demonstrate the feasibility of
studying global and local temperature fluctuations at the Large Hadron Collider
energy by the use of AMPT event generator.
