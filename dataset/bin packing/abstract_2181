Motivated by the problem of local solar subsurface magnetic structure, we
have used numerical simulation to investigate the propagation of waves through
monolithic magnetic flux tubes of different size. A cluster model can be a good
approximation to simulate sunspots as well as solar plage regions which are
composed of an ensemble of compactly packed thin flux tubes. Simulations of
this type is a powerful tool to probe the structure and the dynamic of various
solar features which are related directly to solar magnetic field activity.
