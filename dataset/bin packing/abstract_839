The sphere-packing bound $E_{sp}(R)$ bounds the reliability function for
fixed-length block-codes. For symmetric channels, it remains a valid bound even
when strictly causal noiseless feedback is allowed from the decoder to the
encoder. To beat the bound, the problem must be changed. While it has long been
known that variable-length block codes can do better when trading-off error
probability with expected block-length, this correspondence shows that the {\em
fixed-delay} setting also presents such an opportunity for generic channels.
  While $E_{sp}(R)$ continues to bound the tradeoff between bit error and fixed
end-to-end latency for symmetric channels used {\em without} feedback, a new
bound called the ``focusing bound'' gives the limits on what can be done with
feedback. If low-rate reliable flow-control is free (ie. the noisy channel has
strictly positive zero-error capacity), then the focusing bound can be
asymptotically achieved. Even when the channel has no zero-error capacity, it
is possible to substantially beat the sphere-packing bound by synthesizing an
appropriately reliable channel to carry the flow-control information.
