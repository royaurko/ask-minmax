We propose a new method to analyze fluctuations in the strength function
phenomena in highly excited nuclei. Extending the method of multifractal
analysis to the cases where the strength fluctuations do not obey power scaling
laws, we introduce a new measure of fluctuation, called the local scaling
dimension, which characterizes scaling behavior of the strength fluctuation as
a function of energy bin width subdividing the strength function. We discuss
properties of the new measure by applying it to a model system which simulates
the doorway damping mechanism of giant resonances. It is found that the local
scaling dimension characterizes well fluctuations and their energy scales of
fine structures in the strength function associated with the damped collective
motions.
