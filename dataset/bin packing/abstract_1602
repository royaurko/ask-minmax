This is the second paper of our investigation of the 0.5-2 keV soft X-ray
luminosity function (SXLF) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using results from
ROSAT surveys of various depth. The large dynamic range of the combined sample,
from shallow large-area ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS)-based samples to the
satellite's deepest pointed observation on the Lockman Hole, enabled us to
trace the behavior of the SXLF. While the first paper (Miyaji, Hasinger,
Schmidt 2000, hereafter paper I) emphasized the global behavior of the SXLF,
cosmological evolution and contribution to the soft X-ray background, this
paper presents actual numerical values for practical use of our results.
 To present the binned SXLF, we have used an improved estimator, which is free
from biases associated with the conventional 1/Va estimator.
