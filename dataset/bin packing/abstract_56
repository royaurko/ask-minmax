We study the problem of coalitional manipulation in elections using the
unweighted Borda rule. We provide empirical evidence of the manipulability of
Borda elections in the form of two new greedy manipulation algorithms based on
intuitions from the bin-packing and multiprocessor scheduling domains. Although
we have not been able to show that these algorithms beat existing methods in
the worst-case, our empirical evaluation shows that they significantly
outperform the existing method and are able to find optimal manipulations in
the vast majority of the randomly generated elections that we tested. These
empirical results provide further evidence that the Borda rule provides little
defense against coalitional manipulation.
