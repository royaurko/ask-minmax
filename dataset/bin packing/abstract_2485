The recent PHENIX mid-rapidity measurements of multiplicity distributions for
centrality bins are analyzed in the framework of superposition models. A simple
superposition of pp events is shown to disagree with the heavy ion data for
dispersion as a function of centrality. However, it is suggested that a model
describing properly the pp data and based in the "wounded quark" idea may be
compatible with the multiplicity data for heavy ion collisions.
