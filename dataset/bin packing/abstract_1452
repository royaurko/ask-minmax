Based on Stillinger's version of cell cluster theory, we derive an expression
for the equilibrium concentration of thermal monovacancies in solids which
allows for a transparent interpretation of the vacancy volume and the
energetic/entropic part in the corresponding Gibbs energy of vacancy formation
$\Delta G_{\rm v}$. For the close--packing crystals of the hard sphere and
Lennard--Jones model systems very good agreement with simulation data is found.
Application to metals through the embedded--atom method (EAM) reveals a strong
sensitivity of the variation of $\Delta G_{\rm v}$ with temperature to details
of the EAM potential. Our truncation of the cell cluster series allows for an
approximate, but direct measurement of crystal free energies and vacancy
concentration in colloidal model systems using laser tweezers.
