Suppose that $G_j$ is a sequence of finite connected planar graphs, and in
each $G_j$ a special vertex, called the root, is chosen randomly-uniformly. We
introduce the notion of a distributional limit $G$ of such graphs. Assume that
the vertex degrees of the vertices in $G_j$ are bounded, and the bound does not
depend on $j$. Then after passing to a subsequence, the limit exists, and is a
random rooted graph $G$. We prove that with probability one $G$ is recurrent.
The proof involves the Circle Packing Theorem. The motivation for this work
comes from the theory of random spherical triangulations.
