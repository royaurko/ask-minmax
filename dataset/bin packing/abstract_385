Despite its long history, there are many fundamental issues concerning random
packings of spheres that remain elusive, including a precise definition of
random close packing (RCP). We argue that the current picture of RCP cannot be
made mathematically precise and support this conclusion via a molecular
dynamics study of hard spheres using the Lubachevsky-Stillinger compression
algorithm. We suggest that this impasse can be broken by introducing the new
concept of a maximally random jammed state, which can be made precise.
