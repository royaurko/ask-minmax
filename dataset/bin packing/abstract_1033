Based on 471 million BB pairs collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II
e+e- collider, we perform a series of measurements on rare decays B->K(*)l+l-,
where l+l- is either e+e- or mu+mu-. The measurements include total branching
fractions, and partial branching fractions in six bins of di-lepton
mass-squared. We also measure isospin asymmetries in the same six bins.
Furthermore, we measure direct CP and lepton flavor asymmetries for di-lepton
mass below and above the J/Psi resonance. Our measurements show good agreement
with both Standard Model predictions and measurements from other experiments.
