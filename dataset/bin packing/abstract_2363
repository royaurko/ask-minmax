The persistent spin current in anisotropic spin ring penetrated by a SU(2)
flux is studied by the Schwinger-boson mean field approach. The anisotropy in
spin coupling can facilitate the persistent spin current. Ground-state energy
and excitation energy gap are also studied. The peak of spin current occurs at
the maximum value of the ground-state energy.
