This is the second paper of a series of three investigating, by numerical
means, the geometric and mechanical properties of spherical bead packings under
isotropic stresses. We study the effects of varying the applied pressure P
(from 1 or 10 kPa up to 100 MPa in the case of glass beads) on several types of
configurations assembled by different procedures, as reported in the
preceding paper. As functions of P, we monitor changes in solid fraction
\Phi, coordination number z, proportion of rattlers (grains carrying no
force) x0, the distribution of normal forces, the level of friction
mobilization, and the distribution of near neighbor distances. Assuming the
contact law does not involve material plasticity or damage, \Phi is found to
vary very nearly reversibly with P in an isotropic compression cycle, but all
other quantities, due to the frictional hysteresis of contact forces, change
irreversibly. In particular, initial low P states with high coordination
numbers lose many contacts in a compression cycle, and end up with values of z
and x0 close to those of the most poorly coordinated initial
configurations. Proportional load variations which do not entail notable
configuration changes can therefore nevertheless significantly
affect contact networks of granular packings in quasistatic conditions.
