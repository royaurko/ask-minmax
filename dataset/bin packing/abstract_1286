We study the stress profile of an ordered two-dimensional packing of beads in
response to the application of a vertical overload localized at its top
surface. Disorder is introduced through the Coulombic friction between the
grains which gives some indeterminacy and allows the choice of one constrained
random number per grain in the calculation of the contact forces. The so-called
`multi-agent' technique we use, lets us deal with systems as large as
$1000\times1000$ grains. We show that the average response profile has a double
peaked structure. At large depth $z$, the position of these peaks grows with
$cz$, while their widths scales like $\sqrt{Dz}$. $c$ and $D$ are analogous to
`propagation' and `diffusion' coefficients. Their values depend on that of the
friction coefficient $\mu$. At small $\mu$, we get $c_0-c \propto \mu$ and $D
\propto \mu^\beta$, with $\beta \sim 2.5$, which means that the peaks get
closer and wider as the disorder gets larger. This behavior is qualitatively
what was predicted in a model where a stochastic relation between the stress
components is assumed.
