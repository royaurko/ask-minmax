We study the effect of freeze-thaw cycling on the packing fraction of equal
spheres immersed in water. The water located between the grains experiences a
dilatation during freezing and a contraction during melting. After several
cycles, the packing fraction converges to a particular value $\eta_{\infty} =
0.595$ independently of its initial value $\eta_0$. This behavior is well
reproduced by numerical simulations. Moreover, the numerical results allow to
analyze the packing structural configuration. With a Vorono\"i partition
analysis, we show that the piles are fully random during the whole process and
are characterized by two parameters: the average Vorono\"i volume $\mu_v$
(related to the packing fraction $\eta$) and the standard deviation $\sigma_v$
of Vorono\"i volumes. The freeze-thaw driving modify the volume standard
deviation $\sigma_v$ to converge to a particular disordered state with a
packing fraction corresponding to the Random Loose Packing fraction
$\eta_{BRLP}$ obtained by Bernal during his pioneering experimental work.
Therefore, freeze-thaw cycling is found to be a soft and spatially homogeneous
driving method for disordered granular materials.
