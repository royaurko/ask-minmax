We investigate the primordial trispectra of the general multifield DBI
inflationary model. In contrast with the single field model, the entropic modes
can source the curvature perturbations on the super horizon scales, so we
calculate the contributions from the interaction of four entropic modes
mediating one adiabatic mode to the trispectra, at the large transfer limit
($T_{RS}\gg1$). We obtained the general form of the 4-point correlation
functions, plotted the shape diagrams in two specific momenta configurations,
"equilateral configuration" and "specialized configuration". Our figures showed
that we can easily distinguish the two different momenta configurations.
