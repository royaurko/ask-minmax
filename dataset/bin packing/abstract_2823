The staggered 6-vertex model describes the competition between surface
roughening and reconstruction in (100) facets of CsCl type crystals. Its phase
diagram does not have the expected generic structure, due to the presence of a
fully-packed loop-gas line. We prove that the reconstruction and roughening
transitions cannot cross nor merge with this loop-gas line if these degrees of
freedom interact weakly. However, our numerical finite size scaling analysis
shows that the two critical lines merge along the loop-gas line, with strong
coupling scaling properties. The central charge is much larger than 1.5 and
roughening takes place at a surface roughness much larger than the conventional
universal value. It seems that additional fluctuations become critical
simultaneously.
