The problem of enumerating dimers on an M x N net embedded on non-orientable
surfaces is considered. We solve both the Moebius strip and Klein bottle
problems for all M and N with the aid of imaginary dimer weights. The use of
imaginary weights simplifies the analysis, and as a result we obtain new
compact solutions in the form of double products. The compact expressions also
permit us to establish a general reciprocity theorem.
