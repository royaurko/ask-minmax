I review the present status of the mapping of the large-scale structure of
the Universe through wide-angle redshift surveys. In the first part of the
paper, I discuss the current state of the art, describing in some detail the
recently completed ESO Slice Project (ESP). I then briefly recall some of the
basic motivations for performing larger surveys. Then, in the final section, I
present in detail three large redshift survey projects that in the years from
now to the end of the Century are expected to satisfy this demand.
