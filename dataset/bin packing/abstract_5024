The production of final state photons in hadronic $Z$-boson decays can be
used to study the quark-to-photon fragmentation function $D_{q\to
\gamma}(z,\mu_{F})$. Currently, two different observables are used at LEP to
probe this function: the `photon' +~1 jet rate and the inclusive photon energy
distribution. We outline the results of a calculation of the `photon' +~1 jet
rate at fixed ${\cal O}(\alpha \alpha_{s})$, which yield a next-to-leading
order determination of the quark-to-photon fragmentation function $D_{q\to
\gamma}(z,\mu_{F})$. The resulting predictions for the isolated photon rate and
the inclusive photon spectrum at the same, fixed order, are found to be in good
agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, we outline the main features of
conventional approaches using parameterizations of the resummed solutions of
the evolution equation and point out deficiencies of these currently available
parameterizations in the large $z$-region. We finally demonstrate that the
ALEPH data on the `photon' +~1 jet rate are able to discriminate between
different parameterizations of the quark-to-photon fragmentation function,
which are equally allowed by the OPAL photon energy distribution data.
