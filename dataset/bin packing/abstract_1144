The primordial power spectrum describes the initial perturbations in the
Universe which eventually grew into the large-scale structure we observe today,
and thereby provides an indirect probe of inflation or other
structure-formation mechanisms. In this paper we will investigate the best
scales the primordial power spectrum can be probed, in accordance with the
knowledge about other cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_{b}$,
$\Omega_{c}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, $h$ and $\tau$. The aim is to find the most
informative way of measuring the primordial power spectrum at different length
scales, using different types of surveys and the information they provide for
the desired cosmological parameters. We will find the optimal binning of the
primordial power spectrum for this purpose, by making use of the Fisher matrix
formalism. We will then find a statistically orthogonal basis for a set of
cosmological parameters, mentioned above, and a set of bins of the primordial
power spectrum to investigate the correlation between the two sets. For this
purpose we make use of principal component analysis and Hermitian square root
of the Fisher matrix. The surveys used in this project are Planck and
SDSS(BRG), but the formalism can easily be extended to any windowed
measurements of the perturbation spectrum.
