A fermion ground state energy functional is set up in terms of particle
density, relative pair density, and kinetic energy tensor density. It satisfies
a minimum principle if constrained by a complete set of compatibility
conditions. A partial set, which thereby results in a lower bound energy under
minimization, is obtained from the solution of model systems, as well as a
small number of exact sum rules. Prototypical application is made to several
one-dimensional spinless non-interacting models. The effectiveness of "atomic"
constraints on model "molecules" is observed, as well as the structure of
systems with only finitely many bound states.
