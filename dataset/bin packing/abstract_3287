We prove a number of double-sided estimates relating discrete counterparts of
several classical conformal invariants of a quadrilateral: cross-ratios,
extremal lengths and random walk partition functions. The results hold true for
any simply connected discrete domain $\Omega$ with four marked boundary
vertices and are uniform with respect to $\Omega$'s which can be very rough,
having many fiords and bottlenecks of various widths. Moreover, due to results
from arXiv:1311.3363, those estimates are fulfilled for domains drawn on any
infinite "properly embedded" planar graph $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{C}$ (e.g., any
parabolic circle packing) whose vertices have bounded degrees. This allows one
to use classical methods of geometric complex analysis for discrete domains
"staying on the microscopic level". Applications include a discrete version of
the classical Ahlfors-Beurling-Carleman estimate and some "surgery technique"
developed for discrete quadrilaterals.
