The role of friction coefficient, $\mu$, on the jamming properties of
disordered, particle packings is studied using computer simulations.
Compressed, soft-sphere packings are brought towards the jamming transition -
the point where a packing loses mechanical stability - by decreasing the
packing fraction. The values of the packing fraction at the jamming transition,
$\phi^{\mu}_{c}$, gradually decrease from the random close packing point for
zero friction, to a value coincident with random loose packing as the friction
coefficient is increased over several orders of magnitude. This is accompanied
by a decrease in the coordination number at the jamming transition,
$z^{\mu}_{c}$, which varies from approximately six to four with increasing
friction. Universal power law scaling is observed in the pressure and
coordination number as a function of distance from the generalised,
friction-dependent jamming point. Various power laws are also reported between
the $\phi^{\mu}_{\rm c}$, $z^{\mu}_{\rm c}$, and $\mu$. Dependence on
preparation history of the packings is also investigated.
