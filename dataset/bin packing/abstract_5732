We propose and analyze an extremely fast, efficient, and simple method for
solving the problem:min{parallel to u parallel to(1) : Au = f, u is an element
of R-n}.This method was first described in [J. Darbon and S. Osher, preprint,
2007], with more details in [W. Yin, S. Osher, D. Goldfarb and J. Darbon, SIAM
J. Imaging Sciences, 1(1), 143-168, 2008] and rigorous theory given in [J. Cai,
S. Osher and Z. Shen, Math. Comp., to appear, 2008, see also UCLA CAM Report
08-06] and [J. Cai, S. Osher and Z. Shen, UCLA CAM Report, 08-52, 2008]. The
motivation was compressive sensing, which now has a vast and exciting history,
which seems to have started with Candes, et. al. [E. Candes, J. Romberg and T.
Tao, 52(2), 489-509, 2006] and Donoho, [D. L. Donoho, IEEE Trans. Inform.
Theory, 52, 1289-1306, 2006]. See [W. Yin, S. Osher, D. Goldfarb and J. Darbon,
SIAM J. Imaging Sciences 1(1), 143-168, 2008] and [J. Cai, S. Osher and Z.
Shen, Math. Comp., to appear, 2008, see also UCLA CAM Report, 08-06] and [J.
Cai, S. Osher and Z. Shen, UCLA CAM Report, 08-52, 2008] for a large set of
references. Our method introduces an improvement called "kicking" of the very
efficient method of [J. Darbon and S. Osher, preprint, 2007] and [W. Yin, S.
Osher, D. Goldfarb and J. Darbon, SIAM J. Imaging Sciences, 1(1), 143-168,
2008] and also applies it to the problem of denoising of undersampled signals.
The use of Bregman iteration for denoising of images began in [S. Osher, M.
Burger, D. Goldfarb, J. Xu and W. Yin, Multiscale Model. Simul, 4(2), 460-489,
2005] and led to improved results for total variation based methods. Here we
apply it to denoise signals, especially essentially sparse signals, which might
even be undersampled.
