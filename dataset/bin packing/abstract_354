The recently proposed close-packed motif for collagen is investigated using
first principles semi-empirical wave function theory and Kohn-Sham density
functional theory. Under these refinements the close-packed motif is shown to
be stable. For the case of the 7/2 motif a similar stability exists. The
electronic circular dichroism of the close-packed model has a significant
negative bias and a large signal. An interesting feature of the close-packed
structure is the existence of a central channel. Simulations show that, if
hydrogen atoms are placed in the cavity, a chain of molecular hydrogens is
formed suggesting a possible biological function for molecular hydrogen.
