Neutralino can be the dark matter candidate in the gauge-mediated
supersymmetry breaking models if the conformal sequestered mechanism is assumed
in the hidden sector. In this paper, we study this mechanism by using the
current experimental results after the run I of LHC and LUX. By adding new
Yukawa couplings between the messenger fields and Higgs fields, we find that
this mechanism can predict a neutralino dark matter with correct relic density
and a Higgs boson with mass around 125 GeV. All our survived points have some
common features. Firstly, the Higgs sector falls into the decoupling limit. So
the properties of the light Higgs boson are similar to the predictions of the
Standard Model one. Secondly, the correct EWSB hints a relatively small
$\mu$-term, which makes the lightest neutralino lighter than the lightest stau.
So a bino-higgsino dark matter with correct relic density can be achieved. And
the relatively small $\mu$-term results in a small fine-tuning. Finally, this
bino-higgsino dark matter can pass all current bounds, including both
spin-independent and spin-dependent direct searches. The spin-independent cross
section of our points can be examined by further experiments.
