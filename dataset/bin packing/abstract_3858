We present measurements of the scale (bin-size) dependence of event-wise mean
transverse momentum $<p_{t}>$ fluctuations for Au-Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV simulated with the Hijing-1.37 Monte Carlo. We invert
those scale distributions to obtain autocorrelation distributions on
pseudorapidity $\eta$ and azimuth $\phi$ difference variables
$(\eta_\Delta,\phi_\Delta)$. The autocorrelations have a simple structure
dominated by a same-side (on azimuth) peak with similar widths on the two
difference variables. With jet quenching imposed, the same-side peak widths
increase slightly in both directions, and the amplitude is substantially
reduced. The same-side peaks are attributed to minijets, observed in this study
as local {\em velocity} correlations of charged particles with $p_t < $ 2
GeV/c.
