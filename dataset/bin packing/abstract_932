Athermal packings of soft repulsive spheres exhibit a sharp jamming
transition in the thermodynamic limit. Upon further compression, various
structural and mechanical properties display clean power-law behavior over many
decades in pressure. As with any phase transition, the rounding of such
behavior in finite systems close to the transition plays an important role in
understanding the nature of the transition itself. The situation for jamming is
surprisingly rich: the assumption that jammed packings are isotropic is only
strictly true in the large-size limit, and finite-size has a profound effect on
the very meaning of jamming. Here, we provide a comprehensive numerical study
of finite-size effects in sphere packings above the jamming transition,
focusing on stability as well as the scaling of the contact number and the
elastic response.
