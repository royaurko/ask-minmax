A vertex set $D$ in a graph $G$ is $k$-dependent if $G[D]$ has maximum degree
at most $k-1$, and $k$-dominating if every vertex outside $D$ has at least $k$
neighbors in $D$. Favaron proved that if $D$ is a $k$-dependent set maximizing
the quantity $k|D| - |E(G[D])|$, then $D$ is $k$-dominating. We extend this
result, showing that such sets satisfy a stronger structural property, and we
find a surprising connection between Favaron's theorem and a conjecture of Tuza
regarding packing and covering of triangles.
