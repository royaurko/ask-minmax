In this work I derive analytic expressions for the curvature dependent
fluid-substrate surface tension of a hard sphere fluid on a hard curved wall.
In a first step, the curvature thermodynamic properties are found as truncated
power series in the activity in terms of the known second and third order
cluster integral of the hard-sphere fluid near spherical and cylindrical walls.
These results are then expressed as packing fraction power series and
transformed to different reference regions which is equivalent to consider
different positions of the dividing surface. All the obtained series expansions
are rigorous results. Based on the truncated series it is shown that the
bending rigidity of the system is non-null and that higher order terms in the
curvature also exist. In a second step, approximate analytic expressions for
the surface tension, the Tolman length, the bending rigidity and the Gaussian
rigidity as functions of the packing fraction are found by considering the
known terms of the series expansion complemented with a simple fitting
approach. It is found that the obtained formulas accurately describe the
curvature thermodynamic properties of the system, further, they are more
accurate than any of the previously published expressions.
