A revolution in radio receiving technology is underway with the development
of densely packed phased arrays for radio astronomy. This technology can
provide an exceptionally large field of view, while at the same time sampling
the sky with high angular resolution. Such an instrument, with a field of view
of over 100 square degrees, is ideal for performing fast, all-sky, surveys,
such as the "intensity mapping" experiment to measure the signature of Baryonic
Acoustic Oscillations in the HI mass distribution at cosmological redshifts.
The SKA, built with this technology, will be able to do a billion galaxy
survey. I will present a very brief introduction to radio interferometry, as
well as an overview of the Square Kilometre Array project. This will be
followed by a description of the EMBRACE prototype and a discussion of results
and future plans.
