A stack of titanium foils was irradiated with 136 MeV 136Xe to study
microstructure damage and phase stability of titanium upon irradiation. X- ray
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy and
atomic force microscopy were used to study the resulting microstructure damage
and phase stability of titanium. We observed the phase transfor- mation of
polycrystalline titanium from alpha-Ti (hexagonally closed packed (hcp)) to
face centered cubic (fcc) after irradiation with 2.2 x 1015 ions/cm2.
Irradiation of Ti with 1.8 x 1014-2.2 x 1015 ions/cm2 resulted in the forma-
tion of voids, hillocks, dislocation loops, dislocation lines, as well as
polygonal ridge networks.
