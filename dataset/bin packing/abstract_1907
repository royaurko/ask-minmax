Predictions are made for the forward-backward and charge asymmetries in
bottom-quark pair production at hadron colliders. Tree-level exchanges of
electroweak (EW) gauge bosons dominate the Standard Model (SM) contribution to
the asymmetry near the $Z$-pole. The mixed EW-QCD corrections are computed in
an approximate way, and are found to be small in magnitude. These SM
predictions are consistent with experimental results from CDF, D0, and LHCb. In
particular, CDF and LHCb find that the asymmetry in the invariant mass bin
containing the $Z$-pole is larger than in the adjacent bins, as predicted.
Several beyond the Standard Model scenarios proposed for the top-quark
forward-backward asymmetry, including a 100 GeV axigluon, are disfavored by
this combination of SM predictions and measurements. On the other hand,
modified $Zb\bar{b}$ couplings can explain the 2$\sigma$ discrepancy in the
bottom-quark forward-backward asymmetry at LEP1, while being consistent with
the results of CDF and LHCb. It is also shown that $t$-channel $W$ exchange
makes a non-negligible contribution to the charm-quark charge asymmetry.
