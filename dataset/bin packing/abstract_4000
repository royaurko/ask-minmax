It is well accepted that the solar cycle originates from a
magnetohydrodynamics dynamo deep inside the Sun. Many dynamo models have long
been proposed based on a lot of observational constraints. In this paper, using
342 NSO/Kitt Peak solar synoptic charts we study the solar cycle phases in
different solar latitudinal zones to set further constraints. Our results can
be summarized as follows. (1) The variability of solar polar regions' area has
a correlation with total unsigned magnetic flux in advance of 5 years. (2) The
high-latitude region mainly appears unipolar in the whole solar cycle and its
flux peak time lags sunspot cycle for 3 years. (3) For the activity belt, it is
not surprised that its phase be the same as sunspot's. (4) The flux peak time
of the low-latitude region shifts forward with an average gradient of 32.2
$day/deg$. These typical characteristics may provide some hints for
constructing an actual solar dynamo.
