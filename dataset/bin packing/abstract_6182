The angular distribution and differential branching fraction of the decay
$B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ are studied with a dataset
corresponding to $1.0\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, collected by
the LHCb experiment. The angular distribution is measured in bins of dimuon
invariant mass squared and found to be consistent with Standard Model
expectations. Integrating the differential branching fraction over the full
dimuon invariant mass range yields a total branching fraction of
$\mathcal{B}(B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}) = (4.36 \pm 0.15 \pm
0.18)\times 10^{-7}$. These measurements are the most precise to date of the
$B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay.
