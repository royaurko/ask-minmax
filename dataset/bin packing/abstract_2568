We present the first attempt to use a new method to measure CP violation in
Dalitz plots. This method is unbinned, model independent and has a greater
sensitivity to CP violating effects than binned methods. Preliminary studies
have been made using the three-body decays $D^0 \rightarrow K_\mathrm{S}^0 h^+
h^-$ and $D^0 \rightarrow h^+ h^- \pi^0$, which are especially challenging
since there is one neutral particle in each of the final states. An attempt to
visualise where CP violation occurs in Dalitz plots is also presented.
