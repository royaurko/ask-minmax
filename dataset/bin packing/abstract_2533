We study supersymmetric Wilson loop operators in ABJM theory from both sides
of the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence. We first construct some supersymmetric
Wilson loops. The perturbative computations are performed in the field theory
side at the first two orders. A fundamental string solution ending on a
circular loop is also studied.
