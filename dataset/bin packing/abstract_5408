We present the results of a search for the reactivation of active asteroid
176P/LINEAR during its 2011 perihelion passage using deep optical observations
obtained before, during, and after that perihelion passage. Deep composite
images of 176P constructed from data obtained between June 2011 and December
2011 show no visible signs of activity, while photometric measurements of the
object during this period also show no significant brightness enhancements
similar to that observed for 176P between November 2005 and December 2005 when
it was previously observed to be active. An azimuthal search for dust emission
likewise reveals no evidence for directed emission (i.e., a tail, as was
previously observed for 176P), while a one-dimensional surface brightness
profile analysis shows no indication of a spherically symmetric coma at any
time in 2011. We conclude that 176P did not in fact exhibit activity in 2011,
at least not on the level on which it exhibited activity in 2005, and suggest
that this could be due to the devolatization or mantling of the active site
responsible for its activity in 2005.
