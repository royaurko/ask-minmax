I discuss the capabilities and limitations of the AMiBA for imaging CMB
anisotropies. Michael Kesteven (ATNF-CSIRO) has proposed drift-scanning as an
observing strategy for measuring and rejecting any instrumental response that
the close-packed interferometers may have to the local environment. The
advantages of mosaic imaging CMB anisotropies using a co-mounted
interferometric array in a drift-scanning observing mode are discussed. A
particular case of mosaic imaging a sky strip using a two-element AMiBA
prototype interferometer is considered and the signal-to-noise ratio in the
measurement of sky anisotropy using this observing strategy is analysed.
