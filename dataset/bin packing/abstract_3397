We study the depletion-induced self-assembly of indented colloids. Using
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulation techniques that treat the depletant
particles explicitly, we demonstrate that colloids assemble by a lock-and-key
mechanism, leading to colloidal polymerization. The morphology of the chains
that are formed depends sensitively on the size of the colloidal indentation,
with smaller values additionally permitting chain branching. In contrast to the
case of spheres with attractive patches, Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation
theory fails to provide a fully quantitative description of the polymerization
transition. We trace this failure to a neglect of packing effects and we
introduce a modified theory that accounts better for the shape of the colloids,
yielding improved agreement with simulation.
