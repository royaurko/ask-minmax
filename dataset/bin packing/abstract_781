In this third and final paper of a series, elastic properties of
numerically simulated isotropic packings of spherical beads assembled by
different procedures and subjected to a varying confining pressure P are
investigated. In addition P, which determines the stiffness of contacts by
Hertz's law, elastic moduli are chiefly sensitive to the coordination
number, the possible values of which are not necessarily correlated with the
density. Comparisons of numerical and experimental results for glass beads in
the 10kPa-10MPa range reveal similar differences between dry samples
compacted by vibrations and lubricated packings. The greater stiffness of the
latter, in spite of their lower density, can hence be attributed to a larger
coordination number. Voigt and Reuss bounds bracket bulk modulus B accurately,
but simple estimation schemes fail for shear modulus G, especially in poorly
coordinated configurations under low P. Tenuous, fragile networks respond
differently to changes in load direction, as compared to load intensity. The
shear modulus, in poorly coordinated packings, tends to vary proportionally to
the degree of force indeterminacy per unit volume. The elastic range extends to
small strain intervals, in agreement with experimental observations. The
origins of nonelastic response are discussed. We conclude that elastic moduli
provide access to mechanically important information about coordination
numbers, which escape direct measurement techniques, and indicate further
perspectives.
