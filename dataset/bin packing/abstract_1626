We apply the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) to deep inelastic
scattering near the endpoint region. The forward scattering amplitude, and the
structure functions are shown to factorize as a convolution of the Wilson
coefficients, the jet functions, the parton distribution functions. The
behavior of the parton distribution functions near the endpoint region is
considered. It turns out that it evolves with the Altarelli-Parisi kernel even
in the endpoint region, and the parton distribution function can be factorized
further into a collinear part and the soft Wilson line. The factorized form for
the structure functions is obtained by the two-step matching, and the radiative
corrections or the evolution for each factorized part can be computed in
perturbation theory. We present the radiative corrections of each factorized
part to leading order in alpha_s, including the zero-bin subtraction for the
collinear part.
