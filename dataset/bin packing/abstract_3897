We present the results for the measurement of $\phi$ meson production in
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au and pp collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). Using the event mixing technique, spectra and yields are
obtained from the $\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}$ decay channel for different centrality
bins in Au+Au collisions and in pp collisions. We observe that the spectrum
shape in Au+Au collisions depends weakly on the centrality and the shape of the
spectrum in pp collisions is significantly different from that in Au+Au
collisions. In Au+Au collisions, the extracted yield of $\phi$ meson is flat as
a function of rapidity; The $<p_T>$ of $\phi$, extracted from the fit function
to the spectra, shows a different behavior as a function of centrality than
that of $\pi^-$, $K^-$ and $\bar{p}$
