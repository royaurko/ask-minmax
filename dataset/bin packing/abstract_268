Elementary smooth functions (beyond contact) are employed to construct pair
correlation functions that mimic jammed disordered sphere packings. Using the
g2-invariant optimization method of Torquato and Stillinger [J. Phys. Chem. B
106, 8354, 2002], parameters in these functions are optimized under necessary
realizability conditions to maximize the packing fraction phi and average
number of contacts per sphere Z. A pair correlation function that incorporates
the salient features of a disordered packing and that is smooth beyond contact
is shown to permit a phi of 0.6850: this value represents a 45% reduction in
the difference between the maximum for congruent hard spheres in three
dimensions, pi/sqrt{18} ~ 0.7405, and 0.64, the approximate fraction associated
with maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings in three dimensions. We show that,
surprisingly, the continued addition of elementary functions consisting of
smooth sinusoids decaying as r^{-4} permits packing fractions approaching
pi/sqrt{18}. A translational order metric is used to discriminate between
degrees of order in the packings presented. We find that to achieve higher
packing fractions, the degree of order must increase, which is consistent with
the results of a previous study [Torquato et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2064,
2000].
