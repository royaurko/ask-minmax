We show that in the accelerating universe the generalized second law of
thermodynamics holds only in the case where the enveloping surface is the
apparent horizon, but not in the case of the event horizon. The present
analysis relies on the most recent SNe Ia events, being model independent. Our
study might suggest that event horizon is not a physical boundary from the
point of view of thermodynamics.
