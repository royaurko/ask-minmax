Rigid particles pack into structures, such as sand dunes on the beach, whose
overall stability is determined by the average number of contacts between
particles. However, when packing spatially extended objects with flexible
shapes, additional concepts must be invoked to understand the stability of the
resulting structure. Here we study the disordered packing of chains constructed
out of flexibly-connected hard spheres. Using X-ray tomography, we find long
chains pack into a low-density structure whose mechanical rigidity is mainly
provided by the backbone. On compaction, randomly-oriented, semi-rigid loops
form along the chain, and the packing of chains can be understood as the
jamming of these elements. Finally we uncover close similarities between the
packing of chains and the glass transition in polymers.
