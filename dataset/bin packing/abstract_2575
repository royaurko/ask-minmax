A new diluted magnetic semiconductor system, (Sr3La2O5)(Zn1-xMnx)2As2, has
been synthesized and characterized. 10% Mn substitution for Zn in bulk form
(Sr3La2O5)Zn2As2 results in a ferromagnetic ordering below Curie temperature,
TC ~ 40 K. (Sr3La2O5)(Zn1-xMnx)2As2 has a layered crystal structure identical
to that of 32522-type Fe based superconductors, and represents the fifth DMS
family that has a direct counterpart among the FeAs high temperature
superconductor families.
