We present a novel Bell-state analyzer for time-bin qubits allowing the
detection of three out of four Bell-states with linear optics, only two
detectors and no auxiliary photons. The theoretical success rate of this scheme
is 50%. A teleportation experiment was performed to demonstrate its
functionality. We also present a teleportation experiment with a fidelity
larger than the cloning limit.
