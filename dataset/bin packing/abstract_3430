For every $r\in \mathbb{N}$, we denote by $\theta_{r}$ the multigraph with
two vertices and $r$ parallel edges. Given a graph $G$, we say that a subgraph
$H$ of $G$ is a model of $\theta_{r}$ in $G$ if $H$ contains $\theta_{r}$ as a
contraction. We prove that the following edge variant of the Erd{\H
o}s-P{\'o}sa property holds for every $r\geq 2$: if $G$ is a graph and $k$ is a
positive integer, then either $G$ contains a packing of $k$ mutually
edge-disjoint models of $\theta_{r}$, or it contains a set $S$ of $f_r(k)$
edges meeting all models of $\theta_{r}$ in $G,$ for both $f_r(k) = O(k^2r^3
\mathrm{polylog}~kr)$ and $f_r(k) = O(k^4r^2 \mathrm{polylog}~kr).$
