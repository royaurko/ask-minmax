Strategies for extracting CKM phases from non-leptonic $B$ decays are
reviewed briefly. Both general aspects and some recent developments including
CP-violating asymmetries, the $B_s$ system in light of a possible width
difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$, and triangle relations among $B$ decay amplitudes
are discussed. The role of electroweak penguins in these strategies is
illustrated briefly.
