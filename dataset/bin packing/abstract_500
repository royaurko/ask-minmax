In this paper we make an attempt to combine the two kinds of data from the
Swift-XRT instrument (windowed timing and photon counting modes) and the from
BAT. A thorough desription of the applied procedure will be given. We apply
various binning techniques to the different data: Bayes blocks, exponential
binning and signal-to-noise type of binning. We present a handful of
lightcurves and some possible applications.
