Any two polygons of equal area can be partitioned into congruent sets of
polygonal pieces, and in many cases one can connect the pieces by flexible
hinges while still allowing the connected set to form both polygons. However it
is open whether such a hinged dissection always exists. We solve a special case
of this problem, by showing that any asymmetric polygon always has a hinged
dissection to its mirror image. Our dissection forms a chain of kite-shaped
pieces, found by a circle-packing algorithm for quadrilateral mesh generation.
A hinged mirror dissection of a polygon with n sides can be formed with O(n)
kites in O(n log n) time.
