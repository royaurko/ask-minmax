We report on sytematic measurements of the low frequency conductivity in
aequous supensions of highly charged colloidal spheres. System preparation in a
closed tubing system results in precisely controlled number densities between
1E16/m3 and 1E19/m^3 (packing fractions between 1E-7 and 1E-2) and electrolyte
concentrations between 1E-7 and 1E-3 mol/l. Due to long ranged Coulomb
repulsion some of the systems show a pronounced fluid or crystalline order.
Under deionized conditions we find s to depend linearily on the packing
fraction with no detectable influence of the phase transitions. Further at
constant packing fraction s increases sublinearily with increasing number of
dissociable surface groups N. As a function of c the conductivity shows
pronounced differences depending on the kind of electrolyte used. We propose a
simple yet powerful model based on independent migration of all species present
and additivity of the respective conductivity contributions. It takes account
of small ion macro-ion interactions in terms of an effectivly transported
charge. The model successfully describes our qualitatively complex experimental
observations. It further facilitates quantitative estimates of conductivity
over a wide range of particle and experimental parameters.
