When a single emitter is excited by two phase-coherent pulses with a time
delay, each of the pulses can lead to the emission of a photon pair, thus
creating a ``time-bin entangled'' state. Double pair emission can be avoided by
initially preparing the emitter in a metastable state. We show how photons from
separate emissions can be made indistinguishable, permitting their use for
multi-photon interference. Possible realizations are discussed. The method
might also allow the direct creation of n-photon entangled states (n>2).
