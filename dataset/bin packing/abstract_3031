We show that a suitably chosen position-momentum commutator can elegantly
describe many features of gravity, including the IR/UV correspondence and
dimensional reduction (`holography'). Using the most simplistic example based
on dimensional analysis of black holes, we construct a commutator which
qualitatively exhibits these novel properties of gravity. Dimensional reduction
occurs because the quanta size grow quickly with momenta, and thus cannot be
"packed together" as densely as naively expected. We conjecture that a more
precise form of this commutator should be able to quantitatively reproduce all
of these features.
