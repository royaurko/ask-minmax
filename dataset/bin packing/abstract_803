Packing transitions in the lowest energy structures of Li clusters as a
function of size have been identified via simulated annealing. For N>21, the
large $p$ character of Li leads to unexpected ionic structures. At N~25, a
packing pattern based on interpenetrating 13-atom icosahedra and similar to
that of Na and K appears. This pattern persists until at N=55, where another
transition to a structure based on a Mackay icosahedron occurs. For clusters of
size 55 and 147, the optimized FCC structure representative of the bulk is
still slightly higher in energy than the optimal MIC. (RK-94-03)
