In the Colored Bin Packing problem a sequence of items of sizes up to $1$
arrives to be packed into bins of unit capacity. Each item has one of $c\geq 2$
colors and an additional constraint is that we cannot pack two items of the
same color next to each other in the same bin. The objective is to minimize the
number of bins.
  In the important special case when all items have size zero, we characterize
the optimal value to be equal to color discrepancy. As our main result, we give
an (asymptotically) 1.5-competitive algorithm which is optimal. In fact, the
algorithm always uses at most $\lceil1.5\cdot OPT\rceil$ bins and we show a
matching lower bound of $\lceil1.5\cdot OPT\rceil$ for any value of $OPT\geq
2$. In particular, the absolute ratio of our algorithm is $5/3$ and this is
optimal.
  For items of unrestricted sizes we give an asymptotically $3.5$-competitive
algorithm. When the items have sizes at most $1/d$ for a real $d \geq 2$ the
asymptotic competitive ratio is $1.5+d/(d-1)$. We also show that classical
algorithms First Fit, Best Fit and Worst Fit are not constant competitive,
which holds already for three colors and small items.
  In the case of two colors---the Black and White Bin Packing problem---we
prove that all Any Fit algorithms have absolute competitive ratio $3$. When the
items have sizes at most $1/d$ for a real $d \geq 2$ we show that the Worst Fit
algorithm is absolutely $(1+d/(d-1))$-competitive.
