The production of charged hadrons, in muon Deep inelastic scattering (DIS),
at light and heavy target is presented. The particles produced by the
interaction with Xenon (Xe) is compared with that produced by the interaction
with Deuteron (D), to obtain information on cascading process, forward-backward
productions, and the rapidity distribution in different bins of the invariant
mass of the interacting system W.
