Recent work by Polyanskiy et al. and Chen et al. has excited new interest in
using feedback to approach capacity with low latency. Polyanskiy showed that
feedback identifying the first symbol at which decoding is successful allows
capacity to be approached with surprisingly low latency. This paper uses Chen's
rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP) analysis to study what happens when
symbols must be transmitted in packets, as with a traditional hybrid ARQ
system, and limited to relatively few (six or fewer) incremental transmissions.
  Numerical optimizations find the series of progressively growing cumulative
block lengths that enable RCSP to approach capacity with the minimum possible
latency. RCSP analysis shows that five incremental transmissions are sufficient
to achieve 92% of capacity with an average block length of fewer than 101
symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB.
  The RCSP analysis provides a decoding error trajectory that specifies the
decoding error rate for each cumulative block length. Though RCSP is an
idealization, an example tail-biting convolutional code matches the RCSP
decoding error trajectory and achieves 91% of capacity with an average block
length of 102 symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB. We also show how
RCSP analysis can be used in cases where packets have deadlines associated with
them (leading to an outage probability).
