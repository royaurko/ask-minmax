Considering the results from Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) theory, a more precise
relation between the number of bits and area in the holographic system is
proposed. With this corrected relation and Debye model, two modified Friedmann
equations are derived from the Hawking temperature and the Unruh temperature
separately in entropic force. These equations could be better in describing the
whole evolution of the universe.
