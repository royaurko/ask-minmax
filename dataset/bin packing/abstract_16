The article proposes a heuristic approximation approach to the bin packing
problem under multiple objectives. In addition to the traditional objective of
minimizing the number of bins, the heterogeneousness of the elements in each
bin is minimized, leading to a biobjective formulation of the problem with a
tradeoff between the number of bins and their heterogeneousness. An extension
of the Best-Fit approximation algorithm is presented to solve the problem.
Experimental investigations have been carried out on benchmark instances of
different size, ranging from 100 to 1000 items. Encouraging results have been
obtained, showing the applicability of the heuristic approach to the described
problem.
