Migratory birds can utilize the geomagnetic field for orientation and
navigation through a widely accepted radical-pair mechanism. Although many
theoretical works have been done the available experimental results have not
been fully considered, especially, the temporary disorientation induced by the
field which is increased by 30% of geomagnetic field and the disorientation of
the very weak resonant field of $15nT$. In this paper, we consider the
monotonicity of the singlet yield angular profile as the prerequisite of
direction sensitivity, and find that for some optimal values of the hyperfine
coupling parameters, that is the order of $10^{-7}\sim10^{-6}meV$, the
experimental results available by far can be satisfied. We also investigate the
effects of two decoherence environments and demonstrate that, in order to
satisfy the available experimental results, the decoherence rate should be much
lower than the recombination rate. Finally we investigate the effects of the
fluctuating magnetic noises, and find that the vertical noise destroys the
monotonicity of the profile completely, but the parallel noise preserves the
monotonicity perfectly and even can enhance the direction sensitivity.
