We outline a plan for final muon ionization cooling with quadrupole doublets
focusing onto short absorbers followed by emittance exchange in vacuum to
achieve the small transverse beam sizes needed by a muon collider. A flat muon
beam with a series of quadrupole doublet half cells appears to provide the
strong focusing required for final cooling. Each quadrupole doublet has a low
beta region occupied by a dense, low Z absorber. After final cooling,
normalized xyz emittances of (0.071, 0.141, 2.4) mm-rad are exchanged into
(0.025, 0.025, 70) mm-rad. Thin electrostatic septa efficiently slice the bunch
into 17 parts. The 17 bunches are interleaved into a 3.7 meter long train with
RF deflector cavities. Snap bunch coalescence combines the muon bunch train
longitudinally in a 21 GeV ring in 55 microseconds, one quarter of a
synchrotron oscillation period. A linear long wavelength RF bucket gives each
bunch a different energy causing the bunches to drift until they merge into one
bunch and can be captured in a short wavelength RF bucket with a 13% muon decay
loss and a packing fraction as high as 87%.
