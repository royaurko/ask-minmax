Taking the coupled KdV system as a simple example, analytical and nonsingular
complexiton solutions are firstly discovered in this letter for integrable
systems. Additionally, the analytical and nonsingular positon-negaton
interaction solutions are also firstly found for S-integrable model. The new
analytical positon, negaton and complexiton solutions of the coupled KdV system
are given out both analytically and graphically by means of the iterative
Darboux transformations.
