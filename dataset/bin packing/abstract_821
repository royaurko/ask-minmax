We conduct molecular dynamics simulations of athermal systems undergoing
boundary-driven planar shear flow in two and three spatial dimensions. We find
that these systems possess nonlinear mean velocity profiles when the velocity
$u$ of the shearing wall exceeds a critical value $u_c$. Above $u_c$, we also
show that the packing fraction and mean-square velocity profiles become
spatially-dependent with dilation and enhanced velocity fluctuations near the
moving boundary. In systems with overdamped dynamics, $u_c$ is only weakly
dependent on packing fraction $\phi$. However, in systems with underdamped
dynamics, $u_c$ is set by the speed of shear waves in the material and tends to
zero as $\phi$ approaches $\phi_c$. In the small damping limit, $\phi_c$
approaches values for random close-packing obtained in systems at zero
temperature. For underdamped systems with $\phi<\phi_c$, $u_c$ is zero and thus
they possess nonlinear velocity profiles at any nonzero boundary velocity.
