B -> K*ll angular observables have become a key ingredient in global
model-independent analyses of b->s transitions. However, as experimental
precision improves, the use of theoretically clean quantities becomes a crucial
issue. Global analyses that use clean observables integrated in small bins are
already a reality, opening up a new chapter in our quest for New Physics.
