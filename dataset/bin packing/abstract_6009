By globally analyzing all existing measured branching fractions for $D\to \pi
e^+\nu_e$ decays, partial decay rates in different four momentum
transfer-squared $q^2$ bins, as well as products of the decay form factor
$f_+^\pi(q^2)$ and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix
element $|V_{cd}|$, we obtain $f_+^\pi(0)|V_{cd}|=0.1428\pm0.0019$. This
product, in conjunction with $|V_{cd}|$ from a global Standard Model fit,
implies a value for the $D\to\pi$ semileptonic form factor
$f_+^\pi(0)=0.634\pm0.008\pm0.002$, which is consistent within error with those
calculated in theory based on QCD, but with higher precision than the most
accurate $f_+^\pi(0)_{\rm LQCD}=0.666\pm0.020\pm0.021$ calculated in LQCD by a
factor of 3.3. Alternately, using this product together with the most accurate
form factor calculated in LQCD, we find $|V_{cd}|^{D\to \pi
e^+\nu_e}=0.2144\pm0.0029_{\rm exp}\pm 0.0093_{\rm LQCD}$. Combining this
$|V_{cd}|^{D\to \pi e^+\nu_e}$ together with
$|V_{cd}|^{D^+\to\mu^+\nu_\mu}=0.2160\pm0.0049\pm0.0014$ extracted from both
the BESIII and CLEO-c measurements of $D^+\to\mu^+\nu_\mu$ decays, we find the
most precisely extracted $|V_{cd}|$ to be $|V_{cd}|=0.2157\pm0.0045$ up to
date, which improves the accuracy of the PDG'2014 value $|V_{cd}|_{\rm
PDG'2014}=0.225\pm0.008$ by over $70%$. Using this $|V_{cd}|$ together with the
PDG'2014 $|V_{ud}|$ and $|V_{td}|$, we check for first column unitarity and
find $|V_{ud}|^2+|V_{cd}|^2+|V_{td}|^2-1=-0.004\pm0.002$, which deviates from
unitarity by $2\sigma$. In addition, we find the ratio of $f_+^\pi(0)$ and
$D^+$ decay constant $f_{D^+}$ to be $f_+^\pi(0)/f_{D^+}=(3.11\pm0.08)$
GeV$^{-1}$, which can be used to validate LQCD calculations for these two
quantities.
