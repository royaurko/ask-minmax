This paper describes the methods used to obtain the spectroscopic data and
construct redshift catalogs for the Canada-France deep Redshift Survey (CFRS).
The full data set consists of more than one thousand spectra, of objects with
17.5 < I_{AB} < 22.5, obtained from deep multi-slit data with the MARLIN and
MOS-SIS spectrographs at the CFHT. The final spectroscopic catalog contains 200
stars, 591 galaxies with secure redshifts in the range 0 < z < 1.3, 6 QSOs, and
146 objects with very uncertain or unknown redshifts, leading to an overall
success rate of identification of 85%. Additionally, 67 objects affected by
observational problems have been placed in a supplemental list.
 We describe here the instrumental set up, and the observing procedures used to
efficiently gather this large data set. New optimal ways of packing spectra on
the detector to significantly increase the multiplexing gain offered by
multi-slit spectroscopy are described. Dedicated data reduction procedures have
been developed under the IRAF environment to allow for fast and accurate
processing.
 Very strict procedures have been followed to establish a reliable list of
final spectroscopic measurements. Fully independent processing of the data has
been carried out by three members of the team for each data set associated with
a multi-slit mask, and final redshifts were
 assigned only after the careful comparison of the three independent
measurements. A confidence class scheme was established. We strongly emphasize
the benefits of such procedures.
 Finally, we present the spectroscopic data obtained for 303 objects in the
0000-00 and 1000+25 fields. The success rate in spectroscopic identification is
