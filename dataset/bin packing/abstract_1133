We study the neutrino mass hierarchy at the magnetized Iron CALorimeter
(ICAL) detector at India-based Neutrino Observatory with atmospheric neutrino
events generated by the Monte Carlo event generator Nuance. We judicially
choose the observables so that the possible systematic uncertainties can be
reduced. The resolution as a function of both energy and zenith angle
simultaneously is obtained for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos separately from
thousand years un-oscillated atmospheric neutrino events at ICAL to migrate
number of events from neutrino energy and zenith angle bins to muon energy and
zenith angle bins. The resonance ranges in terms of directly measurable
quantities like muon energy and zenith angle are found using this resolution
function at different input values of $\theta_{13}$. Then, the marginalized
$\chi^2$s are studied for different input values of $\theta_{13}$ with its
resonance ranges taking input data in muon energy and zenith angle bins.
Finally, we find that the mass hierarchy can be explored up to a lower value of
$\theta_{13}\approx 5^\circ$ with confidence level $>$ 95% in this set up.
