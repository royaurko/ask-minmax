Sr2VO{3-delta}FeAs superconductors with different oxygen deficiencies have
been successfully fabricated. It is found that the superconducting transition
temperature drops down monotonically with the increase of oxygen deficiency.
The diminishing of superconductivity is accompanied by the enhancement of
residual resistivity, indicating an unraveled scattering effect induced by the
oxygen deficiency. The highest superconducting transition temperature at about
40 K is achieved near the stoichiometrical sample Sr$_2$VO$_{3}$FeAs.
Surprisingly, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the
vanadium has a "5+" valence state in the samples. The Hall effect measurements
reveal that the density of charge carriers (electron-like here) varies
qualitatively with the increase of oxygen deficiency. Magnetotransport
measurements show that the superconducting transition changes from
one-step-like shape at low fields to two-step-like one at high fields,
indicating a high anisotropy.
