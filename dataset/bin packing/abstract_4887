Magnetic properties and bonding analyses of perovskite structure Co$_{4}$N
nitride have been investigated within density functional theory using both
pseudo potential and all electron methods. In the same time, the structural and
magnetic stability of pure cobalt in hexagonal close packed (HCP), face
centered cubic (FCC) and body centered cubic (BCC) structures are reviewed. At
equilibrium, non-spin polarized (NSP) and spin polarized (SP) calculations of
the energy versus volume show that the ground state is ferromagnetic in both
materials. HCP-Co is found to be more stable than the cubic ones. Magnetic
moments of Co atoms in Co$_4$N nitride respectively belonging to two different
crystallographic sites are studied over a wide range of the cubic lattice
constant, and a comparison with the FCC-cobalt one is given. The volume
expansion in the nitride indicates that the corner Co$^{I}$ atoms show
localized magnetism while face center Co$^{II}$ atoms exhibit an itinerant
behavior. Like in FCC-Fe/Fe$_{4}$N, a "low volume-low moment" and "large
volume-high moment" behavior is observed for FCC-Co/Co$_4$N. The density of
states of the Co$_{4}$N ferromagnetic ground state is interpreted within the
rigid band model. The different bonding characters of Co$^I$-N versus
Co$^{II}$-N are shown with help of electron localization fucntion ELF plots and
spin resolved chemical bonding criteria.
