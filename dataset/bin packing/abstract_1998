An accurate description of a columnar liquid crystal of hard disks at high
packing fractions is presented using an improved free-volume theory. It is
shown that the orientational entropy of the disks in the one-dimensional fluid
direction leads to a different high-density scaling pressure compared to the
prediction from traditional cell theory. Excellent quantitative agreement is
found with recent Monte-Carlo simulation results for various thermodynamic and
structural properties of the columnar state.
