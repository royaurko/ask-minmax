The large multiplicities at the LHC may permit flow harmonics to be
determined on an event by event basis in Pb-Pb collisions. We extract these
harmonics from event by event di-hadron correlations. Within a fine centrality
bin, we find the correlation function varies substantially on an event by event
basis, indicating large fluctuations in the initial conditions for a given
impact parameter. Such large fluctuations lead to some events being highly
triangular or highly elliptical, where the angular correlation function is
completely dominated by the respective second and third Fourier harmonics. We
will show unfolded $v_{2}$ distributions for various centralities, and
implications for our understanding of the initial conditions.
