Matter gets organized at several levels of structural rearrangements. At
mesoscopic level one can distinguish between two types of rearrangements,
conforming to different close-packing or densification conditions, appearing
during different evolution stages. The cluster formations appear to be
temperature- and space-dimension dependent. They suffer a type of Verhulst-like
saturation (frustration) when one couples the growing (instability) and
mechanical stress relaxation modes together. They manifest a chaotic behavior
both in space and time domains. We pretend to offer a comprehensive and
realistic picture of a material or megacluster formation in d-dimension.
