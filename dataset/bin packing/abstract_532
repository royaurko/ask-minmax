For packings of hard but not perfectly rigid particles, the length scales
that govern the packing geometry and the contact forces are well separated.
This separation of length scales is explored in the force network ensemble,
where one studies the space of allowed force configurations for a given, frozen
contact geometry. Here we review results of this approach, which yields
nontrivial predictions for the effect of packing dimension and anisotropy on
the contact force distribution $P(f)$, the response to overall shear and point
forcing, all of which can be studied in great numerical detail. Moreover, there
are emerging analytical approaches that very effectively capture, for example,
the form of force distributions.
