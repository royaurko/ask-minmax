The lattice distortion parameter (the deviation of the c/a ratio from the
ideal value 1.633), orientational order parameter, and crystal-field parameter
in hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice of p-H2, o-D2 and n-H2 are calculated
using the semi-empirical lattice-dynamic approach. It is shown that the lattice
distortion in the J-even species is two order of magnitude smaller compared
with that found in n-H2, and n-D2. The difference is due to the splitting of
the J-odd rotational levels in the J-even - J-odd mixtures.
