We report experimental results on the dynamics of a granular packing
submitted to high-intensity focused ultrasound. Acoustic radiation pressure is
shown to remotely induce local rearrangements within a pile as well as global
motion around the focal spot in an initially jammed system. We further
demonstrate that this fluidization process is intermittent for a range of
acoustic pressures and hysteretic when the pressure is cycled. Experimental
results are reproduced in numerical simulations in which the acoustic pressure
field is modeled by a localized external force. Finally a simple two-state
model is presented and recovers the intermittent, first-order-like unjamming
transition observed experimentally and numerically.
