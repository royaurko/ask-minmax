We confirm the detection of the relativistically broadened iron K-alpha
emission at 6.4 keV with simultaneous Chandra HETGS and RXTE PCA observations.
Heavily binned HETGS data show a disk line profile with parameters very similar
to those previously seen by ASCA. We observe a resolved narrow component with a
velocity width ~4700 km/s (FWHM ~ 11,000 km/s), that is most prominent, and
narrower (FWHM ~ 3600 km/s) when the continuum flux is high. It plausibly is
just the blue wing of the broad line. We obtain a stringent limit on the
equivalent width of an intrinsically narrow line in the source of 16 eV,
indicating little or no contribution due to fluoresence from distant material
such as the molecular torus. Variability studies of the narrow component show a
constant iron line flux and variable width indicating the line may be
originating from different kinematic regions of the disk.
