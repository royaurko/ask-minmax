Recent progress in studies of the nanoscale mechanical responses in amorphous
solids has highlighted a strong degree of heterogeneity in the elastic moduli
of thermal glassy systems. In this contribution, using computer simulations, we
study the elastic heterogeneities in athermal amorphous solids, composed of
isotropic, static, sphere packings near the jamming transition. We employ
techniques based on linear response theory which avoid the need to invoke any
explicit deformation. Not only do we validate these procedures by reproducing
established scaling laws for the global elastic moduli, but our technique
reveals new power-law behaviors in the spatial fluctuations of the local
moduli. The local moduli are randomly distributed in space, and are described
by Gaussian probability distributions all the way down to the transition point.
However, the moduli fluctuations grow as the jamming threshold is approached,
through which we are able to identify a characteristic length scale, associated
with the shear modulus heterogeneities.
