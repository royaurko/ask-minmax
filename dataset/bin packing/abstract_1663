The HERA-B Outer Tracker is a large detector with 112674 drift chamber
channels. It is exposed to a particle flux of up to 2x10^5/cm^2/s thus coping
with conditions similar to those expected for the LHC experiments. The
front-end readout system, based on the ASD-8 chip and a customized TDC chip, is
designed to fulfil the requirements on low noise, high sensitivity, rate
tolerance, and high integration density. The TDC system is based on an ASIC
which digitizes the time in bins of about 0.5 ns within a total of 256 bins.
The chip also comprises a pipeline to store data from 128 events which is
required for a deadtime-free trigger and data acquisition system. We report on
the development, installation, and commissioning of the front-end electronics,
including the grounding and noise suppression schemes, and discuss its
performance in the HERA-B experiment.
