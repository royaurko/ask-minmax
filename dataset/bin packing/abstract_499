In this paper, we address the selfish bin covering problem, which is greatly
related both to the bin covering problem, and to the weighted majority game.
What we mainly concern is how much the lack of coordination harms the social
welfare. Besides the standard PoA and PoS, which are based on Nash equilibrium,
we also take into account the strong Nash equilibrium, and several other new
equilibria. For each equilibrium, the corresponding PoA and PoS are given, and
the problems of computing an arbitrary equilibrium, as well as approximating
the best one, are also considered.
