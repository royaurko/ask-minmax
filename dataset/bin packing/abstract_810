A simple numerical model is used to simulate the effect of vertical taps on a
packing of monodisperse hard spheres. Our results are in agreement with an
experimantal work done in Chicago and with other previous models, especially
concerning the dynamics of the compaction, the influence of the excitation
strength on the compaction efficiency, and some ageing effects. The principal
asset of the model is that it allows a local analysis of the packings. Vertical
and transverse density profiles are used as well as size and volume
distributions of the pores. An interesting result concerns the appearance of a
vertical gradient in the density profiles during compaction. Furthermore, the
volume distribution of the pores suggests that the smallest pores, ranging in
size between a tetrahedral and an octahedral site, are not strongly affected by
the tapping process, in contrast to the largest pores which are more sensitive
to the compaction of the packing.
