We investigate the tight packing of nematic polymers inside a confining hard
sphere. We model the polymer {\sl via} the continuum Frank elastic free energy
augmented by a simple density dependent part as well as by taking proper care
of the connectivity of the polymer chains when compared with simple nematics.
The free energy {\sl ansatz} is capable of describing an orientational ordering
transition within the sample between an isotropic polymer solution and a
polymer nematic phase. We solve the Euler-Lagrange equations numerically with
the appropriate boundary conditions for the director and density field and
investigate the orientation and density profile within a sphere. Two important
parameters of the solution are the exact locations of the beginning and the end
of the polymer chain. Pending on their spatial distribution and the actual size
of the hard sphere enclosure we can get a plethora of various configurations of
the chain exhibiting different defect geometry.
