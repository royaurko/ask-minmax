Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a widely used technique in many
applications such as face recognition, motion segmentation, etc. It
approximates the nonnegative data in an original high dimensional space with a
linear representation in a low dimensional space by using the product of two
nonnegative matrices. In many applications data are often partially corrupted
with large additive noise. When the positions of noise are known, some existing
variants of NMF can be applied by treating these corrupted entries as missing
values. However, the positions are often unknown in many real world
applications, which prevents the usage of traditional NMF or other existing
variants of NMF. This paper proposes a Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
(RobustNMF) algorithm that explicitly models the partial corruption as large
additive noise without requiring the information of positions of noise. In
practice, large additive noise can be used to model outliers. In particular,
the proposed method jointly approximates the clean data matrix with the product
of two nonnegative matrices and estimates the positions and values of
outliers/noise. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm with a solid
theoretical justification has been proposed to learn the desired matrix
factorization. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
algorithm.
