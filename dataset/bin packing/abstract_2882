The micromechanics of a variety of systems experiencing a structural arrest
due to their high density could be unified by a thermodynamic framework
governing their approach to 'jammed' configurations. The mechanism of
supporting an applied stress through the microstructure of these highly packed
materials is important in inferring the features responsible for the
inhomogeneous stress transmission and testing the universality for all jammed
matter. In this paper we present a novel method for measuring the force
distribution within the bulk of a compressed emulsion system using confocal
microscopy and explain our results with a simple theoretical model and computer
simulations. We obtain an exponential distribution at large forces and a small
peak at small forces, in agreement with previous experimental and simulation
data for other particulate systems.
