This paper addresses the problem of detecting and characterizing local
variability in time series and other forms of sequential data. The goal is to
identify and characterize statistically significant variations, at the same
time suppressing the inevitable corrupting observational errors. We present a
simple nonparametric modeling technique and an algorithm implementing it - an
improved and generalized version of Bayesian Blocks (Scargle 1998) - that finds
the optimal segmentation of the data in the observation interval. The structure
of the algorithm allows it to be used in either a real-time trigger mode, or a
retrospective mode. Maximum likelihood or marginal posterior functions to
measure model fitness are presented for events, binned counts, and measurements
at arbitrary times with known error distributions. Problems addressed include
those connected with data gaps, variable exposure, extension to piecewise
linear and piecewise exponential representations, multi-variate time series
data, analysis of variance, data on the circle, other data modes, and dispersed
data. Simulations provide evidence that the detection efficiency for weak
signals is close to a theoretical asymptotic limit derived by (Arias-Castro,
Donoho and Huo 2003). In the spirit of Reproducible Research (Donoho et al.
2008) all of the code and data necessary to reproduce all of the figures in
this paper are included as auxiliary material.
