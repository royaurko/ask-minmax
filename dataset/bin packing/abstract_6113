This Report summarises the results of the second year's activities of the LHC
Higgs Cross Section Working Group. The main goal of the working group was to
present the state of the art of Higgs Physics at the LHC, integrating all new
results that have appeared in the last few years. The first working group
report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables
(CERN-2011-002) focuses on predictions (central values and errors) for total
Higgs production cross sections and Higgs branching ratios in the Standard
Model and its minimal supersymmetric extension, covering also related issues
such as Monte Carlo generators, parton distribution functions, and
pseudo-observables. This second Report represents the next natural step towards
realistic predictions upon providing results on cross sections with benchmark
cuts, differential distributions, details of specific decay channels, and
further recent developments.
