We describe the angular power spectrum of resolved sources at 3.6 microns
(L-band) in Spitzer imaging data of the GOODS HDF-N, the GOODS CDF-S, and the
NDWFS Bootes field in several source magnitude bins. We also measure angular
power spectra of resolved sources in the Bootes field at K_S and J-bands using
ground-based IR imaging data. In the three bands, J, K_S, and L, we detect the
clustering of galaxies on top of the shot-noise power spectrum at multipoles
between ell ~ 10^2 and 10^5. The angular power spectra range from the large,
linear scales to small, non-linear scales of galaxy clustering, and in some
magnitude ranges, show departure from a power-law clustering spectrum. We
consider a halo model to describe clustering measurements and to establish the
halo occup ation number parameters of IR bright galaxies at redshifts around
one. We also extend our clustering results and completeness-corrected faint
source number counts in GOODS fields to understand the underlying nature of
unresolved sources responsible for IR background (IRB) anisotropies that were
detected in deep Spitzer images. While these unresolved fluctuations were
measured at sub-arcminute angular scales, if a high-redshift diffuse component
associated with first galaxies exists in the IRB, then it's clustering
properties are best studied with shallow, wide-field images that allow a
measurement of the clustering spectrum from a few degrees to arcminute angular
scales.
