The STAR data on the multiplicity correlations between narrow psudorapidity
bins in the pp and AuAu collisions are discussed. The PYTHIA 8.145 generator is
used for the pp data, and a naive superposition model is presented for the AuAu
data. It is shown that the PYTHIA generator with default parameter values
describes the pp data reasonably well, whereas the superposition model fails to
reproduce the centrality dependence seen in the data. Some possible reasons for
this failure and a comparison with other models are presented.
