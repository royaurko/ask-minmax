A model is suggested to unify the Einstein GR and Dirac Cosmology. There is
one adjusted parameter $b_2$ in our model. After adjusting the parameter $b_2$
in the model by using the supernova data, we have calculated the gravitational
constant $\bar G$ and the physical quantities of $a(t)$, $q(t)$ and $\rho_r(t)/
\rho_b(t)$ by using the present day quantities as the initial conditions and
found that the equation of state parameter $w_{\theta}$ equals to -0.83, the
ratio of the density of the addition creation $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.8$ and the
ratio of the density of the matter including multiplication creation, radiation
and normal matter $\Omega_m =0.2$ at present. The results are self-consistent
and in good agreement with present knowledge in cosmology. These results
suggest that the addition creation and multiplication creation in Dirac
cosmology play the role of the dark energy and dark matter.
