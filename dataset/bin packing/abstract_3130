We devise a soft, solvent-free, coarse-grained model for lipid bilayer
membranes. The non-bonded interactions take the form of a weighted-density
functional which allows us to describe the thermodynamics of self-assembly and
packing effects of the coarse-grained beads in terms of a density expansion of
the equation of state and the weighting functions that regularize the
microscopic bead densities, respectively. Identifying the length and energy
scales via the bilayer thickness and the thermal energy scale, kT, the model
qualitatively reproduces key characteristics (e.g., bending rigidity, area per
lipid molecules, and compressibility) of lipid membranes. We employ this model
to study the main phase transition between the liquid and the gel phase of the
bilayer membrane. We accurately locate the phase coexistence using free energy
calculations and also obtain estimates for the bare and the thermodynamic line
tension.
