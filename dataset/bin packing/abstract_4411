Elliptic flow parameter, $v_{2}$ is consider as a sensitive probe for early
dynamics of the heavy-ion collision. In this work we have discussed the effect
of detector efficiency, procedure of centrality determination, effect of
resonance decay, procedure to obtain event plane resolution on the measured
$v_{2}$ by standard event plane method within the framework of a transport
model. The measured value of $v_{2}$ depends on the detector efficiency in
particle number counting. The effect of centrality determination is found to be
negligible. The method of event-by-event correction of event plane resolution
for wide centrality bin yields in results closer to the true value of $v_{2}$.
The effect of resonance decay is seen to decrease the $v_{2}$ of $\pi$, $K$ and
$p$. We also propose a procedure to correct for an event bias effect on $v_{2}$
while comparing the minimum bias centrality $v_{2}$ values for different
multi-strange hadrons. Finally we have presented a model based confirmation of
the recently proposed relation between $v_{2}$ obtained using event plane
method and scalar product method to the true value of $v_{2}$.
