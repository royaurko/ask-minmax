We performed the observation of the flux densities of Sgr A* at 90 and 102
GHz on 6 April 2005 using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array in order to detect the
time lag between these frequencies. We constructed light curves covering a few
hour with 1 min bin, and the Intra-Day Variability, which had a rising phase
and intensity peak, of Sgr A* is clearly seen at both frequencies. We
calculated the z-transformed discrete correlation function between the light
curves of Sgr A* at 90 and 102 GHz. The derived time lag of the flares at these
frequencies was approximately zero, contrary to our expectations based on the
previously reported time lag at lower frequencies. If the radio flares of Sgr
A* are explained by the expanding plasma model, the light curve at 90 GHz would
be delayed with respect to the one at 102 GHz. However, we could not find such
a delay with statistical significance in our data.
