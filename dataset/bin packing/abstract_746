Skyrmions are spiral structures observed in thin films of certain magnetic
materials (10.1126/science.1120639). Of the phases allowed by the crystalline
symmetries of these materials(10.1103/PhysRevB.80.054416) only the hexagonally
packed phases (SC_h) has been observed. Here the melting of the $SC_h$ phase is
investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition to the usual measure of
Skyrmion density chiral charge, a morphological measure is considered. In doing
so it is shown that the low temperature reduction in chiral charge is
associated with a change in Skyrmion profiles rather than Skyrmion destruction.
At higher temperatures the loss of six fold symmetry is associated with the
appearance of elongated Skyrmions that disrupt the hexagonal packing.
