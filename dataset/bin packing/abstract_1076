In this paper, under the generalized curvature-dimension inequality recently
introduced by F. Baudoin and N. Garofalo, we obtain differential Harnack
inequalities for the positive solutions to the Sch\"odinger equation associated
to subelliptic operator with potential. As applications of the differential
Harnack inequality, we derive the corresponding parabolic Harnack inequality.
Also we define the Perelman type entropy associated to subelliptic operators
and derive its monotonicity.
