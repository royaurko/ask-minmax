Nanowires with very different size, shape, morphology and crystal symmetry
can give rise to a wide ensemble of magnetic behaviors whose optimization
determines their applications in nanomagnets. We present here an experimental
work on the shape and morphological dependence of the magnetization reversal
mechanism in weakly interacting Co80Ni20 hexagonal-close-packed nanowires.
Non-agglomerated nanowires (with length L and diameter d) with a controlled
shape going from quasi perfect cylinders to diabolos, have been studied inside
their polyol solution in order to avoid any oxidation process. The coercive
field HC was found to follow a standard behavior and to be optimized for an
aspect ratio L/d > 15. Interestingly, an unexpected behavior was observed as
function of the head morphology leading to the strange situation where a
diabolo shaped nanowire is a better nanomagnet than a cylinder. This
paradoxical behavior can be ascribed to the growth-competition between the
aspect ratio L/d and the head morphology ratio d/D (D being the head width).
Our experimental results clearly show the importance of the independent
parameter (t = head thickness) that needs to be considered in addition to the
shape aspect ratio (L/d) in order to fully describe the nanomagnets magnetic
behavior. Micromagnetic simulations well support the experimental results and
bring important insights for future optimization of the nanomagnets morphology
