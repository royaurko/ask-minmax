Inspired by recent progress in fabricating precisely zigzag-edged graphene
nanoribbons and the observation of edge magnetism, we find that spin polarized
edge modes with well-defined valley index can exist in a bulk energy gap opened
by a staggered sublattice potential such as that provided by a hexagonal
Boron-Nitride substrate. Our result is obtained by both tight-binding model and
first principles calculations. These edge modes are helical with respect to the
valley degree of freedom, and are robust against scattering, as long as the
disorder potential is smooth over atomic scale, resulting from the protection
of the large momentum separation of the valleys.
