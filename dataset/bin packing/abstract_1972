We calculate the energy-band structure of a He atom trapped within the
interstitial channel between close-packed nanotubes within a bundle and its
influence on the specific heat of the adsorbed gas. A robust prediction of our
calculations is that the contribution of the low-density adsorbed gas to the
specific heat of the nanotube material shows pronounced nonmonotonic variations
with temperature. These variations are shown to be closely related to the band
gaps in the adsorbate density of states.
