We present predictions for Higgs production via gluon fusion with a p_T veto
on jets and with the resummation of jet-veto logarithms at NNLL'+$NNLO order.
These results incorporate explicit O(alphas^2) calculations of soft and beam
functions, which include the dominant dependence on the jet radius R. In
particular the NNLL' order accounts for the correct boundary conditions for the
N3LL resummation, for which the only unknown ingredients are higher-order
anomalous dimensions. We use scale variations in a factorization theorem in
both rapidity and virtuality space to estimate the perturbative uncertainties,
accounting for both higher fixed-order corrections as well as higher-order
towers of jet-p_T logarithms. This formalism also predicts the correlations in
the theory uncertainty between the exclusive 0-jet and inclusive 1-jet bins. At
the values of R used experimentally, there are important corrections due to jet
algorithm clustering that include logarithms of R. Although we do not sum
logarithms of R, we do include an explicit contribution in our uncertainty
estimate to account for higher-order jet clustering logarithms. Precision
predictions for this H+0-jet cross section and its theoretical uncertainty are
an integral part of Higgs analyses that employ jet binning.
