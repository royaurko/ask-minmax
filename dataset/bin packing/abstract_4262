The NLO QCD corrections to Upsilon production via S-wave color-octet states
Upsilon(^1S_0^8,^3S_1^8) at the Tevatron and LHC is calculated. The K factors
of total cross section (ratio of NLO to LO) are 1.313 and 1.379 for
Upsilon(^1S_0^8) and Upsilon(^3S_1^8) at the Tevatron, while at the LHC they
are 1.044 and 1.182, respectively. By fitting the experimental data from the
D0, the matrix elements for S-wave color-octet states are obtained. And new
predictions for Upsilon production are presented. The prediction for the
polarization of inclusive Upsilon contains large uncertainty rising from the
polarization of Upsilon from feed-down of chi_b. To further clarify the
situation, new measurements on the production and polarization for direct
Upsilon are expected.
