Oscillation probability calculations are becoming increasingly CPU intensive
in modern neutrino oscillation analyses. The independency of reweighting
individual events in a Monte Carlo sample lends itself to parallel
implementation on a Graphics Processing Unit. The library "Prob3++" was ported
to the GPU using the CUDA C API, allowing for large scale parallelized
calculations of neutrino oscillation probabilities through matter of constant
density, decreasing the execution time by a factor of 75, when compared to
performance on a single CPU.
