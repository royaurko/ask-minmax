In this paper, we study an exactly solvable model of IIB superstring in a
time-dependent plane-wave backgound with a constant self-dual Ramond-Ramond
5-form field strength and a linear dilaton in the light-like direction. This
background keeps sixteen supersymmetries. In the light-cone gauge, the action
is described by the two-dimensional free bosons and fermions with
time-dependent masses. The model could be canonically quantized and its
Hamiltonian is time-dependent with vanishing zero point energy. The spectrum of
the excitations is symmetric between the bosonic and fermionic sector. The
string mode creation turns out to be very small.
