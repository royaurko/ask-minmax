We explore the effect of stacking fault defects on the transmission of forces
in three-dimensional face-centered-cubic granular crystals. An external force
is applied to a small area at the top surface of a crystalline packing of
granular beads containing one or two stacking faults at various depths. The
response forces at the bottom surface are measured and found to correspond to
predictions based on vector force balance within the geometry of the defects.
We identify the elementary stacking fault as a boundary between two pure
face-centered-cubic crystals with different stacking orders. Other stacking
faults produce response force patterns that can be viewed as resulting from
repetitions of this basic defect. As the number of stacking faults increases,
the intensity pattern evolves toward that of an hexagonal-close-packed crystal.
This leads to the conclusion that the force pattern of that crystal structure
crystal can be viewed as the extreme limit of a face-centered-cubic crystal
with a stacking fault at every layer.
