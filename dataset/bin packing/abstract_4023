We present and analyze an exact 5-dimensional vacuum solution of Einstein
equation with non-negative cosmological constant written in a C-metric like
coordinate. The metric does not contain any black hole horizons in it, but has
two acceleration horizons and a static patch in between. The coordinate system,
horizon geometry and global structures are analyzed in detail, and in the case
of vanishing cosmological constant, a simple exterior geometric interpretation
is given. The metric possesses a spacelike Killing coordinate $\phi$ besides
the timelike coordinate $t$, along which the spacetime can be dimensionally
reduced via Kaluza-Klein mechanism and interpreted as Einstein gravity coupled
to a 4 dimensional Liouville field (and a Maxwell field as well if a boost
operation is performed before the Kaluza-Klein reduction).
