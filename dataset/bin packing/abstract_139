We have produced loose packings of cohesionless, frictional spheres by
sequential deposition of highly-spherical, monodisperse particles through a
fluid. By varying the properties of the fluid and the particles, we have
identified the Stokes number (St) - rather than the buoyancy of the particles
in the fluid - as the parameter controlling the approach to the loose packing
limit. The loose packing limit is attained at a threshold value of St at which
the kinetic energy of a particle impinging on the packing is fully dissipated
by the fluid. Thus, for cohesionless particles, the dynamics of the deposition
process, rather than the stability of the static packing, defines the random
loose packing limit. We have made direct measurements of the interparticle
friction in the fluid, and present an experimental measurement of the loose
packing volume fraction, \phi_{RLP}, as a function of the friction coefficient
\mu_s.
