We discuss the observables for the B->K*(->K pi)ll decay, focusing on both
CP-averaged and CP-violating observables at large and low hadronic recoil with
special emphasis on their low sensitivity to form-factor uncertainties. We
identify an optimal basis of observables that balances theoretical and
experimental advantages, which will guide the New Physics searches in the short
term. We discuss some advantages of the observables in the basis, and in
particular their improved sensitivity to New Physics compared to other
observables. We present predictions within the Standard Model for the
observables of interest, integrated over the appropriate bins including lepton
mass corrections. Finally, we present bounds on the S-wave contribution to the
distribution coming from the B->K_0*ll decay, which will help to establish the
systematic error associated to this pollution.
