The freezing mechanism, recently suggested for a monodisperse hard-disk fluid
[Huerta et al., Phys. Rev. E, 2006, 74, 061106] is extended here to an
equimolar binary hard-disk mixtures. We are showing that for diameter ratios,
smaller than 1.15 the global orientational order parameter of the binary
mixture behaves like in the case of a monodisperse fluid. Namely, by increasing
the disk number density there is a tendency to form a crystalline-like phase.
However, for diameter ratios larger than 1.15 the binary mixtures behave like a
disordered fluid. We use some of the structural and thermodynamic properties to
compare and discuss the behavior as a function of diameter ratio and packing
fraction.
