We describe in detail how the different components of a multi-phase transport
(AMPT) model, that uses the Heavy Ion Jet Interaction Generator (HIJING) for
generating the initial conditions, Zhang's Parton Cascade (ZPC) for modeling
partonic scatterings, the Lund string fragmentation model or a quark
coalescence model for hadronization, and A Relativistic Transport (ART) model
for treating hadronic scatterings, are improved and combined to give a coherent
description of the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. We also
explain the way parameters in the model are determined, and discuss the
sensitivity of predicted results to physical input in the model. Comparisons of
these results to experimental data, mainly from heavy ion collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), are then made in order to extract
information on the properties of the hot dense matter formed in these
collisions.
