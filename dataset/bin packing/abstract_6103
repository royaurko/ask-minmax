The gp-->etap reaction has been measured with the Crystal Ball and TAPS
multiphoton spectrometers in the energy range from the production threshold of
707 MeV to 1.4 GeV (1.49 =< W >= 1.87 GeV). Bremsstrahlung photons produced by
the 1.5-GeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI-C and momentum analyzed
by the Glasgow Tagging Spectrometer were used for the eta-meson production. Our
accumulation of 3.8 x 10^6 gp-->etap-->3pi0p-->6gp events allows a detailed
study of the reaction dynamics. The gp-->etap differential cross sections were
determined for 120 energy bins and the full range of the production angles. Our
data show a dip near W = 1680 MeV in the total cross section caused by a
substantial dip in eta production at forward angles. The data are compared to
predictions of previous SAID and MAID partial-wave analyses and to thelatest
SAID and MAID fits that have included our data.
