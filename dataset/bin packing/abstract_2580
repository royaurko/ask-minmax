With the step-and-stare approach of the K2 mission, Kepler will be able to
observe a large number of Cepheid an RR Lyrae stars. In this paper we describe
the target selection efforts, and the first impressions based on the K2
two-wheel engineering test data. We also summarize the scientific goals that
can be achieved by Kepler, including the understanding of the various
additional modes and the Blazhko effect, population studies and the
possibilities to observe extragalactic stars in selected campaigns.
