Probabilistic range query (PRQ) over uncertain moving objects has attracted
much attentions in recent years. Most of existing works focus on the PRQ for
objects moving freely in two-dimensional (2D) space. In contrast, this paper
studies the PRQ over objects moving {in a constrained 2D space} where objects
are forbidden to be located in some specific areas. We dub it the constrained
space probabilistic range query (CSPRQ). We analyse its unique properties and
show that to process the CSPRQ using a straightforward solution is infeasible.
The key idea of our solution is to use a strategy called
\textit{pre-approximation} that can reduce the initial problem to a highly
simplified version, implying that it makes the rest of steps easy to tackle. In
particular, this strategy itself is pretty simple and easy to implement.
Furthermore, motivated by the cost analysis, we further optimize our solution.
The optimizations are mainly based on two insights: (\romannumeral 1) the
number of \textit{effective subdivision}s is no more than 1; and (\romannumeral
2) an entity with the larger \textit{span} is more likely to subdivide a single
region. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches through extensive experiments under various experimental settings,
and highlight an extra finding, i.e., the precomputation based approach suffers
a non-trivial preprocessing time, which offers an important indication sign for
the future research.
