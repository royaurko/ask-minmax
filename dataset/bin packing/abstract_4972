We measured the bias and correlation factor of galaxies with respect to the
dark matter using the aperture statistics including the aperture mass from weak
gravitational lensing. The analysis was performed for three galaxy samples
selected by R-band magnitudes; the median redshifts of the samples were
$\ave{z}=0.34,0.49$ and 0.65, respectively. The brightest sample has the
strongest peak in redshift and can therefore be most accurately represented by
a single redshift. The data used is the GaBoDS, and the COMBO-17 survey for an
accurate estimate of the redshift distribution of the galaxies. Assuming the
currently favoured $\Lambda\rm CDM$ model as cosmology, we obtained values for
the linear stochastic galaxy-dark matter bias on angular scales
$1^\prime\le\theta\le20^\prime$. Averaging the measurements for the bias over
the range $4^\prime\le \theta_{\rm ap}\le 18^\prime$, weighting with the cosmic
variance error, yields $b=0.89(5), 0.79(5), 0.89(5)$, respectively ($1\sigma$).
As for the correlation factor $r$ we see, as Hoekstra et al. (2002), a slight
increase to $r=1$ in the last angular bin from an almost constant value on
smaller scales; the weighted average here over the same range as before is
$r=0.8(1), 0.8(1), 0.5(1)$, respectively (abridged).
