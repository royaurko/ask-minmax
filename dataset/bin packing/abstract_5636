The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are used to study the evolution of the
luminosity function of red and blue galaxies to $z \sim 1$. Schechter function
fits show that, since $z = 1$, $M^*_B$ dims by $\sim$ 1.3 mag per unit redshift
for both color classes, $\phi^*$ of blue galaxies shows little change, while
$\phi^*$ for red galaxies has formally nearly quadrupled. At face value, the
number density of blue galaxies has remained roughly constant since $ z = 1$,
whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. Luminosity densities support both
conclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our data
and local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest.
We discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after $z = 1$
from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the properties
of local and distant E/S0s. We suggest a ``mixed'' scenario in which some blue
galaxies have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to the
red sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence in
one or more purely stellar mergers. E/S0s of a given mass today will have
formed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain the
fundamental plane and other local scaling laws.
