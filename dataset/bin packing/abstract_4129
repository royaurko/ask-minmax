Magnetization and its relaxation have been measured on Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 single
crystals with Tc = 39 K. The magnetization hysteresis loops (MHLs) exhibit flux
jumps in the low temperature region, and a second peak-effect in the
intermediate temperature region, especially when the field sweeping rate is
low. Interestingly a third magnetization peak can be easily observed on the
MHLs in the high temperature region. Further analysis find that the first
magnetization peak is very sharp, which is associated with the strong vortex
pinning. However the first dip of the MHL corresponds to a moderate relaxation
rate, then a second peak appears accompanied by a vanishing vortex motion.
Finally a third magnetization peak emerges and the vortex motion becomes
drastic beyond this threshold. The novel features accompanying the second
magnetization peak suggest a new type of vortex phase transition.
