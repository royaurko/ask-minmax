Volume of metric balls relates to rate-distortion theory and packing bounds
on codes. In this paper, the volume of balls in complex Grassmann manifolds is
evaluated for an arbitrary radius. The ball is defined as a set of hyperplanes
of a fixed dimension with reference to a center of possibly different
dimension, and a generalized chordal distance for unequal dimensional subspaces
is used. First, the volume is reduced to one-dimensional integral
representation. The overall problem boils down to evaluating a determinant of a
matrix of the same size as the subspace dimensionality. Interpreting this
determinant as a characteristic function of the Jacobi ensemble, an asymptotic
analysis is carried out. The obtained asymptotic volume is moreover refined
using moment-matching techniques to provide a tighter approximation in
finite-size regimes. Lastly, the pertinence of the derived results is shown by
rate-distortion analysis of source coding on Grassmann manifolds.
