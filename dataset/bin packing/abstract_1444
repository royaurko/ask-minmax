Plutonium dihydride and trihydride show strikingly similar crystal structures
when viewed as close-packed Pu planes with ABC and AB stacking, respectively.
The similarity serves as a framework for density functional theory (DFT)
calculations of PuH2, PuH3, and intermediate compositions. Agreement between
structures observed in experiment and in the DFT description of the Pu-H system
requires accounting for the strong electronic correlation in the f orbitals,
achieved here with the addition of a Hubbard parameter U. The hysteresis
measured between hydriding and dehydriding can be attributed to the effect of
stacking of the close-packed Pu planes on the energy as a function of
stoichiometry, calculated using the GGA+U approach. Changes in the interstitial
positions occupied by the H atoms affect the energy by amounts that are
negligible compared to room temperature; changes in the magnetic structure lead
to equally small energy differences.
