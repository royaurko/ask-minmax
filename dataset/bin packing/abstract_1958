A brief report is presented on the effect of viscoelastic losses in a high
density contrast sonic band-gap material of close-packed rubber spheres in air.
The scattering properties of such a material are computed with an on-shell
multiple scattering method, properties which are compared with the lossless
case. The existence of an appreciable omnidirectional gap in the transmission
spectrum, when losses are present, is also reported.
