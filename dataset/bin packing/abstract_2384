The electromagnetic corrections to the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons
$\pi$ and $K$ are considered. We calculate in chiral perturbation theory the
contributions which arise from resonances within a photon loop at order $O(e^2
m_q)$. Within this approach we find rather moderate deviations to Dashen's
theorem.
