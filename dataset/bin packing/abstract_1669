We study the cluster combinatorics of $d-$cluster tilting objects in
$d-$cluster categories. By using mutations of maximal rigid objects in
$d-$cluster categories which are defined similarly for $d-$cluster tilting
objects, we prove the equivalences between $d-$cluster tilting objects, maximal
rigid objects and complete rigid objects. Using the chain of $d+1$ triangles of
$d-$cluster tilting objects in [IY], we prove that any almost complete
$d-$cluster tilting object has exactly $d+1$ complements, compute the extension
groups between these complements, and study the middle terms of these $d+1$
triangles. All results are the extensions of corresponding results on cluster
tilting objects in cluster categories established in [BMRRT] to $d-$cluster
categories. They are applied to the Fomin-Reading's generalized cluster
complexes of finite root systems defined and studied in [FR2] [Th] [BaM1-2],
and to that of infinite root systems [Zh3].
