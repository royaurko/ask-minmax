Monte Carlo simulations at constant pressure are performed to study
coexistence and interfacial properties of the liquid-solid transition in hard
spheres and in colloid-polymer mixtures. The latter system is described as a
one-component Asakura-Oosawa (AO) model where the polymer's degrees of freedom
are incorporated via an attractive part in the effective potential for the
colloid-colloid interactions. For the considered AO model, the polymer
reservoir packing fraction is eta_p^r=0.1 and the colloid-polymer size ratio is
q=sigma_p/\sigma=0.15 (with sigma_p and sigma the diameter of polymers and
colloids, respectively). Inhomogeneous solid-liquid systems are prepared by
placing the solid fcc phase in the middle of a rectangular simulation box
creating two interfaces with the adjoined bulk liquid. By analyzing the growth
of the crystalline region at various pressures and for different system sizes,
the coexistence pressure p_co is obtained, yielding p_co=11.576 k_BT/sigma^3
for the hard sphere system and p_co=8.0 k_BT/sigma^3 for the AO model (with k_B
the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature). Several order parameters are
introduced to distinguish between solid and liquid phases and to describe the
interfacial properties. From the capillary-wave broadening of the solid-liquid
interface, the interfacial stiffness is obtained for the (100) crystalline
plane, giving the values gamma=0.49 k_BT/sigma^2 for the hard-sphere system and
gamma=0.95 k_BT/sigma^2 for the AO model.
