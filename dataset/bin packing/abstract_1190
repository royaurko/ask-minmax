We present a numerical analysis of the effect of particle elongation on the
quasistatic behavior of sheared granular media by means of the Contact Dynamics
method. The particle shapes are rounded-cap rectangles characterized by their
elongation. The macroscopic and microstructural properties of several packings
subjected to biaxial compression are analyzed as a function of particle
elongation. We find that the shear strength is an increasing linear function of
elongation. Performing an additive decomposition of the stress tensor based on
a harmonic approximation of the angular dependence of branch vectors, contact
normals and forces, we show that the increasing mobilization of friction force
and the associated anisotropy are key effects of particle elongation. These
effects are correlated with partial nematic ordering of the particles which
tend to be oriented perpendicular to the major principal stress direction and
form side-to-side contacts. However, the force transmission is found to be
mainly guided by cap-to-side contacts, which represent the largest fraction of
contacts for the most elongated particles. Another interesting finding is that,
in contrast to shear strength, the solid fraction first increases with particle
elongation, but declines as the particles become more elongated. It is also
remarkable that the coordination number does not follow this trend so that the
packings of more elongated particles are looser but more strongly connected.
