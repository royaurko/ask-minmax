For each of the notions of hypergraph quasirandomness that have been studied,
we identify a large class of hypergraphs F so that every quasirandom hypergraph
H admits a perfect F-packing. An informal statement of a special case of our
general result for 3-uniform hypergraphs is as follows. Fix an integer r >= 4
and 0<p<1. Suppose that H is an n-vertex triple system with r|n and the
following two properties:
  * for every graph G with V(G)=V(H), at least p proportion of the triangles in
G are also edges of H,
  * for every vertex x of H, the link graph of x is a quasirandom graph with
density at least p.
  Then H has a perfect $K_r^{(3)}$-packing. Moreover, we show that neither
hypotheses above can be weakened, so in this sense our result is tight. A
similar conclusion for this special case can be proved by Keevash's hypergraph
blowup lemma, with a slightly stronger hypothesis on H.
