In this communication, a simple mechanism in the optional public goods game
is experimentally investigated using two experimental settings; and first time,
the cyclic strategy pattern in full state space is demonstrated by means of
velocity. It is, furthermore, elaborated that the strategies of cooperation,
defection and nonparticipant form a Rock-Paper-Scissors type cycle, and the
cycle of three strategies are persistent over 200 rounds. This cycle is very
similar to the cycle given by evolutionary dynamics e.g. replicator dynamics.
The mechanism that nonparticipant can sustain cooperation is driven by the
Rock-Paper-Scissors type of cyclic dominance in the three strategies. That is,
if the cycle is existent, the cooperation will always sustain. Meanwhile, the
distribution of social states changes in the state space and from cooperation
as the most frequent strategy to defection and, from defection to
nonparticipant, forms a clear rotation path in a long run. These results seem
to implicate that the evolutionary dynamics has ability to capture the real
dynamics applying not only on biosphere, but also on human society.
