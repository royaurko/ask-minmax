Hydrodynamical simulations of two giant planets embedded in a gaseous disk
have shown that in case of a smooth convergent migration they end up trapped
into a mean motion resonance. These findings have led to the conviction that
the onset of dynamical instability causing close encounters between the planets
can occur only after the dissipation of the gas when the eccentricity damping
is over. We show that a system of three giant planets may undergo planet-planet
scattering when the gaseous disk, with density values comparable to that of the
Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, is still interacting with the planets. The
hydrodynamical code FARGO--2D--1D is used to model the evolution ofthe disk and
planets, modified to properly handle close encounters between the massive
bodies. Our simulations predict a variety of different outcomes of the
scattering phase which includes orbital exchange, planet merging and scattering
of a planet in a hyperbolic orbit. This implies thatthe final fate of a
multiplanet system under the action of the disk torques is not necessarily a
packed resonant configuration.
