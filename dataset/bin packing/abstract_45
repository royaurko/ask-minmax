We propose a stronger formulation of the precedence constraints and the
station limits for the simple assembly line balancing problem. The linear
relaxation of the improved integer program theoretically dominates all previous
formulations using impulse variables, and produces solutions of significantly
better quality in practice. The improved formulation can be used to strengthen
related problems with similar restrictions. We demonstrate their effectiveness
on the U-shaped assembly line balancing problem and on the bin packing problem
with precedence constraints.
