We investigate the possible existence of a high-redshift (z=1) cluster of
galaxies associated with the QSO lens system MG2016+112. From an ultra-deep R-
and less deep V- and I-band Keck images and a K-band mosaic from UKIRT, we
detect ten galaxies with colors consistent with the lensing galaxy within
225h^{-1} kpc of the z=1.01 lensing galaxy. This represents an overdensity of
more than ten times the number density of galaxies with similar colors in the
rest of the image. We also find a group of seven much fainter objects closely
packed in a group only 27h^{-1} kpc north-west of the lensing galaxy. We
perform a weak lensing analysis on faint galaxies in the R-band image and
detect a mass peak of a size similar to the mass inferred from X-ray
observations of the field, but located 64" northwest of the lensing galaxy.
  From the weak lensing data we rule out a similar sized mass peak centered on
the lensing galaxy at the 2 sigma level.
