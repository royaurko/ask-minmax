In this paper, we will first introduce a novel multiscale representation
(MSR) for shapes. Based on the MSR, we will then design a surface inpainting
algorithm to recover 3D geometry of blood vessels. Because of the nature of
irregular morphology in vessels and organs, both phantom and real inpainting
scenarios were tested using our new algorithm. Successful vessel recoveries are
demonstrated with numerical estimation of the degree of arteriosclerosis and
vessel occlusion.
