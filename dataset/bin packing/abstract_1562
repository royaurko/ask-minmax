It is argued that a standard measurement of multiplicities in proton-proton
collisions is sufficient to construct a single nucleon fragmentation function.
A proposed method is based on measurement of mean values of produced particles
<n> and pairs of particles <n(n-1)> in symmetric and asymmetric bins
