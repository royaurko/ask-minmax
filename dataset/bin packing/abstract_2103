We say that a $k$-uniform hypergraph $C$ is a Hamilton cycle of type $\ell$,
for some $1\le \ell \le k$, if there exists a cyclic ordering of the vertices
of $C$ such that every edge consists of $k$ consecutive vertices and for every
pair of consecutive edges $E_{i-1},E_i$ in $C$ (in the natural ordering of the
edges) we have $|E_{i-1}\setminus E_i|=\ell$. We define a class of
$(\e,p)$-regular hypergraphs, that includes random hypergraphs, for which we
can prove the existence of a decomposition of almost all edges into type $\ell$
Hamilton cycles, where $\ell<k/2$.
