Light-harvesting complexes of purple bacteria have two properties that are
thought to contribute to the efficiency of their exciton transport: an energy
funnel that directs excitons towards the reaction centre as well as substantial
excitonic delocalisation, which can enhance transport through supertransfer. To
determine the relative importance of these two features, we compared models of
the light-harvesting apparatus with thousands of counterfactual situations in
which the extent of delocalisation and the energy landscape were altered. We
find that the influence of delocalisation is usually minor and sometimes
deleterious, especially when compared to the decisive importance of a funnel in
the energy landscape. Consequently, delocalisation is most likely a side-effect
of the dense chlorophyll packing that evolved to increase light absorption per
reaction centre.
