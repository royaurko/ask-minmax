Many Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) profiles acquired in dry aeolian
environment have shown good reflectivity inside present-day dunes. We show that
the origin of this reflectivity is related to changes in grain size
distribution, packing and/or grain shape in a sandy material. We integrate
these three parameters into analytical models for bulk permittivity in order to
predict the reflections and the velocity of GPR waves. We consider two GPR
cross-sections acquired over Aeolian dunes in the Chadian desert. The 2D
migration of GPR data suggests that dunes contain different kinds of bounding
surfaces. We discuss and model three kinds of reflections using reasonable
geological hypothesis about Aeolian sedimentation processes. The propagation
and the reflection of radar waves are calculated using the 1D wavelet modelling
method in spectral domain. The results of the forward modelling are in good
accordance with real observed data.
