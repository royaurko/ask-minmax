The dynamic behaviors of microRNA and mRNA under external stress are studied
with biological experiments and mathematics models. In this study, we developed
a mathematic model to describe the biological phenomenon and for the first time
reported that, as responses to external stress, the expression levels of
microRNA and mRNA sustained oscillation. And the period of the oscillation is
much shorter than several reported transcriptional regulation negative feedback
loop.
