The Chandra X-ray observatory monitored the single cool star, AB Doradus,
continuously for a period lasting 88ksec (1.98 Prot) in 2002 December with the
LETG/HRC-S. The X-ray lightcurve shows significant rotational modulation. It
can be represented as having a flat level of emission superimposed with bright
flaring regions that appear at the same phases in both rotation cycles.
Phase-binned OVIII line profiles show centroid shifts that also repeat in
consecutive rotation cycles. These Doppler shifts trace a roughly sinusoidal
pattern with a a semi-amplitude of 30 +/-10km/s. By taking both the lightcurve
and spectral diagnostics into account along with constraints on the rotational
broadening of line profiles (provided by archival Chandra HETG FeXVII line
profiles) we can construct a simple model of the X-ray corona. The corona can
be described as having two components, one component is homogeneously
distributed, extending less than 1.75R*; and the other consists of at least two
compact emitting regions near the stellar surface. These compact regions
account for 16% of the X-ray emission and are likely to be located less than
0.4R* above the stellar surface.
