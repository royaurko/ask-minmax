Recent analyses of XMM and Chandra data of the cores of X-ray bright clusters
of galaxies show that modeling with a multi-phase gas in which several
temperatures and densities are in equilibrium might not be appropriate.
Instead, a single-phase model seems able to reproduce properly the spectra
collected in annuli from the central region. The measured single-phase
temperature profiles indicate a steep positive gradient in the central 100-200
kpc and the gas density shows a flat profile in the central few tens of kpc.
Given this observational evidence, we estimate the contribution to the
projected-on-the-sky rings from the cluster emissivity as function of the shell
volume fraction sampled. We show that the observed projected X-ray emission
mimics the multi-phase status of the plasma even though the input distribution
is single-phase. This geometrical projection affects (i) analyses of data where
insufficient spatial resolution is accessible, (ii) the central bin when its
dimension is comparable to the extension of any flatness in the central gas
density profile.
