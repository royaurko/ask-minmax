By using laboratory experimental data, we test the uncertainty of social
strategy transitions in various competing environments of fixed paired
two-person constant sum $2 \times 2$ games. It firstly shows that, the
distributions of social strategy transitions are not erratic but obey the
principle of the maximum entropy (MaxEnt). This finding indicates that human
subject social systems and natural systems could have wider common backgrounds.
