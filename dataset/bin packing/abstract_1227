The hard sphere model is known to show a liquid-solid phase transition, with
the solid expected to be either face centered cubic or hexagonal close packed.
The difference in free energy between the two structures is very small and
various attempts have been made to determine which one is the more stable. We
contrast the different approaches and extend one.
