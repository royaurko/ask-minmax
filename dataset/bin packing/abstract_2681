The light curves of 252 B-star candidates in the Kepler data base are
analyzed in a similar fashion to that done by Balona et al. (2011) to further
characterize B star variability, increase the sample of variable B stars for
future study, and to identify stars whose power spectra include particularly
interesting features such as frequency groupings. Stars are classified as
either constant light emitters, $\beta$ Cep stars, slowly pulsating B stars,
hybrid pulsators, binaries or stars whose light curves are dominated by
rotation (Bin/Rot), hot subdwarfs, or white dwarfs. One-hundred stars in our
sample were found to be either light contants or to be variable at a level of
less than 0.02 mmag. We increase the number of candidate B-star variables found
in the Kepler data base by Balona et al. (2011) in the following fashion:
$\beta$ Cep stars from 0 to 10, slowly pulsating B stars from 8 to 54, hybrid
pulsators from 7 to 21, and Bin/Rot stars from 23 to 82. For comparison
purposes, approximately 51 SPBs and 6 hybrids had been known prior to 2007. The
number of $\beta$ Cep stars known prior to 2004 was 93. A secondary result of
this study is the identification of an additional 11 pulsating white dwarf
candidates, four of which possess frequency groupings.
