We carry out a finite size scaling analysis of the jamming transition in
frictionless bi-disperse soft core disks in two dimensions. We consider two
different jamming protocols: (i) quench from random initial positions, and (ii)
quasistatic shearing. By considering the fraction of jammed states as a
function of packing fraction for systems with different numbers of particles,
we determine the spatial correlation length critical exponent $\nu\approx 1$,
and show that corrections to scaling are crucial for analyzing the data. We
show that earlier numerical results yielding $\nu<1$ are due to the improper
neglect of these corrections.
