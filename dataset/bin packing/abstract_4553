Unpolarized and beam-polarized four-fold cross sections $\frac{d^4
\sigma}{dQ^2 dx_B dt d\phi}$ for the $ep\to e^\prime p^\prime \gamma$ reaction
were measured using the CLAS detector and the 5.75-GeV polarized electron beam
of the Jefferson Lab accelerator, for 110 ($Q^2,x_B,t$) bins over the widest
phase space ever explored in the valence-quark region. Several models of
Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) describe the data well at most of our
kinematics. This increases our confidence that we understand the GPD $H$,
expected to be the dominant contributor to these observables. Through a
leading-twist extraction of Compton Form Factors, these results reveal a
tomographic image of the nucleon.
