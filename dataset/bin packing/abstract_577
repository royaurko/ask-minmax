Thurston's circle packing approximation of the Riemann Mapping (proven to
give the Riemann Mapping in the limit by Rodin-Sullivan) is largely based on
the theorem that any topological disk with a circle packing metric can be
deformed into a circle packing metric in the disk with boundary circles
internally tangent to the circle. The main proofs of the uniformization use
hyperbolic volumes (Andreev) or hyperbolic circle packings (by Beardon and
Stephenson). We reformulate these problems into a Euclidean context, which
allows more general discrete conformal structures and boundary conditions. The
main idea is to replace the disk with a double covered disk with one side
forced to be a circle and the other forced to have interior curvature zero. The
entire problem is reduced to finding a zero curvature structure. We also show
that these curvatures arise naturally as curvature measures on generalized
manifolds (manifolds with multiplicity) that extend the usual discrete
Lipschitz-Killing curvatures on surfaces.
