Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity on the heterointerface
$LaAlO_{3}/SrTiO_{3}$, we theoretically investigate its local electronic
structures near an impurity considering the influence of Rashba-type spin-orbit
interaction (RSOI) originated in the lack of inversion symmetry. We find that
local density of states near an impurity exhibits the in-gap resonance peaks
due to the quasiparticle scattering on the Fermi surface with the reversal sign
of the pairing gap caused by the mixed singlet and RSOI-induced triplet
superconducting state. We also analyze the evolutions of density of states and
local density of states with the weight of triplet pairing component determined
by the strength of RSOI, which will be widely observed in thin films of
superconductors with surface or interface-induced RSOI, or various
noncentrosymmetric superconductors in terms of point contact tunneling and
scanning tunneling microscopy, and thus reveal an admixture of the spin singlet
and RSOI-induced triplet superconducting states.
