We discuss a model of non perturbative decay of dark energy into hot and cold
dark matter. This model provides a mechanism from the field theory to realize
the energy transfer from dark energy into dark matter, which is the requirement
to alleviate the coincidence problem. The advantage of the model is the fact
that we accommodate a mean life compatible with the age of the universe. We
also argue that supersymmetry is a natural set up, though not essential.
