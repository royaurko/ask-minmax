A comprehensive survey of event-by-event fluctuations of charged hadron
multiplicity in relativistic heavy ions is presented. The survey covers Au+Au
collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 62.4 and 200 GeV, and Cu+Cu collisions sqrt(s_NN) =
22.5, 62.4, and 200 GeV. Fluctuations are measured as a function of collision
centrality, transverse momentum range, and charge sign. After correcting for
non-dynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations in the collision geometry within
a centrality bin, the remaining dynamical fluctuations expressed as the
variance normalized by the mean tend to decrease with increasing centrality.
The dynamical fluctuations are consistent with or below the expectation from a
superposition of participant nucleon-nucleon collisions based upon p+p data,
indicating that this dataset does not exhibit evidence of critical behavior in
terms of the compressibility of the system. An analysis of Negative Binomial
Distribution fits to the multiplicity distributions demonstrates that the heavy
ion data exhibit weak clustering properties.
