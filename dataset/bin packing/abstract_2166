For a graph $G$ and a positive integer $c$, let $\chi_{l}(G,c)$ be the
minimum value of $k$ such that one can properly color the vertices of $G$ from
any lists $L(v)$ such that $|L(v)|=k$ for all $v\in V(G)$ and $|L(u)\cap
L(v)|\leq c$ for all $uv\in E(G)$. Kratochv\'{i}l et al. asked to determine
$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \chi_{l}(K_n,c)/\sqrt{cn}$, if exists. We prove
that the limit exists and equals 1. We also find the exact value of
$\chi_{l}(K_n,c)$ for infinitely many values of $n$.
