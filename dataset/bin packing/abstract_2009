A series of phase diagrams is obtained for a smooth pair-potential with an
outer well and a repulsive inner shoulder. Condensed phase coexistence curves
are located using free-energy calculations. Liquid-vapour equilibria are
obtained with multicanonical methods. As the depth of the outer well is
increased, a simple-hexagonal to close packed transition appears in the solid
leading to a discontinuity in the slope of the melting curve. For deeper wells
the simple hexagonal melting temperature exhibits a maximum with respect to
pressure. The onset of the predicted metastable isostructural transition is
studied. It is shown that this does not persist into the supercooled liquid.
The relevence of these findings to models of supercooled water is discussed.
