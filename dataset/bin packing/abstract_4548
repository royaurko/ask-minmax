The nonlinear dynamic behavior of a magnetic skyrmion in circular nanodots
was studied numerically by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a
classical spin model. We show that a skyrmion core reversal can be achieved
within nanoseconds using a perpendicular oscillating magnetic field. Two
symmetric switching processes that correspond to excitations of the breathing
mode and the mixed mode (combination of the breathing mode and a radial
spin-wave mode) are identified. For excitation of the breathing mode, the
skyrmion core switches through nucleation of a new core from a transient
uniform state. In the mixed mode, the skyrmion core reverses with the help of
spins excited both at the edge and core regions. Unlike the magnetic vortex
core reversal, the excitation of radial spin waves does not dominate the
skyrmion core reversal process.
