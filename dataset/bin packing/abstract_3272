We employ state-of-the-art ab initio simulations within the dynamical
mean-field theory to study three likely phases of iron (hexogonal close-packed,
hcp, face centered cubic, fcc, and body centered cubic, bcc) at the Earth's
core conditions. We demonstrate that the correction to the electronic free
energy due to correlations can be significant for the relative stability of the
phases. The strongest effect is observed in bcc Fe, which shows a non-Fermi
liquid behaviour, and where a Curie-Weiss behaviour of the uniform
susceptbility hints at a local magnetic moment still existing at 5800 K and 300
GPa. We predict that all three structures have sufficiently high magnetic
susceptibility to stabilize the geodynamo.
