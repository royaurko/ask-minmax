We present an analysis of the first far-ultraviolet observations of the SW
Sextantis-type cataclysmic variable DW Ursae Majoris, obtained in November 2001
with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. The time-averaged spectrum of
DW UMa shows a rich assortment of emission lines (plus some contamination from
interstellar absorption lines including molecular hydrogen). Accretion disk
model spectra do not provide an adequate fit to the far-ultraviolet spectrum of
DW UMa. We constructed a light curve by summing far-ultraviolet spectra
extracted in 60-sec bins; this shows a modulation on the orbital period, with a
maximum near photometric phase 0.93 and a minimum half an orbit later. No other
periodic variability was found in the light curve data. We also extracted
spectra in bins spanning 0.1 in orbital phase; these show substantial variation
in the profile shapes and velocity shifts of the emission lines during an
orbital cycle of DW UMa. Finally, we discuss possible physical models that can
qualitatively account for the observed far-ultraviolet behavior of DW UMa, in
the context of recent observational evidence for the presence of a
self-occulting disk in DW UMa and the possibility that the SW Sex stars may be
the intermediate polars with the highest mass transfer rates and/or weakest
magnetic fields.
