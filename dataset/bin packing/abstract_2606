This is another proof of the same result in [9]. Let $X_0$ be a generic
quintic hypersurface in $\mathbf P^4$ over $\mathbb C$ and $c_0$ a regular map
$\mathbf P^1\to X_0$ that is generically one-to-one to its image. In this
paper, we show
  (1) $c_0$ must be an immersion, i.e. the differential $(c_0)_\ast:
T_{t}\mathbf P^1 \to T_{c_0(t)} X_0$ is injective at each $t\in \mathbf P^1$,
  (2) the normal bundle of $c_0$ satisfies
  $$H^1(N_{c_0/X_0})=0.$$
