We study the orbit of $\mathbb{R}$ under the Bianchi group
$\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$, where $K$ is an imaginary quadratic
field. The orbit, called a Schmidt arrangement $\mathcal{S}_K$, is a geometric
realisation, as an intricate circle packing, of the arithmetic of $K$. This
paper presents several examples of this phenomenon. First, we show that the
curvatures of the circles are integer multiples of $\sqrt{-\Delta}$ and
describe the curvatures of tangent circles in terms of the norm form of
$\mathcal{O}_K$. Second, we show that the circles themselves are in bijection
with certain ideal classes in orders of $\mathcal{O}_K$, the conductor being a
certain multiple of the curvature. This allows us to count circles with class
numbers. Third, we show that the arrangement of circles is connected if and
only if $\mathcal{O}_K$ is Euclidean. These results are meant as foundational
for a study of a new class of thin groups generalising Apollonian groups, in a
companion paper.
