Classical hard spheres crystallize at equilibrium at high enough density.
Crystals made up of stackings of 2-dimensional hexagonal close-packed layers
(e.g. fcc, hcp, etc.) differ in entropy by only about $10^{-3}k_B$ per sphere
(all configurations are degenerate in energy). To readily resolve and study
these small entropy differences, we have implemented two different
multicanonical Monte Carlo algorithms that allow direct equilibration between
crystals with different stacking sequences. Recent work had demonstrated that
the fcc stacking has higher entropy than the hcp stacking. We have studied
other stackings to demonstrate that the fcc stacking does indeed have the
highest entropy of ALL possible stackings. The entropic interactions we could
detect involve three, four and (although with less statistical certainty) five
consecutive layers of spheres. These interlayer entropic interactions fall off
in strength with increasing distance, as expected; this fall-off appears to be
much slower near the melting density than at the maximum (close-packing)
density. At maximum density the entropy difference between fcc and hcp
stackings is $0.00115 +/- 0.00004 k_B$ per sphere, which is roughly 30% higher
than the same quantity measured near the melting transition.
