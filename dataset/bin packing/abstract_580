We numerically simulate mechanically stable packings of soft-core,
frictionless, bidisperse disks in two dimensions, above the jamming packing
fraction $\phi_J$. For configurations with a fixed isotropic global stress
tensor, we compute the averages, variances, and correlations of conserved
quantities (stress $\Gamma_{\cal C}$, force-tile area $A_{\cal C}$, Voronoi
volume $V_{\cal C}$, number of particles $N_{\cal C}$, and number of small
particles $N_{s{\cal C}}$) on compact subclusters of particles ${\cal C}$, as a
function of the cluster size and the global system stress. We find several
significant differences depending on whether the cluster ${\cal C}$ is defined
by a fixed radius $R$ or a fixed number of particles $M$. We comment on the
implications of our findings for maximum entropy models of jammed packings.
