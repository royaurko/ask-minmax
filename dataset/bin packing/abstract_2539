This paper is prepared as a contribution to the proceedings after the 12th
ICSSUR/Feynfest Conference held in Foz do Iguacu (Brazil) from 2 to 6 May 2011.
In the first part I briefy report the topic of entropic uncertainty relations
for position and momentum variables. Then I investigate the discrete Shannon
entropies related to the case of fnite number of detectors set to measure
probability distributions in position and momentum spaces. I derive an
uncertainty relation for the sum of the Shannon entropies which generalizes
previous approaches [Phys. Lett. 103 A, 253 (1984)] based on an infnite number
of detectors (bins).
