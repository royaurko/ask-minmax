The dynamics of isolated-photon plus jet production in pp collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV has been studied with the ATLAS detector at the
LHC using an integrated luminosity of 37 pb-1. Measurements of isolated-photon
plus jet bin-averaged cross sections are presented as functions of photon
transverse energy, jet transverse momentum and jet rapidity. In addition, the
bin-averaged cross sections as functions of the difference between the
azimuthal angles of the photon and the jet, the photon--jet invariant mass and
the scattering angle in the photon--jet centre-of-mass frame have been
measured. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations are compared to the
measurements and provide a good description of the data, except for the case of
the azimuthal opening angle.
