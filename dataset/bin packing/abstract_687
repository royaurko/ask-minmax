When submitted to gentle mechanical taps a granular packing slowly compacts
until it reaches a stationary state that depends on the tap characteristics.
The properties of such stationary states are experimentally investigated. The
influence of the initial state, taps properties and tapping protocol are
studied. The compactivity of the packings is determinated. Our results strongly
support the idea that the stationary states are genuine thermodynamic states.
