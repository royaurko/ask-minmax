The ATLAS experiment measures yields of isolated photons and of Z and W
bosons via leptonic decay modes in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=2.76 TeV. The
data samples used in the analysis were obtained in the year 2010 and year 2011
LHC runs and correspond to 5 ub-1 and 0.15 nb-1 of integrated luminosity
respectively. The measured yields of all bosons are consistent with the scaling
proportional to the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions. The transverse
momentum distributions are measured for isolated photons and for Z bosons for
different centrality bins. The shapes of measured distributions do not change
with centrality. The transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of Z boson
are consistent in shape with Pythia model and the second harmonic coefficient
of the azimuthal distribution of Z bosons with respect to the event plane is
consistent with zero.
