We describe the design, operation, and performance of a new high-speed
infrared photometer using the Solid-State Photomultiplier (SSPM) detector. The
SSPM was developed by Rockwell International Science Center and has
single-photon counting capability over the 0.4-28 micron wavelength range,
intrinsic time response of order 1 ns, and low detector noise (Petroff, 1987).
We have operated a 200x200-micron back-illuminated SSPM in a liquid-helium
cooled dewar with a room-temperature transimpedance amplifier output. Single
photon pulses can be easily distinguished above the amplifier noise. The
individual photon pulses are binned at a selectable time resolution ranging
from $5 \mu$s to 64 ms, and then written to Exabyte tape. In the first
astronomical application of such a device, we have made observations of the
Crab Nebula pulsar and Her X-1 at near-infrared wavelengths (J-, H-, and
K-bands), and we present the instrument sensitivities established by these
observations. We discuss other astronomical observations which are either
planned or currently underway. Finally, we present design specifications and
predicted performances for a second-generation SSPM high-speed infrared
photometer.
