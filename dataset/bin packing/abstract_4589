Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising multiplexing approach to
achieve high system capacity. In this paper, we develop a novel iterative
detection and decoding scheme for SCMA systems combined with Low-density
Parity-check (LDPC) decoding. In particular, we decompose the output of the
message passing algorithm (MPA) based SCMA multiuser detection into intrinsic
part and prior part. Then we design a joint detection and decoding scheme which
iteratively exchanges the intrinsic information between the detector and the
decoder, yielding a satisfied performance gain. Moreover, the proposed scheme
has almost the same complexity compared to the traditional receiver for
LDPC-coded SCMA systems. As numerical results demonstrate, the proposed scheme
has a substantial gain over the traditional SCMA receiver on AWGN channels and
Rayleigh fading channels.
