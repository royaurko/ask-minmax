We present a numerical study on ground state properties of a one-dimensional
(1D) general Hubbard model (GHM) with particle-assisted tunnelling rates and
repulsive on-site interaction (positive-U), which describes fermionic atoms in
an anisotropic optical lattice near a wide Feshbach resonance. For our
calculation, we utilize the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm,
which is an extension of the density matrix renormalization group and provides
a well-controlled method for 1D systems. We show that the positive-U GHM, when
hole-doped from half-filling, exhibits a phase with coexistence of
quasi-long-range superfluid and charge-density-wave orders. This feature is
different from the property of the conventional Hubbard model with positive-U,
indicating the particle-assisted tunnelling mechanism in GHM brings in
qualitatively new physics.
