We present experimental measurements of dynamical heterogeneities in a dense
system of microgel spheres, sheared at different rates and at different packing
fractions in a microfluidic channel, and visualized with high speed digital
video microscopy. A four-point dynamic susceptibility is deduced from video
correlations, and is found to exhibit a peak that grows in height and shifts to
longer times as the jamming transition is approached from two different
directions. In particular, the time for particle-size root-mean square relative
displacements is found to scale as $\tau^* \sim (\dot \gamma \Delta
\phi^4)^{-1}$ where $\dot\gamma$ is the strain rate and
$\Delta\phi=|\phi-\phi_c|$ is the distance from the random close packing volume
fraction. The typical number of particles in a dynamical heterogeneity is
deduced from the susceptibility peak height and found to scale as $n^* \sim
(\dot \gamma \Delta \phi^4)^{-0.3}$. Exponent uncertainties are less than ten
percent. We emphasize that the same power-law behavior is found at packing
fractions above and below $\phi_c$. Thus, our results considerably extend a
previous observation of $n^* \sim \dot\gamma^{-0.3}$ for granular heap flow at
fixed packing below $\phi_c$. Furthermore, the implied result $n^*\sim
(\tau^*)^{0.3}$ compares well with expectation from mode-coupling theory and
with prior observations for driven granular systems.
