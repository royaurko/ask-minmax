Using the recently obtained holographic cosmic duality, we reached a
reasonable quantitative agreement between predictions of the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation at small l and the WMAP observations, showing the power of
the holographic idea. We also got constraints on the dark energy and its
behaviour as a function of the redshift upon relating it to the small l CMB
spectrum. For a redshift independent dark energy, our constraint is consistent
with the supernova results, which again shows the correctness of the cosmic
duality prescription. We have also extended our study to the redshift
dependence of the dark energy.
