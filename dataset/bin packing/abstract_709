It is shown that there is no quasi-sphere packing of the lattice grid Z^{d+1}
or a co-compact hyperbolic lattice of H^{d+1} or the 3-regular tree \times Z,
in R^d, for all d. A similar result is proved for some other graphs too. Rather
than using a direct geometrical approach, the main tools we are using are from
non-linear potential theory.
