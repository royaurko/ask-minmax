We evaluate thermodynamic, geometric and dynamic properties of a short-ranged
square well binary mixture to provide a coherent picture of this simple, but
rich, model for colloidal interactions. In particular, we compare the location,
in the temperature-packing fraction plane, of the geometrical percolation
locus, the metastable liquid-gas spinodal and the glass transition lines. Such
comparison provides evidence that the gel-state can not be related to the
attractive glass transition line directly. Indications are given for the
possibility of an indirect link between the two, via an arrested phase
separation process. We finally discuss the possibility that a spherical short
range attraction may not be sufficient to produce an equilibrium cluster phase
at low packing fraction and low temperatures.
