Packing problems in discrete geometry can be modeled as finding independent
sets in infinite graphs where one is interested in independent sets which are
as large as possible. For finite graphs one popular way to compute upper bounds
for the maximal size of an independent set is to use Lasserre's semidefinite
programming hierarchy. We generalize this approach to infinite graphs. For this
we introduce topological packing graphs as an abstraction for infinite graphs
coming from packing problems in discrete geometry. We show that our hierarchy
converges to the independence number.
