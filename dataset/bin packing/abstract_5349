The ESA Gaia mission, to be launched during 2013, will observe billions of
objects, among which many galaxies, during its scanning of the sky. This will
provide a large space-based dataset with unprecedented spatial resolution.
Because of its natural Galactic and Astrometric priority, Gaia's observational
strategy was optimized for point sources. Nonetheless, it is expected that 10^6
sources will be extragalactic, and a large portion of them will be angularly
small galaxies. Although the mission was designed for point sources, a
dedicated analysis of the raw data will allow the recovery of morphology of
those objects at a 0.2" level. This may constitute a unique all-sky survey of
such galaxies. We describe the conceptual design of the method we created for
performing the morphological analysis of these objects as well as first results
obtained from data simulations of low-resolution, highly binned, satellite
data. Based on the obtained results we conclude that it is possible to push the
limits of the Gaia space mission by analyzing galaxy morphology. (Abridged)
