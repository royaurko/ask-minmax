The doping effect of Sr and transition metals Mn, Fe, Co into the direct-gap
semiconductor LaZnAsO has been investigated. Our results indicate that the
single phase ZrCuSiAs-type tetragonal crystal structure is preserved in
(La1-xSrx)(Zn1-xTMx)AsO (TM = Mn, Fe, Co) with the doping level up to x = 0.1.
While the system remains semiconducting, doping with Sr and Mn results in
ferromagnetic order with TC ~ 30K, and doping with Sr and Fe results in a spin
glass like state below ~6K with a saturation moment of ~0.02 muB/Fe, an order
of magnitude smaller than the ~0.4 muB/Mn of Sr and Mn doped samples. The same
type of magnetic state is observed neither for (Zn,Fe) substitution without
carrier doping, nor for Sr and Co doped specimens.
