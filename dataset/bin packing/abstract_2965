We perform event-driven molecular dynamics simulations of a system composed
by uniaxial hard ellipsoids for different values of the aspect-ratio and
packing fraction . We compare the molecular orientational-dependent structure
factors previously calculated within the Percus-Yevick approximation with the
numerical results. The agreement between theoretical and numerical results is
rather satisfactory. We also show that, for specific orientational quantities,
the molecular structure factors are sensitive to the particle shape and can be
used to distinguish prolate from oblate ellipsoids. A first-order theoretical
expansion around the spherical shape and a geometrical analysis of the
configurations confirms and explains such an observation.
