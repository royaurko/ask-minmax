We present a new method for the treatment of extended-core states in the
linearized augmented plane wave method (LAPW) where the usual LAPW basis set is
supplemented by basis functions of the tight binding type, which go to zero
with zero derivative at the sphere boundary and are linear independent of the
standard LAPW basis functions. These supplemented tight binding basis functions
appear as a result of a plane wave augmentation by two different radial wave
components constructed at two different energies (referring to valence and
semicore states) of linear expansion. We discuss properties of such additional
tight binding basis functions and apply the extended basis set for computation
of electron energy bands of lanthanum (face and body centered structures) and
hexagonal close packed lattice of cadmium. We also discuss the relation between
the present method and other variational approaches.
