We describe an FPGA-based, 96-channel, time-to-digital converter (TDC)
intended for use with the Central Outer Tracker (COT) in the CDF Experiment at
the Fermilab Tevatron. The COT system is digitized and read out by 315 TDC
cards, each serving 96 wires of the chamber. The TDC is physically configured
as a 9U VME card. The functionality is almost entirely programmed in firmware
in two Altera Stratix FPGA's. The special capabilities of this device are the
availability of 840 MHz LVDS inputs, multiple phase-locked clock modules, and
abundant memory. The TDC system operates with an input resolution of 1.2 ns.
Each input can accept up to 7 hits per collision. The time-to-digital
conversion is done by first sampling each of the 96 inputs in 1.2-ns bins and
filling a circular memory; the memory addresses of logical transitions (edges)
in the input data are then translated into the time of arrival and width of the
COT pulses. Memory pipelines with a depth of 5.5 $\mu$s allow deadtime-less
operation in the first-level trigger. The TDC VME interface allows a 64-bit
Chain Block Transfer of multiple boards in a crate with transfer-rates up to 47
Mbytes/sec. The TDC also contains a separately-programmed data path that
produces prompt trigger data every Tevatron crossing. The full TDC design and
multi-card test results are described. The physical simplicity ensures
low-maintenance; the functionality being in firmware allows reprogramming for
other applications.
