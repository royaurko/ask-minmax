Radial velocity and transit surveys indicate that solar-type stars bear
super-Earths, with mass and period up to ~ 20 M_E and a few months, are more
common than those with Jupiter-mass gas giants. In many cases, these
super-Earths are members of multiple-planet systems in which their mutual
dynamical interaction has influenced their formation and evolution. In this
paper, we modify an existing numerical population synthesis scheme to take into
account protoplanetary embryos' interaction with their evolving natal gaseous
disk, as well as their close scatterings and resonant interaction with each
other. We show that it is possible for a group of compact embryos to emerge
interior to the ice line, grow, migrate, and congregate into closely-packed
convoys which stall in the proximity of their host stars. After the disk-gas
depletion, they undergo orbit crossing, close scattering, and giant impacts to
form multiple rocky Earths or super-Earths in non-resonant orbits around ~
0.1AU with moderate eccentricities of ~0.01-0.1. We suggest that most
refractory super-Earths with period in the range of a few days to weeks may
have formed through this process. These super-Earths differ from Neptune-like
ice giants by their compact sizes and lack of a substantial gaseous envelope.
