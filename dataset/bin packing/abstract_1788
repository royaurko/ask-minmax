Blind-source separation techniques are used to extract the transmission
spectrum of the hot-Jupiter HD189733b recorded by the Hubble/NICMOS instrument.
Such a 'blind' analysis of the data is based on the concept of independent
component analysis. The de-trending of Hubble/NICMOS data using the sole
assumption that nongaussian systematic noise is statistically independent from
the desired light-curve signals is presented. By not assuming any prior, nor
auxiliary information but the data themselves, it is shown that spectroscopic
errors only about 10 - 30% larger than parametric methods can be obtained for
11 spectral bins with bin sizes of ~0.09 microns. This represents a reasonable
trade-off between a higher degree of objectivity for the non-parametric methods
and smaller standard errors for the parametric de-trending. Results are
discussed in the light of previous analyses published in the literature. The
fact that three very different analysis techniques yield comparable spectra is
a strong indication of the stability of these results.
