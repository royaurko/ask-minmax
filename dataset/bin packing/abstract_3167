We measure the permeability of a fluidized bed of monodispersed bubbles with
soap solution characteristic of mobile and non-mobile interfaces. These
experimental data extend the permeability curves previously published for foam
in the dry limit. In the wet limit, these data join the permeability curves of
a hard sphere suspension at porosity equal to 0.4 and 0.6 in the cases of
mobile and non-mobile interfaces respectively. We show that the model of
permeability proposed by Kozeny and Carman and originally validated for packed
beds of spheres (with porosity around 0.4) can be successfully applied with no
adjustable parameters to liquid fractions from 0.001 up to 0.85 for systems
made of monodisperse and deformable entities with non-mobile interfaces.
