We study the ground state (GS) and the phase transition in a
hexagonal-close-packed lattice with both XY and Ising models by using extensive
Monte Carlo simulation. We suppose the in-plane interaction $J_1$ and
inter-plane interaction $J_2$, both antiferromagnetic. The system is frustrated
with two kinds of GS configuration below and above a critical value of
$\eta=J_1/J_2$ ($\eta_c$). For the Ising case, one has $\eta_c=0.5$ which
separates in-plane ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, while for the XY
case $\eta_c=1/3$ separates the collinear and non collinear spin
configurations. The phase transition is shown to be of first (second) order for
$\eta> (<) \eta_c$. The spin resistivity is calculated for the Ising case. It
shows a rounded maximum at the magnetic transition in the second-order region,
and a discontinuity in the first-order region of $\eta$.
