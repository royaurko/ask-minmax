We present results for the 2m spectroscopic part of the MultiSite
Spectroscopic Telescope campaign, which took place in May/June 2002. In order
to perform an asteroseismological analysis on the multiperiodic pulsating
subdwarf B star PG 1605+072 we used over 150 hours of time resolved
spectroscopy in order to search for and analyse line profile variations by
using phase binning. We succeeded in finding variations in effective
temperature and gravity for four modes. A pilot analysis using the
\textit{BRUCE} and \textit{KYLIE} programs and assuming strong rotation and low
inclination favours models with $l=1$ or $l=2$ with $m\leq0$.
