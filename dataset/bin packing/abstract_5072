We report the discovery of the most-distant double-peaked emitter, CXOECDFS
J033115.0-275518, at z=1.369. A Keck/DEIMOS spectrum shows a clearly
double-peaked broad Mg II $\lambda2799$ emission line, with FWHM 11000 km/s for
the line complex. The line profile can be well fit by an elliptical
relativistic Keplerian disk model. This is one of a handful of double-peaked
emitters known to be a luminous quasar, with excellent multiwavelength coverage
and a high-quality X-ray spectrum. CXOECDFS J033115.0-275518 is a radio-loud
quasar with two radio lobes (FR II morphology) and a radio loudness of f_{5
GHz}/f_{4400 \AA}~429. The X-ray spectrum can be modeled by a power law with
photon index 1.72 and no intrinsic absorption; the rest-frame 0.5-8.0 keV
luminosity is $5.0\times10^{44}$ erg/s. The spectral energy distribution (SED)
of CXOECDFS J033115.0-275518 has a shape typical for radio-loud quasars and
double-peaked emitters at lower redshift. The local viscous energy released
from the line-emitting region of the accretion disk is probably insufficient to
power the observed line flux, and external illumination of the disk appears to
be required. The presence of a big blue bump in the SED along with the
unexceptional X-ray spectrum suggest that the illumination cannot arise from a
radiatively inefficient accretion flow.
