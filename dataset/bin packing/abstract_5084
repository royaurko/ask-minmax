We consider a three-terminal state-dependent relay channel with the channel
state noncausally available at only the relay. Such a model may be useful for
designing cooperative wireless networks with some terminals equipped with
cognition capabilities, i.e., the relay in our setup. In the discrete
memoryless (DM) case, we establish lower and upper bounds on channel capacity.
The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme at the relay that uses a
combination of codeword splitting, Gel'fand-Pinsker binning, and
decode-and-forward relaying. The upper bound improves upon that obtained by
assuming that the channel state is available at the source, the relay, and the
destination. For the Gaussian case, we also derive lower and upper bounds on
the capacity. The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme at the relay that
uses a combination of codeword splitting, generalized dirty paper coding, and
decode-and-forward relaying; the upper bound is also better than that obtained
by assuming that the channel state is available at the source, the relay, and
the destination. In the case of degraded Gaussian channels, the lower bound
meets with the upper bound for some special cases, and, so, the capacity is
obtained for these cases. Furthermore, in the Gaussian case, we also extend the
results to the case in which the relay operates in a half-duplex mode.
