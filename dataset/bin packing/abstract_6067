The exclusive electroproduction of $\pi^+$ above the resonance region was
studied using the $\rm{CEBAF}$ Large Acceptance Spectrometer ($\rm{CLAS}$) at
Jefferson Laboratory by scattering a 6 GeV continuous electron beam off a
hydrogen target. The large acceptance and good resolution of $\rm{CLAS}$,
together with the high luminosity, allowed us to measure the cross section for
the $\gamma^* p \to n \pi^+$ process in 140 ($Q^2$, $x_B$, $t$) bins:
$0.16<x_B<0.58$, 1.6 GeV$^2<$$Q^2$$<4.5$ GeV$^2$ and 0.1 GeV$^2<$$-t$$<5.3$
GeV$^2$. For most bins, the statistical accuracy is on the order of a few
percent. Differential cross sections are compared to two theoretical models,
based either on hadronic (Regge phenomenology) or on partonic (handbag diagram)
degrees of freedom. Both can describe the gross features of the data reasonably
well, but differ strongly in their ingredients. If the handbag approach can be
validated in this kinematical region, our data contain the interesting
potential to experimentally access transversity Generalized Parton
Distributions.
