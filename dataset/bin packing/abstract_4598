The ATLAS Collaboration announced a 3$\sigma$ excess in the
leptonic-$Z+jets+\met$ channel. We show that such an excess can be interpreted
in the extension of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM)
with a heavy Dirac gluino and light squarks. The abundant $Z$ bosons can be
produced by light squark pair productions with the subsequent decays $\tilde{q}
\to q \tilde{\chi}_2^0 \to q Z \tilde{\chi}_1^0$. We investigate the relevant
parameter space by considering the constraints from both the ATLAS and CMS
direct SUSY searches. Our model can provide sufficient $Z$-signal events in
large parameter space if only the ATLAS searches are considered. After
combining the ATLAS and CMS searches, the maximal number of signal events can
still reach about 15, which is within the $1\sigma$ region of the observed
excess. For comparison, we study the conventional low energy NMSSM with a
Majorana gluino and its maximal number of signal events are about 11, although
we cannot realize such model in the known supersymmetry breaking scenarios.
