Asymptotic equivalence theory developed in the literature so far are only for
bounded loss functions. This limits the potential applications of the theory
because many commonly used loss functions in statistical inference are
unbounded. In this paper we develop asymptotic equivalence results for robust
nonparametric regression with unbounded loss functions. The results imply that
all the Gaussian nonparametric regression procedures can be robustified in a
unified way. A key step in our equivalence argument is to bin the data and then
take the median of each bin. The asymptotic equivalence results have
significant practical implications. To illustrate the general principles of the
equivalence argument we consider two important nonparametric inference
problems: robust estimation of the regression function and the estimation of a
quadratic functional. In both cases easily implementable procedures are
constructed and are shown to enjoy simultaneously a high degree of robustness
and adaptivity. Other problems such as construction of confidence sets and
nonparametric hypothesis testing can be handled in a similar fashion.
