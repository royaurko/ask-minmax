Two-pion correlation functions are analyzed at mid-rapidity for three systems
(14.6 A-GeV Si+Al, Si+Au, and 11.6 A-GeV Au+Au), seven distinct centrality
conditions, and different kT bins in the range 0.1--0.5 GeV/c. Source reference
frames are determined from fits to the Yano-Koonin source parameterization.
Bertsch-Pratt radius parameters are shown to scale linearly with both number of
projectile and total participants as obtained from a Glauber model calculation.
A finite emission duration that increases linearly with system/centrality is
also reported. The mT dependence of the Bertsch-Pratt radii is measured for the
central Si+Au and Au+Au systems. The system/centrality dependence is
investigated separately for both high and low mT regions.
