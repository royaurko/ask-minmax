We develop a general holographic superconductor away from the probe limit by
considering the corrections both in the gravity and in the gauge matter fields.
We find the consistent effects of the high curvature correction in the gravity,
the nonlinear correction in the gauge matter field and the backreaction on the
dynamics of bulk AdS background and boundary CFT. They all have the effect to
protect the stability of the bulk spacetime and hinder the formation of the
scalar hair condensation on the boundary.
