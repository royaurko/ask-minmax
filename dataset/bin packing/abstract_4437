The jet fragmentation function of inclusive jets with transverse momentum pt
above 100 GeV in PbPb collisions has been measured using reconstructed charged
particles with pt above 1 GeV in a cone of radius 0.3 around the jet axis. A
data sample of PbPb collisions collected in 2011 at a nucleon-nucleon
center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 150 inverse microbarns is used. The results for PbPb collisions
as a function of collision centrality and jet transverse momentum are compared
to reference distributions based on pp data collected at the same
center-of-mass energy in 2013, with an integrated luminosity of 5.3 inverse
picobarns. A centrality-dependent modification of the fragmentation function is
found. For the most central collisions, a significant enhancement is observed
in the PbPb / pp fragmentation function ratio for charged particles with pt
less than 3 GeV. This enhancement is observed for all jet pt bins studied.
