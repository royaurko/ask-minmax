New conjectures are proposed on the numbers of FPL configurations pertaining
to certain types of link patterns. Making use of the Razumov and Stroganov
Ansatz, these conjectures are based on the analysis of the ground state of the
Temperley-Lieb chain, for periodic boundary conditions and so-called
``identified connectivities'', up to size $2n=22$.
