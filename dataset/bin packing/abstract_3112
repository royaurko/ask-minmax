Close-packed, classical dimer models on three-dimensional, bipartite lattices
harbor a Coulomb phase with power-law correlations at infinite temperature.
Here, we discuss the nature of the thermal phase transition out of this Coulomb
phase for a variety of dimer models which energetically favor crystalline dimer
states with columnar ordering. For a family of these models we find a direct
thermal transition from the Coulomb phase to the dimer crystal. While some
systems exhibit (strong) first-order transitions in correspondence with the
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, we also find clear numerical evidence for
continuous transitions. A second family of models undergoes two consecutive
thermal transitions with an intermediate paramagnetic phase separating the
Coulomb phase from the dimer crystal. We can describe all of these phase
transitions in one unifying framework of candidate field theories with two
complex Ginzburg-Landau fields coupled to a U(1) gauge field. We derive the
symmetry-mandated Ginzburg-Landau actions in these field variables for the
various dimer models and discuss implications for their respective phase
transitions.
