The Background Emission Anisotropy Scanning Telescope (BEAST) is a 2.2m
off-axis telescope with an 8 element mixed Q (38-45GHz) and Ka (26-36GHz) band
focal plane, designed for balloon borne and ground based studies of the Cosmic
Microwave Background. Here we present the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
angular power spectrum calculated from 682 hours of data observed with the
BEAST instrument. We use a binned pseudo-Cl estimator (the MASTER method). We
find results that are consistent with other determinations of the CMB
anisotropy for angular wavenumber l between 100 and 600. We also perform
cosmological parameter estimation. The BEAST data alone produces a good
constraint on Omega_k = 1-Omega_tot=-0.074 +/- 0.070, consistent with a flat
Universe. A joint parameter estimation analysis with a number of previous CMB
experiments produces results consistent with previous determinations.
