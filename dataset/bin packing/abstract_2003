We analyze the phase diagram of a model of hard spheres of chemical radius
one, which is defined over a generalized Bethe lattice containing short loops.
We find a liquid, two different crystalline, a glassy and an unusual
crystalline glassy phase. Special attention is also paid to the close-packing
limit in the glassy phase. All analytical results are cross-checked by
numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.
