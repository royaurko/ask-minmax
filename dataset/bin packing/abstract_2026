This paper investigates general properties of codes with the rank metric. We
first investigate asymptotic packing properties of rank metric codes. Then, we
study sphere covering properties of rank metric codes, derive bounds on their
parameters, and investigate their asymptotic covering properties. Finally, we
establish several identities that relate the rank weight distribution of a
linear code to that of its dual code. One of our identities is the counterpart
of the MacWilliams identity for the Hamming metric, and it has a different form
from the identity by Delsarte.
