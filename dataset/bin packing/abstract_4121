In recent years, many chemical reactions have been studied by means of the
quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method within the Gaussian binning (GB)
procedure. The latter consists in "quantizing" the final vibrational actions in
Bohr spirit by putting strong emphasis on the trajectories reaching the
products with vibrational actions close to integer values. A major drawback of
this procedure is that if N is the number of product vibrational modes, the
amount of trajectories necessary to converge the calculations is ~ 10^N larger
than with the standard QCT method. Applying it to polyatomic processes is thus
problematic. In a recent paper, however, Czako and Bowman propose to quantize
the total vibrational energy instead of the vibrational actions [G. Czako and
J. M. Bowman, J. Chem. Phys., 131, 244302 (2009)], a procedure called 1GB here.
The calculations are then only ~ 10 times more time-consuming than with the
standard QCT method, allowing thereby for considerable numerical saving. In
this paper, we propose some theoretical arguments supporting the 1GB procedure
and check its validity on model test cases as well as the prototype four-atom
reaction OH+D_2 -> HOD+D.
