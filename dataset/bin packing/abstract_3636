The expansion center Universe (ECU) gives a dipole anisotropy to the Hubble
ratio, at any Hubble depth D. After a long series of successful dipole tests,
here is a crucial multiple dipole test at z bins centred on the mean <z>=z0=1,
or Hubble depth D=c/H0, and based on data from SCP Union & Union2 compilation.
Table 5abc lists data of two main samples, with 48 SCPU SNe Ia and 58 SCPU2 SNe
Ia respectively. The confirmed dipole anisotropy, shown by 6 primary sample
tests and by another 27 from 9 encapsulated z bins with DL=D(1+z) assumed and
the Hubble Magnitude definition, gives a model independent result, in full
accordance with the expansion center model (ECM). That means a maximum cz range
of about 50000 km/s at the central redshift z0=1. As a complement to the dipole
tests, here is a new computation of the relativistic deceleration parameter q0,
based on the extrapolated total M spread, that is the deviation of the Hubble
Magnitude M of high-z SCP Union supernovae at a normal or central redshift
<z>=z0=z << 1 from the absolute magnitude M0 at z0=0 (cf. parallel paper XVI).
A total M spread according to ECM is derived from 249 high-z SCPU SNe listed in
paper XVI. In a concordance test with the expansion center model, the obtained
new relativistic q0 agrees with the value q0=+2 inferred from the ECM paper I
eq. (41), when R0 is the proper distance at t0 of the expansion center from the
Galaxy.
