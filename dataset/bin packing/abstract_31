In this paper we propose an improved approximation scheme for the Vector Bin
Packing problem (VBP), based on the combination of (near-)optimal solution of
the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation and a greedy (modified first-fit)
heuristic. The Vector Bin Packing problem of higher dimension (d \geq 2) is not
known to have asymptotic polynomial-time approximation schemes (unless P = NP).
  Our algorithm improves over the previously-known guarantee of (ln d + 1 +
epsilon) by Bansal et al. [1] for higher dimensions (d > 2). We provide a
{\theta}(1) approximation scheme for certain set of inputs for any dimension d.
More precisely, we provide a 2-OPT algorithm, a result which is irrespective of
the number of dimensions d.
