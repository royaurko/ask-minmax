In this paper a new supernova catalogue containing data for 5526
extragalactic supernovae that were discovered up to 2010 December 31 is
presented. It combines several catalogues that are currently available online
in a consistent and traceable way. During the comparison of the catalogues
inconsistent entries were identified and resolved where possible. Remaining
inconsistencies are marked transparently and can be easily identified. Thus it
is possible to select a high-quality sample in a most simple way. Where
available, redshift-based distance estimates to the supernovae were replaced by
journal-refereed distances. Examples of statistical studies that are now
possible with this new catalogue are presented in this paper.
