We revisit the question of whether or not one can perform reliable
semiclassical QCD computations at zero temperature. We study correlation
functions with no perturbative contributions, and organize the problem by means
of the operator product expansion, establishing a precise criterion for the
validity of a semiclassical calculation. For $N_f>N$, a systematic computation
is possible; for $N_f<N$, it is not. $N_f=N$ is a borderline case. In our
analysis, we see explicitly the exponential suppression of instanton effects at
large $N$. As an application, we describe a test of QCD lattice gauge theory
computations in the chiral limit.
