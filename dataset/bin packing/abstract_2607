We study the lepton forward-backward asymmetry AFB and the longitudinal K*
polarization FL, as well as an observable P2 derived from them, in the rare
decays B->K*l+l-, where l+l- is either e+e- or mu+mu-, using the full sample of
471 million BBbar events collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Babar
detector at the PEP-II e+e- collider. We separately fit and report results for
the B+->K*+l+l- and B0->K*0l+l- final states, as well as their combination
B->K*l+l-, in five disjoint dilepton mass-squared bins. An angular analysis of
B+->K*+l+l- decays is presented here for the first time.
