We report high pressure magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity
measurements on Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystals up to 60 kbar. These
measurements allow us to follow the evolution of the superconducting critical
temperature T_c, the resistivity anomaly temperature T*, the superconducting
coherence length and the Fermi velocity under pressure. The
pressure-temperature phase diagram constructed for Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} shows a
dome-shaped pressure dependence of T_c. The initial rise in T_c, which is
accompanied by a decrease in T*, is consistent with a reduction in the partial
gapping of the Fermi surface under pressure.
