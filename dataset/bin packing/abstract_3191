We study the feasibility of fabricating an optical link for the SLHC ATLAS
silicon tracker based on the current pixel optical link architecture. The
electrical signals between the current pixel modules and the optical modules
are transmitted via micro-twisted cables. The optical signals between the
optical modules and the data acquisition system are transmitted via
radiation-hard/low-bandwidth SIMM fibres fusion spliced to
radiation-tolerant/medium-bandwidth GRIN fibres. The link has several nice
features. We have measured the bandwidths of the micro twisted-pair cables to
be ~ 1 Gb/s and the fusion spliced fibre ribbon to be ~ 2 Gb/s. We have
irradiated PIN and VCSEL arrays with 24 GeV protons and find the arrays can
operate up to the SLHC dosage. We have also demonstrated the feasibility of
fabricating a novel opto-pack for housing VCSEL and PIN arrays with BeO as the
substrate.
