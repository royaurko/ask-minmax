If C is a clutter with n vertices and q edges whose clutter matrix has column
vectors V={v1,...,vq}, we call C an Ehrhart clutter if {(v1,1),...,(vq,1)} is a
Hilbert basis. Letting A(P) be the Ehrhart ring of P=conv(V), we are able to
show that if A is the clutter matrix of a uniform, unmixed MFMC clutter C, then
C is an Ehrhart clutter and in this case we provide sharp bounds on the
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of A(P). Motivated by the Conforti-Cornuejols
conjecture on packing problems, we conjecture that if C is both ideal and the
clique clutter of a perfect graph, then C has the MFMC property. We prove this
conjecture for Meyniel graphs, by showing that the clique clutters of Meyniel
graphs are Ehrhart clutters. In much the same spirit, we provide a simple proof
of our conjecture when C is a uniform clique clutter of a perfect graph. We
close with a generalization of Ehrhart clutters as it relates to total dual
integrality.
