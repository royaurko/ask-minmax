We introduce a novel algorithm to perform event-driven simulations of hard
rigid bodies of arbitrary shape, that relies on the evaluation of the geometric
distance. In the case of a monodisperse system of uniaxial hard ellipsoids,we
perform molecular dynamics simulations varying the aspect-ratio X0 and the
packing fraction phi. We evaluate the translational Dtrans and the rotational
Drot diffusion coefficient and the associated isodiffusivity lines in the
phi-X0 plane. We observe a decoupling of the translational and rotational
dynamics which generates an almost perpendicular crossing of the Dtrans and
Drot isodiffusivity lines. While the self intermediate scattering function
exhibits stretched relaxation, i.e. glassy dynamics, only for large phi and X0
about equals to 1, the second order orientational correlator C2(t) shows
stretching only for large and small X0 values. We discuss these findings in the
context of a possible pre-nematic order driven glass transition.
