Data collected during three years with a germanium spectrometer at the Sierra
Grande underground laboratory have been analyzed for distinctive features of
annual modulation of the signal induced by WIMP dark matter candidates. The
main motivation for this analysis was the recent suggestion by the DAMA/NaI
Collaboration that a yearly modulation signal could not be rejected at the 90%
confidence level when analyzing data obtained with a high-mass low-background
scintillator detector. We performed two different analyses of the data: First,
the statistical distribution of modulation-significance variables (expected
from an experiment running under the conditions of Sierra Grande) was compared
with the same variables obtained from the data. Second, the data were analyzed
in energy bins as an independent check of the first result and to allow for the
possibility of a crossover in the expected signal. In both cases no
statistically significant deviation from the null result was found, which could
support the hypothesis that the data contain a modulated component. A plot is
also presented to enable the comparison of these results to those of the DAMA
collaboration.
