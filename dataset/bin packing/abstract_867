We numerically produce fully amorphous assemblies of frictionless spheres in
three dimensions and study the jamming transition these packings undergo at
large volume fractions. We specify four protocols yielding a critical value for
the jamming volume fraction which is sharply defined in the limit of large
system size, but is different for each protocol. Thus, we directly establish
the existence of a continuous range of volume fraction where nonequilibrium
jamming transitions occur. However, these jamming transitions share the same
critical behaviour. Our results suggest that, even in the absence of partial
crystalline ordering, a unique location of a random close packing does not
exist, and that volume fraction alone is not sufficient to describe the
properties of jammed states.
