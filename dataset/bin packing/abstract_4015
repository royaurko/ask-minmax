In a macroscopic realm, in which photons are too many for being counted by
any photon counting detector, photon statistics can be measured by using
detectors simply endowed with linear response. We insert one of such detectors
in a conventional photon-counting apparatus, which returns a voltage every time
the detector responds to light by generating a number of elementary charges via
its primary photo-detection process. We only assume that, when a single charge
is photo-generated, the probability density of the voltages is a distribution
that is narrow with respect to its mean value. Under this hypothesis the output
voltages can be suitably binned so that their probability distribution is the
same as that of the photo-generated charges, that is, of the detected photons.
