The shape and the intensity of the 6.4 keV iron line bring unique information
on the geometrical and physical properties of the supermassive black hole and
the surrounding accreting gas at the very center of Active Galactic Nuclei.
While there are convincing evidences of a relativistically broadened iron line
in a few nearby bright objects, their properties at larger distances are
basically unknown. We have searched for the presence of iron line by fully
exploiting Chandra observations in the deep fields. The line is clearly
detected in the average spectra of about 250 sources stacked in several
redshift bins over the range z=0.5-4.0. We discuss their average properties
with particular enphasys on the presence and intensity of a broad component.
