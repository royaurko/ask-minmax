This letter proposes an analytical approach to formulate the power system
oscillation frequency under a large disturbance. A fact is revealed that the
oscillation frequency is only the function of the oscillation amplitude when
the system's model and operating condition are fixed. Case studies also show
that this function is damping-insensitive and could be applied to an inter-area
model of a multi-machine power system.
