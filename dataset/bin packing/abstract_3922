Distinct entropy definitions have been used to obtain an inverse correlation
between the residual size and entropy for Heavy Ion Collisions. This explains
the existence of several temperatures for different residual size bins, as
reported elsewhere (Natowitz et. al., 2002). HIC collisions were simulated
using binary interaction LATINO model where Pandharipande potential replicates
internucleonic interaction. System temperature is defined as the temperature
obtained when Kinetic Gas Theory is applied to the nucleons in the participant
region. Fragments are detected with an Early Cluster Recognition Algorithm that
optimizes the partitions in energy space.
