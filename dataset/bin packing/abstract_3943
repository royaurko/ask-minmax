The strength of charged particle forward-backward multiplicity correlation in
pbar+p and p+p collisions at s^1/2 = 200 GeV is studied by PYTHIA 6.4 and
compared to the UA5 and STAR data correspondingly. It is turned out that a
factor of 3-4 apparent discrepancy between UA5 and STAR data can be attributed
to the differences in detector acceptances and observing bin interval in both
experiments. A mixed event method is introduced and used to calculate the
statistical correlation strength and the dynamical correlation strengths
stemming from the charge conservation, four- momentum conservation, and decay,
respectively. It seems that the statistical correlation is much larger than
dynamical one and the charge conservation, four-momentum conservation and decay
may account for most part of the dynamical correlation. In addition, we have
also calculated the correlation strength by fitting the charged particle
multiplicity distribution from PYTHIA to the Negative Binomial Distribution and
found that the result agrees well with the correlation strength calculated by
mixed events.
