A class of simple superposition models based on the Glauber picture of
multiple collisions is compared with the data on the centrality dependence of
the multiplicity distributions in a central rapidity bin. We show how the
results depend on the specific assumptions concerning the distributions in the
number of participants and their relations to the distributions of the number
of produced hadrons in various phase space bins. None of the versions of the
model describes satisfactorily the centrality dependence of the scaled
dispersion.
