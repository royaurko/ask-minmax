We report a systematic investigation on c-axis point-contact Andreev
reflection (PCAR) in BaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_x$As$_2$ superconducting single crystals
from underdoped to overdoped regions (0.075 $\leq x\leq 0.15$). At optimal
doping ($x=0.1$) the PCAR spectrum feature the structures of two
superconducting gap and electron-boson coupling mode. In the $s\pm$ scenario,
quantitative analysis using a generalized Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK)
formalism with two gaps: one isotropic and another angle dependent, suggest a
nodeless state in strong-coupling limit with gap minima on the Fermi surfaces.
Upon crossing above the optimal doping ($x > 0.1$), the PCAR spectrum show an
in-gap sharp narrow peak at low bias, in contrast to the case of underdoped
samples ($x < 0.1$), signaling the onset of deepened gap minima or nodes in the
superconducting gap. This result provides evidence of the modulation of the gap
amplitude with doping concentration, consistent with the calculations for the
orbital dependent pair interaction mediated by the antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations.
