Neutron scattering is used to probe magnetic excitations in
FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} (T_c=14 K). Low energy spin fluctuations are found with a
characteristic wave vector $(0.5,0.5,L)$ that corresponds to Fermi surface
nesting and differs from Q_m=(\delta,0,0.5) for magnetic ordering in
Fe_{1+y}Te. A spin resonance with \hbar\Omega_0=6.5 meV \approx 5.3 k_BT_c and
\hbar\Gamma=1.25 meV develops in the superconducting state from a normal state
continuum. We show that the resonance is consistent with a bound state
associated with s+/- superconductivity and imperfect quasi-2D Fermi surface
nesting.
