We use the automorphism group $Aut(H)$, of holes in the lattice
$L_8=A_2\oplus A_2\oplus D_4$, as the starting point in the construction of
sphere packings in 10 and 12 dimensions. A second lattice, $L_4=A_2\oplus A_2$,
enters the construction because a subgroup of $Aut(L_4)$ is isomorphic to
$Aut(H)$. The lattices $L_8$ and $L_4$, when glued together through this
relationship, provide an alternative construction of the laminated lattice in
twelve dimensions with kissing number 648. More interestingly, the action of
$Aut(H)$ on $L_4$ defines a pair of invariant planes through which dense,
non-lattice packings in 10 dimensions can be constructed. The most symmetric of
these is aperiodic with center density 1/32. These constructions were prompted
by an unexpected arrangement of 378 kissing spheres discovered by a search
algorithm.
