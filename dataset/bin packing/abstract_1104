Barrier coverage is a critical issue in wireless sensor networks for many
practical applications,e.g., national border monitoring, security surveillance
and intruder detection, etc. Its aim is to detect intruders that attempt to
cross the protected region. In this paper, we study how to efficiently improve
barrier coverage using mobile camera sensors, where camera sensors are deployed
by a grid-based strategy.
