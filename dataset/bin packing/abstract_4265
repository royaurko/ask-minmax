A grid of ATLAS9 model atmospheres has been computed, spanning 3500 K <=
T_eff <= 8000 K, 0.0 <= log g <= 5.0, -4.0 <= [M/H] <= 0.0, and -0.8 <
[alpha/Fe] <= +1.2. These parameters are appropriate for stars in the red giant
branch, subgiant branch, and the lower main sequence. The main difference from
a previous, similar grid (Castelli & Kurucz 2003) is the range of [alpha/Fe]
values. A grid of synthetic spectra, calculated from the model atmospheres, is
also presented. The fluxes are computed every 0.02 Angstrom from 6300 Angstrom
to 9100 Angstrom. The microturbulent velocity is given by a relation to the
surface gravity. This relation is appropriate for red giants, but not for
subgiants or dwarfs. Therefore, caution is urged for the synthetic spectra with
log g > 3.5 or for any star that is not a red giant. Both the model atmosphere
and synthetic spectrum grids are available online through VizieR. Applications
of these grids include abundance analysis for large samples of stellar spectra
and constructing composite spectra for stellar populations.
