This paper proves a corner occupying theorem for the two-dimensional integral
rectangle packing problem, stating that if it is possible to orthogonally place
n arbitrarily given integral rectangles into an integral rectangular container
without overlapping, then we can achieve a feasible packing by successively
placing an integral rectangle onto a bottom-left corner in the container. Based
on this theorem, we might develop efficient heuristic algorithms for solving
the integral rectangle packing problem. In fact, as a vague conjecture, this
theorem has been implicitly mentioned with different appearances by many people
for a long time.
