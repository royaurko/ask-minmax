We study numerically and analytically a model of self-propelled polar disks
on a substrate in two dimensions. The particles interact via isotropic
repulsive forces and are subject to rotational noise, but there is no aligning
interaction. As a result, the system does not exhibit an ordered state. The
isotropic fluid phase separates well below close packing and exhibits the large
number fluctuations and clustering found ubiquitously in active systems. Our
work shows that this behavior is a generic property of systems that are driven
out of equilibrium locally, as for instance by self propulsion.
