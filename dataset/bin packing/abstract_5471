We study a possible explanation of a 3.0 $\sigma$ excess recently reported by
the ATLAS Collaboration in events with Z-peaked same-flavour opposite-sign
lepton pair, jets and large missing transverse momentum in the context of
gauge-mediated SUSY breaking with more than one hidden sector, the so-called
goldstini scenario. In a certain parameter space, the gluino two-body decay
chain $\tilde g\to g\tilde\chi^0_{1,2}\to gZ\tilde G'$ becomes dominant, where
$\tilde\chi^0_{1,2}$ and $\tilde G'$ are the Higgsino-like neutralino and the
massive pseudo-goldstino, respectively, and gluino pair production can
contribute to the signal. We find that a mass spectrum such as $m_{\tilde
g}\sim 1000$ GeV, $m_{\tilde\chi^0_{1,2}}\sim 800$ GeV and $m_{\tilde G'}\sim
600$ GeV demonstrates the rate and the distributions of the excess, without
conflicting with the stringent constraints from jets plus missing energy
analyses and with the CMS constraint on the identical final state.
