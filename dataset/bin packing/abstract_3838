A sizeable difference in the differential production cross section of top and
antitop quarks, respectively, is predicted for hadronically produced heavy
quarks. It is of order $\alpha_s$ and arises from the interference between
charge odd and even amplitudes respectively. For the TEVATRON it amounts to
approximately 5-10% in the region where the cross section is large and could
therefore be measured in the next round of experiments. At the LHC the
asymmetry can be studied by selecting appropriately chosen kinematical regions.
