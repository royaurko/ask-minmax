Within the framework of a multi-phase transport model, we study the equation
of state and pressure anisotropy of the hot dense matter produced in central
relativistic heavy ion collisions. Both are found to depend on the
hadronization scheme and scattering cross sections used in the model.
Furthermore, only partial thermalization is achieved in the produced matter as
a result of its fast expansion.
