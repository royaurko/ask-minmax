We propose an ambitious new method that models the intracluster medium in
clusters of galaxies as a set of X-ray emitting smoothed particles of plasma.
Each smoothed particle is described by a handful of parameters including
temperature, location, size, and elemental abundances. Hundreds to thousands of
these particles are used to construct a model cluster of galaxies, with the
appropriate complexity estimated from the data quality. This model is then
compared iteratively with X-ray data in the form of adaptively binned photon
lists via a two-sample likelihood statistic and iterated via Markov Chain Monte
Carlo. The complex cluster model is propagated through the X-ray instrument
response using direct sampling Monte Carlo methods. Using this approach the
method can reproduce many of the features observed in the X-ray emission in a
less assumption-dependent way that traditional analyses, and it allows for a
more detailed characterization of the density, temperature, and metal abundance
structure of clusters. Multi-instrument X-ray analyses and simultaneous X-ray,
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ), and lensing analyses are a straight-forward extension
of this methodology. Significant challenges still exist in understanding the
degeneracy in these models and the statistical noise induced by the complexity
of the models.
