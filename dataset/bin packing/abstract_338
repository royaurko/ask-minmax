We report on experiments to measure the temporal and spatial evolution of
packing arrangements of anisotropic, cylindrical granular material, using
high-resolution capacitive monitoring. In these experiments, the particle
configurations start from an initially disordered, low-packing-fraction state
and under vertical vibrations evolve to a dense, highly ordered, nematic state
in which the long particle axes align with the vertical tube walls. We find
that the orientational ordering process is reflected in a characteristic, steep
rise in the local packing fraction. At any given height inside the packing, the
ordering is initiated at the container walls and proceeds inward. We explore
the evolution of the local as well as the height-averaged packing fraction as a
function of vibration parameters and compare our results to relaxation
experiments conducted on spherically shaped granular materials.
