Static and dynamical structure factors for shear and longitudinal modes of
the velocity and density fields are computed for a granular system fluidized by
a stochastic bath with friction. Analytical expressions are obtained through
fluctuating hydrodynamics and are successfully compared with numerical
simulations up to a volume fraction $\sim 50%$. Hydrodynamic noise is the sum
of external noise due to the bath and internal one due to collisions. Only the
latter is assumed to satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relation with the
average granular temperature. Static velocity structure factors $S_\perp(k)$
and $S_\parallel(k)$ display a general non-constant behavior with two plateaux
at large and small $k$, representing the granular temperature $T_g$ and the
bath temperature $T_b>T_g$ respectively. From this behavior, two different
velocity correlation lengths are measured, both increasing as the packing
fraction is raised. This growth of spatial order is in agreement with the
behaviour of dynamical structure factors, the decay of which becomes slower and
slower at increasing density.
