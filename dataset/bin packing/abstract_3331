We study the stochastic motion of an intruder in a dilute driven granular
gas. All particles are coupled to a thermostat, representing the external
energy source, which is the sum of random forces and a viscous drag. The
dynamics of the intruder, in the large mass limit, is well described by a
linear Langevin equation, combining the effects of the external bath and of the
"granular bath". The drag and diffusion coefficients are calculated under few
assumptions, whose validity is well verified in numerical simulations. We also
discuss the non-equilibrium properties of the intruder dynamics, as well as the
corrections due to finite packing fraction or finite intruder mass.
