We study the phase behaviour of a two-dimensionally confined hard sphere
colloidal system in the presence of a periodic light field of two interfering
laser beams using Monte Carlo simulations. For a given packing fraction of the
particles, the colloidal system undergoes a transition from a modulated liquid
to a modulated crystal as the light intensity is increased, corresponding to
laser induced freezing. For certain packing fractions of the colloidal
particles, the system again becomes a modulated liquid as the field strength
crosses a threshold value, showing a re-entrant behaviour.
