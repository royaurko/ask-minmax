Existing fourteen Bravais/space lattices are found to be inadequate for
proper crystallographic representation and some conceptual understandings. The
complicacies, confusions and ambiguities encountered in the representation of
trigonal/rhomohedral and hexagonal lattices have been removed by suggesting the
need of two more space lattices in the form of Hexagonal Close Packing (HCP)
and Rhombohedral Close Packing (RCP) with appropriate justifications.
Henceforth, these two lattices will be called as Wahab lattices and the sixteen
lattices together as Bravais Wahab lattices (or space lattices as before). This
finding will have immediate as well as far reaching implications.
