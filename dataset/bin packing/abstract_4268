We investigate electrical conduction and breakdown behavior of 3D
nano-carbon-stacked multilayer graphene (s-MLG) system with complete interlayer
decoupling. The s-MLG is prepared by transferring and stacking large-area
CVD-grown graphene monolayers, followed by wire patterning and plasma etching.
Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the layer number. The D-band peak
indicates low defect level in the samples. Electrical current stressing induced
doping is performed to shift the charge-neutrality Dirac point and decrease the
graphene/metal contact resistance, improving the overall electrical conduction.
Breakdown experiments show the current-carrying capacity of s-MLG is largely
enhanced as compared with that of monolayer graphene.
