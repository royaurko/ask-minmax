It is suggested and demonstrated that two specific 2-dimensional correlation
patterns, fixed-to-arbitrary bin and neighboring bin correlation patterns, are
efficient for identifying various random multiplicative cascade processes. A
possible application of these two correlation patterns to single event analysis
in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider experiments is discussed.
