We consider the problem of packing rectangles into bins that are unit
squares, where the goal is to minimize the number of bins used. All rectangles
have to be packed non-overlapping and orthogonal, i.e., axis-parallel. We
present an algorithm for this problem with an absolute worst-case ratio of 2,
which is optimal provided P != NP.
