Let $\ggg:=\gl_{m|n}$ be a general linear Lie superalgebra over an
algebraically closed field $\mathds{k}=\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ of
characteristic $p>2$. A module of $\ggg$ is said to be of Kac-Weisfeiler if its
dimension coincides with the dimensional lower bound in the super
Kac-Weisfeiler property presented by Wang-Zhao in \cite{WZ}. In this paper, we
verify the existence of the Kac-Weisfeiler modules for $\gl_{m|n}$. We also
establish the corresponding consequence for the special linear Lie
superalgebras $\mathfrak{sl}_{m|n}$ with restrictions $p>2$ and $p\nmid(m-n)$.
