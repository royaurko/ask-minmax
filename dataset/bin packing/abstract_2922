We have studied the electronic properties, in relation to their structural
properties, of monolayers of 1-octadecene attached on a hydrogen-terminated
(111) silicon surface. The molecules are attached using the free-radical
reaction between C=C and Si-H activated by an ultraviolet illumination. We have
compared the structural and electrical properties of monolayers formed on
silicon substrate of different types (n-type and p-type) and different doping
concentrations from low-doped (~1E14 cm-3) to highly doped (~1E19 cm-3) silicon
substrates. We show that the monolayers on n-, p- and p+ silicon are densely
packed and that they act as very good insulating films at a nanometer thickness
with leakage currents as low as ~1E-7 A.cm-2 and high quality
capacitance-voltage characteristics. The monolayers formed on n+-type silicon
are more disordered and therefore exhibit larger leakage current densities
(>1E-4 A.cm-2) when embedded in a silicon/monolayer/metal junction. The
inferior structural and electronic properties obtained with n+-type silicon
pinpoint the important role of surface potential and of the position of the
surface Fermi level during the chemisorption of the organic monolayers.
