We explore the centrality dependence of properties of the dense hadronic
matter created in \sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV Au--Au collisions at RHIC. Using the
statistical hadronization model we fit particle yields known for 11 centrality
bins. We present the resulting model parameters, rapidity yields of physical
quantities and the physical properties of bulk matter at hadronization as
function of centrality. We discuss the production of strangeness and entropy.
