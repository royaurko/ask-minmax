Cross-planar di-vacancies (CPDVs) within stacked graphene hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) heterostructures provide stabilized covalent links to bridge
adjacent graphene and h-BN sheets. It was shown that the CPDVs serve as focal
points for cross-planar atom transport between graphene and h-BN, and the
chemical nature of interlayer links along with associated cross-planar
migration pathways at these defects can be predictively manipulated through
modulation of the chemical environment and charge engineering, to achieve
consistent B or N doping and simultaneous healing of graphene. The present
study proposed a viable approach integrating irradiation, chemical and charge
engineering, to produce high-quality graphene with tunable electronic and
electrochemical properties, using the h-BN substrate.
