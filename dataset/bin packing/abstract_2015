We study the structure and energetics of Au$_N$ clusters by means of
parameter-free density-functional calculations ($N\le 8$), jellium calculations
($N\le 60$), embedded-atom calculations ($N\le 150$), and parameterized
density-functional calculations ($N\le 40$) in combination with different
methods for determining the structure of the lowest total energy. By comparing
the results from the different approaches, effects due to geometric packing and
those due to the electronic orbitals can be identified. Different descriptors
that highlight the results of the analysis are presented and used.
