This paper evaluates methods of hierarchical skill analysis developed in
aerospace to the problem of surgical skill assessment and modeling. The
analysis employs tool motion data of Fundamental of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS)
tasks collected from clinicians of various skill levels at three different
clinical teaching hospitals in the United States. Outcomes are evaluated based
on their ability to provide relevant information about the underlying processes
across the entire system hierarchy including control, guidance and planning.
