We propose a model of two-way selection system. It appears in the processes
like choosing a mate between men and women, making contracts between job
hunters and recruiters, and trading between buyers and sellers. In this paper,
we propose a model of two-way selection system, and present its analytic
solution for the expectation of successful matching total and the regular
pattern that the matching rate trends toward an inverse proportion to either
the ratio between the two sides or the ratio of the state total to the smaller
people number. The proposed model is verified by empirical data of the
matchmaking fairs. Results indicate that the model well predicts this typical
real-world two- way selection behavior to the bounded error extent, thus it is
helpful for understanding the dynamics mechanism of the real-world two-way
selection system.
