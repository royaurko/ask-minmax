Using a radio frequency tunnel diode oscillator technique, we measured the
temperature dependence of the in-plane London penetration depth
$\Delta\lambda_{ab}(T)$ in Fe$_{1+y}$(Te$_{1-x}$Se$_{x})$ single crystals, down
to temperatures as low as 50 mK. A significant number of samples, with nominal
Se concentration $x$=0.36, 0.40, 0.43 and 0.45 respectively, were studied and
in many cases we found that $\Delta\lambda_{ab}(T)$ shows an upturn below 0.7
K, indicative of a paramagnetic type contribution. After subtracting the
magnetic background, the low temperature behavior of penetration depth is best
described by a power law with exponent $n\approx2$ and with no systematic
dependence on the Se concentration. Most importantly, in the limit of
T$\rightarrow$0, in some samples we observed a narrow region of linear
temperature dependence of penetration depth, suggestive of nodes in the
superconducting gap of Fe$_{1+y}$(Te$_{1-x}$Se$_{x})$.
