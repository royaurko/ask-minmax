We study adsorption sites of a single Xe adatom on Nb(110) surface using a
density functional theory approach: The on-top site is the most favorable
position for the adsorption. We compare the binding features of the present
study to earlier studies of a Xe adatom on close-packed (111) surface of
face-centered cubic metals. The different features are attributed through a
microscopic picture to the less than half filled d-states in Nb.
