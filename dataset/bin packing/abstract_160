Random packing of spheres inside fractal collectors of dimension 2 < d < 3 is
studied numerically using Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) algorithm. The
paper focuses mainly on the measurement of random packing saturation limit.
Additionally, scaling properties of density autocorrelations in the obtained
packing are analyzed. The RSA kinetics coefficients are also measured. Obtained
results allow to test phenomenological relation between random packing
saturation density and collector dimension. Additionally, performed simulations
together with previously obtained results confirm that, in general, the known
dimensional relations are obeyed by systems having non-integer dimension, at
least for d < 3.
