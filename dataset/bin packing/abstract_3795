This paper describes two generalization schemes of the Optimal Variables
technique in estimating simultaneously two Trilinear Gauge Couplings. The first
is an iterative procedure to perform a 2-dimensional fit using the linear terms
of the expansion of the probability density function with respect to the
corresponding couplings, whilst the second is a clustering method of
probability distribution representation in five dimensions. The pair production
of W's at 183 GeV center of mass energy, where one W decays leptonically and
the other hadronically, was used to demonstrate the optimal properties of the
proposed estimation techniques.
