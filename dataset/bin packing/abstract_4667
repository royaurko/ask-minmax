Through the consideration of spherically symmetric gravitating systems
consisting of perfect fluids with linear equation of state constrained to be in
a finite volume, an account is given of the properties of entropy at conditions
in which it is no longer an extensive quantity (it does not scale with system's
size). To accomplish this, the methods introduced by Oppenheim [1] to
characterize non-extensivity are used, suitably generalized to the case of
gravitating systems subject to an external pressure. In particular when, far
from the system's Schwarzschild limit, both area scaling for conventional
entropy and inverse radius law for the temperature set in (i.e. the same
properties of the corresponding black hole thermodynamical quantities), the
entropy profile is found to behave like 1/r, being r the area radius inside the
system. In such circumstances thus entropy heavily resides in internal layers,
in opposition to what happens when area scaling is gained while approaching the
Schwarzschild mass, in which case conventional entropy lies at the surface of
the system. The information content of these systems, even if it globally
scales like the area, is then stored in the whole volume, instead of packed on
the boundary.
