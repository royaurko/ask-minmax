We present infrared spectroscopy of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, obtained
11.81, 20.75 and 55.71 days following its 2006 eruption. The spectra are
dominated by hydrogen recombination lines, together with HeI, OI and OII lines;
the electron temperature of ~10^4 K implied by the recombination spectrum
suggests that we are seeing primarily the wind of the red giant, ionized by the
ultraviolet flash when RS Oph erupted. However, strong coronal emission lines
(i.e. emission from fine structure transitions in ions having high ionization
potential) are present in the last spectrum. These imply a temperature of
930000K for the coronal gas; this is in line with x-ray observations of the
2006 eruption. The emission line widths decrease with time in a way that is
consistent with the shock model for the x-ray emission.
