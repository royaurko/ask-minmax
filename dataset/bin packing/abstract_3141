If general relativity is spontaneously induced, the black hole limit is
governed by a phase transition which occurs precisely at the would have been
horizon. The exterior Schwarzschild solution then connects with a novel core of
vanishing spatial volume. The Kruskal structure, admitting the exact Hawking
imaginary time periodicity, is recovered, with the conic defect defused at the
origin, rather than at the horizon. The entropy stored inside \textbf{any}
interior sphere is universal, equal to a quarter of its surface area, thus
locally saturating the 't Hooft-Susskind holographic bound. The associated
Komar mass and material energy functions are non-singular.
