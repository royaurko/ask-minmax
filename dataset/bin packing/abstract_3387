Open lattices are characterized by low volume-fraction arrangements of
building blocks, low coordination number, and open spaces between building
blocks. The self-assembly of these lattices faces the challenge of mechanical
instability due to their open structures. We theoretically investigate the
stabilizing effects of entropy in the self-assembly of open lattices from
patchy particles. A preliminary account of these findings and their comparison
to experiment was presented recently [X. Mao, Q. Chen, S. Granick, \textit{Nat.
Mater.}, \textbf{12}, 217 (2013)]. We found that rotational entropy of patchy
particles can provide mechanical stability to open lattices, whereas
vibrational entropy of patchy particles can lower the free energy of open
lattices and thus enables the selection of open lattices verses close-packed
lattices which have the same potential energy. These effects open the door to
significant simplifications of possible future designs of patchy-particles for
open-lattice self-assembly.
