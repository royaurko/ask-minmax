We have commenced a 21-cm survey of the entire southern sky (\delta < 0
degrees, -1200 km/s < v < 12700 km/s) which is ''blind'', i.e. unbiased by
previous optical information. In the present paper we report on the results of
a pilot project which is based on data from this all-sky survey. The project
was carried out on an area of 600 square degrees centred on the nearby
Centaurus A (Cen A) group of galaxies at a mean velocity of v ~ 500 km/s. This
was recently the subject of a separate and thorough optical survey.
  We found 10 new group members to add to the 21 galaxies already known in the
Cen A group: five of these are previously uncatalogued galaxies, while five
were previously catalogued but not known to be associated with the group.
  We found optical counterparts for all the HI detections, most of them
intrinsically very faint low surface brightness dwarfs. The new group members
add approximately 6% to the HI mass of the group and 4% to its light. The HI
mass function, derived from all the known group galaxies in the interval 10^7
\Msun of HI to 10^9 \Msun of HI, has a faint-end slope of 1.30 +/- 0.15,
allowing us to rule out a slope of 1.7 at 95% confidence. Even if the number in
the lowest mass bin is increased by 50%, the slope only increases to 1.45 +/-
0.15.
