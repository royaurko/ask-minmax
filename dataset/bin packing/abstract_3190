We theoretically investigate the anomalous Hall effect in a system of
dense-packed ferromagnetic grains in the metallic regime. Using the formalism
recently developed for the conventional Hall effect in granular metals, we
calculate the residual anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ and
resistivity $\rho_{xy}$ and weak localization corrections to them for both
skew-scattering and side-jump mechanisms. We find that, unlike for
homogeneously disordered metals, the scaling relation between $\rho_{xy}$ and
the longitudinal resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ does not hold. The weak localization
corrections, however, are found to be in agreement with those for homogeneous
metals. We discuss recent experimental data on the anomalous Hall effect in
polycrystalline iron films in view of the obtained results.
