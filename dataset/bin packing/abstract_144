We present results from experiments with granular packings in three
dimensions in microgravity as realized on parabolic flights. Two different
techniques are employed to monitor the inside of the packings during
compaction: (1) X-ray radiography is used to measure in transmission the
integrated fluctuations of particle positions. (2) Stress-birefringence in
three dimensions is applied to visualize the stresses inside the packing. The
particle motions below the transition into an arrested packing are found to
produce a well agitated state. At the transition, the particles lose their
energy quite rapidly and form a stress network. With both methods, non-arrested
particles (rattlers) can be identified. In particular, it is found that
rattlers inside the arrested packing can be excited to appreciable dynamics by
the rest-accelerations (g-jitter) during a parabolic flight without destroying
the packings. At low rates of compaction, a regime of slow granular cooling is
identified. The slow cooling extends over several seconds, is described well by
a linear law, and terminates in a rapid final collapse of dynamics before
complete arrest of the packing.
