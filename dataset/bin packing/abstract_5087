Information and computer security is supported largely by passwords which are
the principle part of the authentication process. The most common computer
authentication method is to use alphanumerical username and password which has
significant drawbacks. To overcome the vulnerabilities of traditional methods,
visual or graphical password schemes have been developed as possible
alternative solutions to text based scheme. A potential drawback of graphical
password schemes is that they are more vulnerable to shoulder surfing than
conventional alphanumeric text passwords. When users input their passwords in a
public place, they may be at risk of attackers stealing their password. An
attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the
individuals authentication session. This is referred to as shouldersurfing and
is a known risk, of special concern when authenticating in public places. In
this paper we will present a survey on graphical password schemes from 2005
till 2009 which are proposed to be resistant against shoulder surfing attacks.
