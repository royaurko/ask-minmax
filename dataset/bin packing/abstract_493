The capacity regions of semideterministic multiuser channels, such as the
semideterministic relay channel and the multiple access channel with partially
cribbing encoders, have been characterized using the idea of
partial-decode-forward. However, the requirement to explicitly decode part of
the message at intermediate nodes can be restrictive in some settings; for
example, when nodes have different side information regarding the state of the
channel. In this paper, we generalize this scheme to
$\textit{cooperative-bin-forward}$ by building on the observation that explicit
recovering of part of the message is not needed to induce cooperation. Instead,
encoders can bin their received signals and cooperatively forward the bin index
to the decoder. The main advantage of this new scheme is illustrated by
considering state-dependent extensions of the aforementioned semideterministic
setups. While partial-decode-forward is not applicable in these new setups,
cooperative-bin-forward continues to achieve capacity.
