We introduce a two-player game in which one and his/her opponent attempt to
pack as many ``prisoners'' as possible on the squares of an n-by-n
checkerboard; each prisoner has to be ``protected'' by at least as many guards
as the number of the other prisoners adjacent. Initially, the board is covered
entirely with guards. The players take turns adjusting the board configuration
using one of the following rules in each turn:
  I. Replace one guard with a prisoner of the player's color.
  II. Replace one prisoner of either color with a guard and replace two other
guards with prisoners of the player's color.
  We analyze winning strategies for small n (n<5) and the maximum number of
prisoners in general. We show that this maximum is less than (7n^2+4n)/11 and
conjecture it is more likely 3n^2/5+O(n).
