We study the absorption probability and Hawking radiation of the scalar field
in the rotating black holes on codimension-2 branes. We find that finite brane
tension modifies the standard results in Hawking radiation if compared with the
case when brane tension is completely negligible. We observe that the rotation
of the black hole brings richer physics. Nonzero angular momentum triggers the
super-radiance which becomes stronger when the angular momentum increases. We
also find that rotations along different angles influence the result in
absorption probability and Hawking radiation. Compared with the black hole
rotating orthogonal to the brane, in the background that black hole spins on
the brane, its angular momentum brings less super-radiance effect and the brane
tension increases the range of frequency to accommodate super-radiance. These
information can help us know more about the rotating codimension-2 black holes.
