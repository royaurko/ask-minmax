We present the Halpha imaging observations of 273 late-type galaxies in the
nearby rich galaxy clusters Virgo, A1367, Coma, Cancer, Hercules and in the
Great Wall, carried out primarily with the 2.1m telescope of the San Pedro
Martir Observatory (SPM) and with the ESO/3.6m telescope. We derived the
Halpha+[NII] fluxes and equivalent widths. The Halpha survey reached completion
for an optically selected sample of nearby galaxies in and outside rich
clusters. Taking advantage of the completeness of the data set, the dependence
of Halpha properties on the Hubble type was determined for late-type galaxies
in the Virgo cluster. Differences in the gaseous content partly account for the
large scatter of the Halpha E.W. within each Hubble-type class. We studied the
radial distributions of the Halpha E.W. around Coma+A1367 and the Virgo
clusters in two luminosity bins. Luminous galaxies show a decrease in their
average Halpha E.W. in the inner 1 virial radius, while low-luminosity galaxies
do not show this trend.
