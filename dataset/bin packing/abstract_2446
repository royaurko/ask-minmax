Multiplicity fluctuations of intermediate-mass fragments are studied with the
percolation model. It is shown that super-Poissonian fluctuations occur near
the percolation transition and that this behavior is associated with the
fragmentative nature of the percolation model. The consequences of various
choices in defining and binning fragments are also evaluated. Several
suggestions for experiments in nuclear fragmentation are presented.
