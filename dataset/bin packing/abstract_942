Triangular fully packed loop configurations (TFPLs) came up in the study of
fully packed loop configurations on a square (FPLs) corresponding to link
patterns with a large number of nested arches. To a TFPL is assigned a triple
$(u,v;w)$ of $01$-words encoding its boundary conditions which must necessarily
satisfy that $d(u)+d(v)\leq d(w)$, where $d(u)$ denotes the number of
inversions in $u$. Wieland gyration, on the other hand, was invented to show
the rotational invariance of the numbers $A_\pi$ of FPLs corresponding to a
given link pattern $\pi$. Later, Wieland drift - a map on TFPLs that is based
on Wieland gyration - was defined. The main contribution of this article is a
linear expression for the number of TFPLs with boundary $(u,v;w)$ where
$d(w)-d(u)-d(v)=2$ in terms of numbers of stable TFPLs, that is, TFPLs
invariant under Wieland drift. This linear expression is consistent with
already existing enumeration results for TFPLs with boundary $(u,v;w)$ where
$d(w)-d(u)-d(v)=0,1$.
