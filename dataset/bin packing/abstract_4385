This work presents new integral data measured at the ASP 14 MeV neutron
irradiation facility at Aldermaston in the UK, which has recently become
available for fusion-related work through the CCFE materials programme.
Measurements of reaction products from activation experiments using elemental
foils were carried out using gamma spectrometry in a high efficiency,
high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector and associated digital signal processing
hardware. Following irradiation and rapid extraction to the measurement cell,
gamma emissions were acquired with both energy and time bins. Integral cross
section and half-life data have been derived from these measurements. Selected
integral cross section values are presented from the measurement campaigns.
