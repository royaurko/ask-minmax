It has been recently pointed out that local volume fluctuations in granular
packings follow remarkably well a shifted and rescaled Gamma distribution named
the kGamma distribution [T. Aste, T. Di Matteo, Phys. Rev. E 77 (2008) 021309].
In this paper we confirm, extend and discuss this finding by supporting it with
additional experimental and simulation data.
