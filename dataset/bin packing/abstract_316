We call a periodic ball packing in d-dimensional Euclidean space periodically
(strictly) jammed with respect to a period lattice if there are no nontrivial
motions of the balls that preserve the period (that maintain some period with
smaller or equal volume). In particular, we call a packing consistently
periodically (strictly) jammed if it is periodically (strictly) jammed on every
one of its periods. After extending a well-known bar framework and stress
condition to strict jamming, we prove that a packing with period Lambda is
consistently strictly jammed if and only if it is strictly jammed with respect
to Lambda and consistently periodically jammed. We next extend a result about
rigid unit mode spectra in crystallography to characterize periodic jamming on
sublattices. After that, we prove that there are finitely many strictly jammed
packings of m unit balls and other similar results. An interesting example
shows that the size of the first sublattice on which a packing is first
periodically unjammed is not bounded. Finally, we find an example of a
consistently periodically jammed packing of low density \delta = \frac{4 \pi}{6
\sqrt{3} + 11} + \epsilon ~ 0.59, where \epsilon is an arbitrarily small
positive number. Throughout the paper, the statements for the closely related
notions of periodic infinitesimal rigidity and affine infinitesimal rigidity
for tensegrity frameworks are also given.
