We propose that a system of colloidal particles interacting with a honeycomb
array of optical traps that each contain three wells can be used to realize a
fully packed loop model. One of the phases in this system can be mapped to
Baxter's three-coloring problem, offering an easily accessible physical
realization of this problem. As a function of temperature and interaction
strength, we find a series of phases, including long range ordered loop or
stripe states, stripes with sliding symmetries, random packed loop states, and
disordered states in which the loops break apart. Our geometry could be
constructed using ion trap arrays, BEC vortices in optical traps, or magnetic
vortices in nanostructured superconductors.
