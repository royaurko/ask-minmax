We study the 2-dimensional vector packing problem, which is a generalization
of the classical bin packing problem where each item has 2 distinct weights and
each bin has 2 corresponding capacities. The goal is to group items into
minimum number of bins, without violating the bin capacity constraints. We
propose a \Theta}(n)-time approximation algorithm that is inspired by the
O(n^2) algorithm proposed by Chang, Hwang, and Park.
