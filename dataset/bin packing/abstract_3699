In Paper-I we presented a methodology to recover the spatial variations of
properties of the intracluster gas from ASCA X-ray satellite observations of
galaxy clusters. We verified the correctness of this procedure by applying it
to simulated cluster datasets which we had subjected to the various
contaminants common in ASCA data. In this paper we present the results which we
obtain when we apply this method to real galaxy cluster observations. We
determine broad-band temperature and cooling-flow mass-deposition rates for the
106 clusters in our sample, and obtain temperature, abundance and emissivity
profiles (i.e. at least two annular bins) for 98 of these clusters. We find
that 90 percent of these temperature profiles are consistent with isothermality
at the 3-sigma confidence level. This conflicts with the prevalence of
steeply-declining cluster temperature profiles found by Markevitch et al.
(1998) from a sample of 30 clusters. In Paper-III (in preparation) we utilise
our temperature and emissivity profiles to determine radial hydrostatic-mass
properties for a subsample of the clusters presented in this paper.
