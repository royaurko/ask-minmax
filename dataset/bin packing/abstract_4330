A search for supersymmetry in final states with jets and missing transverse
energy is performed in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7
TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.98 inverse
femtobarns collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. In this search, a
dimensionless kinematic variable, alphaT, is used as the main discriminator
between events with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse energy. The
search is performed in a signal region that is binned in the scalar sum of the
transverse energy of jets and the number of jets identified as originating from
a bottom quark. No excess of events over the standard model expectation is
found. Exclusion limits are set in the parameter space of the constrained
minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model, and also in simplified
models, with a special emphasis on compressed spectra and third-generation
scenarios.
