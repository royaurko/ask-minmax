The contributors of this paper deal with the existence and regularities of weak
solutions to the homogenous $\hbox{Dirichlet}$ boundary value problem for the
equation $-\hbox{div}(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla
u)+|u|^{p-2}u=\frac{f(x)}{u^{\alpha}}$. The contributors apply the method of
regularization and $\hbox{Leray-Schauder}$ fixed point theorem as well as a
necessary compactness argument to prove the existence of solutions and then
obtain some maximum norm estimates by constructing three suitable iterative
sequences. Furthermore, we find that the critical exponent of $m$ in
$\|f\|_{L^{m}(\Omega)}$. That is, when $m$ lies in different intervals, the
solutions of the problem mentioned belongs to different $\hbox{Sobolev}$
spaces. Besides, we prove that the solution of this problem is not in
$W^{1,p}_{0}(\Omega)$ when $\alpha>2$, while the solution of this problem is in
$W^{1,p}_{0}(\Omega)$ when $1<\alpha<2$.
