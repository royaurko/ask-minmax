We report on the first results of the Narrow-band Ultraviolet Imaging
Experiment for Wide-field Surveys (NUVIEWS), a sounding rocket experiment
designed to map the far-ultraviolet background in four narrow bands. This is
the first imaging measurement of the UV background to cover a substantial
fraction of the sky. The narrow band responses (145, 155, 161, and 174 nm, 7-10
nm wide) allow us to isolate background contributions from dust-scattered
continuum, H2 fluorescence, and CIV 155 nm emission. In our first flight, we
mapped one quarter of the sky with 5-10 arcminute imaging resolution. In this
paper, we model the dominant contribution of the background, dust-scattered
continuum. Our data base consists of a map of over 10,000 sq. degrees with 468
independent measurements in 6.25 by 6.25 sq. degree bins. Stars and
instrumental stellar halos are removed from the data. We present a map of the
continuum background obtained in the 174 nm telescope. We use a model that
follows Witt, Friedman, and Sasseen (1997: WFS) to account for the
inhomogeneous radiation field and multiple scattering effects in clouds. We
find that the dust in the diffuse interstellar medium displays a moderate
albedo (a=0.55+/-0.1) and highly forward scattering phase function parameter
(g=0.75+/-0.1) over a large fraction of the sky, similar to dust in star
forming regions. We also have discovered a significant variance from the model.
