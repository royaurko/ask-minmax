Progress is reported on several questions that bedevil understanding of
granular systems: (i) are the stress equations elliptic, parabolic or
hyperbolic? (ii) how can the often-observed force chains be predicted from a
first-principles continuous theory? (iii) How to relate insight from isostatic
systems to general packings? Explicit equations are derived for the stress
components in two dimensions including the dependence on the local structure.
The equations are shown to be hyperbolic and their general solutions, as well
as the Green function, are found. It is shown that the solutions give rise to
force chains and the explicit dependence of the force chains trajectories and
magnitudes on the local geometry is predicted. Direct experimental tests of the
predictions are proposed. Finally, a framework is proposed to relate the
analysis to non-isostatic and more realistic granular assemblies.
