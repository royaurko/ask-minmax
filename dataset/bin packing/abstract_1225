We use numerical simulation to investigate and analyze the way that rigid
disks and spheres arrange themselves when compressed next to incommensurate
substrates. For disks, a movable set is pressed into a jammed state against an
ordered fixed line of larger disks, where the diameter ratio of movable to
fixed disks is 0.8. The corresponding diameter ratio for the sphere simulations
is 0.7, where the fixed substrate has the structure of a (001) plane of a
face-centered cubic array. Results obtained for both disks and spheres exhibit
various forms of density-reducing packing frustration next to the
incommensurate substrate, including some cases displaying disorder that extends
far from the substrate. The disk system calculations strongly suggest that the
most efficient (highest density) packings involve configurations that are
periodic in the lateral direction parallel to the substrate, with substantial
geometric disruption only occurring near the substrate. Some evidence has also
emerged suggesting that for the sphere systems a corresponding structure doubly
periodic in the lateral directions would yield the highest packing density;
however all of the sphere simulations completed thus far produced some residual
"bulk" disorder not obviously resulting from substrate mismatch. In view of the
fact that the cases studied here represent only a small subset of all that
eventually deserve attention, we end with discussion of the directions in which
first extensions of the present simulations might profitably be pursued.
