Time-averages are common observables in analysis of experimental data and
numerical simulations of physical systems. We will investigate, from the angle
of PDE (partial differential equation) analysis, some oscillatory geophysical
fluid dynamics in three dimensions: Navier-Stokes equations in a fast rotating,
spherical shell, and Magnetohydrodynamics subject to strong Coriolis and
Lorentz forces. Upon averaging their oscillatory solutions in time, interesting
patterns such as zonal flows can emerge. More rigorously, we will prove that,
when the restoring forces are strong enough, time-averaged solutions stay close
to the null spaces of the wave operators, whereas the solutions themselves can
be arbitrarily far away from these subspaces.
