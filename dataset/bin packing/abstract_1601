The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) holds information about
almost all the fundamental cosmological parameters, and by performing a
likelihood analysis of high precision CMBR fluctuation data, these parameters
can be inferred. However, this analysis relies on assumptions about the initial
power spectrum, which is usually taken to be a featureless power-law, P(k) ~
k^{n_s-1}. Many inflationary models predict power spectra with non-power law
features. We discuss the possibility for detecting such features by describing
the power spectrum as bins in k-space. This method for power spectrum
reconstruction is demonstrated in practise by performing likelihood
optimization on synthetic spectra, and the difficulties arising from
reconstructing smooth features using discontinuous bins are discussed in
detail.
