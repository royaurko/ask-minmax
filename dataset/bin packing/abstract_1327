The multifractal spectrum of various three-dimensional representations of
Packed Swiss Cheese cosmologies in open, closed, and flat spaces are measured,
and it is determined that the curvature of the space does not alter the
associated fractal structure. These results are compared to observational data
and simulated models of large scale galaxy clustering, to assess the viability
of the PSC as a candidate for such structure formation. It is found that the
PSC dimension spectra do not match those of observation, and possible solutions
to this discrepancy are offered, including accounting for potential luminosity
biasing effects. Various random and uniform sets are also analyzed to provide
insight into the meaning of the multifractal spectrum as it relates to the
observed scaling behaviors.
