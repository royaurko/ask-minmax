Recent values for virial coefficients up to B12, when expressed in powers of
density relative to maximum close packing,lead to a closed equation-of-state
for the equilibrium fluid. The series obtained converges for all densities;it
becomes negative and diverges to a negative pole at maximum packing. MD data
for 64000 spheres in the metastable region shows the virial pressure begins to
deviate at the fluid freezing density.
