A $P_q(t,k,n)$ $q$-packing design is a selection of $k$-subspaces of $\F_q^n$
such that each $t$-subspace is contained in at most one element of the
collection. A successful approach adopted from the Kramer-Mesner-method of
prescribing a group of automorphisms was applied by Kohnert and Kurz to
construct some constant dimension codes with moderate parameters which arise by
$q$-packing designs. In this paper we recall this approach and give a version
of the Kramer-Mesner-method breaking the condition that the whole $q$-packing
design must admit the prescribed group of automorphisms. Afterwards, we
describe the basic idea of an algorithm to tackle the integer linear
optimization problems representing the $q$-packing design construction by means
of a metaheuristic approach. Finally, we give some improvements on the size of
$P_2(2,3,n)$ $q$-packing designs.
