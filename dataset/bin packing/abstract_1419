We construct the complete liquid crystal phase diagram of hard plate-like
cylinders for variable aspect ratio using Onsager's second virial theory with
the Parsons-Lee decoupling approximation to account for higher-body
interactions in the isotropic and nematic fluid phases. The stability of the
solid (columnar) state at high packing fraction is included by invoking a
simple equation of state based on a Lennard-Jones-Devonshire (LJD) cell model
which has proven to be quantitatively reliable over a large range of packing
fractions. By employing an asymptotic analysis based on the Gaussian
approximation we are able to show that the nematic-columnar transition is
universal and independent of particle shape. The predicted phase diagram is in
qualitative agreement with simulation results.
