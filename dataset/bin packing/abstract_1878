In this letter I report the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) detection of
Very High Energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission from the BL Lac object RBS
0970. 5.3 years of LAT observations revealed the presence of 3 VHE photon
events within 0.1 degrees of RBS 0970, with a subsequent unbinned likelihood
analysis finding RBS 0970 to be a source of VHE photons at the 6.5 sigma level
of confidence. The E>1 GeV flux, binned in monthly periods, did not indicate
any flux brightening of RBS 0970 accompanying the emission of the VHE photons.
However, a likelihood analysis of the 0.1-100 GeV flux, binned in 28 day
periods centered on detection of the VHE photons, revealed that the emission of
the lowest energy VHE photons coincided with a hardening of the gamma-ray
spectrum. Interestingly, the same analysis did not find any significant
gamma-ray emission from RBS 0970 during the emission of the highest energy VHE
event. The discovery of RBS 0970 as a VHE emitter, combined with the spectral
variability, suggest RBS 0970 to be a good candidate for follow-up observations
with ground-based gamma-ray observatories.
