In this paper, we study the following knapsack problem: Given a list of
squares with profits, we are requested to pack a sublist of them into a
rectangular bin (not a unit square bin) to make profits in the bin as large as
possible. We first observe there is a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme
(PTAS) for the problem of packing weighted squares into rectangular bins with
large resources, then apply the PTAS to the problem of packing squares with
profits into a rectangular bin and get a $\frac65+\epsilon$ approximation
algorithm.
