We investigate the modifications brought about by the linear connectivity
among charges in the classical Thomson problem. Instead of packing with local
hexagonal order intersperced with topological defects, we find charge
distributions with helical symmetry wound around the surface of the sphere.
This finding should have repercussions in the viral packing and macroion
adsorption theories.
