A software tool, computing observed and expected upper limits on poissonian
process rates using a hybrid frequentist-bayesian CLs method, is presented.
This tool can be used for simple counting experiments where only signal,
background and observed yields are provided or for multi-bin experiments where
binned distributions of discriminating variables are provided. It allows to
combine several channels and takes into account statistical and systematic
uncertainties, as well as correlations of systematic uncertainties between
channels. It has been validated against other software tools or analytical
calculations, in several cases.
