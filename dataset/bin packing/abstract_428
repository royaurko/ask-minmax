The sintering behavior of close packed spheres is investigated using a
numerical model. The investigated systems are the body centered cubic (BCC),
face centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal closed packed spheres (HCP). The
sintering behavior is found to be ideal with no grain growth until full density
is reached for all systems. During sintering the grains change shape from
spherical to tetrakaidecahedron, similar to the geometry analyzed by Coble (R.
L. Coble, J. Appl. Phys. 32 (1961) 787).
