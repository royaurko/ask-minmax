We have identified an obvious and strong large scale structure at redshift
z=5.75 in a wide (31 by 33 arcminute) field, narrowband survey of the Chandra
Deep Field South region. This structure is traced by 17 candidate Lyman alpha
emitters, among which 12 are found in an 823nm filter (corresponding to Lyman
alpha at z=5.77 +- 0.03) and 5 in an 815nm image (z=5.70 +- 0.03). The Lyman
alpha emitters in both redshift bins are concentrated in one quadrant of the
field. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, Chandra Deep Field South, and GOODS-South
fields all lie near the edge of this overdense region. Our results are
consistent with reports of an overdensity in the UDF region at z=5.9. This
structure is the highest redshift overdensity found so far.
