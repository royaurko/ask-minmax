We generate and study an ensemble of isostatic jammed hard-sphere lattices.
These lattices are obtained by compression of a periodic system with an
adaptive unit cell containing a single sphere until the point of mechanical
stability. We present detailed numerical data about the densities, pair
correlations, force distributions, and structure factors of such lattices. We
show that this model retains many of the crucial structural features of the
classical hard-sphere model and propose it as a model for the jamming and glass
transitions that enables exploration of much higher dimensions than are usually
accessible.
