In a recent paper [ F. Wang and F. Y. Wu, Phys. Rev. E 75 (2007) 040105(R) ]
we reported exact results on the enumeration of close-packed dimers on an
infinite kagome lattice. We computed the per-dimer free energy using both the
Pfaffian approach and a vertex-model formulation, and found the result given by
a simple expression. We also reported results on dimer-dimer correlations
without giving details. In this paper we present details of the correlation
function analysis. In addition, we extend the exact enumeration to finite
lattices under two different boundary conditions and with asymmetric dimer
weights. For symmetric dimer weights the finite-lattice results are again
simple, and we show that they can be understood using a spin variable mapping.
We also describe the formulation of a Grassmannian functional integral approach
and apply it to the kagome lattice.
