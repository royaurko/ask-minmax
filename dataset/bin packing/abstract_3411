Recent observations demonstrate that densely packed tissues exhibit features
of glassy dynamics, such as caging behavior and dynamical heterogeneities,
although it has remained unclear how single-cell properties control this
behavior. Here we develop numerical and theoretical models to calculate energy
barriers to cell rearrangements, which help govern cell migration in cell
monolayers. In contrast to work on sheared foams, we find that energy barrier
heights are exponentially distributed and depend systematically on the cell's
number of neighbors. Based on these results, we predict glassy two-time
correlation functions for cell motion, with a timescale that increases rapidly
as cell activity decreases. These correlation functions are used to construct
simple random walks that reproduce the caging behavior observed for cell
trajectories in experiments. This work provides a theoretical framework for
predicting collective motion of cells in wound-healing, embryogenesis and
cancer tumorigenesis.
