The Time-Resolved Integrative Optical Neutron (TRION) detector was developed
for Fast Neutron Resonance Radiography (FNRR), a fast-neutron transmission
imaging method that exploits characteristic energy-variations of the total
scattering cross-section in the En = 1-10 MeV range to detect specific elements
within a radiographed object. As opposed to classical event-counting time of
flight (ECTOF), it integrates the detector signal during a well-defined neutron
Time of Flight window corresponding to a pre-selected energy bin, e.g., the
energy-interval spanning a cross-section resonance of an element such as C, O
and N. The integrative characteristic of the detector permits loss-free
operation at very intense, pulsed neutron fluxes, at a cost however, of
recorded temporal resolution degradation.
  This work presents a theoretical and experimental evaluation of detector
related parameters which affect temporal resolution of the TRION system.
