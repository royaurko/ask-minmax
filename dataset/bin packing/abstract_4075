We propose an effective method which can simplify the optimization of the
increase of the trace distance over all pairs of initial states in calculating
the non-Markovianity $\mathcal{N}$ for single channel open systems. For the
amplitude damping channel, we can unify the results of Breuer $et$ $al$. [Phys.
Rev. Lett. \bf 103\rm, 210401 (2009)] in the large-detuning case and the
results of Xu $et$ $al$. [Phys. Rev. A \bf 81\rm, 044105 (2010)] in the
resonant case; furthermore, for the general off-resonant cases we can obtain a
very tight lower bound of $\mathcal{N}$.
  As another application of our method, we also discuss $\mathcal{N}$ for the
non-Markovian depolarizing channel.
