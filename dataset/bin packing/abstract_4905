We analyse the surface density of very faint galaxies at the limit of the sky
background noise in the field of the cluster of galaxies Cl0024+1654. The
radial variation of their number density in the magnitude bins $B=26-28$ and
$I=24-26.5$ displays an (anti)bias magnification effect for $I < 24$ which
provides the redshift range of the populations seen in $B$ and $I$. The
depletion curve can be reproduced with two redshift populations with $60\% \pm
10\%$ of the $B$ galaxies between $z=0.9$ and $z=1.1$ and the remaining at a
redshift close to $z=3$. The $I$ selected population is similar but with a
minimum extending from the $B$ inner critical line to $R_I=60"$. Whatever the
cosmological model, the $I$-selected galaxies spread up to a larger redshift
with about 20\% above $z > 4$. Using a model for the gravitational potential,
the locations of the two extreme critical lines for the B and I galaxies favour
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$-dominated flat universes with a cosmological
 constant ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. The result is confirmed by a preliminary
investigation of A370. We discuss the method to search the "last critical line"
and the various biases.
