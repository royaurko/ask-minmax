There is an increasing interest in executing complex analyses over large
graphs, many of which require processing a large number of multi-hop
neighborhoods or subgraphs. Examples include ego network analysis, motif
counting, personalized recommendations, and others. These tasks are not well
served by existing vertex-centric graph processing frameworks, where user
programs are only able to directly access the state of a single vertex. This
paper introduces NSCALE, a novel end-to-end graph processing framework that
enables the distributed execution of complex subgraph-centric analytics over
large-scale graphs in the cloud. NSCALE enables users to write programs at the
level of subgraphs rather than at the level of vertices. Unlike most previous
graph processing frameworks, which apply the user program to the entire graph,
NSCALE allows users to declaratively specify subgraphs of interest. Our
framework includes a novel graph extraction and packing (GEP) module that
utilizes a cost-based optimizer to partition and pack the subgraphs of interest
into memory on as few machines as possible. The distributed execution engine
then takes over and runs the user program in parallel, while respecting the
scope of the various subgraphs. Our experimental results show
orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance and drastic reductions in the
cost of analytics compared to vertex-centric approaches.
