The multiplicity difference correlators between two well-separated bins in
high-energy heavy-ion collisions are studied as a means to detect evidence of a
first-order quark-hadron phase transition. Analytical expressions for the
scaled factorial moments of multiplicity difference distribution are obtained
for small bin size $\delta$ with mean multiplicity in the bin ${\bar s}\le 1.0$
within Ginzburg-Landau description. The scaling behaviors between the moments
are still valid, though they behave completely different from the so-called
intermittency patterns. A universal exponent $\gamma=1.4066$ is given to
describe the dynamical fluctuations in the phase transition in small $\delta$
limit.
