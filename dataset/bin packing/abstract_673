We report new experimental results on granular compaction under consecutive
vertical taps. The evolution of the mean volume fraction and of the mean
potential energy of a granular packing presents a slow densification until a
final steady-state, and is reminiscent to usual relaxation in glasses via a
stretched exponential law. The intensity of the taps seems to rule the
characteristic time of the relaxation according to an Arrhenius's type relation
>. Finally, the analysis of the vertical volume fraction profile reveals an
almost homogeneous densification in the packing.
