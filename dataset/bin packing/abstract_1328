In this paper, we assume that $G$ is a finitely generated torsion free
non-elementary Kleinian group with $\Omega(G)$ nonempty. We show that the
maximal number of elements of $G$ that can be pinched is precisely the maximal
number of rank 1 parabolic subgroups that any group isomorphic to $G$ may
contain. A group with this largest number of rank 1 maximal parabolic
subgroups is called {\it maximally parabolic}. We show such groups exist. We
state our main theorems concisely here.
  Theorem I. The limit set of a maximally parabolic group is a circle packing;
that is, every component of its regular set is a round disc.
  Theorem II. A maximally parabolic group is geometrically finite.
  Theorem III. A maximally parabolic pinched function group is determined up
to conjugacy in $PSL(2,{\bf C})$ by its abstract isomorphism class and its
parabolic elements.
