This paper provides an alternative approach referred to as pseudo-predictor
feedback (PPF) for stabilization of linear systems with multiple input delays.
Differently from the traditional predictor feedback which is from the model
reduction appoint of view, the proposed PPF utilizes the idea of prediction by
generalizing the corresponding results for linear systems with a single input
delay to the case of multiple input delays. Since the PPF will generally lead
to distributed controllers, a truncated pseudopredictor feedback (TPPF)
approach is established instead which gives finite dimensional controllers. It
is shown that the TPPF can compensate arbitrarily large yet bounded delays as
long as the open-loop system is only polynomially unstable. The proposed TPPF
approach is then used to solve the consensus problems for multi-agent systems
characterized by linear systems with multiple input delays. Numerical examples
show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
