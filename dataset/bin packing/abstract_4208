Based on nonrelativistic QCD factorization scheme, we present the first
complete next-to-leading order study on the yield and polarization of
Upsilon(1S,2S,3S) hadroproduction. By using the color-octet long-distance
matrix elements obtained from fits of the experimental measurements on Upsilon
yield and polarization at the Tevatron and LHC, our results can explain the
measurements on the yield very well, and for the polarizations of
Upsilon(1S,2S,3S), they are in (good, good, bad) agreement with recent CMS
measurement, but still have some distance from the CDF measurement.
