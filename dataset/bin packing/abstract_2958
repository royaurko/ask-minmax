We construct asymptotic arguments for the relative efficiency of
rejection-free Monte Carlo (MC) methods compared to the standard MC method. We
find that the efficiency is proportional to $\exp{({const} \beta)}$ in the
Ising, $\sqrt{\beta}$ in the classical XY, and $\beta$ in the classical
Heisenberg spin systems with inverse temperature $\beta$, regardless of the
dimension. The efficiency in hard particle systems is also obtained, and found
to be proportional to $(\rhoc -\rho)^{-d}$ with the closest packing density
$\rhoc$, density $\rho$, and dimension $d$ of the systems. We construct and
implement a rejection-free Monte Carlo method for the hard-disk system. The
RFMC has a greater computational efficiency at high densities, and the density
dependence of the efficiency is as predicted by our arguments.
