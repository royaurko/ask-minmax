We give theorems that can be used to upper bound the densities of packings of
different spherical caps in the unit sphere and of translates of different
convex bodies in Euclidean space. These theorems extend the linear programming
bounds for packings of spherical caps and of convex bodies through the use of
semidefinite programming. We perform explicit computations, obtaining new
bounds for packings of spherical caps of two different sizes and for binary
sphere packings. We also slightly improve bounds for the classical problem of
packing identical spheres.
