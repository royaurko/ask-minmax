Measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy of high-\pT neutral pion neutral
pion production in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV by the PHENIX
experiment are presented. The data included in this paper were collected during
the 2004 RHIC running period and represent approximately an order of magnitude
increase in the number of analyzed events relative to previously published
results. Azimuthal angle distributions of pi^0s detected in the PHENIX
electromagnetic calorimeters are measured relative to the reaction plane
determined event-by-event using the forward and backward beam-beam counters.
Amplitudes of the second Fourier component (v_2) of the angular distributions
are presented as a function of pi^0 transverse momentum p_T for different bins
in collision centrality. Measured reaction plane dependent pi^0 yields are used
to determine the azimuthal dependence of the pi^0 suppression as a function of
p_T, R_AA (Delta phi,p_T). A jet-quenching motivated geometric analysis is
presented that attempts to simultaneously describe the centrality dependence
and reaction plane angle dependence of the pi^0 suppression in terms of the
path lengths of hypothetical parent partons in the medium. This set of results
allows for a detailed examination of the influence of geometry in the collision
region, and of the interplay between collective flow and jet-quenching effects
along the azimuthal axis.
