The series of equilibrium states reached by disordered packings of rigid,
frictionless discs in two dimensions, under gradually varying stress, are
studied by numerical simulations. Statistical properties of trajectories in
configuration space are found to be independent of specific assumptions ruling
granular dynamics, and determined by geometry only. A monotonic increase in
some macroscopic loading parameter causes a discrete sequence of
rearrangements. For a biaxial compression, we show that, due to the statistical
importance of such events of large magnitudes, the dependence of the resulting
strain on stress direction is a Levy flight in the thermodynamic limit.
