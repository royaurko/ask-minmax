A molecular solid C$_{50}$Cl$_{10}$ with possible crystalline structures,
including the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) phase, the face-centered cubic (fcc)
phase, and a hexagonal monolayer, is predicted in terms of first-principles
calculation within the density functional theory. The stable structures are
determined from the total-energy calculations, where the hcp phase is uncovered
more stable than the fcc phase and the hexagonal monolayer in energy per
molecule. The energy bands and density of states for hcp and fcc
C$_{50}$Cl$_{10}$ are presented. The results show that C$_{50}$Cl% $_{10}$
molecules can form either a hcp or fcc indirect-gap band insulator or an
insulating hexagonal monolayer.
