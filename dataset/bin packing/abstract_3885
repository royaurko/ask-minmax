Bauer and Itzykson showed that associated to each labeled map embedded on an
oriented Riemann surface there was a group generated by a pair of permutations.
  From this result an algorithm may be constructed for enumerating labeled
maps, and this construction is easily augmented to bin the numbers by the genus
of the surface the map is embedded in. The results agree with the calculations
of Harer and Zagier of 1-vertex maps; with those of Bessis, Itzykson, and Zuber
of 4-valent maps; and with those of Ercolani, McLaughlin, and Pierce for
$2\nu$-valent maps. We then modify this algorithm to one which counts
unoriented maps or Mobius graphs. The results in this case agree with the
calculation of Goulden and Jackson on 1-vertex unoriented maps.
