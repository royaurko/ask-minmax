An oriented graph is a directed graph which can be obtained from a simple
undirected graph by orienting its edges. In this paper we show that any
oriented graph G on n vertices with minimum indegree and outdegree at least
(1/2-o(1))n contains a packing of cyclic triangles covering all but at most 3
vertices. This almost answers a question of Cuckler and Yuster and is best
possible, since for n = 3 mod 18 there is a tournament with no perfect triangle
packing and with all indegrees and outdegrees (n-1)/2 or (n-1)/2 \pm 1. Under
the same hypotheses, we also show that one can embed any prescribed almost
1-factor, i.e. for any sequence n_1,...,n_t with n_1+...+n_t < n-O(1) we can
find a vertex-disjoint collection of directed cycles with lengths n_1,...,n_t.
In addition, under quite general conditions on the n_i we can remove the O(1)
additive error and find a prescribed 1-factor.
