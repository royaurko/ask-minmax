Commodity prices depend on supply and demand. With an uneven distribution of
resources, prices are high at locations starved of commodity and low where it
is abundant. We introduce an agent-based model in which agents set their prices
to maximize profit. At steady state, the market self-organizes into three
groups: excess producers, consumers, and balanced agents. When resources are
scarce, prices rise sharply at a turning point due to the disappearance of
excess producers. Market data of commodities provide evidence of turning points
for essential commodities, as well as a yield point for non-essential ones.
