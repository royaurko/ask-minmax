Photonic metamaterials are man-made structures composed of tailored micro- or
nanostructured metallo-dielectric sub-wavelength building blocks that are
densely packed into an effective material. This deceptively simple, yet
powerful, truly revolutionary concept allows for achieving novel, unusual, and
sometimes even unheard-of optical properties, such as magnetism at optical
frequencies, negative refractive indices, large positive refractive indices,
zero reflection via impedance matching, perfect absorption, giant circular
dichroism, or enhanced nonlinear optical properties. Possible applications of
metamaterials comprise ultrahigh-resolution imaging systems, compact
polarization optics, and cloaking devices. This review describes the
experimental progress recently made fabricating three-dimensional metamaterial
structures and discusses some remaining future challenges.
