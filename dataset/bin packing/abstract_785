We perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations of dense liquids composed
of bidisperse dimer- and ellipse-shaped particles in 2D that interact via
repulsive contact forces. We measure the structural relaxation times obtained
from the long-time decay of the self-part of the intermediate scattering
function for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom (DOF) as a
function of packing fraction \phi, temperature T, and aspect ratio \alpha. We
are able to collapse the \phi and T-dependent structural relaxation times for
disks, and dimers and ellipses over a wide range of \alpha, onto a universal
scaling function {\cal F}_{\pm}(|\phi-\phi_0|,T,\alpha), which is similar to
that employed in previous studies of dense liquids composed of purely repulsive
spherical particles in 3D. {\cal F_{\pm}} for both the translational and
rotational DOF are characterized by the \alpha-dependent scaling exponents \mu
and \delta and packing fraction \phi_0(\alpha) that signals the crossover in
the scaling form {\cal F}_{\pm} from hard-particle dynamics to super-Arrhenius
behavior for each aspect ratio. We find that the fragility at \phi_0,
m(\phi_0), decreases monotonically with increasing aspect ratio for both
ellipses and dimers. Moreover, the results for the slow dynamics of dense
liquids composed of dimer- and ellipse-shaped particles are qualitatively the
same, despite the fact that zero-temperature static packings of dimers are
isostatic, while static packings of ellipses are hypostatic.
