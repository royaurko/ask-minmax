We show theoretically by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation with a classical spin model on a two-dimensional system that both
magnetic skyrmions and skyrmion lattices can be moved with microwave magnetic
fields. The mechanism is enabled by breaking the axial symmetry of the
skyrmion, for example through application of a static in-plane external field.
The net velocity of the skyrmion depends on the frequency and amplitude of the
microwave fields as well as the strength of the in-plane field. The maximum
velocity is found where the frequency of the microwave coincides with the
resonance frequency of the breathing mode of the skyrmions.
