In this paper we describe the intersection between the balls of maximal
symplectic packings of $\P^2$. This analysis shows the existence of singular
points for maximal packings of $\P^2$ by more than three equal balls. It also
yields a construction of a class of very regular examples of maximal packings
by five balls.
