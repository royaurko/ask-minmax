A 16-channel digital TDC chip has been built for the DIRC Cherenkov counter
of the BaBar experiment at the SLAC B-factory (Stanford, USA). The binning is
0.5 ns, the conversion time 32 ns and the full-scale 32 mus. The data driven
architecture integrates channel buffering and selective readout of data falling
within a programmable time window. The time measuring scale is constantly
locked to the phase of the (external) clock. The linearity is better than 80 ps
rms. The dead time loss is less than 0.1% for incoherent random input at a rate
of 100 khz on each channel. At such a rate the power dissipation is less than
100 mw. The die size is 36 mm2.
