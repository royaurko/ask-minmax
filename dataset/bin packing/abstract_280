Static packings of perfectly rigid particles are investigated theoretically
and numerically. The problem of finding the contact forces in such packings is
formulated mathematically. Letting the values of the contact forces define a
vector in a high-dimensional space enable us to show that the set of all
possible contact forces is convex, facilitating its numerical exploration. It
is also found that the boundary of the set is connected with the presence of
sliding contacts, suggesting that a stable packing should not have more than
2M-3N sliding contacts in two dimensions, where M is the number of contacts and
N is the number of particles.
  These results were used to analyze packings generated in different ways by
either molecular dynamics or contact dynamics simulations. The dimension of the
set of possible forces and the number of sliding contacts agrees with the
theoretical expectations. The indeterminacy of each component of the contact
forces are found, as well as the an estimate for the diameter of the set of
possible contact forces. We also show that contacts with high indeterminacy are
located on force chains. The question of whether the simulation methods can
represent a packing's memory of its formation is addressed.
