The average extensive air shower longitudinal development profile as a
function of shower age in the energy range from 10$^{17}$ to 10$^{18}$eV is
measured using data from the hybrid HiRes/MIA experiment. An angular bin signal
based Cerenkov light component subtraction method and a shower maximum fitting
method using a local parabolic function are used to correct and normalize the
data. The Gaisser-Hillas and Greisen functions work equally well for describing
the shower profile. The Gaussian function is a poor fit. A simple scale-free
function is proposed and fits the data equally well. The best-fit parameters
for the above functions are determined.
