In this paper, we propose a decision-aided scheme for parallel SC-List
decoding of polar codes. At the parallel SC-List decoder, each survival path is
extended based on multiple information bits, therefore the number of split
paths becomes very large and the sorting to find the top L paths becomes very
complex. We propose a decision-aided scheme to reduce the number of split paths
and thus reduce the sorting complexity.
