We construct colliding plane wave solutions in higher dimensional gravity
theory with dilaton and higher form flux, which appears naturally in the low
energy theory of string theory. Especially, the role of the junction condition
in constructing the solutions is emphasized. Our results not only include the
previously known CPW solutions, but also provide a wide class of new solutions
that is not known in the literature before. We find that late time curvature
singularity is always developed for the solutions we obtained in this paper.
This supports the generalized version of Tipler's theorem in higher dimensional
supergravity.
