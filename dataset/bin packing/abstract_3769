We have investigated the fractal characteristics and shape complexity of the
fracture surfaces of swelled isotactic polypropylene Y1600 in supercritical
carbon dioxide fluid through the consideration of the statistics of the islands
in binary SEM images. The distributions of area $A$, perimeter $L$, and shape
complexity $C$ follow power laws $p(A)\sim A^{-(\mu_A+1)}$, $p(L)\sim
L^{-(\mu_L+1)}$, and $p(C)\sim C^{-(\nu+1)}$, with the scaling ranges spanning
over two decades. The perimeter and shape complexity scale respectively as
$L\sim A^{D/2}$ and $C\sim A^q$ in two scaling regions delimited by $A\approx
10^3$. The fractal dimension and shape complexity increase when the temperature
decreases. In addition, the relationships among different power-law scaling
exponents $\mu_A$, $\mu_B$, $\nu$, $D$, and $q$ have been derived analytically,
assuming that $A$, $L$, and $C$ follow power-law distributions.
