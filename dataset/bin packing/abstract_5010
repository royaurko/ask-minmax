We introduce the snowblower problem (SBP), a new optimization problem that is
closely related to milling problems and to some material-handling problems. The
objective in the SBP is to compute a short tour for the snowblower to follow to
remove all the snow from a domain (driveway, sidewalk, etc.). When a snowblower
passes over each region along the tour, it displaces snow into a nearby region.
The constraint is that if the snow is piled too high, then the snowblower
cannot clear the pile.
  We give an algorithmic study of the SBP. We show that in general, the problem
is NP-complete, and we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for
removing snow under various assumptions about the operation of the snowblower.
Most commercially-available snowblowers allow the user to control the direction
in which the snow is thrown. We differentiate between the cases in which the
snow can be thrown in any direction, in any direction except backwards, and
only to the right. For all cases, we give constant-factor approximation
algorithms; the constants increase as the throw direction becomes more
restricted.
  Our results are also applicable to robotic vacuuming (or lawnmowing) with
bounded capacity dust bin and to some versions of material-handling problems,
in which the goal is to rearrange cartons on the floor of a warehouse.
