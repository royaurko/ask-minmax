We present new experimental results on the mechanical behavior of static
granular assemblies confined in a vertical column. Our measurements confirm,
for the first time, the universal Janssen's scaling for the stress saturation
curve. We show consequently, in the context of isotropic elasticity, a relation
between the Poisson ratio and granular packing fraction. Moreover, using a
systematic study of the overshoot effect created by a top mass equal to the
saturation mass, we show behaviors reproduced qualitatively by isotropic
elastic materials but in the case of a granular assembly of a spectacular
amplitude. These experimental results are strong tests for any theory of
granular matter.
