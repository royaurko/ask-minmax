We study through controlled numerical simulation the ground state properties
of spin-polarized strongly interacting fermi gas in an anisotropic optical
lattice, which is described by an effective one-dimensional general Hubbard
model with particle correlated hopping rate. We show that the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) type of state, while enhanced by a
negative correlated hopping rate, can be completely suppressed by positive
particle correlated hopping, yielding to an unusual magnetic phase even for
particles with on-site attractive interaction We also find several different
phase separation patterns for these atoms in an inhomogeneous harmonic trap,
depending on the correlated hopping rate.
