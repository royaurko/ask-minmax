Superconductivity was achieved in PrFeAsO by partially substituting Pr^{3+}
with Sr^{2+}. The electrical transport properties and structure of this new
superconductor Pr_{1-x}Sr_xFeAsO at different doping levels (x = 0.05$\sim$
0.25) were investigated systematically. It was found that the lattice constants
(a-axis and c-axis) increase monotonously with Sr or hole concentration. The
superconducting transition temperature at about 16.3 K (95% $\rho_n$) was
observed around the doping level of 0.20$\sim$ 0.25. A detailed investigation
was carried out in the sample with doping level of x = 0.25. The domination of
hole-like charge carriers in this material was confirmed by Hall effect
measurements. The magnetoresistance (MR) behavior can be well described by a
simple two-band model. The upper critical field of the sample with T_c = 16.3 K
(x = 0.25) was estimated to be beyond 45 Tesla. Our results suggest that the
hole-doped samples may have higher upper critical fields comparing to the
electron-doped ones, due to the higher quasi-particle density of states at the
Fermi level.
