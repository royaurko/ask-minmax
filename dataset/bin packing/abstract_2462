We investigate the background dynamics when dark energy is coupled to dark
matter in the universe described by Einstein cosmology and Loop Quantum
Cosmology. We introduce a new general form of dark sector coupling, which
presents us a more complicated dynamical phase space. Differences in the phase
space in obtaining the accelerated scaling attractor in Einstein cosmology and
Loop Quantum Cosmology are disclosed.
