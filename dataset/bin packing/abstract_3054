There are applications, which require MeV-range multiple-beams consisting of
a large number of identical highly packed beamlets. The multiple-beam RFQ
(MB-RFQ) arranged as a matrix array of longitudinal rod-electrodes is
appropriate candidate. A configuration of MB-RFQ resonator should ensure
identical quadrupole fields in every accelerating channel. The MB-RFQ
resonators based on TEM transmission lines are studied. The resonators are
designed by a periodical multiplication of a 4-rod unit cell in transverse
direction. To understand fields of resonator the normal mode technique is
applied. Novel configurations of MB-RFQ resonators based on these normal modes
are generated. The RF properties of resonators are verified with computer
simulations done with MAFIA code. Beam dynamics study for the initial 400-keV
MB-RFQ has been performed using PARMTEQ code. The MB-RFQ parameters and the
results of beam dynamics simulations are presented. The calculated beam
transmission is 33% at injection of 50-keV, 20mA deuteron beam.
