Recent studies of relativistic jet sources in the Galaxy, also known as
microquasars, have been very useful in trying to understand the
accretion/ejection processes that take place near compact objects. However, the
number of sources involved in such studies is still small. In an attempt to
increase the number of known microquasars we have carried out a search for new
Radio Emitting X-ray Binaries (REXBs). These sources are the ones to be
observed later with VLBI techniques to unveil their possible microquasar
nature. To this end, we have performed a cross-identification between the X-ray
ROSAT all sky survey Bright Source Catalog (RBSC) and the radio NRAO VLA Sky
Survey (NVSS) catalogs under very restrictive selection criteria for sources
with |b|<5 degrees. We have also conducted a deep observational radio and
optical study for six of the selected candidates. At the end of this process
two of the candidates appear to be promising, and deserve additional
observations aimed to confirm their proposed microquasar nature.
