This is the first part of an Halpha kinematics follow-up survey of the SINGS
sample. The data for 28 galaxies are presented. The observations were done on
three different telescopes with FaNTOmM, an integral field photon counting
spectrometer, installed in the respective focal reducer of each telescope. The
data reduction was done through a newly built pipeline with the aim of
producing the most homogenous data set possible. Adaptive spatial binning was
applied to the data cubes in order to get a constant signal-to-noise ratio
across the field of view. Radial velocity and monochromatic maps were generated
using a new algorithm and the kinematical parameters were derived using
tilted-ring models.
