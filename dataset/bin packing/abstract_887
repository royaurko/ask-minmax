We prepare packings of frictional tetrahedra with volume fractions {\phi}
ranging from 0.469 to 0.622 using three different experimental protocols under
isobaric conditions. Analysis via X-ray micro-tomography reveals that the
contact number Z grows with {\phi}, but does depend on the preparation
protocol. While there exist four different types of contacts in tetrahedra
packings, our analysis shows that the edge-to-face contacts contribute about
50% of the total increase in Z. The number of constraints per particle C
increases also with {\phi} and even the loosest packings are strongly
hyperstatic i.e. mechanically over-determined with C approximately twice the
degrees of freedom each particle possesses.
