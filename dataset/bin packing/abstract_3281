Numerical simulations of soft-core frictionless disks in two dimensions are
carried out to study behavior of a simple liquid as a function of thermal
temperature $T$, packing fraction $\phi$, and uniform applied shear strain rate
$\dot\gamma$. Inferring the hard-core limit from our soft-core results, we find
that it depends on the two parameters $\phi$ and $T/\dot\gamma$.
$T/\dot\gamma\to 0$ defines the athermal limit in which a shear driven jamming
transition occurs at a well defined $\phi_J$. $T/\dot\gamma\to\infty$ defines
the thermalized limit where an equilibrium glass transition may take place at a
$\phi_G$. This conclusion argues that athermal jamming and equilibrium glassy
behavior are not controlled by the same critical point. Preliminary results
suggest $\phi_G <\phi_J$.
