We say that a graph G has a perfect H-packing if there exists a set of
vertex-disjoint copies of H which cover all the vertices in G. We consider
various problems concerning perfect H-packings: Given positive integers n, r,
D, we characterise the edge density threshold that ensures a perfect
K_r-packing in any graph G on n vertices and with minimum degree at least D. We
also give two conjectures concerning degree sequence conditions which force a
graph to contain a perfect H-packing. Other related embedding problems are also
considered. Indeed, we give a structural result concerning K_r-free graphs that
satisfy a certain degree sequence condition.
