A packing of spherical caps on the surface of a sphere (that is, a spherical
code) is called rigid or jammed if it is isolated within the space of packings.
In other words, aside from applying a global isometry, the packing cannot be
deformed. In this paper, we systematically study the rigidity of spherical
codes, particularly kissing configurations. One surprise is that the kissing
configuration of the Coxeter-Todd lattice is not jammed, despite being locally
jammed (each individual cap is held in place if its neighbors are fixed); in
this respect, the Coxeter-Todd lattice is analogous to the face-centered cubic
lattice in three dimensions. By contrast, we find that many other packings have
jammed kissing configurations, including the Barnes-Wall lattice and all of the
best kissing configurations known in four through twelve dimensions. Jamming
seems to become much less common for large kissing configurations in higher
dimensions, and in particular it fails for the best kissing configurations
known in 25 through 31 dimensions. Motivated by this phenomenon, we find new
kissing configurations in these dimensions, which improve on the records set in
1982 by the laminated lattices.
