General consequences of mass mixing between the ordinary Z boson and a
relatively light Z_d boson, the "dark" Z, arising from a U(1)_d gauge symmetry,
associated with a hidden sector such as dark matter, are examined. New effects
beyond kinetic mixing are emphasized. Z-Z_d mixing introduces a new source of
low energy parity violation well explored by possible future atomic parity
violation and planned polarized electron scattering experiments. Rare K (B)
meson decays into pi (K) l^+ l^- (l = e, mu) and pi (K) nu anti-nu are found to
already place tight constraints on the size of Z-Z_d mixing. Those
sensitivities can be further improved with future dedicated searches at K and B
factories as well as binned studies of existing data. Z-Z_d mixing can also
lead to the Higgs decay H -> Z Z_d, followed by Z -> l_1^+ l_1^- and Z_d ->
l_2^+ l_2^- or "missing energy", providing a potential hidden sector discovery
channel at the LHC. An illustrative realization of these effects in a 2 Higgs
doublet model is presented.
