In this article an explicit method (relying on representation theory) to
construct packings in Grassmannian space is presented. Infinite families of
configurations having only one non-trivial set of principal angles are found
using 2-transitive groups. These packings are proved to reach the simplex bound
and are therefore optimal w.r.t. the chordal distance. The construction is
illustrated by an example on the symmetric group. Then some natural extends and
consequences of this situation are given.
