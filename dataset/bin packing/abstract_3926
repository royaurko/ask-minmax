This paper considers three kinds of length sequences of the complete genome.
Detrended fluctuation analysis, spectral analysis, and the mean distance
spanned within time $L$ are used to discuss the correlation property of these
sequences. The values of the exponents from these methods of these three kinds
of length sequences of bacteria indicate that the long-range correlations exist
in most of these sequences. The correlation have a rich variety of behaviours
including the presence of anti-correlations. Further more, using the exponent
$\gamma$, it is found that these correlations are all linear ($\gamma=1.0\pm
0.03$). It is also found that these sequences exhibit $1/f$ noise in some
interval of frequency ($f>1$). The length of this interval of frequency depends
on the length of the sequence. The shape of the periodogram in $f>1$ exhibits
some periodicity. The period seems to depend on the length and the complexity
of the length sequence.
