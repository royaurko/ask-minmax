We have measured the clustering properties of low-redshift (z < 0.3) sub-mm
galaxies detected at 250 micron in the Herschel-ATLAS Science Demonstration
Phase (SDP) field. We selected a sample for which we have high-quality
spectroscopic redshifts, obtained from reliably matching the 250-micron sources
to a complete (for r < 19.4) sample of galaxies from the GAMA database. Both
the angular and spatial clustering strength are measured for all z < 0.3
sources as well as for five redshift slices with thickness delta z=0.05 in the
range 0.05 < z < 0.3. Our measured spatial clustering length r_0 is comparable
to that of optically-selected, moderately star-forming (blue) galaxies: we find
values around 5 Mpc. One of the redshift bins contains an interesting
structure, at z = 0.164.
