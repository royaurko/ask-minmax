This paper describes the local density inequality approach to getting upper
bounds for sphere packing densities in R^n. This approach was first suggested
by L. Fejes-Toth in 1956 to prove the Kepler conjecture that the densest sphere
packing in R^3 is the "cannonball packing". The approaches of L. Fejes-Toth,
W.-Y. Hsiang, and T. Hales to the Kepler conjecture are each based on
(different) local density inequalities. Recently T. Hales and S. P. Ferguson
have presented extensive details carrying out a modified version of the
otrignal Hales approach to prove the Kepler conjecture. We describe the
particular local density inequality undelying the Hales and Ferguson approach
and sketch some features of their proof.
