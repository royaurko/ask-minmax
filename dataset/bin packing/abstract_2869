An accurate and systematic equation of state for the hard-core one-component
plasma (HCOCP) is obtained. The result is based on the Hubbard-Schofield
transformation which yields the field-theoretical Hamiltonian, with
coefficients expressed in terms of equilibrium correlation functions of the
reference hard-core fluid. Explicit calculations were performed using the
Gaussian approximation for the effective Hamiltonian and known thermodynamic
and structural properties of the reference hard-core fluid. For small values of
the plasma parameter G and packing fraction the Debye-Huckel result is
recovered, while for G>>1, the excess free energy F_ex and internal U_{ex}
energy depend linearly on G. The obtained expression for U_ex is in a good
agreement with the available Monte Carlo data for the HCOCP. We also analyse
the validity of the widely used approximation, which represents the free energy
as a sum of the hard-core and electrostatic part.
