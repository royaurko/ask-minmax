A significant dependence on the relative humidity H for the apparent mass
(Mapp) measured at the bottom of a granular packing inside a vertical tube in
relative motion is demonstrated experimentally. While the predictions of
Janssen's model are verified for all values of H investigated (25%< H <80%),
Mapp increases with time towards a limiting value at high relative humidities
(H>60%) but remains constant at lower ones (H=25%). The corresponding Janssen
length is nearly independent of the tube velocity for H>60% but decreases
markedly for H=25%. Other differences are observed on the motion of individual
beads in the packing. For H=25%, they are almost motionless while the mean
particle fraction of the packing remains constant; for H>60% the bead motion is
much more significant and the mean particle fraction decreases. The dependence
of these results on the bead diameter and their interpretation in terms of the
influence of capillary forces are discussed.
