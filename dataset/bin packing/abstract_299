Finding the densest sphere packing in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is an outstanding fundamental problem with relevance in many
fields, including the ground states of molecular systems, colloidal crystal
structures, coding theory, discrete geometry, number theory, and biological
systems. Numerically generating the densest sphere packings becomes very
challenging in high dimensions due to an exponentially increasing number of
possible sphere contacts and sphere configurations, even for the restricted
problem of finding the densest lattice sphere packings. In this paper, we apply
the Torquato-Jiao packing algorithm, which is a method based on solving a
sequence of linear programs, to robustly reproduce the densest known lattice
sphere packings for dimensions 2 through 19. We show that the TJ algorithm is
appreciably more efficient at solving these problems than previously published
methods. Indeed, in some dimensions, the former procedure can be as much as
three orders of magnitude faster at finding the optimal solutions than earlier
ones. We also study the suboptimal local density-maxima solutions (inherent
structures or "extreme" lattices) to gain insight about the nature of the
topography of the "density" landscape.
