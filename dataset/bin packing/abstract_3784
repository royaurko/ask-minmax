We have investigated the thermodynamical properties of the Universe with dark
energy. Adopting the usual assumption in deriving the constant co-moving
entropy density that the physical volume and the temperature are independent,
we observed some strange thermodynamical behaviors. However, these strange
behaviors disappeared if we consider the realistic situation that the physical
volume and the temperature of the Universe are related. Based on the well known
correspondence between the Friedmann equation and the first law of
thermodynamics of the apparent horizon, we argued that the apparent horizon is
the physical horizon in dealing with thermodynamics problems. We have
concentrated on the volume of the Universe within the apparent horizon and
considered that the Universe is in thermal equilibrium with the Hawking
temperature on the apparent horizon. For dark energy with $w\ge -1$, the
holographic principle and the generalized second law are always respected.
