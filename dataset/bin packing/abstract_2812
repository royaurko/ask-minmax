For treatment of the layers below the crust of a neutron star it is useful to
employ a relativistic model involving three independently moving constituents,
representing superfluid neutrons, superfluid protons, and degenerate negatively
charged leptons. A Kalb Ramond type formulation is used here to develop such a
model for the specific purpose of application at the semi macroscopic level
characterised by lengthscales that are long compared with the separation
between the highly localised and densely packed proton vortices of the
Abrikosov type lattice that carries the main part of the magnetic flux, but
that are short compared with the separation between the neutron vortices.
