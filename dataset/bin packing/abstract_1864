We theoretically study the process of photoelectron emission of the Helium
atom by a high-intensity short-wavelength laser at a resonance condition of the
residual singly charged ion. Photoionization followed by strong resonance
coupling in the ion leads to a change in the photoelectron spectrum due to Rabi
oscillations in the residual ion. Similarly to resonance fluorescence at high
laser intensity, the photoelectron spectrum at high intensities evolves into a
multi-peaked structure. The number of peaks in the photoelectron spectrum is
related to the number of Rabi cycles following the photoionization process.
Moreover, the strong laser-induced coupling to nonresonant states of the
residual ion have an imprint on the photoelectron spectrum, leading to
additional, isolated peaks at the lower or higher energy sides. The effect
should be observable at current seeded XUV free-electron lasers and persists
after volume integration in a realistic experimental geometry.
