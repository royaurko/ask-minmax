Openoffice.org is a popular, free and open source office product. This
product is used by millions of people and developed, maintained and extended by
thousands of developers worldwide. Playing a dominant role in the web, web
services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of
the most popular, free and open source web service engines. The framework
presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is
capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to
enhance web services functionality in office products are Excel Web Services
and UNO Web Service Proxy. Excel Web Services is combined with Microsoft
SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different
perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web Service
Proxy is implemented with Java Web Services Developer Pack and enables basic
web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work
presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we
expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and
feature richness in those products.
