Electrical conductivity measurements on a 2D packing of metallic beads have
been performed to study internal rearrangements in weakly pertubed granular
materials. Small thermal perturbations lead to large non gaussian conductance
fluctuations. These fluctuations are found to be intermittent and gathered in
bursts. The distributions of the waiting time between to peaks is found to be a
power law inside bursts. The exponent is independent of the bead network, the
intensity of the perturbation and external stress. these bursts are interpreted
as the signature of individual bead creep rather than collective vaults
reorganisations. We propose a simple model linking the exponent of the waiting
time distribution to the roughness exponent of the surface of the beads.
