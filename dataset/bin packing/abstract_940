We investigate whether kernelization results can be obtained if we restrict
kernelization algorithms to run in logarithmic space. This restriction for
kernelization is motivated by the question of what results are attainable for
preprocessing via simple and/or local reduction rules. We find kernelizations
for d-Hitting Set(k), d-Set Packing(k), Edge Dominating Set(k) and a number of
hitting and packing problems in graphs, each running in logspace. Additionally,
we return to the question of linear-time kernelization. For d-Hitting Set(k) a
linear-time kernelization was given by van Bevern [Algorithmica (2014)]. We
give a simpler procedure and save a large constant factor in the size bound.
Furthermore, we show that we can obtain a linear-time kernel for d-Set
Packing(k) as well.
