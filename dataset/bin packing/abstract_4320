We consider direct diphoton production in hadron collisions. We compute the
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD radiative corrections at the
fully-differential level. Our calculation uses the qT subtraction formalism and
it is implemented in a parton level Monte Carlo program, which allows the user
to apply arbitrary kinematical cuts on the final-state photons and the
associated jet activity, and to compute the corresponding distributions in the
form of bin histograms. We present selected numerical results related to Higgs
boson searches at the LHC and the Tevatron, and we show how the NNLO
corrections to diphoton production are relevant to understand the main
background of the decay channel H -> \gamma \gamma of the Higgs boson H.
