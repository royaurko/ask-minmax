We study the mechanical response generated by local deformations in jammed
packings of rigid disks. Based on discrete element simulations we determine the
critical force of the local perturbation that is needed to break the mechanical
equilibrium and examine the generated displacement field. Displacements decay
as a power law of the distance from the perturbation point. The decay exponent
and the critical force exhibit nontrivial dependence on the friction: Both
quantities are nonmonotonic and have a sharp maximum at the friction
coefficient 0.1. We find that the mechanical response properties are closely
related to the problem of force-indeterminacy where similar nonmonotonic
behavior was observed previously. We establish direct connection between the
critical force and the ensemble of static force networks.
