We presents in this paper a novel fish classification methodology based on a
combination between robust feature selection, image segmentation and
geometrical parameter techniques using Artificial Neural Network and Decision
Tree. Unlike existing works for fish classification, which propose descriptors
and do not analyze their individual impacts in the whole classification task
and do not make the combination between the feature selection, image
segmentation and geometrical parameter, we propose a general set of features
extraction using robust feature selection, image segmentation and geometrical
parameter and their correspondent weights that should be used as a priori
information by the classifier. In this sense, instead of studying techniques
for improving the classifiers structure itself, we consider it as a black box
and focus our research in the determination of which input information must
bring a robust fish discrimination.The main contribution of this paper is
enhancement recognize and classify fishes based on digital image and To develop
and implement a novel fish recognition prototype using global feature
extraction, image segmentation and geometrical parameters, it have the ability
to Categorize the given fish into its cluster and Categorize the clustered fish
into poison or non-poison fish, and categorizes the non-poison fish into its
family .
