We present the first dynamical study of the globular cluster system of NGC
4636. This giant elliptical galaxy is claimed to be extremely dark matter
dominated, according to X-ray observations. Using the VLT with FORS2/MXU, we
obtained velocities for 174 globular clusters. The clusters have projected
galactocentric distances in the range 4 to 70 kpc, the overwhelming majority
lie within 30 kpc. We find some indication for a rotation of the red
(metal-rich) clusters about the minor axis. Out to a radius of 30 kpc, we find
a roughly constant projected velocity dispersion for the blue clusters of ~200
km/s. The red clusters exhibit a distinctly different behavior: at a radius of
about 13 kpc, the velocity dispersion drops by ~50 km/s to about 170 km/s which
then remains constant out to a radius of 30 kpc.
  Using only the blue clusters as dynamical tracers, we perform Jeans-analyses
for different assumptions of the orbital anisotropy. Depending on the
anisotropy and the adopted M/L-values, we find that the dark matter fraction
within one effective radius can vary between 20% and 50% with most a probable
range between 20% and 30%. A main source of uncertainty is the ambiguity of the
velocity dispersion in the outermost bin.
  Although the dark halo mass still cannot be strongly constrained, NGC 4636
does not seem to be extremely dark matter dominated. The derived circular
velocities are also consistent with Modified Newtonian Dynamics.
