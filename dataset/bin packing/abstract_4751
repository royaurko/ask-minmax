We present new precise HIRES radial velocity (RV) data sets of five nearby
stars obtained at Keck Observatory. HD 31253, HD 218566, HD 177830, HD 99492
and HD 74156 are host stars of spectral classes F through K and show radial
velocity variations consistent with new or additional planetary companions in
Keplerian motion. The orbital parameters of the candidate planets in the five
planetary systems span minimum masses of M sin i = 27.43 M_{earth} to M sin i =
8.28 M_{jup}, periods of 17.05 to 4696.95 days and eccentricities ranging from
circular to extremely eccentric (e ~ 0.63). The 5th star, HD 74156, was known
to have both a 52-day and a 2500-day planet, and was claimed to also harbor a
3rd planet at 336d, in apparent support of the "Packed Planetary System"
hypothesis. Our greatly expanded data set for HD 74156 provides strong
confirmation of both the 52-day and 2500-d planets, but strongly contradicts
the existence of a 336-day planet, and offers no significant evidence for any
other planets in the system.
