We consider the effect of intermolecular interactions on the optimal
size-distribution of $N$ hard spheres that occupy a fixed total volume. When we
minimize the free-energy of this system, within the Percus-Yevick
approximation, we find that no solution exists beyond a quite low threshold
($\eta \thickapprox 0.260$). Monte Carlo simulations reveal that beyond this
density, the size-distribution becomes bi-modal. Such distributions cannot be
reproduced within the Percus-Yevick approximation. We present a theoretical
argument that supports the occurrence of a non-monotonic size-distribution and
emphasizing the importance of finite size effects.
