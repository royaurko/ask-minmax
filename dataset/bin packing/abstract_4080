Chandra ACIS observed the field of the extended TeV source HESS J1834-087 for
47 ks. A previous XMM-Newton EPIC observation of the same field revealed a
point-like source (XMMU J183435.3-084443) and an offset region of faint
extended emission. In the low-resolution, binned EPIC images the two appear to
be connected. However, the high-resolution Chandra ACIS images do not support
the alleged connection. Instead, in these images XMMU J183435.3-084443 is
resolved into a point source, CXOU~J183434.9--084443 (L=2.5 x 10e33 ergs/s, for
a distance of 4 kpc; photon index 1.1), and a compact (~20'') nebula with an
isotropic morphology and a softer spectrum (L=4.2 x10e33 ergs/s, photon index
2.7). The nature of the nebula is uncertain. We discuss a dust scattering halo
and a pulsar-wind nebula as possible interpretations. Based on our analysis of
the X-ray data, we re-evaluate the previously suggested interpretations of HESS
J1834-087 and discuss a possible connection to the Fermi LAT source 1FGL
J1834.3-0842c. We also obtained an upper limit of 3 x 10e-14 ergs/s cm^2 on the
unabsorbed flux of the SGR J1833--0832 (in quiescence), which happened to be in
the ACIS field of view.
