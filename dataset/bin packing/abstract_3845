We present a new, model independent method for extracting bounds for the
anomalous $\gamma WW$ couplings from hadron collider experiments. At the
partonic level we introduce a set of three observables which are constructed
from the unpolarized differential cross-section for the process $d\bar{u}\to
W^{-}\gamma$ by appropriate convolution with a set of simple polynomials
depending only on the center-of-mass angle. One of these observables allows for
the direct determination of the anomalous coupling usually denoted by
$\Delta\kappa$, without any simplifying assumptions, and without relying on the
presence of a radiation zero. The other two observables impose two sum rules on
the remaining three anomalous couplings. The inclusion of the structure
functions is discussed in detail for both $p\bar{p}$ and $pp$ colliders. We
show that, whilst for $p\bar{p}$ experiments this can be accomplished
straightforwardly, in the $pp$ case one has to resort to somewhat more
elaborate techniques, such as the binning of events according to their
longitudinal momenta.
