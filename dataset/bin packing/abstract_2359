The relativistic Breit Hamiltonian between electrons is transformed into an
effective vector potential ${\bf A}_i$ for the $i.$th electron, ${\bf A}_i$
having the structure of a recoil--corrected hyperfine operator. Apart from a
small three--body operator, the Dirac--Breit equation is now easier applied to
relativistic magnetic properties of complex systems.
