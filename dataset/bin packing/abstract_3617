We present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of star-forming galaxies
at z~1.4 with FMOS on the Subaru Telescope. We observed K-band selected
galaxies in the SXDS/UDS fields with K<23.9 mag, 1.2<z_ph<1.6, M*>10^{9.5}
Msun, and expected F(Halpha)>10^{-16} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. 71 objects in the
sample have significant detections of Halpha. For these objects, excluding
possible AGNs identified from the BPT diagram, gas-phase metallicities are
obtained from [NII]/Halpha line ratio. The sample is split into three stellar
mass bins, and the spectra are stacked in each stellar mass bin. The
mass-metallicity relation obtained at z~1.4 is located between those at z~0.8
and z~2.2. We constrain an intrinsic scatter to be ~0.1 dex or larger in the
mass-metallicity relation at z~1.4; the scatter may be larger at higher
redshifts. We found trends that the deviation from the mass-metallicity
relation depends on the SFR and the half light radius: Galaxies with higher SFR
and larger half light radii show lower metallicities at a given stellar mass.
One possible scenario for the trends is the infall of pristine gas accreted
from IGM or through merger events. Our data points show larger scatter than the
fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) at z~0.1 and the average metallicities
slightly deviate from the FMR. The compilation of the mass-metallicity
relations at z~3 to z~0.1 shows that they evolve smoothly from z~3 to z~0
without changing the shape so much except for the massive part at z~0.
