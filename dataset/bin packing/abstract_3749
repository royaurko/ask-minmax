Based on deep VLT/ISAAC JHK photometry, we have derived the present-day mass
function of the central starburst cluster NGC 3603 YC (Young Cluster) in the
giant HII region NGC 3603. The effects of field contamination, individual
reddening, and a possible binary contribution are investigated. The MF slopes
resulting from the different methods are compared, and lead to a surprisingly
consistent cluster MF with a slope of Gamma = -0.9 +/- 0.15. Analyzing
different radial annuli around the cluster core, no significant change in the
slope of the MF is observed. However, mass segregation in the cluster is
evidenced by the increasing depletion of the high-mass tail of the stellar mass
distribution with increasing radius. We discuss the indications of mass
segregation with respect to the changes observed in the binned and cumulative
stellar mass functions, and argue that the cumulative function as well as the
fraction of high- to low-mass stars provide better indicators for mass
segregation than the MF slope alone. (abridged)
