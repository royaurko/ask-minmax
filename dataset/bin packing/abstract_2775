We present novel and sharp lower bounds for higher load moments in the
classical problem of mapping $M$ balls into $N$ bins by $q$-universal hashing,
specialized to the case when $M=N$. As a corollary we prove a tight counterpart
for the result about min-entropy condensers due to Dodis, Pietrzak and Wichs
(CRYPTO'14), which has found important applications in key derivation. It
states that condensing $k$ bits of min-entropy into a $k$-bit string
$\epsilon$-close to almost full min-entropy (precisely $
k-\log\log(1/\epsilon)$ bits of entropy) can be achieved by the use of
$q$-independent hashing with $q= \log(1/\epsilon)$. We prove that when given a
source of min-entropy $k$ and aiming at entropy loss $\ell = \log\log
(1/\epsilon) - 3$, the independence level $q=(1-o(1))\log(1/\epsilon)$ is
necessary (for small values of $\epsilon$), which almost matches the positive
result. Besides these asymptotic bounds, we provide clear hard bounds in terms
of Bell numbers and some numerical examples. Our technique is based on an
explicit representation of the load moments in terms of Stirling numbers, some
asymptotic estimates on Stirling numbers and a tricky application of the
Paley-Zygmund inequality. \keywords{ min-entropy condensers, key derivation,
