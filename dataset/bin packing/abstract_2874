The devil's staircase is a term used to describe surface or an equilibrium
phase diagram in which various ordered facets or phases are infinitely closely
packed as a function of some model parameter. A classic example is a 1-D Ising
model [bak] wherein long-range and short range forces compete, and the
periodicity of the gaps between minority species covers all rational values. In
many physical cases, crystal growth proceeds by adding surface layers which
have the lowest energy, but are then frozen in place. The emerging layered
structure is not the thermodynamic ground state, but is uniquely defined by the
growth kinetics. It is shown that for such a system, the grown structure tends
to the equilibrium ground state via a devil's staircase traversing an infinity
of intermediate phases. It would be extremely difficult to deduce the simple
growth law based on measurement made on such an grown structure.
