Recently the 1/R gravity has been proposed in order to explain the
accelerated expansion of the universe. However, it was argued that the 1/R
gravity conflicts with solar system tests. While this statement is true if one
views the 1/R gravity as an effective theory, we find that this difficulty
might be avoided if one treats the 1/R term as a correction to the scalar
curvature term in the high curvature limit $R \gg \mu^2$.
