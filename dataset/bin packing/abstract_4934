{Abridged} A combination of spectroscopy and broadband photometric redshifts
has been used to find the complete redshift distribution of the Hercules sample
of millijansky radio sources. These data have been used to examine the
evolution of the radio luminosity function (RLF) and its high-redshift cut-off.
  New redshifts have been measured for eleven sources, and a further ten upper
limits are given. The total number of sources with known redshifts in the
sample is now 47 (65%). We calculated broadband photometric redshifts for the
remaining one-third of the sample.
  For the luminosity range probed by the present study (P_1.4 > 10^24.5
W/Hz/sr), we use the V/V_max test to show conclusively that there is a deficit
of high-redshift (z > 2-2.5) objects. Comparison with the model RLFs of Dunlop
& Peacock (1990) shows that our data can now exclude pure luminosity evolution.
Two of the models of DP90, and the RLF deduced by direct binning of the data,
both favour a luminosity dependence for the high-redshift cut-off, with
lower-luminosity sources (P_1.4 \simeq 10^24 W/Hz/sr) in decline by z \simeq
1-1.5 while higher-luminosity sources (P_1.4 \simeq 10^{25-26} W/Hz/sr) decline
in comoving number density beyond z \simeq 2-2.5.
