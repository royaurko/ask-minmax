We develop a holographic superconductor in BTZ black hole background with
backreactions. We investigate the influence of the backreaction on the
condensation of the scalar hair and the dynamics of perturbation in the
background spacetime. When the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound is approached, we
argue that only one of two possible operators can reflect the real property of
the condensation in the holographic superconductor. This argument is supported
by the investigation in dynamics.
