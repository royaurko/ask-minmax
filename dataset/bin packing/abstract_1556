Various distribution free goodness-of-fit test procedures have been extracted
from literature. We present two new binning free tests, the univariate
three-region-test and the multivariate energy test. The power of the selected
tests with respect to different slowly varying distortions of experimental
distributions are investigated. None of the tests is optimum for all
distortions. The energy test has high power in many applications and is
superior to the chi^2 test.
