We present an update of the branching ratios for Higgs-boson decays in the
Standard Model. We list results for all relevant branching ratios together with
corresponding uncertainties resulting from input parameters and missing
higher-order corrections. As sources of parametric uncertainties we include the
masses of the charm, bottom, and top quarks as well as the QCD coupling
constant. We compare our results with other predictions in the literature.
