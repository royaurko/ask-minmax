In JHEP {\bf 1304}, 009 (2013) and arXiv:1303.2534 [hep-ph] the {\it reach of
INO experiment} for determination of neutrino mass hierarchy and the
sensitivity to both $\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\theta_{23}$ have been reported,
which are significantly underestimated and drastically different from earlier
studies JHEP {\bf 1107}, 048 (2011), Phys. Rev. D {\bf 81}, 037302 (2010) and
strongly dependent on the flux uncertainties. Here, we clarified that the
effect on oscillation probability due to change of oscillation parameters are
not considered appropriately due to improper binning of data, improper
incorporation of resolutions, and rejection of high energy events $E\gapp $ 10
GeV.
