We fit axisymmetric 3-integral dynamical models to NGC3379 using the
line-of-sight velocity distribution obtained from HST/FOS spectra of the galaxy
center and ground-based long-slit spectroscopy along four position angles, with
the light distribution constrained by WFPC2 and ground-based images. We have
fitted models with inclinations from 29 (intrinsic galaxy type E5) to 90
degrees (intrinsic E1) and black hole masses from 0 to 1e9 M_solar. The
best-fit black hole masses range from 6e7 to 2e8 M_solar, depending on
inclination. The velocity ellipsoid of the best model is not consistent with
either isotropy or a two-integral distribution function. Along the major axis,
the velocity ellipsoid becomes tangential at the innermost bin, radial in the
mid-range radii, and tangential again at the outermost bins. For the acceptable
models, the radial to tangential dispersion in the mid-range radii ranges from
1.1 < sigma_r / sigma_t < 1.7. Compared with these 3-integral models,
2-integral isotropic models overestimate the black hole mass since they cannot
provide adequate radial motion. However, the models presented in this paper
still contain restrictive assumptions-namely assumptions of constant M/L and
spheroidal symmetry-requiring yet more models to study black hole properties in
complete generality.
