Possible explanations of the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe
are the introduction of a dark energy component or the modifications of gravity
at large distances. A particular difference between these scenarios is the
dynamics of the growth of structures. The redshift distribution of galaxy
clusters will probe this growth of structures with large precision. Here we
will investigate how proposed galaxy cluster surveys will allow one to
distinguish the modified gravity scenarios from dark energy models. We find
that cluster counts can distinguish the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model from a
dark energy model, which has the same background evolution, as long as the
amplitude of the primordial power spectrum is constrained by a CMB experiment
like Planck. In order to achieve this, only a couple of hundred clusters in
bins of width Delta-z = 0.1 are required. This should be easily achievable with
forthcoming Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster counts, such as the South Pole Telescope
in conjunction with the Dark Energy Survey.
