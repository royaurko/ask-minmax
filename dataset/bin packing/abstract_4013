It is usually thought that the quintessence as a fundamental scalar field was
already present during the inflationary epoch. While there are various models
in which the quintessence couples to other species, it is attractive to
anticipate a coupling between the quintessence and the inflaton in the very
early universe as well. We consider such a coupling in the context of
k-inflation. The coupling function and the potential of the quintessence are
chosen to be of power law forms. We show such a coupling affects the speed of
sound for the inflaton field as well as the power spectra of perturbations.
