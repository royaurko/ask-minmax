We present a measurement of the cluster X-ray luminosity-temperature relation
out to high redshift (z~0.8). Combined ROSAT PSPC spectra of 91 galaxy clusters
detected in the Wide Angle ROSAT Pointed Survey (WARPS) are simultaneously fit
in redshift and luminosity bins. The resulting temperature and luminosity
measurements of these bins, which occupy a region of the high redshift L-T
relation not previously sampled, are compared to existing measurements at low
redshift in order to constrain the evolution of the L-T relation. We find a
best fit to low redshift (z<0.2) cluster data, at T>1 keV, to be L proportional
to T^(3.15\pm0.06). Our data are consistent with no evolution in the
normalisation of the L-T relation up to z~0.8. Combining our results with ASCA
measurements taken from the literature, we find eta=0.19\pm0.38 (for Omega_0=1,
with 1 sigma errors) where L_Bol is proportional to (1 + z)^eta T^3.15, or
eta=0.60\pm0.38 for Omega_0=0.3. This lack of evolution is considered in terms
of the entropy-driven evolution of clusters. Further implications for
cosmological constraints are also discussed.
