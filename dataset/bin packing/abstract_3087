In this paper we provide characterizing properties of TDI systems, among
others the following: a system of linear inequalities is TDI if and only if its
coefficient vectors form a Hilbert basis, and there exists a test-set for the
system's dual integer programs where all test vectors have positive entries
equal to 1. Reformulations of this provide relations between computational
algebra and integer programming and they contain Applegate, Cook and
McCormick's sufficient condition for the TDI property and Sturmfels' theorem
relating toric initial ideals generated by square-free monomials to unimodular
triangulations. We also study the theoretical and practical efficiency and
limits of the characterizations of the TDI property presented here.
  In the particular case of set packing polyhedra our results correspond to
endowing the weak perfect graph theorem with an additional, computationally
interesting, geometric feature: the normal fan of the stable set polytope of a
perfect graph can be refined into a regular triangulation consisting only of
unimodular cones.
