We use an atom-atom potential between carbon atoms to obtain an interaction
potential between nanotubes (assumed rigid), thereby calculating the cohesive
energy of a bunch of nanotubes in hexagonal two dimensional packing. The model
proposed is quite similar to our earlier work on fullerenes and organic
molecular crystals. The results for inter-nanotube distances, energy per unit
length, bulk modulus and phonons for inter-nanotube vibrations are obtained and
compared with available data from measurements and other available
calculations. We also model formation of multi-wall nanotubes. We find the
results for various calculated quantities agreeing very well with measured
structural parameters and other calculations. The reversible energy stored on
compression of the bunch of nanotubes on application of pressure up to 30 Kbar
calculated in this rigid molecule model is overestimated by about 30% when
compared with measured results, signifying the appreciable flexibility of tubes
at high pressures. The model is considered very suitable for incorporating
flexible nanotubes in bunches of single and multi-wall nanotube materials of
various types.
