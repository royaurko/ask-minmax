The demagnetization factors for randomly packed spherical particle powders
with different porosities, sample aspect ratios and monodisperse, normal and
log-normal particle size distributions have been calculated using a numerical
model. For a relative permeability of 2, comparable to room temperature Gd, the
calculated demagnetization factor is close to the theoretical value. The
normalized standard deviation of the magnetization in the powder was 6.0%-6.7%.
The demagnetization factor decreased significantly, while the standard
deviation of the magnetization increased, for increasing relative permeability.
