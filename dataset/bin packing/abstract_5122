The weak lensing shear signal has been measured numerically in $N$-body
simulations at 14 different redshifts ($z_s = 0.1$ to 3.6) and on angular
scales of $\theta = 2'$ to 32'. In addition, the data have been validated by
analytical computations for an identical cosmology, with density parameter
$\Omega_m = 0.3$ and vacuum energy density parameter $\lambda_0 = 0.7$. This
paper reports on the scale and redshift dependence of the shear variance,
$<\gamma^2>$, which may be described by a simple formula of the form
$<\gamma^2>(\theta,z_s) = a(\theta)z_s^{b(\theta)}$. The redshift dependence
for source redshifts up to 1.6, is found to be close to $z_s^2$, which is a
stronger dependence than earlier analytical predictions ($<\gamma^2 > \propto
z_s^{1.52}$), although, at higher redshifts, the $z_s$ dependence of the shear
variance is clearly less steep. The strong redshift dependence further
emphasises the need to know the precise redshift distribution for the galaxy
sources in any given survey, so that they can be allocated to redshift bins
accordingly, and the cosmic shear signal correctly interpreted. Equations are
also given for the variance in the reduced shear, which is a more directly
measurable quantity observationally.
