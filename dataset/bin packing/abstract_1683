It is possible that there exist some interactions between dark energy (DE)
and dark matter (DM), and a suitable interaction can alleviate the coincidence
problem. Several phenomenological interacting forms are proposed and are fitted
with observations in the literature. In this paper we investigate the possible
interaction in a way independent of specific interacting forms by use of
observational data (SNe, BAO, CMB and Hubble parameter). We divide the whole
range of redshift into a few bins and set the interacting term $\delta(z)$ to
be a constant in each redshift bin. We consider four parameterizations of the
equation of state $w_{de}$ for DE and find that $\delta(z)$ is likely to cross
the non-interacting ($\delta=0$) and have an oscillation form. It suggests that
to study the interaction between DE and DM, more general phenomenological forms
of the interacting term should be considered.
