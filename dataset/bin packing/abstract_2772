We propose the Supersymmetric Standard Models (SSMs) with a pseudo-Dirac
gluino from hybrid $F-$ and $D-$term supersymmetry (SUSY) breakings. Similar to
the SSMs before the LHC, all the supersymmetric particles in the Minimal SSM
(MSSM) obtain the SUSY breaking soft terms from the traditional gravity
mediation and have masses within about 1 TeV except gluino. To evade the LHC
SUSY search constraints, the gluino also has a heavy Dirac mass above 3 TeV
from $D-$term SUSY breaking. Interestingly, such a heavy Dirac gluino mass will
not induce the electroweak fine-tuning problem. We realize such SUSY breakings
via an anomalous $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry inspired from string models. To
maintain the gauge coupling unification and increase the Higgs boson mass, we
introduce extra vector-like particles. We study the viable parameter space
which satisfies all the current experimental constraints, and present a
concrete benchmark point. This kind of models not only preserves the merits of
pre-LHC SSMs such as naturalness, dark matter, etc, but also solves the
possible problems in the SSMs with Dirac gauginos due to the $F$-term gravity
mediation.
