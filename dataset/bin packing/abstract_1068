By generalizing mutation of rigid subcategories, maximal rigid subcategories
and cluster tilting subcategories, the notion of mutation of torsion pairs in
triangulated categories is introduced. It is proved that the mutation of
torsion pairs in triangulated categories are torsion pairs. It is also proved
that there is no non-trivial mutation of t-structures, but shift. A geometric
realization of mutation of torsion pairs in the cluster categories of type
$A_n$ or in the cluster categories of type $A_{\infty}$ is given via the
mutations (generalized flips) of Ptolemy diagrams of a regular $(n+3)-$gon
$P_{n+3}$ or of a $\infty-$gon $P_{\infty}$ respectively.
