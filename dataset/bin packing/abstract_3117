It is shown that one can count $k$-edge paths in an $n$-vertex graph and
$m$-set $k$-packings on an $n$-element universe, respectively, in time ${n
\choose k/2}$ and ${n \choose mk/2}$, up to a factor polynomial in $n$, $k$,
and $m$; in polynomial space, the bounds hold if multiplied by $3^{k/2}$ or
$5^{mk/2}$, respectively. These are implications of a more general result:
given two set families on an $n$-element universe, one can count the disjoint
pairs of sets in the Cartesian product of the two families with $\nO(n \ell)$
basic operations, where $\ell$ is the number of members in the two families and
their subsets.
