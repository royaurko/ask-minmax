We consider the stationary state of a fluid comprised of inelastic hard
spheres or disks under the influence of a random, momentum-conserving external
force. Starting from the microscopic description of the dynamics, we derive a
nonlinear equation of motion for the coherent scattering function in two and
three space dimensions. A glass transition is observed for all coefficients of
restitution, epsilon, at a critical packing fraction, phi_c(epsilon), below
random close packing. The divergence of timescales at the glass-transition
implies a dependence on compression rate upon further increase of the density -
similar to the cooling rate dependence of a thermal glass. The critical
dynamics for coherent motion as well as tagged particle dynamics is analyzed
and shown to be non-universal with exponents depending on space dimension and
degree of dissipation.
