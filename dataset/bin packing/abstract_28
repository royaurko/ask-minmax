The Cloud Computing paradigm consists in providing customers with virtual
services of the quality which meets customers' requirements. A cloud service
operator is interested in using his infrastructure in the most efficient way
while serving customers. The efficiency of infrastructure exploitation may be
expressed, amongst others, by the electrical energy consumption of computing
centers.
  We propose to model the energy consumption of private Clouds, which provides
virtual computation services, by a variant of the Bin Packing problem. This
novel generalization is obtained by introducing such constraints as: variable
bin size, cost of packing and the possibility of splitting items.
  We analyze the packing problem generalization from a theoretical point of
view. We advance on-line and off-line approximation algorithms to solve our
problem to balance the load either on-the-fly or on the planning stage. In
addition to the computation of the approximation factors of these two
algorithms, we evaluate experimentally their performance.
  The quality of the results is encouraging. This conclusion makes a packing
approach a serious candidate to model energy-aware load balancing in Cloud
Computing.
