ALMA is estimated to generate TB scale data during only one observation;
astronomers manage to identify which part of the data they are really
interested in. Now we have been developing new GUI software for this purpose
utilizing the VO interface: ALMA Web Quick Look System (ALMAWebQL) and ALMA
Desktop Application (Vissage). The former is written in JavaScript and HTML5
generated from Java codes by Google Web Toolkit, and the latter is in pure
Java. An essential point of our approach is how to reduce network traffic: we
prepare, in advance, "compressed" FITS files of 2x2x1 (horizontal, vertical,
and spectral directions, respectively) binning, 2x2x2 binning, 4x4x2 binning
data, and so on. These files are hidden from users, and Web QL automatically
choose proper one by each user operation. Through this work, we find that
network traffic in our system is still a bottleneck towards TB scale data
distribution. Hence we have to develop alternative data containers for much
faster data processing. In this paper, I introduce our data analysis systems,
and describe what we learned through the development.
