The least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm is the most popular algorithm in
adaptive filtering. Several variable step-size strategies have been suggested
to improve the performance of the LMS algorithm. These strategies enhance the
performance of the algorithm but a major drawback is the complexity in the
theoretical analysis of the resultant algorithms. Researchers use several
assumptions to find closed-form analytical solutions. This work presents a
unified approach for the analysis of variable step-size LMS algorithms. The
approach is then applied to several variable step-size strategies and
theoretical and simulation results are compared.
