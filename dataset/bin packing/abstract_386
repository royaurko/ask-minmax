A novel effect in a granular material under swirling motion of the container
is presented. At low packing densities the material rotates in the same
direction as the swirling motion of the container (rotation). At higher
densities the cluster of granular material rotates in opposite direction
(reptation). The change of the direction of the motion of the cluster takes
place at a critical packing density while the diffusion coefficient changes
significantly. The measured critical density of the packing is in good
agreement with results obtained by molecular dynamics simulation.
