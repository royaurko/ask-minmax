We extend our previously developed general approach (1) to study a
phenomenological model in which the simulated packing of hard, attractive
spheres on a prolate spheroid surface with convexity constraints produces
structures identical to those of prolate virus capsid structures. Our
simulation approach combines the traditional Monte Carlo method with the method
of random sampling on an ellipsoidal surface and a convex hull searching
algorithm. Using this approach we study the assembly and structural origin of
non-icosahedral, elongated virus capsids, such as two aberrant flock house
virus (FHV) particles and the prolate prohead of bacteriophage phi29, and
discuss the implication of our simulation results in the context of recent
experimental findings.
