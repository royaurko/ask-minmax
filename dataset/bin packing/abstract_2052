The growth morphology of clean silver exhibits a profound anisotropy: The
growing surface of Ag(111) is typically very rough while that of Ag(100) is
smooth and flat. This serious and important difference is unexpected, not
understood, and hitherto not observed for any other metal. Using density
functional theory calculations of self-diffusion on flat and stepped Ag(100) we
find, for example, that at flat regions a hopping mechanism is favored, while
across step edges diffusion proceeds by an exchange process. The calculated
microscopic parameters explain the experimentally reported growth properties.
