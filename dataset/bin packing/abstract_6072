FOCCoS, Fiber Optical Cable and Connector System, has the main function of
capturing the direct light from the focal plane of Subaru Telescope using
optical fibers, each one with a microlens in its tip, and conducting this light
through a route containing connectors to a set of four spectrographs. The
optical fiber cable is divided in 3 different segments called Cable A, Cable B
and Cable C. Multi-fibers connectors assure precise connection among all
optical fibers of the segments, providing flexibility for instrument changes.
To assure strong and accurate connection, these sets are arranged inside two
types of assemblies: the Tower Connector, for connection between Cable C and
Cable B; and the Gang Connector, for connection between Cable B and Cable A.
Throughput tests were made to evaluate the efficiency of the connections. A
lifetime test connection is in progress. Cable C is installed inside the PFI,
Prime Focus Instrument, where each fiber tip with a microlens is bonded to the
end of the shaft of a 2-stage piezo-electric rotatory motor positioner; this
assembly allows each fiber to be placed anywhere within its patrol region,
which is 9.5mm diameter.. Each positioner uses a fiber arm to support the
ferrule, the microlens, and the optical fiber. 2400 of these assemblies are
arranged on a motor bench plate in a hexagonal-closed-packed disposition.
