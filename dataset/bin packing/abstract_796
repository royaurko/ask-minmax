Granular material exposed to shear shows a variety of unique phenomena:
Reynolds dilatancy, positional order and orientational order effects may
compete in the shear zone. We study granular packings consisting of macroscopic
prolate, oblate and spherical grains and compare their behaviour. X-ray
tomography is used to determine the particle positions and orientations in a
cylindrical split bottom shear cell. Packing densities and the arrangements of
individual particles in the shear zone are evaluated. For anisometric
particles, we observe the competition of two opposite effects. One the one
hand, the sheared granulate is dilated, but on the other hand the particles
reorient and align with respect to the streamlines. Even though aligned
cylinders in principle may achieve higher packing densities, this alignment
compensates for the effect of dilatancy only partially. The complex
rearrangements lead to a depression of the surface above the well oriented
region while neigbouring parts still show the effect of dilation in the form of
heaps. For grains with isotropic shapes, the surface remains rather flat.
Perfect monodisperse spheres crystallize in the shear zone, whereby positional
order partially overcompensates dilatancy effects. However, already slight
deviations from the ideal monodisperse sphere shape inhibit crystallization.
