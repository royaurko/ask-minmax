Multi-layered scintillating fibre arrays read-out are commonly used as high
resolution charged particle hodoscopes. Fibres of a column along the
geometrical trajectory of incident particles are typically grouped to one pixel
of a multi-channel read-out device. In some applications the incident particles
will cross the detection plane with large angles w.r.t. the normal to the
layers. Then, the packing of the fibres needs to be adapted to the incident
particles and the columns need to be inclined. In this paper possible fibre
array geometries are shown, relevant design criteria for detectors are
discussed, and the effect of diverging particles incident on fibre arrays was
studied using a Monte Carlo simulation.
