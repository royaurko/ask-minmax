The rotation curve for the IV galactic quadrant, within the solar circle, is
derived from the Columbia University - U. de Chile CO(J=1-0) survey of
molecular gas. A new sampling, four times denser in longitude than in our
previous analysis, is used to compute kinematical parameters that require
derivatives w/r to galactocentric radius; the angular velocity Omega(R), the
epicyclic frequency kappa(R), and the parameters A(R) and B(R) describing,
respectively, gas shear and vorticity. The face-on surface density of molecular
gas is computed from the CO data in galactocentric radial bins for the
subcentral vicinity, the same spectral region used to derive the rotation
curve, where the two-fold ambiguity in kinematical distances is minimum. The
rate of massive star formation per unit area is derived, for the same radial
bins, from the luminosity of IRAS point-like sources with FIR colors of UC HII
regions detected in the CS(J=2-1) line. Massive star formation occurs
preferentially in three regions of high molecular gas density, coincident with
lines of sight tangent to spiral arms. The molecular gas motion in these arms
resembles that of a solid body, characterized by constant angular velocity and
by low shear and vorticity. The formation of massive stars in the arms follows
the Schmidt law, Sigma_{MSFR} is proportional to [Sigma_{gas}]^n, with an index
of n = 1.2 +- 0.2 Our results suggest that the large scale kinematics, through
shear, regulate global star formation in the Galactic disk.
