A radiation gene box (RGB) onboard the SJ-10 satellite is a device carrying
mice and drosophila cells to determine the biological effects of space
radiation environment. The shielded fluxes of different radioactive sources
were calculated and the linear energy transfers of gamma-rays, electrons,
protons and alpha-particles in tissue were acquired using A-150
tissue-equivalent plastic. Then, a conceptual model of a space radiation
instrument employing three semiconductor sub-detectors for deriving the charged
and uncharged radiation environment of the RGB was designed. The energy
depositions in the three sub-detectors were classified into fifteen channels
(bins) in an algorithm derived from the Monte Carlo method. The physical
feasibility of the conceptual instrument was also verified by Monte Carlo
simulations.
