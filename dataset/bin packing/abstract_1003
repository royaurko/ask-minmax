We explore the signature of the extra dimension in the Hawking radiation in a
rotating Kaluza-Klein black hole with squashed horizons. Comparing with the
spherical case, we find that the rotating parameter brings richer physics. We
obtain the appropriate size of the extra dimension which can enhance the
Hawking radiation and may open a window to detect the extra dimensions.
