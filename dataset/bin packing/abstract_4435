We describe three corrections that should be applied to the observed relative
incidence of nearby stars hosting giant planets. These are diffusion in the
stellar atmosphere, use of the [Ref] index in place of [Fe/H] for metallicity,
and correction for local sampling with the W velocity. We have applied these
corrections to a subset of the SPOCS exoplanet survey with uniform giant planet
detectability. Fitting the binned data to a power law of the form, $\alpha
10^{\beta [Fe/H]}$, we derived $\alpha = 0.022 \pm 0.007$ and $\beta = 3.0 \pm
0.5$; this value of $\beta$ is 50\% larger than the value determined by
\citet{fv05}. While the statistical significance of this difference is
marginal, given the small number statistics, these corrections should be
included in future analyses that include larger samples.
