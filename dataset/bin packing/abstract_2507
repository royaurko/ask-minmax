2MASS J09440940-5617117 was identified as a cataclysmic variable in 2007 by
its spectrum. In this article we present optical differential photometry in the
Rc band obtained using the 0.6-m telescope at Observatorio do Pico dos
Dias/Brazil. The complete light curves confirm the presence of a deep eclipse.
We derive an orbital period of 0.1879340(5) d. The eclipse has a width of 0.112
+- 0.003 orbital cycles.
