We study the scaling properties of forced folding of thin materials of
different geometry. The scaling relations implying the topological crossovers
from the folding of threedimensional plates to the folding of two-dimensional
sheets, and further to the packing of one-dimensional strings, are derived for
elastic and plastic manifolds. These topological crossovers in the folding of
plastic manifolds were observed in experiments with predominantly plastic
aluminum strips of different geometry. Elasto-plastic materials, such as paper
sheets during the (fast) folding under increasing confinement force, are
expected to obey the scaling force-diameter relation derived for elastic
manifolds. However, in experiments with paper strips of different geometry, we
observed the crossover from packing of one-dimensional strings to folding two
dimensional sheets only, because the fractal dimension of the set of folded
elasto-plastic sheets is the thickness dependent due to the strain relaxation
after a confinement force is withdrawn.
