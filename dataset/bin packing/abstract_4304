We summarize the sensitivity achieved by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational
wave detectors for low-mass compact binary coalescence (CBC) searches during
LIGO's sixth science run and Virgo's second and third science runs. We present
strain noise power spectral densities (PSDs) which are representative of the
typical performance achieved by the detectors in these science runs. The data
presented here and in the accompanying web-accessible data files are intended
to be released to the public as a summary of detector performance for low-mass
CBC searches during S6 and VSR2-3.
