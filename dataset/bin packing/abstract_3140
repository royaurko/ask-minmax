We study the problem of finding the smallest $m$ such that every element of
an exponential family can be written as a mixture of $m$ elements of another
exponential family. We propose an approach based on coverings and packings of
the face lattice of the corresponding convex support polytopes and results from
coding theory. We show that $m=q^{N-1}$ is the smallest number for which any
distribution of $N$ $q$-ary variables can be written as mixture of $m$
independent $q$-ary variables. Furthermore, we show that any distribution of
$N$ binary variables is a mixture of $m = 2^{N-(k+1)}(1+ 1/(2^k-1))$ elements
of the $k$-interaction exponential family.
