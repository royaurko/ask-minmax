In 1940 Fisher famously showed that if there exists a non-trivial
$(v,k,\lambda)$-design then $\lambda(v-1) \geq k(k-1)$. Subsequently Bose gave
an elegant alternative proof of Fisher's result. Here, we show that the idea
behind Bose's proof can be generalised to obtain new bounds on the number of
blocks in $(v,k,\lambda)$-coverings and -packings with $\lambda(v-1)<k(k-1)$.
