In this paper, first, we investigate the model of degraded broadcast channel
with side information and confidential messages. This work is from Steinberg's
work on the degraded broadcast channel with causal and noncausal side
information, and Csisz$\acute{a}$r-K\"{o}rner's work on broadcast channel with
confidential messages. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation
regions are provided for the noncausal and causal cases. Superposition coding
and double-binning technique are used in the corresponding achievability
proofs.
  Then, we investigate the degraded broadcast channel with side information,
confidential messages and noiseless feedback. The noiseless feedback is from
the non-degraded receiver to the channel encoder. Inner and outer bounds on the
capacity-equivocation region are provided for the noncausal case, and the
capacity-equivocation region is determined for the causal case. Compared with
the model without feedback, we find that the noiseless feedback helps to
enlarge the inner bounds for both causal and noncausal cases. In the
achievability proof of the feedback model, the noiseless feedback is used as a
secret key shared by the non-degraded receiver and the transmitter, and
therefore, the code construction for the feedback model is a combination of
superposition coding, Gel'fand-Pinsker's binning, block Markov coding and
Ahlswede-Cai's secret key on the feedback system.
