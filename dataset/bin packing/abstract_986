Preliminary results are presented for two analyses of transverse energy (ET)
production measured with the electromagnetic calorimeters of the Pioneering
High Energy Nuclear Interaction Experiment (PHENIX), in nuclear interactions in
Au+Au heavy-ion collisions created by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC), at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Event-by-event ET distributions made
across collision centrality were used in (1) measurements of 200 GeV mean ET,
and (2) measurements of 200 GeV and 62.4 GeV ET distribution fluctuations.
Event centrality was selected in 5% wide bins and each bin represented by a
modeled mean number of participant nucleons.
