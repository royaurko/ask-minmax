We experimentally demonstrate that low-frequency electrical noise in silver
nanowires is heavily suppressed when the crystal structure of the nanowires is
hexagonal closed pack (hcp) rather than face centered cubic (fcc). Using a
low-potential electrochemical method we have grown single crystalline silver
nanowires with hcp crystal structure, in which the noise at room temperature is
two to six orders of magnitude lower than that in the conventional fcc
nanowires of the same diameter. We suggest that motion of dislocations is
probably the primary source of electrical noise in metallic nanowires, which is
strongly diminished in hcp crystals.
