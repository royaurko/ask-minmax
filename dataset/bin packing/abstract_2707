CDF has observed a top forward-backward asymmetry discrepant with the
Standard Model prediction at 3.4 \sigma. We analyze models that could generate
the asymmetry, including flavor-violating W's, horizontal Z'_Hs, triplet and
sextet diquarks, and axigluons. We consider the detailed predictions of these
models for the invariant mass and rapidity distributions of the asymmetry at
the parton level, comparing against the unfolded parton-level CDF results.
While all models can reproduce the asymmetry with the appropriate choice of
mass and couplings, it appears at first examination that the extracted
parton-level invariant mass distribution for all models are in conflict with
Tevatron observations. We show on closer examination, however, that t tbar
events in Z'_H and W' models have considerably lower selection efficiencies in
high invariant mass bins as compared to the Standard Model, so that W', Z'_H,
and axigluon models can generate the observed asymmetry while being consistent
with the total cross-section and invariant mass spectrum. Triplet and sextet
models have greater difficulty producing the observed asymmetry while remaining
consistent with the total cross-section and invariant mass distribution. To
more directly match the models and the CDF results, we proceed to decay and
reconstruct the tops, comparing our results against the "raw" CDF asymmetry and
invariant mass distributions. We find that the models that successfully
generate the corrected CDF asymmetry at the parton level reproduce very well
the more finely binned uncorrected asymmetry. Finally, we discuss the early LHC
reach for discovery of these models, based on our previous analysis
[arXiv:1102.0018].
