We holographically investigate the effects of a dipole coupling between a
fermion field and a $U(1)$ gauge field on the dual fermionic sector in the
charged gravity bulk with hyperscaling violation. We analytically study the
features of the ultraviolet and infrared Green's functions of the dual
fermionic system and we show that as the dipole coupling and the hyperscaling
violation exponent are varied, the fluid possess Fermi, marginal Fermi,
non-Fermi liquid phases and also an additional Mott insulating phase. We find
that the increase of the hyperscaling violation exponent which effectively
reduces the dimensionality of the system makes it harder for the Mott gap to be
formed. We also show that the observed duality between zeros and poles in the
presence of a dipole moment coupling still persists in theories with
hyperscaling violation.
