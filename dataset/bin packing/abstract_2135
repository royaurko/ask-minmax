This paper studies multiclass loss systems with two layers of servers, where
each server at the first layer is dedicated to a certain customer class, while
the servers at the second layer can handle all customer classes. The routing of
customers follows an overflow scheme, where arriving customers are
preferentially directed to the first layer. Stochastic comparison and coupling
techniques are developed for studying how the system is affected by packing of
customers, altered service rates, and altered server configurations. This
analysis leads to easily computable upper and lower bounds for the performance
of the system.
