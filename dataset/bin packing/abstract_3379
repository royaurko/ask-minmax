Plasticity in zirconium is controlled by 1/3<1-210> screw dislocations
gliding in the prism planes of the hexagonal close-packed structure. This
prismatic and not basal glide is observed for a given set of transition metals
like zirconium and is known to be related to the number of valence electrons in
the d band. We use ab initio calculations based on the density functional
theory to study the core structure of screw dislocations in zirconium.
Dislocations are found to dissociate in the prism plane in two partial
dislocations, each with a pure screw character. Ab initio calculations also
show that the dissociation in the basal plane is unstable. We calculate then
the Peierls barrier for a screw dislocation gliding in the prism plane and
obtain a small barrier. The Peierls stress deduced from this barrier is lower
than 21 MPa, which is in agreement with experimental data. The ability of an
empirical potential relying on the embedded atom method (EAM) to model
dislocations in zirconium is also tested against these ab initio calculations.
