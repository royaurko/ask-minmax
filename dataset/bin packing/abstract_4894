We have developed two independent methods to measure the one-dimensional
power spectrum of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The first
method is based on a Fourier transform, and the second on a maximum likelihood
estimator. The two methods are independent and have different systematic
uncertainties. The determination of the noise level in the data spectra was
subject to a novel treatment, because of its significant impact on the derived
power spectrum.
  We applied the two methods to 13,821 quasar spectra from SDSS-III/BOSS DR9
selected from a larger sample of over 60,000 spectra on the basis of their high
quality, large signal-to-noise ratio, and good spectral resolution. The power
spectra measured using either approach are in good agreement over all twelve
redshift bins from $<z> = 2.2$ to $<z> = 4.4$, and scales from 0.001
$\rm(km/s)^{-1}$ to $0.02 \rm(km/s)^{-1}$. We determine the methodological and
instrumental systematic uncertainties of our measurements.
  We provide a preliminary cosmological interpretation of our measurements
using available hydrodynamical simulations. The improvement in precision over
previously published results from SDSS is a factor 2--3 for constraints on
relevant cosmological parameters. For a $\Lambda$CDM model and using a
constraint on $H_0$ that encompasses measurements based on the local distance
ladder and on CMB anisotropies, we infer $\sigma_8 =0.83\pm0.03$ and $n_s=
0.97\pm0.02$ based on \ion{H}{i} absorption in the range $2.1<z<3.7$.
