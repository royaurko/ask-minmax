Several controversial issues concerning the packing of linear DNA in
bacteriophages and globules are discussed. Exact relations for the osmotic
pressure, capsid pressure and loading force are derived in terms of the hole
size inside phages under the assumption that the DNA globule has a uniform
density. A new electrostatic model is introduced for computing the osmotic
pressure of rodlike polyelectrolytes at very high concentrations. At
intermediate packing, a reptation model is considered for DNA diffusing within
a toroidal globule. Under tight packing conditions, a model of Coulomb sliding
friction is proposed. A general discussion is given of our current
understanding of the statics and dynamics of confined DNA in the context of to
the following experiments: characterization of the liquid crystalline phases,
X-ray scattering by phages, osmotic stress measurements, cyclization within
globules and single-molecule determination ofthe loading forces.
