There are two known CFT duals, namely the J-picture and the Q-picture, for a
four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole, corresponding to the angular momentum
$J$ and the electric charge $Q$ respectively. In our recent study we found a
one-parameter class of CFT duals for extremal Kerr-Newman black hole,
connecting these two pictures. In this paper we study these novel CFT duals for
the generic non-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole. We investigate the hidden
conformal symmetry in the low frequency scattering off Kerr-Newman black hole,
from which the dual temperatures could be read. We find that there still exists
a hidden conformal symmetry for a general CFT dual. We reproduce the correct
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from the Cardy formula, assuming the form of the
central charge being invariant. Moreover we compute the retarded Green's
function in the general CFT dual picture and find it is in good match with the
CFT prediction. Furthermore we discuss the hidden conformal symmetries of the
five dimensional Kerr black hole and obtain the similar evidence to support the
general dual CFT pictures.
