We present here results on the source location accuracy of the INTEGRAL
IBIS/ISGRI coded mask telescope, based on ten years of INTEGRAL data and on
recent developments in the data analysis procedures. Data were selected and
processed with the new Off-line Scientific Analysis pipeline (OSA10.0) that
benefits from the most accurate background corrections, the most performing
coding noise cleaning and sky reconstruction algorithms available. We obtained
updated parameters for the evaluation of the point source location error from
the source signal to noise ratio. These results are compared to previous
estimates and to theoretical expectations. Also thanks to a new fitting
procedure the typical error at 90% confidence level for a source at a signal to
noise of 10 is now estimated to be 1.5 arcmin. Prospects for future analysis on
the Point Spread Function fitting procedure and on the evaluation of residual
biases are also presented. The new consolidated parameters describing the
source location accuracy that will be derived in the near future using the
whole INTEGRAL database, the new fitting technique and the bias correction,
will be included in future versions of OSA.
