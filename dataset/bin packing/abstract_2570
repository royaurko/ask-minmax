The production of W boson in association with two jets in proton-proton
collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV has
been investigated using data collected with the ATLAS detector. The fraction of
events arising from double-parton scattering has been measured through the
transverse momentum balance between the two jets. The measurement provides new
information on the scaling of the rate of double-parton scattering processes
and constraints on proton transverse profile modeling.
