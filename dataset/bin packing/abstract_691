We study correlations on the euclidean spacetimes generated in Monte Carlo
simulations of the model. In the elongated phase, curvature correlations appear
to fall off like a fractional power. Near the transition to the crumpled phase
this power is consistent with 4. We also present improved data of our
computations of the binding energy of test particles.
