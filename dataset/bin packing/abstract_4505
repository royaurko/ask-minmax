The essential distinction between the Fundamental Diagram Approach (FDA) and
Kerner's Three- Phase Theory (KTPT) is the existence of a unique gap-speed (or
flow-density) relationship in the former class. In order to verify this
relationship, empirical data are analyzed with the following findings: (1)
linear relationship between the actual space gap and speed can be identified
when the speed difference between vehicles approximates zero; (2) vehicles
accelerate or decelerate around the desired space gap most of the time. To
explain these phenomena, we propose that, in congested traffic flow, the space
gap between two vehicles will oscillate around the desired space gap in the
deterministic limit. This assumption is formulated in terms of a cellular
automaton. In contrast to FDA and KTPT, the new model does not have any
congested steady-state solution. Simulations under periodic and open boundary
conditions reproduce the empirical findings of KTPT. Calibrating and validating
the model to detector data produces results that are better than that of
previous studies.
