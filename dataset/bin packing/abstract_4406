In the Directed $k$-Chinese Postman Problem ($k$-DCPP), we are given a
connected weighted digraph $G$ and asked to find $k$ non-empty closed directed
walks covering all arcs of $G$ such that the total weight of the walks is
minimum. Gutin, Muciaccia and Yeo (Theor. Comput. Sci. 513 (2013) 124--128)
asked for the parameterized complexity of $k$-DCPP when $k$ is the parameter.
We prove that the $k$-DCPP is fixed-parameter tractable.
  We also consider a related problem of finding $k$ arc-disjoint directed
cycles in an Euler digraph, parameterized by $k$. Slivkins (ESA 2003) showed
that this problem is W[1]-hard for general digraphs. Generalizing another
result by Slivkins, we prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable for
Euler digraphs. The corresponding problem on vertex-disjoint cycles in Euler
digraphs remains W[1]-hard even for Euler digraphs.
