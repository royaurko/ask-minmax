We have located the global minimum for all lead clusters with up to 160 atoms
using a glue potential to model the interatomic interactions. The lowest-energy
structures are not face-centred cubic as suggested previously. Rather, for N<40
the majority of structures are decahedral or hexagonal close-packed, and beyond
this size the structures do not correspond to any of the structural forms
commonly found in clusters. However, these latter clusters are not simply
disordered. High symmetry, magic number clusters are still present, the most
prominent of which is the 148-atom D3d hexagonal barrel. We relate these
structural preferences back to the form of the interactions.
