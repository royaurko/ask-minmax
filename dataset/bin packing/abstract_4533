In this work we apply generalized A. Sparavigna method (use of freely
available softwares (programs), e.g. http://www.sollumis.com/,
http://suncalc.net/#/44.557,22.0265,13/2014.12.29/09:22,
http://universimmedia.pagesperso-orange.fr/geo/loc.htm,
http://www.spectralcalc.com/solar_calculator/solar_position.php and
http://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/Yourhorizon) for analysis of possible
astronomical characteristics of three remarkable Giza, i.e. Cheops, Chephren
and Mikerin pyramids. Concretely, we use mentioned programs for determination
of the Giza plateau longitude and latitude, moments of the sunrise and sunset
for any day at the Giza plateau, and, simulation of the sky horizon above Giza
plateau in any moment of any day, respectively. In this way we obtain a series
of the figures which unambiguously imply the following original results. Any of
three remarkable Giza pyramids (Cheops, Chephren and Mikerin) holds only one
characteristic edge between apex and north-west vertex of the base so that
sunrise direction overlap almost exactly this edge during 28. October. (There
is a small declination of the overlap date by Chephren pyramid by which overlap
date is approximately 23. or 24. October.) Simultaneously, in the sunset moment
for the same day, Taurus constellation (corresponding to holly bull in ancient
Egypt mythology) appears at a point at the very eastern boundary of the sky
horizon.
