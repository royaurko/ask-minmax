Top quark pair production close to threshold at a next linear collider is
discussed, with special focus on the influence of rescattering corrections.
Numerical results are shown for the differential cross-section, i.e. the
momentum distribution and the forward backward asymmetry, and for moments of
the angular distribution of leptons arising from the semileptonic top quark
decay.
