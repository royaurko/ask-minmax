Leaves are packed in a bud in different ways, being flat, enrolled, or
folded, but always filling the whole bud volume. This {\guillemotleft} filling
law {\guillemotright} has many consequences, in particular on the shape of
growing folded leaves. This is shown here for different types of folding and
packing. The folded volume is always part of an ellipsoid, with the veins on
the outside rounded face, and the lamina margin on an adaxial plane or axis.
The veins on the abaxial side protect the more fragile lamina. The first
general consequence of the folds is the presence of symmetries on the leaf
shape, but also quantitative relationships between lobes and sinus sizes. For
particular geometries, the leaf lamina can be limited by lateral veins,
creating spoon-like lobes, or transverse cuts, creating asymmetrical wavy
perimeters. A change in the packing between cultivars induces the corresponding
change in the leaf shape. Each particular case shows how pervasive are the
geometrical consequences of the filling law.
