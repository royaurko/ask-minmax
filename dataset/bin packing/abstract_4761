We consider a theoretical model for a binary mixture of colloidal particles
and spherical emulsion droplets. The hard sphere colloids interact via
additional short-ranged attraction and long-ranged repulsion. The
droplet-colloid interaction is an attractive well at the droplet surface, which
induces the Pickering effect. The droplet-droplet interaction is a hard-core
interaction. The droplets shrink in time, which models the evaporation of the
dispersed (oil) phase, and we use Monte Carlo simulations for the dynamics. In
the experiments, polystyrene particles were assembled using toluene droplets as
templates. The arrangement of the particles on the surface of the droplets was
analyzed with cryogenic field emission scanning electron microscopy. Before
evaporation of the oil, the particle distribution on the droplet surface was
found to be disordered in experiments, and the simulations reproduce this
effect. After complete evaporation, ordered colloidal clusters are formed that
are stable against thermal fluctuations. Both in the simulations and with field
emission scanning electron microscopy, we find stable packings that range from
doublets, triplets, and tetrahedra to complex polyhedra of colloids. The
simulated cluster structures and size distribution agree well with the
experimental results. We also simulate hierarchical assembly in a mixture of
tetrahedral clusters and droplets, and find supercluster structures with
morphologies that are more complex than those of clusters of single particles.
