We study the orbit of the extended real line under the Bianchi group
PSL_2(OK), where K is an imaginary quadratic field. The orbit SK, called a
Schmidt arrangement, is a geometric realisation, as an intricate circle
packing, of the arithmetic of K. We define certain natural subgroups whose
orbits generalise Apollonian circle packings, and show that SK, considered with
orientations, is a disjoint union of all of these K-Apollonian packings. These
packings define a new class of thin groups called K-Apollonian groups. We make
a conjecture on the curvatures of these packings, generalizing the
local-to-global conjecture of Apollonian circle packings.
