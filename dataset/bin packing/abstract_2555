In this paper we consider the local and global well-posedness to the
density-dependent incompressible viscoelastic fluids. We first study some
linear models associated to the incompressible viscoelastic system. Then we
approximate the system by a sequence of ordinary differential equations, by
means of the Friedrichs method. Some uniform estimates for those solutions will
be obtained. Using compactness arguments, we will get the local existence up to
extracting a subsequence by means of Ascoli's lemma. With the help of small
data conditions and hybird Besov spaces, we finally derive the global
existence.
