Recent experiments and numerical simulations have shown that certain types of
microorganisms "reflect" off of a flat surface at a critical angle of
departure, independent of the angle of incidence. The nature of the reflection
may be active (cell and flagellar contact with the surface) or passive
(hydrodynamic) interactions. We explore the billiard-like motion of such a body
inside a regular polygon and show that the dynamics can settle on a stable
periodic orbit, or can be chaotic, depending on the swimmer's departure angle
and the domain geometry. The dynamics are often found to be robust to the
introduction of weak random fluctuations. The Lyapunov exponent of swimmer
trajectories can be positive or negative, can have extremal values, and can
have discontinuities depending on the degree of the polygon. A passive sorting
device is proposed that traps swimmers of different departure angles into
separate bins. We also study the external problem of a microorganism swimming
in a patterned environment of square obstacles, where the departure angle
dictates the possibility of trapping or diffusive trajectories.
