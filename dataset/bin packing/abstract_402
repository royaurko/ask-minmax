We identify putative load-bearing structures (bridges) in experimental
colloidal systems studied by confocal microscopy. Bridges are co-operative
structures that have been used to explain stability and inhomogeneous force
transmission in simulated granular packings with a range of densities. We show
that bridges similar to those found in granular simulations are present in real
experimental colloidal packings. We describe critically the bridge-finding
procedure for real experimental data and propose a new criterion-Lowest Mean
Squared Separation (LSQS)-for selecting optimum stabilisations.
