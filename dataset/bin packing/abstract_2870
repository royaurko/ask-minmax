An experimental study of the viscosity of a macroscopic suspension, i.e. a
suspension for which Brownian motion can be neglected, under steady shear is
presented. The suspension is prepared with a high packing fraction and is
density-matched in a Newtonian carrier fluid. The viscosity of the suspension
depends on the shear rate and the time of shearing. It is shown for the first
time that a macroscopic suspension shows thixotropic viscosity, i.e.
shear-thinning with a long relaxation time as a unique function of shear. The
relaxation times show a systematic decrease with increasing shear rate. These
relaxation times are larger when decreasing the shear rates, compared to those
observed after increasing the shear. The time scales involved are about 10000
times larger than the viscous time scale and about 1000 times smaller than the
thermodynamic time scale. The structure of the suspension at the outer cylinder
of a viscometer is monitored with a camera, showing the formation of a
hexagonal structure. The temporal decrease of the viscosity under shear
coincides with the formation of this hexagonal pattern.
