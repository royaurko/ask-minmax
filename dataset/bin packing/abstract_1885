We describe a method using the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect caused by
individual inhomogeneities to determine the cosmological parameters, $H_0$,
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, and $\Omega_\Lambda$, etc. This ISW-redshift test requires
detailed knowledge of the internal kinematics of a set of individual density
perturbations, e.g., galaxy clusters and/or cosmic voids, in particular their
density and velocity profiles, and their mass accretion rates. It assumes the
density perturbations are isolated and imbedded (equivalently compensated) and
makes use of the newly found relation between the ISW temperature perturbation
of the CMB and the Fermat potential of the lens. Given measurements of the
amplitudes of the temperature variations in the CMB caused by such clusters or
voids at various redshifts and estimates of their angular sizes or masses, one
can constrain the cosmological parameters. More realistically, the converse is
more likely, i.e., if the background cosmology is sufficiently constrained,
measurement of ISW profiles of clusters and voids (e.g., hot and cold spots and
rings) can constrain dynamical properties of the dark matter, including
accretion, associated with such lenses and thus constrain the evolution of
these objects with redshift.
