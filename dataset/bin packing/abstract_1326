Modern generations of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) allow for
partial reconfiguration. In an online context, where the sequence of modules to
be loaded on the FPGA is unknown beforehand, repeated insertion and deletion of
modules leads to progressive fragmentation of the available space, making
defragmentation an important issue. We address this problem by propose an
online and an offline component for the defragmentation of the available space.
We consider defragmenting the module layout on a reconfigurable device. This
corresponds to solving a two-dimensional strip packing problem. Problems of
this type are NP-hard in the strong sense, and previous algorithmic results are
rather limited. Based on a graph-theoretic characterization of feasible
packings, we develop a method that can solve two-dimensional defragmentation
instances of practical size to optimality. Our approach is validated for a set
of benchmark instances.
