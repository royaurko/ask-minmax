Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) direct detection experiments are
closing in on the region of parameter space where relic neutralinos may
constitute the galactic halo dark matter. We discuss two issues in the
interpretation of data, in particular the calculation of exclusion limits, from
these experiments. Firstly we show that the technique that has been used for
calculating exclusion limits from binned data without background subtraction
produces erroneously tight limits, and discuss alternative methods which avoid
this problem. We then argue that the standard maxwellian halo model is likely
to be a poor approximation to the dark matter distribution and examine how halo
models with triaxiality, velocity anisotropy and small scale clumping affect
exclusion limits.
