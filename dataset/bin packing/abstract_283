Higher-dimensional orthogonal packing problems have a wide range of practical
applications, including packing, cutting, and scheduling. Combining the use of
our data structure for characterizing feasible packings with our new classes of
lower bounds, and other heuristics, we develop a two-level tree search
algorithm for solving higher-dimensional packing problems to optimality.
Computational results are reported, including optimal solutions for all
two--dimensional test problems from recent literature.
  This is the third in a series of articles describing new approaches to
higher-dimensional packing; see cs.DS/0310032 and cs.DS/0402044.
