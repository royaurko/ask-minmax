In the frame of a well established lattice gas model for granular compaction,
we investigate the high intensity tapping regime where a pile expands
significantly during external excitation. We find that this model shows the
same general trends as more sophisticated models based on molecular dynamic
type simulations. In particular, a minimum in packing fraction as a function of
tapping strength is observed in the reversible branch of an annealed tapping
protocol.
