For dealing with the equal sphere packing problem, we propose a serial
symmetrical relocation algorithm, which is effective in terms of the quality of
the numerical results. We have densely packed up to 200 equal spheres in
spherical container and up to 150 equal spheres in cube container. All results
are rigorous because of a fake sphere trick. It was conjectured impossible to
pack 68 equal spheres of radius 1 into a sphere of radius 5. The serial
symmetrical relocation algorithm has proven wrong this conjecture by finding
one such packing.
