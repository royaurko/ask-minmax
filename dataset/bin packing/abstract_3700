The normalized inclination distributions are presented for the spiral
galaxies in RC3. The results show that, except for the bin of
$81^{\circ}$-$90^{\circ}$, in which the apparent minor isophotal diameters that
are used to obtain the inclinations, are affected by the central bulges, the
distributions for Sa, Sab, Scd and Sd are well consistent with the Monte-Carlo
simulation of random inclinations within 3-$\sigma$, and Sb and Sbc almost, but
Sc is different. One reason for the difference between the real distribution
and the Monte-Carlo simulation of Sc may be that some quite inclined spirals,
the arms of which are inherently loosely wound on the galactic plane and should
be classified to Sc galaxies, have been incorrectly classified to the earlier
ones, because the tightness of spiral arms which is one of the criteria of the
Hubble classification in RC3 is different between on the galactic plane and on
the tangent plane of the celestial sphere. Our result also implies that there
might exist biases in the luminosity functions of individual Hubble types if
spiral galaxies are only classified visually.
