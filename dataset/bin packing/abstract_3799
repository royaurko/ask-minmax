A measurement is presented of the two-jet differential cross section,
d^3\sigma/dE_T d\eta_1 d\eta_2, at center of mass energy sqrt{s} = 1800 GeV in
proton-antiproton collisions. The results are based on an integrated luminosity
of 86 pb^-1 collected during 1994-1995 by the CDF collaboration at the Fermilab
Tevatron collider. The differential cross section is measured as a function of
the transverse energy, E_T, of a jet in the pseudorapidity region 0.1 < |eta_1|
< 0.7 for four different pseudorapidity bins of a second jet restricted to 0.1
< |\eta_2| < 3.0. The results are compared with next-to-leading order QCD
calculations determined using the CTEQ4 and MRST sets of parton distribution
functions. None of the sets examined in this analysis provides a good
description of the data.
