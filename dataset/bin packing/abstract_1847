We examine the consistency of the unified scheme of the powerful
extragalactic radio sources with the 408 MHz BRL sample from the equatorial sky
region, selected at the same flux-density level as the 3CRR sample. We find
that, unlike in the 3CRR sample, a foreshortening in the observed sizes of
quasars, expected from the orientation-based unified scheme model, is not seen
in the BRL sample, at least in different redshift bins up to z~1. Even the
quasar fraction in individual redshift bins up to z~1 does not match with that
expected from the unified scheme, where radio galaxies and quasars are supposed
to belong to a common parent population at all redshifts. This not only casts
strong doubts on the unified scheme, but also throws up an intriguing result
that in a sample selected from the equatorial sky region, using almost the same
criteria as in the 3CRR sample from the northern hemisphere, the relative
distribution of radio galaxies and quasars differs qualitatively from the 3CRR
sample.
