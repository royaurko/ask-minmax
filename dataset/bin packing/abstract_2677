We explore the implications of 7 TeV LHC searches for a scenario in which one
of the stops is the next-to lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). The NLSP
stop (\tilde{t}_1) is assumed to decay exclusively into neutralino and charm
quark. We consider processes where the stops are pair produced together with a
hard QCD jet. We also consider stop quarks from gluino decays, \tilde{g}\to
t\tilde{t}_1^\ast+\bar{t}\tilde{t}_1. We show that the monojet ATLAS and CMS
searches corresponding to 1 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity are sensitive to
stop masses of up to 160 GeV, with the 20% neutralino-stop coannihilation
region essentially ruled out for M_{\tilde{t}_1}\lesssim 140 GeV. The region
M_{\tilde{t}_1}\lesssim 130 GeV is excluded with even relatively larger mass
difference, M_{\tilde{t}_1}-M_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}\sim 40 GeV, by the multi-jets
search. The b-jet and same-sign dilepton searches are sensitive to a heavier
gluino because they only pick up gluino pair production events followed by top
quarks decaying into b-jets and same-sign dileptons, respectively. We find that
the LHC data places a lower limit on the gluino mass in this scenario of about
600 GeV (700 GeV) from b-jets (same-sign dileptons) searches.
