A toy model of particles packings is presented, which consists in arranging
hexagons on a triangular lattice according to local stability rules. The number
of stable packings is analytically computed and found to grow exponentially
with the size of the lattice, which illustrates the concept of packing entropy
first proposed by Edwards and collaborators. The analysis is carried out for
both the monodispersed case and the more interesting, i.e. more disordered,
bidispersed case.
