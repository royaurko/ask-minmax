Let (g,[p]) be a finite-dimensional restricted Lie algebra, defined over an
algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0. The scheme of tori of
maximal dimension of g gives rise to a finite group S(g) that coincides with
the Weyl group of g in case g is a Lie algebra of classical type. In this
paper, we compute the group S(g) for Lie algebras of Cartan type and provide
applications concerning weight space decompositions, the existence of generic
tori and polynomial invariants.
