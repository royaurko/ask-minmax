This chapter discusses geometric models of biomolecules and geometric
constructs, including the union of ball model, the weigthed Voronoi diagram,
the weighted Delaunay triangulation, and the alpha shapes. These geometric
constructs enable fast and analytical computaton of shapes of biomoleculres
(including features such as voids and pockets) and metric properties (such as
area and volume). The algorithms of Delaunay triangulation, computation of
voids and pockets, as well volume/area computation are also described. In
addition, applications in packing analysis of protein structures and protein
function prediction are also discussed.
