We compare the expected contribution of FR-II hot spots to the ultra-high
energy cosmic ray spectrum (Rachen & Biermann 1993, A&A in press, BB paper
astro-ph/9301010) to improved experimental results. We introduce a "world data
set" of UHE cosmic rays by comparing the data of various experiments,
extracting relative systematic errors in the energy derivation and averaging
over energy bins. Since the contribution of FR-II hot spots is expected to be
dominated by protons, we can also compare it to the recent experimental results
for the proton component of cosmic rays between 0.1 and 1 EeV from both the
Fly's Eye and the Akeno airshower detector (Gaisser et al. 1993, Phys Rev D in
press, and Stanev et al. 1992, A&A submitted). The result is striking: Our
prediction for energies below 1 EeV fits very well to the data for the proton
component, while explaining the total flux at highest energies as well. The
result is consistent with the expectation of a galactic component, consisting
of heavy nuclei only, that has a slope of about -3.1 and cuts off at 5 EeV, as
predicted by Biermann 1993 (A&A in press, BB paper astro-ph/9301008)
