The DFT/vdW-WF method, recently developed to include the Van der Waals
interactions in Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the Maximally Localized
Wannier functions, is applied to the study of the adsorption of rare-gas atoms
(Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) on the Cu(111) and Pb(111) surfaces, at three
high-symmetry sites. We evaluate the equilibrium binding energies and
distances, and the induced work-function changes and dipole moments. We find
that, for Ne, Ar, and Kr on the Cu(111) surface the different adsorption
configurations are characterized by very similar binding energies, while the
favored adsorption site for Xe on Cu(111) is on top of a Cu atom, in agreement
with previous theoretical calculations and experimental findings, and in common
with other close-packed metal surfaces. Instead, the favored site is always the
hollow one on the Pb(111) surface, which therefore represents an interesting
system where the investigation of high-coordination sites is possible.
Moreover, the Pb(111) substrate is subject, upon rare-gas adsorption, to a
significantly smaller change in the work function (and to a correspondingly
smaller induced dipole moment) than Cu(111). The role of the chosen reference
DFT functional and of different Van der Waals corrections, and their dependence
on different rare-gas adatoms, are also discussed.
