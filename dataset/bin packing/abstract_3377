We study numerically the hydrodynamics of dip coating from a suspension and
report a mechanism for colloidal assembly and pattern formation on smooth and
uniform substrates. Below a critical withdrawal speed of the substrate,
capillary forces required to deform the meniscus prevent colloidal particles
from entering the coating film. Capillary forces are overcome by hydrodynamic
drag only after a minimum number of particles organize in a close-packed
formation within the meniscus. Once within the film, the formed assembly moves
at nearly the withdrawal speed and rapidly separates from the next assembly.
The interplay between hydrodynamic and capillary forces can thus produce
periodic and regular structures within the curved meniscus that extends below
the withdrawn film. The hydrodynamically-driven assembly documented here is
consistent with stripe pattern formations observed experimentally in the
so-called thin-film entrainment regime.
