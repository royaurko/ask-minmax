We study a gossip-based algorithm for searching data objects in a multipeer
communication network. All of the nodes in the network are able to communicate
with each other. There exists an initiator node that starts a round of searches
by randomly querying one or more of its neighbors for a desired object. The
queried nodes can also be activated and look for the object. We examine several
behavioural patterns of nodes with respect to their willingness to cooperate in
the search. We derive mathematical models for the search process based on the
balls and bins model, as well as known approximations for the rumour-spreading
problem. All models are validated with simulations. We also evaluate the
performance of the algorithm and examine the impact of search parameters.
