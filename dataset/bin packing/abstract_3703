We have used an updated version of the empirically and semi-empirically
calibrated BaSeL library of synthetic stellar spectra of Lejeune et al. (1997,
1998) and Westera et al. (1999) to calculate synthetic photometry in the
UBVRIJHKLL'M, HST-WFPC2, Geneva, and Washington systems for the entire set of
non-rotating Geneva stellar evolution models covering masses from 0.4-0.8 to
120-150 Msun and metallicities Z=0.0004 (1/50 Zsun) to 0.1 (5 Zsun). The
results are provided in a database which includes all individual stellar tracks
and the corresponding isochrones covering ages from 10^3 yr to 16--20 Gyr in
time steps of Delta(log t)= 0.05 dex. The database also includes a new grid of
stellar tracks of very metal-poor stars (Z=0.0004) from 0.8 - 150 Msun
calculated with the Geneva stellar evolution code.
  The full database will be available in electronic form at the CDS
(http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/(vol)/(page)) and at
