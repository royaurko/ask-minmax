We propose a method to transform a single photon field into bunches of pulses
with controllable timing and number of pulses in a bunch. This method is based
on transmission of a photon through an optically thick single-line absorber
vibrated with a frequency appreciably exceeding the width of the absorption
line. The spectrum of the quasi-monochromatic incoming photon is 'seen' by the
vibrated absorber as a comb of equidistant spectral components separated by the
vibration frequency. Tuning the absorber in resonance with m-th spectral
component transforms the output radiation into bunches of pulses with m pulses
in each bunch. We experimentally demonstrated the proposed technique with
single 14.4 keV photons and produced for the first time gamma-photonic time-bin
qudits with dimension d=2m.
