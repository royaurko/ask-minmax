Some new results are derived concerning random coding error exponents and
expurgated exponents for list decoding with a deterministic list size $L$. Two
asymptotic regimes are considered, the fixed list-size regime, where $L$ is
fixed independently of the block length $n$, and the exponential list-size,
where $L$ grows exponentially with $n$. We first derive a general upper bound
on the list-decoding average error probability, which is suitable for both
regimes. This bound leads to more specific bounds in the two regimes. In the
fixed list-size regime, the bound is related to known bounds and we establish
its exponential tightness. In the exponential list-size regime, we establish
the achievability of the well known sphere packing lower bound. Relations to
guessing exponents are also provided. An immediate byproduct of our analysis in
both regimes is the universality of the maximum mutual information (MMI) list
decoder in the error exponent sense. Finally, we consider expurgated bounds at
low rates, both using Gallager's approach and the Csisz\'ar-K\"orner-Marton
approach, which is, in general better (at least for $L=1$). The latter
expurgated bound, which involves the notion of {\it multi-information}, is also
modified to apply to continuous alphabet channels, and in particular, to the
Gaussian memoryless channel, where the expression of the expurgated bound
becomes quite explicit.
