In studies involving lifetimes, observed survival times are frequently
censored and possibly subject to biased sampling. In this paper, we model
survival times under biased sampling (a.k.a., biased survival data) by a
semi-parametric model, in which the selection function $w(t)$ (that leads to
the biased sampling) is specified up to an unknown finite dimensional parameter
$\theta$, while the density function $f(t)$ of the survival times is assumed
only to be smooth. Under this model, two estimators are derived to estimate the
density function $f$, and a pseudo maximum likelihood estimation procedure is
developed to estimate $\theta$. The identifiability of the estimation problem
is discussed and the performance of the new estimators is illustrated via both
simulation studies and a real data application.
