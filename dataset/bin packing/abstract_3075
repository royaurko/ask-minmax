The prion protein (PrP) binds Cu2+ ions in the octarepeat domain of the
N-terminal tail up to full occupancy at pH=7.4. Recent experiments show that
the HGGG octarepeat subdomain is responsible for holding the metal bound in a
square planar coordination. By using first principle ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations of the Car-Parrinello type, the Cu coordination mode to
the binding sites of the PrP octarepeat region is investigated. Simulations are
carried out for a number of structured binding sites. Results for the complexes
Cu(HGGGW)+(wat), Cu(HGGG) and the 2[Cu(HGGG)] dimer are presented. While the
presence of a Trp residue and a H2O molecule does not seem to affect the nature
of the Cu coordination, high stability of the bond between Cu and the amide
Nitrogens of deprotonated Gly's is confirmed in the case of the Cu(HGGG)
system. For the more interesting 2[Cu(HGGG)] dimer a dynamically entangled
arrangement of the two monomers, with intertwined N-Cu bonds, emerges. This
observation is consistent with the highly packed structure seen in experiments
at full Cu occupancy.
