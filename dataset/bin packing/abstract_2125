Silanization bases on the adsorption, selfassembly and covalent binding of
silane molecules onto surfaces, resulting in a densely packed self-assembled
monolayer (SAM). Following standard recipes, however, the quality of the
monolayer is often variable and therefore unsatisfactory. The process of
self-assembly is highly affected by the chemicals involved in the wet-chemical
process, by the ambient parameters during preparation such as humidity or
temperature and by possibly present contaminants (or impurities). Here, we
present a reliable, efficient, and wet-chemical recipe for the preparation of
ultra-smooth, highly ordered alkylterminated silane SAMs on Si wafers.
