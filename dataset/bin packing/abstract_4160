In this paper, we investigate the holographic descriptions of two kinds of
black rings, the neutral doubly rotating black ring and the dipole charged
black ring. For generic nonextremal black rings, the information of holographic
CFT duals, including the central charges and left- and right-moving
temperatures, could be read from the thermodynamics at the outer and inner
horizons, as suggested in arXiv:1206.2015. To confirm these pictures, we study
the extreme black rings in the well-established formalism. We compute the
central charges of dual CFTs by doing asymptotic symmetry group analysis in the
stretched horizon formalism, and find exact agreements. Moreover, we study the
superradiant scattering of a scalar field off the near-extremal black rings and
obtain the scattering amplitudes, which are in good match with the CFT
predictions.
