We report experimental measurements on the rheology of a dry granular
material under a weak level of vibration generated by sound injection. First,
we measure the drag force exerted on a wire moving in the bulk. We show that
when the driving vibration energy is increased, the effective rheology changes
drastically: going from a non-linear dynamical friction behavior - weakly
increasing with the velocity- up to a linear force-velocity regime. We present
a simple heuristic model to account for the vanishing of the stress dynamical
threshold at a finite vibration intensity and the onset of a linear
force-velocity behavior. Second, we measure the drag force on spherical
intruders when the dragging velocity, the vibration energy, and the diameters
are varied. We evidence a so-called ''geometrical hardening'' effect for
smaller size intruders and a logarithmic hardening effect for the velocity
dependence. We show that this last effect is only weakly dependent on the
vibration intensity.
