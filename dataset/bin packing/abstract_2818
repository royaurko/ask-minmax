We derive a method to study the phase diagram for high temperature
superconductors (HTCS). Our starting point is the Hubbard Hamiltonian with a
weak attractive interaction to obtain the formation of bound pairs. We consider
this attractive potential at different positions for different compounds
accordingly to the experimental results of the coherence length. We then
construct a wave function of the BCS type by a variational method using the
Fourier transform of this extended Hubbard potential and then derive an energy
gap equation. This approach allows us to obtain the critical temperature as
function of the doping concentration which gives very good agreement with the
experimental phase diagrams of YBaCuO and La(Sr,Ba)CuO compounds.
