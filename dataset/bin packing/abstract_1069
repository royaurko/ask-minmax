Acquisition is a search in two continuous dimensions, where the digital
algorithms require a partitioning of the search space into cells. Depending on
the partitioning of the Doppler frequency domain, more than one cell might
contain significant signal energy. We present an expression for the expected
values of the cells' energies to analyze the impact of the Doppler bin width on
detection and false alarm probabilities.
