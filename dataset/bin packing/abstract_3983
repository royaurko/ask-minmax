The P-wave charm-strange mesons $D_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ lie below
the $DK$ and $D^\ast K$ threshold respectively. They are extremely narrow
because their strong decays violate the isospin symmetry. We study the possible
heavy molecular states composed of a pair of excited charm strange mesons. As a
byproduct, we also present the numerical results for the bottonium-like
analogue.
