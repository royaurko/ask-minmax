Aims. The detection and measurement of gravitational-waves from coalescing
neutron-star binary systems is an important science goal for ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors. In addition to emitting gravitational-waves at
frequencies that span the most sensitive bands of the LIGO and Virgo detectors,
these sources are also amongst the most likely to produce an electromagnetic
counterpart to the gravitational-wave emission. A joint detection of the
gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals would provide a powerful new
probe for astronomy.
  Methods. During the period between September 19 and October 20, 2010, the
first low-latency search for gravitational-waves from binary inspirals in LIGO
and Virgo data was conducted. The resulting triggers were sent to
electromagnetic observatories for followup. We describe the generation and
processing of the low-latency gravitational-wave triggers. The results of the
electromagnetic image analysis will be described elsewhere.
  Results. Over the course of the science run, three gravitational-wave
triggers passed all of the low-latency selection cuts. Of these, one was
followed up by several of our observational partners. Analysis of the
gravitational-wave data leads to an estimated false alarm rate of once every
6.4 days, falling far short of the requirement for a detection based solely on
gravitational-wave data.
