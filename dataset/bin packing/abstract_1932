These notes are for the proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Insitutue on
"Scale Invariance, Interfaces, and Non--Equilibrium Dynamics", held at the
Isaac Newton Institute, 20--30 June 1994. The four lectures address a number of
issues related to dynamic fluctuations of lines in non-equilibrium
circumstances. The first two are devoted to the critical behavior of contact
lines and flux lines depinning from impurities. It is emphasized that
anisotropies in the medium lead to different universality classes. The
importance of nonlinearities for moving lines are discussed in the context of
flux lines and polymers in the last two lectures. A dynamic form birefringence
is predicted for drifting polymers.
