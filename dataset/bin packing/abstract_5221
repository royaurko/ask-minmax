Three-Receiver broadcast channels (BC) are of interest due to their
information-theoretic differences with two-receiver one. In this paper, we
derive achievable rate regions for two classes of 3-receiver BC with side
information (SI), i.e. Multilevel BC (MBC) and 3-receiver less noisy BC, using
a combination of superposition coding, Gelfand-Pinsker binning scheme and
Nair-El Gamal indirect decoding. Our rate region for MBC subsumes Steinberg
rate region for 2-receiver degraded BC with SI as its special case. We will
also show that the obtained achievable rate regions in the first two cases are
tight for several classes of non-deterministic, semi-deterministic, and
deterministic 3-receiver BC when SI is available both at the transmitter and at
the receivers. We also prove that as far as a receiver is deterministic in the
three-receiver less noisy BC, the presence of side information at that receiver
does not affect the capacity region. We have also provided the writing on dirty
paper (WDP) property for 3-receiver BC is provided as an example. In the last
section, we provide simple bounds on the capacity region of the Additive
Exponential noise three-receiver broadcast channels with Additive Exponential
interference (AEN-3BC-EI).
