The early stage of the transient regimes in the shock-induced flows within
solid-packed beds are investigated in the linear longwave and high-frequency
approximation. The transient resistance law is refined as the Duhameltime
integral that follows from the general concept of dynamic tortuosity and
compressibility of the packed beds. A closed-form solution is expected to
describe accurately the early stage of the transient regime flow and is in
qualitative agreement with available experimental data.
