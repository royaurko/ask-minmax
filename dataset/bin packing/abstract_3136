We study the layer-to-layer diffusion in smectic-A liquid crystals of
colloidal hard rods with different length-to-diameter ratios using computer
simulations. The layered arrangement of the smectic phase yields a hopping-type
diffusion due to the presence of permanent barriers and transient cages.
Remarkably, we detect stringlike clusters composed of inter-layer rods moving
cooperatively along the nematic director. Furthermore, we find that the
structural relaxation in equilibrium smectic phases shows interesting
similarities with that of out-of-equilibrium supercooled liquids, although
there the particles are kinetically trapped in transient rather than permanent
cages. Additionally, at fixed packing fraction we find that the barrier height
increases with increasing particle anisotropy, and hence the dynamics is more
heterogeneous and non-Gaussian for longer rods, yielding a lower diffusion
coefficient along the nematic director and smaller clusters of inter-layer
particles that move less cooperatively. At fixed barrier height, the dynamics
becomes more non-Gaussian and heterogeneous for longer rods that move more
collectively giving rise to a higher diffusion coefficient along the nematic
director.
