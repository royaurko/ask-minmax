Random packing of unoriented regular polygons and star polygons on a
two-dimensional flat, continuous surface is studied numerically using random
sequential adsorption algorithm. Obtained results are analyzed to determine
saturated random packing ratio as well as its density autocorrelation function.
Additionally, the kinetics of packing growth and available surface function are
measured. In general, stars give lower packing ratios than polygons, but, when
the number of vertexes is large enough, both shapes approach disks and,
therefore, properties of their packing reproduce already known results for
disks.
