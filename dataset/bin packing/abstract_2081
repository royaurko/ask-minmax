In this work we extend recent study of the properties of the dense packing of
"superdisks," by Y. Jiao, F. H. Stillinger and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. Lett.
100, 245504 (2008), to the jammed state formed by these objects in random
sequential adsorption. The superdisks are two-dimensional shapes bound by the
curves of the form |x|^(2p) + |y|^(2p) = 1, with p > 0. We use Monte Carlo
simulations and theoretical arguments to establish that p = 1/2 is a special
point at which the jamming density has a discontinuous derivative as a function
of p. The existence of this point can be also argued for by geometrical
arguments.
