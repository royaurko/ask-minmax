A new method is employed to measure the neutral current cross section up to
Bjorken-x values of one with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated
luminosity of 65.1 pb-1 for e+p collisions and 16.7 pb-1 for e-p collisions at
sqrt{s}=318 GeV and 38.6 pb-1 for e+p collisions at sqrt{s}=300 GeV. Cross
sections have been extracted for Q2 >= 648 GeV2 and are compared to predictions
using different parton density functions. For the highest x bins, the data have
a tendency to lie above the expectations using recent parton density function
parametrizations.
