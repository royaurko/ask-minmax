We discuss a version of the Ramsey and the directed Ramsey problem. First,
consider a complete graph on $n$ vertices and a two-coloring of the edges such
that every edge is colored with at least one color and the number of bicolored
edges is given. We want to find the maximal size of a monochromatic clique
which is guaranteed by such a coloring. Analogously, in the second problem a
semicomplete digraph is given on $n$ vertices such that the number of
bioriented edges is given. The aim is to bound the size of the maximal
transitive subtournament that is guaranteed by such a digraph.
  Probabilistic and analytic tools are used to determine the order of magnitude
of the maximal substructure in terms of the bicolored or bioriented edges
besides constructions related to graph packings and feedback vertex sets.
