The solar neutrino spectrum measured by the Super-Kamiokande shows an excess
in high energy bins, which may be explained by vacuum oscillation solution or
$hep$ neutrino effect. Here we reconsider an uncertainty of the data caused by
the tail of the energy resolution function. Events observed at energy higher
than 13.5 MeV are induced by the tail of the resolution. At Super-Kamiokande
precision level this uncertainty is no more than few percent within a Gaussian
tail. But a power-law decay tail at 3 $\sigma$ results considerable excesses in
these bins, which may be another possible explanation of the anomaly in
708d(825d) data.
