Signals of bimodality have been investigated in experimental data of
quasi-projectile decay produced in Au+Au collisions at 35 AMeV. This same data
set was already shown to present several signals characteristic of a first
order, liquid-gas-like phase transition. For the present analysis, events are
sorted in bins of transverse energy of light charged particles emitted by the
quasi-target source. A sudden change in the fragmentation pattern is observed
from the distributions of the asymmetry of the two largest fragments, and the
charge of the largest fragment. This latter distribution shows a bimodal
behavior. The interpretation of this signal is discussed.
