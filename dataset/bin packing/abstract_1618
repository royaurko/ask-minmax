It is suggested that the study of multiplicity difference correlators between
two well-separated bins in high-energy heavy-ion collisions can be used as a
means to detect evidence of a quark-hadron phase transition. Analytical
expressions for the scaled factorial moments of multiplicity difference
distribution are obtained in a kinetical region ${\bar s}\le 0.3$ within
Ginzburg-Landau description. It is shown that the scaling behaviors between the
moments are still valid, though the behaviors of the moments with respect to
the bin size are completely different from the so-called intermittency
patterns. A universal exponent $\gamma$ is given to describe the dynamical
fluctuations in the phase transition.
