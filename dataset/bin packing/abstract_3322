We study membrane-protein interactions and membrane-mediated protein-protein
interactions by Monte Carlo simulations of a generic coarse-grained model for
lipid bilayers with cylindrical hydrophobic inclusions. The strength of the
hydrophobic force and the hydrophobic thickness of the proteins are
systematically varied. The results are compared with analytical predictions of
two popular analytical theories: The Landau-de Gennes theory and the elastic
theory. The elastic theory provides an excellent description of the fluctuation
spectra of pure membranes and successfully reproduces the deformation profiles
of membranes around single proteins. However, its prediction for the potential
of mean force between proteins is not compatible with the simulation data for
large distances. The simulations show that the lipid-mediated interactions are
governed by five competing factors: Direct interactions, lipid-induced
depletion interactions, lipid bridging, lipid packing, and a smooth long-range
contribution. The mechanisms leading to "hydrophobic mismatch" interactions are
critically analyzed.
