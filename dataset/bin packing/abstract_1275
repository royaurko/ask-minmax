The free energy and other thermodynamic properties of hexagonal-close-packed
iron are calculated by direct {\em ab initio} methods over a wide range of
pressures and temperatures relevant to the Earth's core. The {\em ab initio}
calculations are based on density-functional theory in the generalised-gradient
approximation, and are performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW)
approach. Thermal excitation of electrons is fully included. The Helmholtz free
energy consists of three parts, associated with the rigid perfect lattice,
harmonic lattice vibrations, and anharmonic contributions, and the technical
problems of calculating these parts to high precision are investigated. The
harmonic part is obtained by computing the phonon frequencies over the entire
Brillouin zone, and by summation of the free-energy contributions associated
with the phonon modes. The anharmonic part is computed by the technique of
thermodynamic integration using carefully designed reference systems. Detailed
results are presented for the pressure, specific heat, bulk modulus, expansion
coefficient and Gr\"{u}neisen parameter, and comparisons are made with values
obtained from diamond-anvil-cell and shock experiments.
