We introduce a new statistic omega_l for measuring and analyzing large-scale
structure and particularly the baryon acoustic oscillations. omega_l is a
band-filtered, configuration space statistic that is easily implemented and has
advantages over the traditional power spectrum and correlation function
estimators. Unlike these estimators, omega_l can localize most of the acoustic
information into a single dip at the acoustic scale while also avoiding
sensitivity to the poorly constrained large scale power (i.e., the integral
constraint) through the use of a localized and compensated filter. It is also
sensitive to anisotropic clustering through pair counting and does not require
any binning. We measure the shift in the acoustic peak due to nonlinear effects
using the monopole omega_0 derived from subsampled dark matter catalogues as
well as from mock galaxy catalogues created via halo occupation distribution
(HOD) modeling. All of these are drawn from 44 realizations of 1024^3 particle
dark matter simulations in a 1h^{-1}Gpc box at z=1. We compare these shifts
with those obtained from the power spectrum and conclude that the results
agree. This indicates that any distance measurements obtained from omega_0 and
P(k) will be consistent with each other. We also show that it is possible to
extract the same amount of acoustic information using either omega_0 or P(k)
from equal volume surveys.
