In a recent paper, Brusco, K\"ohn and Steinley [Ann. Oper. Res. 206:611-626
(2013)] conjecture that the 2 bins special case of the one-dimensional minimax
bin-packing problem with bin size constraints might be solvable in polynomial
time. In this note, we show that this problem is NP-hard for the special case
and that it is strongly NP-hard for the general problem. We also propose a
pseudo-polynomial algorithm for the special case and a constructive heuristic
for the general problem.
