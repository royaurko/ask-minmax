Recent studies reveal that certain viruses package a portion of their genome
in a manner that mirrors the icosahedral symmetry of the protein container, or
capsid. Graph theoretical constraints forbid exact realization of icosahedral
symmetry. This paper proposes a model for the determination of
quasi-icosahedral genome structures and discusses the connection between
genomic structure and viral assembly kinetics.
