We report the results of a study of the exclusive charmless semileptonic
B0->pilnu decay undertaken with approximately 227 million BBbar pairs collected
at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector. The analysis uses events
in which the signal B mesons are reconstructed with a novel loose neutrino
reconstruction technique. We obtain partial branching fractions in 12 bins of
q2, the l+nu invariant mass squared, from which we extract the f+(q2) form
factor shape and the total branching fraction: BF(B0->pilnu) = (1.44 +-
0.08(stat) +- 0.10(syst))x 10-4. Based on a recent theoretical calculation of
the form factor, we find the magnitude of the CKM matrix element |Vub| to be
(4.1 +- 0.2(stat) +- 0.2(syst) +0.6-0.4(FF))x 10-3, where the last uncertainty
is due to the normalization of the form factor.
