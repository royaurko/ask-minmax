The $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the low-frequency-peaked BL Lac (LBL) object AP
Librae is studied, following the discovery of very-high-energy (VHE;
$E>100\,{\rm GeV}$) $\gamma$-ray emission up to the TeV range by the H.E.S.S.
experiment. This makes AP Librae one of the few VHE emitters of the LBL type.
The measured spectrum yields a flux of $(8.8 \pm 1.5_{\rm stat} \pm 1.8_{\rm
sys}) \times 10^{-12}\ {\rm cm}^{-2} {\rm s}^{-1}$ above 130 GeV and a spectral
index of $\Gamma = 2.65\pm0.19_{\rm stat}\pm0.20_{\rm sys}$. This study also
makes use of \textit{Fermi}-LAT, observations in the high energy (HE, E$>$100
MeV) range, providing the longest continuous light curve (5 years) ever
published on this source. The source underwent a flaring event between MJD
56306-56376 in the HE range, with a flux increase of a factor 3.5 in the 14-day
bin light curve and no significant variation in spectral shape with respect to
the low-flux state. While the H.E.S.S., and (low state) \textit{Fermi}-LAT
fluxes are in good agreement where they overlap, a spectral curvature between
the steep VHE spectrum and the \textit{Fermi}-LAT, spectrum is observed. The
maximum of the $\gamma$-ray emission in the spectral energy distribution is
located below the GeV energy range.
