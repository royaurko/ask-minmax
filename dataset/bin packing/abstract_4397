We report on the results of a novel partial-wave analysis based on $50\cdot
10^6$ events from the reaction $\pi^- + p \to \pi^-\pi-^\pi^+ +
p_\text{recoil}$ at 190 $\text{GeV/c}$ incoming beam momentum using the COMPASS
spectrometer. A separated analysis in bins of $m_{3\pi}$ and four-momentum
transfer $t'$ reveals the interference of resonant and non-resonant particle
production and allows their spectral separation. Besides well known resonances
we observe a new iso-vector meson $a_1(1420)$ at a mass of 1420
$\text{MEV\c}^2$ in the $f_0(980)\pi$ final state only, the origin of which is
unclear. We have also examined the structure of the $0^{++}$ $\pi\pi$-isobar in
the $J^{PC}=0^{-+}, 1^{++}, 2^{-+}$ three pion waves. This clearly reveals the
various $0^{++}$ $\pi\pi$-isobar components and its correlation to the decay of
light mesons.
