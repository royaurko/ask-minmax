In this note, we prove that separable subgroups have bounded packing in
ambient groups. The notion bounded packing was introduced by Hruska and Wise
and in particular, our result answers positively a question of theirs, asking
whether each subgroup of a virtually polycyclic group has the bounded packing
property.
