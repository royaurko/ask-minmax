We prove that the total range of Super-Brownian motion with quadratic
branching mechanism has an exact packing measure with respect to the gauge
function $g(r)=r^4 (\log \log1/r)^{-3}$ in super-critical dimensions $d\geq 5$.
More precisely, we prove that the total occupation measure of Super-Brownian
motion is equal to the $g$-packing measure restricted to its range, up to a
deterministic multiplicative constant that only depends on space dimension $d$.
