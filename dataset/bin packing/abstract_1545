Geometrical properties of the extreme Kerr black holes in the topological
sectors of nonextreme and extreme configurations are studied. We find that the
Euler characteristic plays an essential role to distinguish these two kinds of
extreme black holes. The relationship between the geometrical properties and
the intrinsic thermodynamics are investigated.
