We present a Chandra analysis of the X-ray spectra of 56 clusters of galaxies
at z>0.3, which cover a temperature range of 3>kT>15 keV. Our analysis is aimed
at measuring the iron abundance in the ICM out to the highest redshift probed
to date. We find that the emission-weighted iron abundance measured within
(0.15-0.3)R_vir in clusters below 5 keV is, on average, a factor of ~2 higher
than in hotter clusters, following Z(T)~0.88T^-(0.47)Z_o, which confirms the
trend seen in local samples. We made use of combined spectral analysis
performed over five redshift bins at 0.3>z>1.3 to estimate the average emission
weighted iron abundance. We find a constant average iron abundance Z_Fe~0.25Z_o
as a function of redshift, but only for clusters at z>0.5. The
emission-weighted iron abundance is significantly higher (Z_Fe~0.4Z_o) in the
redshift range z~0.3-0.5, approaching the value measured locally in the inner
0.15R_vir radii for a mix of cool-core and non cool-core clusters in the
redshift range 0.1<z<0.3. The decrease in Z_Fe with redshift can be
parametrized by a power law of the form ~(1+z)^(-1.25). The observed evolution
implies that the average iron content of the ICM at the present epoch is a
factor of ~2 larger than at z=1.2. We confirm that the ICM is already
significantly enriched (Z_Fe~0.25Z_o) at a look-back time of 9 Gyr. Our data
provide significant constraints on the time scales and physical processes that
drive the chemical enrichment of the ICM.
