The centrality dependence of transverse momentum spectra for identified
hadrons at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV is
systematically studied in a quark combination model. The $\mathrm{{p}_{T}}$
spectra of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p(\bar{p})$ and $\Lambda(\bar{\Lambda})$ in
different centrality bins and the nuclear modification factors ($R_{CP}$) for
these hadrons are calculated. The centrality dependence of the average
collective transverse velocity $<\beta (r)>$ for the hot and dense quark matter
is obtained in Au+Au collisions, and it is applied to a relative smaller Cu+Cu
collision system. The centrality dependence of $\mathrm{{p}_{T}}$ spectra and
the $R_{CP}$ for $\pi^{0}$, $K_{s}^{0}$ and $\Lambda$ in Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV are well described. The results show that $<\beta
(r)>$ is only a function of the number of participants $N_{part}$ and it is
independent of the collision system.
