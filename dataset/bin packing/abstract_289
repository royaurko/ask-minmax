Fully packed loop models describe the statistics of closely packed nested
polygons on the square lattice. Many exact results can be obtained for these
models, even for finite geometries, using their close relationship to
alternating-sign matrices and the solvable six-vertex and O(n=1) lattice
models. Some results for the exact partition function of fully packed loop
models on various finite geometries are briefly reviewed, as well as the
well-known order-disorder bulk phase transition present in these models.
  A detailed study is presented of the distribution of boundary nests of
polygons in fully packed loop models with mirror or rotational symmetry. The
probability distribution function of such nests, as well as the average number
of nests, are obtained analytically, albeit conjecturally. It is further shown
that fully packed loop models undergo another phase transition as a function of
the boundary nest fugacity. At criticality, we derive a scaling form for the
nest distribution function which displays an unusual non-Gaussian cubic
exponential behaviour.
