The two-body photodisintegration of 3He has been investigated using tagged
photons with energies from 14 -- 31 MeV at MAX-lab in Lund, Sweden. The
two-body breakup channel was unambiguously identified by the (nonsimultaneous)
detection of both protons and deuterons. This approach was made feasible by the
over-determined kinematic situation afforded by the tagged-photon technique.
Proton- and deuteron-energy spectra were measured using four silicon
surface-barrier detector telescopes located at a laboratory angle of 90deg with
respect to the incident photon-beam direction. Average statistical and
systematic uncertainties of 5.7% and 6.6% in the differential cross section
were obtained for 11 photon-energy bins with an average width of 1.2 MeV. The
results are compared to previous experimental data measured at comparable
photon energies as well as to the results of two recent Faddeev calculations
which employ realistic potential models and take into account three-nucleon
forces and final-state interactions. Both the accuracy and precision of the
present data are improved over the previous measurements. The data are in good
agreement with most of the previous results, and favor the inclusion of
three-nucleon forces in the calculations.
