Dense packings composed of irregular polyhedral particles are investigated by
numerical simulations under quasistatic triaxial compression. The Contact
Dynamics method is used for this investigation with 40 000 particles. The
effect of particle shape is analyzed by comparing this packing with a packing
of similar particle size distribution but with spherical particles. We analyze
the origin of the higher shear strength of the polyhedra packing by considering
various anisotropy parameters characterizing the microstructure and force
transmission. Remarkably, we find that the polyhedra packing has a lower fabric
anisotropy in terms of branch vectors (joining the particle centers) than the
sphere packing. In contrast, the polyhedra packing shows a much higher force
anisotropy which is at the origin of its higher shear strength. The force
anisotropy in the polyhedra packing is shown to be related to the formation of
face-face contacts. In particular, most face-face contacts belong to strong
force chains along the major principal stress direction whereas vertex-face and
edge-edge contacts are correlated with weak forces and oriented on average
along the minor principal stress direction in steady shearing.
