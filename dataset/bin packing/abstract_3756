We examine new methods of producing and analyzing the empirical initial-final
mass relation for open cluster white dwarfs (WDs). We re-determine initial and
final masses for the complete sample of published cluster WDs and then pare
this sample using stringent criteria. We create an empirical initial-final mass
relation by binning all WDs in individual clusters to a single point. Despite
potentially significant systematics arising from this approach, we are
comfortable concluding that, to within current observational constraints, the
initial-final mass relation is linear, any intrinsic scatter in the relation is
<~0.05 solar masses, and there is no metallicity dependence. More exploration
of these issues is clearly warranted.
