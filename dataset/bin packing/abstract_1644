We reexamined the argument that the quasinormal modes could be a probe of the
phase transition of a topological black hole to a hairy configuration by
investigating general scalar perturbations. We found further evidence in the
quasinormal modes for this phase transition. For the general black hole
configurations, we observed that although the quasinormal modes can present us
different phases of different configurations, there is no dramatic change in
the slope of quasinormal frequencies at the critical point of the phase
transition. More detailed studies of quasinormal modes are needed to reveal the
subtle behavior of the phase transition.
