We present a determination of the strong coupling constant using ATLAS
inclusive jet cross section data at sqrt{s} = 7TeV, with their full information
on the bin-to-bin correlations. Several procedures for combining the
statistical information from the data inputs are compared. The theoretical
prediction is obtained using NLO QCD with non-perturbative corrections. Our
determination uses inputs with transverse momenta between 45 and 600 GeV, the
running of the strong coupling being also tested in this range. Good agreement
is observed when comparing our result with the world average at the Z-boson
scale, as well as with the most recent results from the Tevatron.
