We present measurements of the FUV (1530A) and NUV (2310A) galaxy luminosity
functions (LF) at low redshift (z<0.2) from GALEX observations matched to the
2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. We split our FUV and NUV samples into two UV-bj
color bins and two redshift bins. As observed at optical wavelengths, the local
LF of the bluest galaxies tend to have steeper faint end slopes and fainter
characteristic magnitudes M* than the reddest subsamples. We find evidence for
color dependent evolution at very low redshift in both bands, with bright blue
galaxies becoming dominant in the highest redshift bin. The evolution of the
total LF is consistent with an 0.3 magnitude brightening between z=0 and 0.13,
in agreement with the first analysis of deeper GALEX fields probing adjacent
and higher redshifts.
