We study real-time correlators in the warped AdS/CFT correspondence. We apply
the prescription used in the usual AdS/CFT correspondence and obtain the
retarded Green's functions for the scalar and vector fields in the spacelike
warped and the null warped black hole backgrounds. We find that the retarded
Green's functions and the cross sections are well consistent with the
predictions from dual CFT. Our results not only support strongly the
conjectured warped AdS/CFT correspondence, but also show that the usual
relativistic AdS/CFT prescription of obtaining the real-time correlators remain
effective in more general backgrounds with anisotropic conformal infinity.
