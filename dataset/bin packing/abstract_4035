We introduce a new statistic to measure more accurately the cosmic sound
speed of clusters of galaxies at different redshifts. This statistic is
evaluated by cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations
caused by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from observed clusters of galaxies with
their redshifts. When clusters are distributed in redshift bins of narrow
width, one could measure the mean squared cluster peculiar velocity with an
error \sigma_{C_S^2}\lsim (300{\rm km/s})^2. This can be done around z>0.3 with
clusters of flux above 200 mJy which will be detected by PLANCK, coupled with
high resolution microwave images to eliminate the cosmological part of the CMB
fluctuations. The latter can be achieved with observations by the planned ALMA
array or the NSF South Pole telescope and other surveys. By measuring the
cosmic sound speed and the bulk flow in, e.g., 4 spheres of ~ 100h^{-1}Mpc at
z=0.3, we could have a direct measurement of the matter density
0.21<\Omega_m<0.47 at 95 % confidence level.
