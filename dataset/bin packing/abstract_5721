Internet generation is growing accustomed to having broadband access wherever
they go and not just at home or in the office, which turns mobile broadband
into a reality. This paper aims to look for a suitable mobile broadband
solution in the South Asian region through comparative analysis in various
perspectives. Both WiMAX and LTE are 4G technologies designed to move data
rather than voice having IP networks based on OFDM technology. Proving
competency in various significant aspects WiMAX and LTE already have made a
strong position in telecommunication industry. Again, because of certain
similarities in technology; they aren't like technological rivals as of GSM and
CDMA. But still they are treated as opponents and viewed as a major threat in
case of the flourishing of each other. Such view point is surely not conducive
for getting the best out of them. In this paper various aspects and
applications of WiMAX and LTE for deployment have been analyzed. South Asia
being the residence of an enormous number of people presents an exciting
opportunity for mobile operators, developers and internet service providers.
So, every consideration that has been made here also correlates successfully
with south Asia i.e. how mass people of this region may be benefited from it.
As a result, it might be regarded as a good source in case of making major BWA
deployment decisions in this region. Besides these, it also opens the path for
further research and thinking in this issue.
