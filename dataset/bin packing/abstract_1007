We study the elastic scattering of atomic argon by a electron in the presence
of a bichromatic laser field. The numerical calculation is done in the first
Born approximation (FBA) for a simple screening electric potential. With the
help of numerical results we explore the dependence of the differential cross
sections (DCS) on the relative phase between the two components of the
radiation field and discuss the influence of the number of photons exchanged on
the phase-dependence effect. Moreover, we also discuss the numerical results of
the DCS for different scattering angles and impact energies.
