Recently, is has been observed that events with the {\it same} total
transverse energy of light charged particles (LCP) in the quasi target region,
$E_{\perp 12}^{QT}$, show two quite distinct reaction scenarios in the
projectile domain: multifragmentation and residue production. This phenomenon
has been dubbed "bimodality". Using Quantum Molecular Dynamics calculations we
demonstrate that this observation is very general. It appears in collisions of
all symmetric systems larger than Ca and at beam energies between 50 A.MeV and
600 A.MeV and is due to large fluctuations of the impact parameter for a given
$E_{\perp 12}^{QT}$. Investigating in detail the $E_{\perp 12}^{QT}$ bin in
which both scenarios are present, we find that neither the average fragment
momenta nor the average transverse and longitudinal energies of fragments show
the behavior expected from a system in statistical equilibrium, in experiment
as well as in QMD simulations. On the contrary, the experimental as well as the
theoretical results point towards a fast process. This observation questions
the conjecture that the observed bimodality is due to the coexistence of 2
phases at a given temperature in finite systems.
