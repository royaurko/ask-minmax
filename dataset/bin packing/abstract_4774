A method of growing mushroom or shell like nanostructured metal convex
concave models has been worked out. Silver,copper,nickel,rhodium and
Pd-Ni,Pd-Co alloy structures are reproduced as a result of self-assembly of
nanowires growing on porous membranes in the course of pulse current
electrodeposition. It is shown that the method allows to model not only the
shell shape but also the hierarchical structure at the nano, micro and
mesolevels. A 1,2 mm sized shell was grown from Pd-Ni alloy. The architecture
of the models was studied by fragmentation and chemical etching. The images
were obtained using SUPRA 50 VP and JEOL scanning electron microscopes. The
metal shell is a bowl-shaped frame, its walls composed of densely packed
nanoelements. Each nanoelement is a conical bundle of nanowires grown as a
supported wine glass. The shell inner surface is a weave of nanowires with a
vegetation pattern with bottom up directed lines. The inner surface exhibits
also well pronounced transverse rings formed by the bottom up growing bundles
of nanowires that compose the shell frame. A number of nanowire bundle ends
rise to the shell outer surface as nanoflowers that can serve as templates for
growing nanowires. In some cases the nanowires growing on the outer surface
form a copy of plate mushroom. A hypothesis is proposed that pulsed growth on
membranes is a tool of morphogenesis of many mushrooms and plants.
