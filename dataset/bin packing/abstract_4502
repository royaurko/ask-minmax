We study the quasinormal modes (QNM) of electromagnetic perturbations for
rotating black hole with a nonminimally coupled scalar field hair and
Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS)
spacetimes. We find that the imaginary parts of quasinormal frequencies of
dynamical perturbations can reflect the properties of thermodynamical stability
disclosed by examining the free energy. In addition, we observe that the
imaginary part of QNM frequencies can also determine the dynamically preferred
stable configuration, which agrees with the study of the thermodynamically
stability. This dramatic relation between dynamics and thermodynamics is also
disclosed in three-dimensional static black hole backgrounds. The obtained
results further support that the QNM can be a dynamic probe of the
thermodynamic properties in black holes.
