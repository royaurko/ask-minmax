We present a comprehensive study of the adsorption of
bis(phthalocyaninato)lutetium(III) (LuPc$_2$) on highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite(0001) (HOPG). The growth and self-assembly of the molecular layers as
well as the electronic structure has been investigated systematically using
scanning tunnelling microscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy combined
with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular mechanics
simulations. We reveal that the adsorption of LuPc$_2$ leads to the formation
of a square-like close-packed structure on the almost inert surface of HOPG,
which is corroborated by simulations. Moreover, we observed a parallel
orientation of the LuPc$_2$ molecules in the first monolayer, whereas in
subsequent layers an increasing tilt out of the surface plane was found.
Tip-sample distance-dependent tunnelling spectroscopy measurements allowed us
to detect a shift in the energy positions of the peaks assigned to the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital toward the Fermi energy with decreasing tip-sample
separation.
