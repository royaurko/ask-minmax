We study pre-equilibrium strangeness production at RHIC energies in a new
parton cascade. Starting with the turbulent glue HIJING initial conditions we
investigate the interplay between mini-jet and soft beam jet gluons for
strangeness production prior to hadronization, and show the importance of soft
beam jet gluons in the strangeness production.
