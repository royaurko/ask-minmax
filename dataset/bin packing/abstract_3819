The measurement of the polarized gluon distribution function $\Delta g(x)$
from photon gluon fusion processes in electron proton deep inelastic scattering
producing two jets has been investigated. The study is based on the MEPJET
simulation program. The size of the expected spin asymmetry and corresponding
statistical uncertainties for a possible measurement with polarized beams of
electrons and protons at HERA have been estimated. The results show that the
asymmetry can reach a few percents.
