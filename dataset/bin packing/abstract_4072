The emission from blazars is known to be variable at all wavelengths. The
flux variability is often accompanied by spectral changes. Spectral energy
distribution (SED) changes must be associated with changes in the spectra of
emitting electrons and/or the physical parameters of the jet. Meaningful
modeling of blazar broadband spectra is required to understand the extreme
conditions within the emission region. Not only is the broadband SED crucial,
but also information about its variability is needed to understand how the
highest states of emission occur and how they differ from the low states. This
may help in discriminating between models. Here we present the results of our
SED modeling of the blazar S5 0716+714 during various phases of its activity.
The SEDs are classified into different bins depending on the optical brightness
state of the source.
