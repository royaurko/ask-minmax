Baryonic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum have been studied as a way
of probing dark-energy models. While most studies have focused on spectroscopic
surveys at high redshift, large multi-color imaging surveys have already been
planned for the near future. In view of this, we study the prospects for
measuring baryonic oscillations from angular statistics of galaxies binned
using photometric redshifts. We use the galaxy bispectrum in addition to the
power spectrum; this allows us to measure and marginalize over possibly complex
galaxy bias mechanisms to get robust cosmological constraints. In our parameter
estimation we allow for a weakly nonlinear biasing scheme that may evolve with
redshift by two bias parameters in each of ten redshift bins. We find that a
multi-color imaging survey that probes redshifts beyond one can give
interesting constraints on dark-energy parameters. In addition, the shape of
the primordial power spectrum can be measured to better accuracy than with the
CMB alone. We explore the impact of survey depth, area, and calibration errors
in the photometric redshifts on dark-energy constraints.
