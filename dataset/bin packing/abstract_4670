We investigate the topological structure of the vacuum in SU(3) lattice gauge
theory. We use under-relaxed cooling to remove the high-frequency fluctuations
and a variety of "filters" to identify the topological charges in the resulting
smoothened field configurations. We find a densely packed vacuum with an
average instanton size, in the continuum limit, of about 0.5 fm. The density at
large sizes decreases as a large inverse power of the size. At small sizes we
see some sign of a trend towards the asymptotic perturbative behaviour. We find
that an interesting polarisation phenomenon occurs: the large topological
charges tend to have, on the average, the same sign and are over-screened by
the smaller charges which tend to have, again on the average, the opposite sign
to the larger instantons. We also calculate the topological susceptibility for
which we obtain a continuum value of about 187 MeV. We perform the calculations
for various volumes, lattice spacings and numbers of cooling sweeps, so as to
obtain some control over the associated systematic errors. The coupling range
is from beta=6.0 to beta=6.4 and the lattice volumes range from 16x16x16x48 to
32x32x32x64.
