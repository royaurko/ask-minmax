We provide a geometric representation of the Poisson and Martin boundaries of
a transient, bounded degree triangulation of the plane in terms of its circle
packing in the unit disc (this packing is unique up to Mobius transformations).
More precisely, we show that any bounded harmonic function on the graph is the
harmonic extension of some measurable function on the boundary of the disk, and
that the space of extremal positive harmonic functions, i.e. the Martin
boundary, is homeomorphic to the unit circle.
  All our results hold more generally for any "good"-embedding of planar
graphs, that is, an embedding in the unit disc with straight lines such that
angles are bounded away from 0 and pi uniformly, and lengths of adjacent edges
are comparable. Furthermore, we show that in a good embedding of a planar graph
the probability that a random walk exits a disc through a sufficiently wide arc
is at least a constant, and that Brownian motion on such graphs takes time of
order r^2 to exit a disc of radius r. These answer a question recently posed by
Chelkak.
