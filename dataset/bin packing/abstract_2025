This paper shows that it is possible to dramatically reduce the memory
consumption of classes loaded in an embedded Java virtual machine without
reducing its functionalities. We describe how to pack the constant pool by
deleting entries which are only used during the class loading process. We
present some benchmarks which demonstrate the efficiency of this mechanism. We
finally suggest some additional optimizations which can be applied if some
restrictions to the functionalities of the virtual machine can be tolerated.
