We use light microscopy to investigate the aging dynamics of a glass made of
closely packed soft spheres, following a rapid transition from a fluid to a
solid-like state. By measuring time-resolved, coarse-grained displacements
fields, we identify two classes of dynamical events, corresponding to
reversible and irreversible rearrangements, respectively. The reversible events
are due to the small, experimentally unavoidable fluctuations of the
temperature imposed to the sample, leading to transient thermal expansions and
contractions that cause shear deformations. The irreversible events are plastic
rearrangements, induced by the repeated shear cycles. We show that the
displacement due to the irreversible rearrangements grows linearly with time,
both on average and at a local level. The velocity associated with this
ballistic motion decreases exponentially with sample age, accounting for the
observed slowing down of the dynamics. The displacement field due to the
irreversible rearrangements has a vortex-like structure and is spatially
correlated over surprisingly long distances.
