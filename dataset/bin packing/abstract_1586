We give criterions for the existence of toric conical Kahler-Einstein and
Kahler-Ricci soliton metrics on any toric manifold in relation to the greatest
Ricci and Bakry-Emery-Ricci lower bound. We also show that any two toric
manifolds with the same dimension can be joined by a continuous path of toric
manifolds with conical Kahler-Einstein metrics in the Gromov-Hausdorff
topology.
