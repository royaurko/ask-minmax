We have constructed a catalog containing best available astrometric,
photometric, radial velocity and astrophysical data for mainly F-type and
G-type stars (called the Astrometric catalog associated with Astrophysical
Data, ACAD), which contains 27,553 records, and is used for the purpose of
analyzing the stellar kinematics in the Solar neighborhood. Using the
Lindblad-Oort Model and compiled ACAD, we calculated the Solar motion and Oort
constants in different age/metallicity bins. The evolution of kinematical
parameters with stellar age and metallicity were investigated directly. The
results show that the component of the Solar motion in the direction of
Galactic rotation (denoted $S_2$) has a linear increase with respect to age,
which may be a consequence of the scattering processes, and its value for a
dynamical cold disk was found to be $8.0\pm1.2~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. $S_2$ also
increases linearly with respect to metallicity, which indicates that radial
migration is correlated to the metallicity gradient. On the other hand, the
rotational velocity of the Sun around the Galactic center has no clear
correlation with ages or metallicities of stars used in the estimation.
