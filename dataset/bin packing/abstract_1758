This article proposes a way to improve the presentation of histograms where
data are compared to expectation. Sometimes, it is difficult to judge by eye
whether the difference between the bin content and the theoretical expectation
(provided by either a fitting function or another histogram) is just due to
statistical fluctuations. More importantly, there could be statistically
significant deviations which are completely invisible in the plot. We propose
to add a small inset at the bottom of the plot, in which the statistical
significance of the deviation observed in each bin is shown. Even though the
numerical routines which we developed have only illustration purposes, it comes
out that they are based on formulae which could be used to perform statistical
inference in a proper way. An implementation of our computation is available at
