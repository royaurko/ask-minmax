Inspired by Bondarenko's counter-example to Borsuk's conjecture, we notice
some strongly regular graphs that provide examples of ball packings whose
chromatic numbers is significantly higher than the dimension. In particular, we
obtain from generalized quadrangles the first non-constant lower bound for the
difference between the chromatic number and the dimension.
