Space debris has been posing a serious threat to human space activities and
is needed to be measured and cataloged. As a new technology of space target
surveillance, the measurement accuracy of DRLR (Diffuse Reflection Laser
Ranging) is much higher than that of microwave radar and electro-optical
measurement. Based on laser ranging data of space debris from DRLR system
collected at SHAO (Shanghai Astronomical Observatory) in March-April 2013, the
characteristics and precision of the laser ranging data are analyzed and its
applications in OD (Orbit Determination) of space debris are discussed in this
paper, which is implemented for the first time in China. The experiment
indicates that the precision of laser ranging data can reach 39cm-228cm. When
the data is sufficient enough (4 arcs of 3 days), the orbit accuracy of space
debris can be up to 50m.
