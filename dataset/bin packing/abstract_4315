EKS is a numerical program that predicts differential cross sections for
production of single-inclusive hadronic jets and jet pairs at next-to-leading
order (NLO) accuracy in a perturbative QCD calculation. We describe MEKS 1.0,
an upgraded EKS program with increased numerical precision, suitable for
comparisons to the latest experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider and
Tevatron. The program integrates the regularized patron-level matrix elements
over the kinematical phase space for production of two and three partons using
the VEGAS algorithm. It stores the generated weighted events in finely binned
two-dimensional histograms for fast offline analysis. A user interface allows
one to customize computation of inclusive jet observables. Results of a
benchmark comparison of the MEKS program and the commonly used FastNLO program
are also documented.
