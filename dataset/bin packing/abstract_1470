We study the Biroli-Mezard model for lattice glasses on a number of
hierarchical networks. These networks combine certain lattice-like features
with a recursive structure that makes them suitable for exact renormalization
group studies. In our numerical simulations here, we first explore their
equilibrium properties with the Wang-Landau algorithm. Then, we investigate
their dynamical behavior using a grand-canonical annealing algorithm. We find
that the dynamics readily falls out of equilibrium and jams in many of our
networks with certain constraints on the neighborhood occupation imposed by the
Biroli-Mezard model, even in cases where exact results indicate that no ideal
glass transition exists. But while we find that time-scales for the jams
diverge, our simulations can not ascertain such a divergence for a packing
fraction that would distinctly above random close packing. In cases where we
allow hopping in our dynamical simulations, the jams on these networks
generally disappear, in contrast to what has been found in lattices simulations
previously.
