We measure the number Omega(phi) of mechanically stable states of volume
fraction phi of a granular assembly under gravity. The granular entropy S(phi)
= log Omega(phi) vanishes both at high density, at phi = phi_rcp, and a low
density, at phi = phi_rvlp, where phi_rvlp is a new lower bound we call random
very loose pack. phi_rlp is the volume fraction where the entropy is maximal.
These findings allow for a clear explanation of compaction experiments, and
provide the first first-principle definition of the random loose volume
fraction. In the context of the statistical mechanics approach to static
granular materials, states with phi < phi_rlp are characterized by a negative
temperature.
