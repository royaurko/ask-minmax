Using a multiphase transport model (AMPT), which includes both initial
partonic and final hadronic interactions, we study the rapidity distributions
of charged particles such as protons, antiprotons, pions, and kaons in heavy
ion collisions at RHIC. The theoretical results for the total charged particle
multiplicity at midrapidity are consistent with those measured by the PHOBOS
collaboration in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt s$ = 56 and 130 AGeV. We
find that these hadronic observables are much more sensitive to the hadronic
interactions than the partonic interactions.
