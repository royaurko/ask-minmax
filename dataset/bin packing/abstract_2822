I consider a one dimensional system of particles which interact through a
hard core of diameter $\si$ and can connect to each other if they are closer
than a distance $d$. The mean cluster size increases as a function of the
density $\rho$ until it diverges at some critical density, the percolation
threshold. This system can be mapped onto an off-lattice generalization of the
Potts model which I have called the Potts fluid, and in this way, the mean
cluster size, pair connectedness and percolation probability can be calculated
exactly. The mean cluster size is $S = 2 \exp[ \rho (d -\si)/(1 - \rho \si)] -
1$ and diverges only at the close packing density $\rho_{cp} = 1 / \si $. This
is confirmed by the behavior of the percolation probability. These results
should help in judging the effectiveness of approximations or simulation
methods before they are applied to higher dimensions.
