We present a parallel approximation algorithm for a class of mixed packing
and covering semidefinite programs which generalize on the class of positive
semidefinite programs as considered by Jain and Yao [2011]. As a corollary we
get a faster approximation algorithm for positive semidefinite programs with
better dependence of the parallel running time on the approximation factor, as
compared to that of Jain and Yao [2011]. Our algorithm and analysis is on
similar lines as that of Young [2001] who considered analogous linear programs.
