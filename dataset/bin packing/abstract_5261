In this paper, we demonstrate the LHC discovery potential of new charged
vector boson $W_1^{\pm}$ predicted by the Minimal Higgsless model in the
process $pp\to W_1^{\pm}qq^{\prime}\to W^{\pm}Z^0qq^\prime\to
\ell^{\pm}\ell^+\ell^-\nu qq^{\prime}(\ell=e,\mu)$ by analyzing the generator
level events of the signal and backgrounds. The generator for the signal $pp
\to {W_1}^{\pm}qq^\prime\to W^{\pm}Z^0qq^\prime$ at tree level is developed
with the Minimal Higgsless model and then interfaced with PYTHIA for the parton
showers and hadronization. The backgrounds are produced with PYTHIA and ACERMC.
We give integrated luminosities required to discover 5$\sigma$ signal as a
function of $W_1^{\pm}$ mass.
