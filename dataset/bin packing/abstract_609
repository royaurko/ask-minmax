In this paper, we investigate operator-valued frames with the structure of
group-like unitary system. We show the commutant of the group-like unitary
system can be characterized in terms of analysis operators associated with all
the operator-valued Bessel generators and give some sufficient and necessary
conditions to describe when an operator-valued frame generator admits a
Parseval dual.
