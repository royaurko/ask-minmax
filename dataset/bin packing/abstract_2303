Lattices abound in nature - from the crystal structure of minerals to the
honey-comb organization of ommatidia in the compound eye of insects. Such
regular arrangements provide solutions for optimally dense packings, efficient
resource distribution and cryptographic schemes, highlighting the importance of
lattice theory in mathematics and physics, biology and economics, and computer
science and coding theory. Do lattices also play a role in how the brain
represents information? To answer this question, we focus on higher-dimensional
stimulus domains, with particular emphasis on neural representations of the
physical space explored by an animal. Using information theory, we ask how to
optimize the spatial resolution of neuronal lattice codes.
  We show that the hexagonal activity patterns of grid cells found in the
hippocampal formation of mammals navigating on a flat surface lead to the
highest spatial resolution in a two-dimensional world. For species that move
freely in a three-dimensional environment, the firing fields should be arranged
along a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice or a equally dense non-lattice
variant thereof known as a hexagonal close packing (HCP). This quantitative
prediction could be tested experimentally in flying bats, arboreal monkeys, or
cetaceans. More generally, our theoretical results suggest that the brain
encodes higher-dimensional sensory or cognitive variables with populations of
grid-cell-like neurons whose activity patterns exhibit lattice structures at
multiple, nested scales.
