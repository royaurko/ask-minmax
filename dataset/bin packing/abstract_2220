A novel kind of crystal order in high-density nanoconfined bilayer ice is
proposed from molecular dynamics and density-functional theory simulations. A
first-order transition is observed between a low-temperature proton-ordered
solid and a high-temperature proton-disordered solid. The latter is shown to
possess crystalline order for the oxygen positions, arranged on a close-packed
triangular lattice with AA stacking. Uniquely amongst the ice phases, the
triangular bilayer is characterized by two levels of disorder (for the bonding
network and for the protons) which results in a residual entropy twice that of
bulk ice.
