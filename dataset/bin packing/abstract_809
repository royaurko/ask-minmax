We present a systematic investigation of the distribution of normal forces at
the boundaries of static packings of spheres. A new method for the efficient
construction of large hexagonal-close-packed crystals is introduced and used to
study the effect of spatial ordering on the distribution of forces. Under
uniaxial compression we find that the form for the probability distribution of
normal forces between particles does not depend strongly on crystallinity or
inter-particle friction. In all cases the distribution decays exponentially at
large forces and shows a plateau or possibly a small peak near the average
force but does not tend to zero at small forces.
