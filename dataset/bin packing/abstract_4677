We introduce the concept of pseudo symplectic capacities which is a mild
generalization of that of symplectic capacities. As a generalization of the
Hofer-Zehnder capacity we construct a Hofer-Zehnder type pseudo symplectic
capacity and estimate it in terms of Gromov-Witten invariants. The (pseudo)
symplectic capacities of Grassmannians and some product symplectic manifolds
are computed. As applications we first derive some general nonsqueezing
theorems that generalize and unite many previous versions, then prove the
Weinstein conjecture for cotangent bundles over a large class of symplectic
uniruled manifolds (including the uniruled manifolds in algebraic geometry) and
also show that any closed symplectic submanifold of codimension two in any
symplectic manifold has a small neighborhood whose Hofer-Zehnder capacity is
less than a given positive number. Finally, we give two results on symplectic
packings in Grassmannians and on Seshadri constants.
