The time-convolutionless (TCL) non-Markovian master equation was generally
thought to break down at finite time due to its singularity and fail to produce
the asymptotic behavior in strong coupling regime. However, in this paper, we
show that the singularity is not an obstacle for validity of the TCL master
equation. Further, we propose a multiscale perturbative method valid for
solving the TCL master equation in strong coupling regime, though the ordinary
perturbative method invalidates therein.
