Previous studies demonstrated empirically that human mobility exhibits Levy
flight behaviour. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms governing this Levy
flight behaviour remains limited. Here we analyze over 72 000 people's moving
trajectories, obtained from 50 taxicabs during a six-month period in a large
street network, and illustrate that the human mobility pattern, or the Levy
flight behaviour, is mainly attributed to the underlying street network. In
other words, the goal-directed nature of human movement has little effect on
the overall traffic distribution. We further simulate the mobility of a large
number of random walkers, and find that (1) the simulated random walkers can
reproduce the same human mobility pattern, and (2) the simulated mobility rate
of the random walkers correlates pretty well (an R square up to 0.87) with the
observed human mobility rate.
