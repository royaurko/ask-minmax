We put cluster tilting in ageneral framework by showing that any quotient of
a triangulated category modulo a tilting subcategory (that is, a maximal
one-orthogonal subcategory) carries an abelian structure. These abelian
quotients turn out to be module categories of Goreisten algebras of dimension
at most one.
