Seeing sharper or becoming invisible are visions strongly driving the
development of THz metamaterials. Strings are a preferred architecture of
metamaterials as they extend continuously along one dimension. Here, we
demonstrate that laterally interconnecting strings by structural elements that
are placed in oscillation nodes such as to not quench electromagnetic
resonances enables manufacturing of self-supported free-standing all-metal
metamaterials. Upright S-strings, interconnected by rods, form a space-grid
which we call meta-foil. In this way, we introduce binding between the "atoms"
of the metamaterial, thus doing away with conventional "frozen-in solutions"
like matrix embedding or thin films on substrates. Meta-foils are locally
stiff, yet globally flexible. Even bent to cylinders of 1 cm radius, they
maintain their spectral response, thus becoming true metamaterials on curved
surfaces. Exploiting UV/X-ray lithography and ultimately plastic moulding,
meta-foils can be cost-effectively manufactured in large areas and quantities
to serve as optical elements.
