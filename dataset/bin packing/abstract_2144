This paper describes a general algorithm for finding the commensurator of a
non-arithmetic cusped hyperbolic manifold, and for deciding when two such
manifolds are commensurable. The method is based on some elementary
observations regarding horosphere packings and canonical cell decompositions.
For example, we use this to find the commensurators of all non-arithmetic
hyperbolic once-punctured torus bundles over the circle.
  For hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the algorithm has been implemented using
Goodman's computer program Snap. We use this to determine the commensurability
classes of all cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds triangulated using at most 7 ideal
tetrahedra, and for the complements of hyperbolic knots and links with up to 12
crossings.
