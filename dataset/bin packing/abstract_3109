We consider the Helmholtz problem in the context of the evolution of uniform
initial distribution of a physical attribute in general porous media subject to
a partially absorbing boundary condition. Its spectral property as a reflection
of the boundary geometry has been widely exploited, such as in biological and
geophysical applications. We consider the situation where the critical
assumptions which enable such applications break down. Specifically, what are
the consequences of an inhomogeneous absorption strength? By means of
perturbation theory, exact theoretical results, and numerical simulations on
random sphere packs, we identify the regions of parameter space in which such
inhomogeneity is important and those in which it is not. Our findings shed
light on the issue that limits the mapping between the diffusion/relaxation
spectrum and the underlying boundary geometry.
