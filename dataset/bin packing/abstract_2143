Following the recent proposal made by Bouttier et al [Phys. Rev. E 76, 041140
(2007)], we study analytically the mobility properties of a single vacancy in
the close-packed dimer model on the square lattice. Using the spanning web
representation, we find determinantal expressions for various observable
quantities. In the limiting case of large lattices, they can be reduced to the
calculation of Toeplitz determinants and minors thereof. The probability for
the vacancy to be strictly jammed and other diffusion characteristics are
computed exactly.
