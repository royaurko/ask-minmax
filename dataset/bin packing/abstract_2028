The nonuniversal behavior of two noncompact nonlinear sigma models is
described. When these theories are defined on a lattice, the behavior
of the order parameter (magnetization) near the critical point is
sensitive to the details of the lattice definition. This is counter to
experience and to expectations based on the ideas of universality.
