Elastic and dissipative properties of granular assemblies under uniaxial
compression are studied both experimentally and by numerical simulations.
Following a novel compaction procedure at varying oscillatory pressures, the
stress response to a step-strain reveals an exponential relaxation followed by
a slow logarithmic decay. Simulations indicate that the latter arises from the
coupling between damping and collective grain motion predominantly through
sliding. We characterize an analogous "glass transition" for packed grains,
below which the system shows aging in time-dependent sliding correlation
functions.
