As a droplet impacts on a granular substrate, both the intruder and the
target deform, during which the liquid may penetrate into the substrate. {These
three aspects together distinguish} it from other impact phenomena in the
literature. We perform high-speed, double-laser profilometry measurements and
disentangle the dynamics into three aspects: the deformation of the substrate
during the impact, the maximum spreading diameter of the droplet, and the
penetration of the liquid into the substrate. By systematically varying the
impact speed and the packing fraction of the substrate, (i) the substrate
deformation indicates a critical packing fraction $\phi^*\approx 0.585$; (ii)
the maximum droplet spreading diameter is found to scale with a Weber number
corrected by the substrate deformation; and (iii) a model about the liquid
penetration is established and is used to explain the observed crater
morphology transition.
