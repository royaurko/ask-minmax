I present first results of LOFAR observations with international baselines.
An important cornerstone was the detection of the first long-baseline fringes.
Their analysis turns out to be extremely useful to investigate and solve a
number of technical issues of the instrument. Crude maps of the sky are created
from single-baseline delay/fringe-rate spectra and compared with a
short-baseline synthesis map. First long-baseline LBA images are shown of the
source 3C196, a bright quasar whose sub-components can only be resolved with
the long baselines. The corresponding sub-arcsec HBA image does not show the
same amount of details yet, but HBA results are expected to improve
significantly very soon. The LBA long-baseline image of 3C196 comprises the
highest-resolution radio map ever produced at this low frequency.
