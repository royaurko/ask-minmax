Problem of high PT suppression in RHIC data is generally associated to jet
quenching in a dense medium. We recently proposed a new approach to high energy
nuclear scattering, which treats the initial stage of heavy ion collisions in a
sophisticated way, and whose numerical solution is the model NEXUS. Within this
model, there is no jet quenching, but the explicit energy conservation leads to
similar results. RHIC high PT ratio between AA and pp results can be reproduced
for different centrality bins.
