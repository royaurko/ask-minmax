We present a new scheme to generate high dimensional entanglement between two
photonic systems. The idea is based on parametric down conversion with a
sequence of pump pulses generated by a mode-locked laser. We prove
experimentally the feasibility of this scheme by performing a Franson-type Bell
test using a 2-way interferometer with path-length difference equal to the
distance between 2 pump pulses. With this experiment, we can demonstrate
entanglement for a two-photon state of at least dimension D=11. Finally, we
propose a feasible experiment to show a Fabry-Perot like effect for a high
dimensional two-photon state.
