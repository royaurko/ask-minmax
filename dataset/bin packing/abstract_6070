When an extrasolar planet passes in front of its star (transits), its radius
can be measured from the decrease in starlight and its orbital period from the
time between transits. Multiple planets transiting the same star reveal more:
period ratios determine stability and dynamics, mutual gravitational
interactions reflect planet masses and orbital shapes, and the fraction of
transiting planets observed as multiples has implications for the planarity of
planetary systems. But few stars have more than one known transiting planet,
and none has more than three. Here we report Kepler spacecraft observations of
a single Sun-like star that reveal six transiting planets, five with orbital
periods between 10 and 47 days plus a sixth one with a longer period. The five
inner planets are among the smallest whose masses and sizes have both been
measured, and these measurements imply substantial envelopes of light gases.
The degree of coplanarity and proximity of the planetary orbits imply energy
dissipation near the end of planet formation.
