We investigate the 35-plet baryons from the chiral soliton models. We find
that the coupling constant for the decay of 35-plet baryons with spin 3/2 to
the decuplet baryons is surprisingly small, but that for the decay to 27-plet
baryons with spin 3/2 is larger. We give all the masses and widths of 35-plet
baryons with spin 5/2 and suggest candidates for all nonexotic members from the
available particle listings. We also focus on $\Delta_{5/2}$ and $\Theta_2$,
which are the lightest two baryons of 35-plet with spin 5/2 and with simplest
minimal pentaquark configurations. Calculations show that
$\Gamma_{\Delta_{5/2}}<$380 MeV, compared with the results from SU(2) Skyrme
Model ($\Gamma_{\Delta_{5/2}}>$800 MeV), and $\Gamma_{\Theta_{2}}<100$ MeV if
we assume that their widths are dominated by two-body decay and that $\Theta^+$
has a width $\Gamma_{\Theta^+}<25$ MeV.
