We measure the top quark mass m_t using t tbar pairs produced in the D0
detector by root(s) = 1.8 TeV p pbar collisions in a 125 pb^-1 exposure at the
Fermilab Tevatron. We make a two constraint fit to m_t in t tbar --> b W^+ bbar
W^- final states with one W decaying to q qbar and the other to e nu or mu nu.
Events are binned in fit mass versus a measure of probability for events to be
signal rather than background. Likelihood fits to the data yield m_t = 173.3 +-
5.6 (stat) +- 6.2 (syst) GeV/c^2.
