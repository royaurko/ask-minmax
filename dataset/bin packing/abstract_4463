We study the production of ${\rm K}_{\rm S}^{0}$ mesons and $\Lambda$ baryons
in jets in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV with ALICE at the
LHC. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential density of the particles produced in jets is
compared to the inclusive distributions and the $\Lambda/{\rm K}_{\rm S}^{0}$
ratio is reported in bins of multiplicity of the collisions. The hard
scatterings are selected on an event-by-event basis using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$
clustering algorithm with resolution parameter $R=0.2,~0.3$ and $0.4$,
reconstructed from charged particles with a minimum $p_{\rm T,jet}$ of $10$ (or
$20$) GeV/$c$.
