The cookie-cutter-like set is defined as the limit set of a sequence of
classical cookie-cutter mappings. For this cookie-cutter-like set first we have
determined the topological pressure function, and then by Banach limit we have
determined a unique Borel probability measure $\mu_h$ with the support the
cookie-cutter-like set $E$. With the topological pressure and the measure
$\mu_h$, we have shown that the fractal dimensions such as the Hausdorff
dimension, the packing dimension and the box-counting dimension are all equal
to the unique zero $h$ of the pressure function. Moreover, we have shown that
the $h$-dimensional Hausdorff measure and the $h$-dimensional packing measure
are finite and positive.
