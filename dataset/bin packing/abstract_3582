We compute the angular power spectrum C_l from 1.5 million galaxies in early
SDSS data on large angular scales, l<600. The data set covers about 160 square
degrees, with a characteristic depth of order 1 Gpc/h in the faintest (21<r<22)
of our four magnitude bins. Cosmological interpretations of these results are
presented in a companion paper by Dodelson et al (2001). The data in all four
magnitude bins are consistent with a simple flat ``concordance'' model with
nonlinear evolution and linear bias factors of order unity. Nonlinear evolution
is particularly evident for the brightest galaxies. A series of tests suggest
that systematic errors related to seeing, reddening, etc., are negligible,
which bodes well for the sixtyfold larger sample that the SDSS is currently
collecting. Uncorrelated error bars and well-behaved window functions make our
measurements a convenient starting point for cosmological model fitting.
