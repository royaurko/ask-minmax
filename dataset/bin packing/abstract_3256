We investigate the dynamics of an intruder pulled by a constant force in a
dense two-dimensional granular fluid by means of event-driven molecular
dynamics simulations. In a first step, we show how a propagating momentum front
develops and compactifies the system when reflected by the boundaries. To be
closer to recent experiments \cite{candelier2010journey,candelier2009creep}, we
then add a frictional force acting on each particle, proportional to the
particle's velocity. We show how to implement frictional motion in an
event-driven simulation. This allows us to carry out extensive numerical
simulations aiming at the dependence of the intruder's velocity on packing
fraction and pulling force. We identify a linear relation for small and a
nonlinear regime for high pulling forces and investigate the dependence of
these regimes on granular temperature.
