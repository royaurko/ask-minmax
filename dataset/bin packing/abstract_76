In this paper we prove an asymptotic lower bound for the sphere packing
density in dimensions divisible by four. This asymptotic lower bound improves
on previous asymptotic bounds by a constant factor and improves not just lower
bounds for the sphere packing density, but also for the lattice sphere packing
density and, in fact, the Hurwitz lattice sphere packing density.
