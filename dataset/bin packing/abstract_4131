In central Pb-Pb collisions at LHC the multiplicity of particles produced is
so high that it should become feasible to examine the nature of transition from
the deconfined quark-gluon state to the confined hadron state by methods that
rely on the availability of high multiplicity events. We consider four classes
of the transition process ranging from critical behavior to totally random
behavior, depending on whether or not there is clustering of quarks and on
whether or not there is contraction of dense clusters due to confinement.
Fluctuations of bin multiplicities in each event are quantified, and then the
event-by-event fluctuations of spatial patterns are analyzed. A sequence of
measures are proposed and are shown to be effective in capturing the essence of
the differences among the classes of simulated events. It is demonstrated that
a specific index has a low value for critical transition but a larger value if
the hadronization process is random.
