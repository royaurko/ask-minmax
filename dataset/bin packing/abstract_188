We develop a theoretical description for mechanically stable frictional
packings in terms of the difference between the total number of contacts
required for isostatic packings of frictionless disks and the number of
contacts in frictional packings, $m=N_c^0-N_c$. The saddle order $m$ represents
the number of unconstrained degrees of freedom that a static packing would
possess if friction were removed. Using a novel numerical method that allows us
to enumerate disk packings for each $m$, we show that the probability to obtain
a packing with saddle order $m$ at a given static friction coefficient $\mu$,
$P_m(\mu)$, can be expressed as a power-series in $\mu$. Using this form for
$P_m(\mu)$, we quantitatively describe the dependence of the average contact
number on friction coefficient for static disk packings obtained from direct
simulations of the Cundall-Strack model for all $\mu$ and $N$.
