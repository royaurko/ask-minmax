Sequentially-built random sphere-packings have been numerically studied in
the packing fraction interval $0.329 < \gamma < 0.586$. For that purpose fast
running geometrical algorithms have been designed in order to build about 300
aggregates, containing $10^6$ spheres each one, which allowed a careful study
of the local fluctuations and an improved accuracy in the calculations of the
pair distribution $P(r)$ and structure factors $S(Q)$ of the aggregates.
  Among various parameters (Voronoi tessellation, contact coordination number
distribution,...), fluctuations were quantitatively evaluated by the direct
evaluation of the fluctuations of the local sphere number density, which
appears to follow a power law. The FWHM of the Voronoi cells volume shows a
regular variation over the whole packing fraction range.
  Dirac peaks appear on the pair correlation function as the packing fraction
of the aggregates decreases, indicating the growth of larger and larger
polytetrahedra, which manifest in two ways on the structure factor, at low and
large $Q$values. These low PF aggregates have a composite structure made of
regular polytetrahedra embedded in a more disordered matrix. Incidentally, the
irregularity index of the building tetrahedron appears as a better parameter
than the packing fraction to describe various features of the aggregates
structure.
