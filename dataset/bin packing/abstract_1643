We disclose the deep connection between the thermodynamics and gravity in a
general braneworld model with curvature correction terms on the brane and in
the bulk, respectively. We show that the Friedmann equations on the 3-brane
embedded in the 5D spacetime with curvature correction terms can be written
directly in the form of the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent
horizon. Using the first law, we extract the entropy expression of the apparent
horizon on the brane, which is useful in studying the thermodynamical
properties of the black hole horizon on the brane in Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
