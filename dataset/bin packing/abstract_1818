In this paper, we investigate the utility of Minkowski Functionals as a probe
of cold/hot disk-like structures in the CMB. In order to construct an accurate
estimator, we resolve a long-standing issue with the use of Minkowski
Functionals as probes of the CMB sky -- namely that of systematic differences
("residuals") when numerical and analytical MF are compared. We show that such
residuals are in fact by-products of binning, and not caused by pixelation or
masking as originally thought. We then derive a map-independent estimator that
encodes the effects of binning, applicable to beyond our present work. Using
this residual-free estimator, we show that small disk-like effects (as claimed
by Vielva et al.) can be detected only when a large sample of such maps are
averaged over. In other words, our estimator is noise-dominated for small disk
sizes at WMAP resolution. To confirm our suspicion, we apply our estimator to
the WMAP7 data to obtain a null result.
