Using sedimentation to obtain precisely controlled packings of noncohesive
spheres, we find that the volume fraction $\phi_{\rm RLP}$ of the loosest
mechanically stable packing is in an operational sense well defined by a limit
process. This random loose packing volume fraction decreases with decreasing
pressure $p$ and increasing interparticle friction coefficient $\mu$. Using
X-ray tomography to correct for a container boundary effect that depends on
particle size, we find for rough particles in the limit $p \to 0$ a new lower
bound, $\phi_{\rm RLP} = 0.550 \pm 0.001$.
