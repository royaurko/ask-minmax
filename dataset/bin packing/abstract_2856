We present a simple model of a vibrated box of sand, and discuss its dynamics
in terms of two parameters reflecting static and dynamic disorder respectively.
The fluidised, intermediate and frozen (`glassy') dynamical regimes are
extensively probed by analysing the response of the packing fraction to steady,
as well as cyclic, shaking, and indicators of the onset of a `glass transition'
are analysed. In the `glassy' regime, our model is exactly solvable, and allows
for the qualitative description of ageing phenomena in terms of two
characteristic lengths; predictions are also made about the influence of grain
shape anisotropy on ageing behaviour.
