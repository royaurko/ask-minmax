Very thick, ~ 40 $\mu$m, clean, and highly textured MgB2 film was effectively
grown on an Al2O3 substrate. The fabrication technique is by the hybrid
physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) using B2H6 gas and Mg ingot as the
sources. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows a highly (101)-oriented
MgB2 crystal structure without any impurity detected. There is no signal from
the substrate in the XRD spectrum, indicating that the film thickness exceeds
the X-ray penetration length. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that
the film is composed of highly-packed MgB2 micro-crystals with a uniform size
distribution of about 2 $\mu$m in diameter and 0.2 $\mu$m in thickness.
According to the compositional analysis of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX), no oxygen, hence no MgO, exists in the textured film, consistent with
the XRD result. Also, the transport properties are similar to those of a single
crystal, indicating a clean film of good crystallite. The zero field transition
temperatures are determined as TC(onset) = 39.2 K and TC(zero) = 38.4 K, giving
a sharp transition typical of a clean sample. The residual resistivity ratio
(RRR) is determined as 6.4 and the magnetoreisitance (MR) is about 28 % at 40 K
under the applied field of 9 T, which are similar to those of a single crystal.
The zero temperature upper critical field, HC2(0), is extrapolated as 19 T from
the TC(onset) at applied field up to 9 T.
