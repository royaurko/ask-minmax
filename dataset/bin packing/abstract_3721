In an attempt to increase the number of known microquasars, Paredes et al.
(2002) have presented a long-term project focused on the search for new objects
of this type. They performed a cross-identification between X-ray and radio
catalogs under very restrictive selection criteria for sources with |b|<5
degrees, and obtained a sample of 13 radio-emitting X-ray sources. Follow-up
observations of 6 of these sources with the VLA provided accurate coordinates,
which were used to discover optical counterparts for all of them. We have
observed these six sources with the EVN and MERLIN at 5 GHz. Five of the six
objects have been detected and imaged, presenting different morphologies: one
source has a two-sided jet, three sources have one-sided jets, and one source
is compact. With all the presently available information, we conclude that two
of the sources are promising microquasar candidates in our Galaxy.
