We present a progress report on a project to derive the evolution of the
volumetric supernova Type Ia rate from the Supernova Legacy Survey. Our
preliminary estimate of the rate evolution divides the sample from Neill et al.
(2006) into two redshift bins: 0.2 < z < 0.4, and 0.4 < z < 0.6. We extend this
by adding a bin from the sample analyzed in Sullivan et al. (2006) in the range
0.6 < z < 0.75 from the same time period. We compare the derived trend with
previously published rates and a supernova Type Ia production model having two
components: one component associated closely with star formation and an
additional component associated with host galaxy mass. Our observed trend is
consistent with this model, which predicts a rising SN Ia rate out to at least
z=2.
