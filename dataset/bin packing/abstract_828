We report on experiments to measure the temporal and spatial evolution of
packing arrangements of anisotropic and weakly confined granular material,
using high-resolution $\gamma$-ray adsorption. In these experiments, the
particle configurations start from an initially disordered,
low-packing-fraction state and under vertical solicitations evolve to a dense
state. We find that the packing fraction evolution is slowed by the grain
anisotropy but, as for spherically shaped grains, can be well fitted by a
stretched exponential. For a given type of grains, the characteristic times of
relaxation and of convection are found to be of the same order of magnitude. On
the contrary compaction mechanisms in the media strongly depend on the grain
anisotropy.
