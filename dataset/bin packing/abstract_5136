Recently, Bauer et al. (J Graph Theory 55(4) (2007), 343--358) introduced a
graph operator $D(G)$, called the $D$-graph of $G$, which has been useful in
investigating the structural aspects of maximal Tutte sets in $G$ with a
perfect matching. Among other results, they proved a characterization of
maximal Tutte sets in terms of maximal independent sets in the graph $D(G)$ and
maximal extreme sets in $G$. This was later extended to graphs without perfect
matchings by Busch et al. (Discrete Appl. Math. 155 (2007), 2487--2495). Let
$\theta$ be a real number and $\mu(G,x)$ be the matching polynomial of a graph
$G$. Let $\textnormal{mult} (\theta, G)$ be the multiplicity of $\theta$ as a
root of $\mu(G,x)$. We observe that the notion of $D$-graph is implicitly
related to $\theta=0$. In this paper, we give a natural generalization of the
$D$-graph of $G$ for any real number $\theta$, and denote this new operator by
$D_{\theta}(G)$, so that $D_{\theta}(G)$ coincides with $D(G)$ when $\theta=0$.
We prove a characterization of maximal $\theta$-Tutte sets which are
$\theta$-analogue of maximal Tutte sets in $G$. In particular, we show that for
any $X \subseteq V(G)$, $|X|>1$, and any real number $\theta$, $\m(\theta, G
\setminus X)=\m(\theta, G)+|X|$ if and only if $\m(\theta, G \setminus
uv)=\m(\theta, G)+2$ for any $u, v \in X$, $u \not = v$, thus extending the
preceding work of Bauer et al. and Busch et al. which established the result
for the case $\theta=0$.
