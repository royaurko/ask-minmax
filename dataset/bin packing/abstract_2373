In view of the recent interest in the decays of mesons into a pair of light
leptons, a computation of the QED radiative corrections to the decay of
$\pi^{0}$ into an electron-positron pair is presented here. The results
indicate that the peak value of the differential decay rate is reduced by about
$50 \%$, because of soft-photon radiation. The number of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs
having invariant masses in an energy bin of 0.5 MeV centered around $m_{\pi}$
is found to be about $20 \%$ smaller than the one it would be if radiative
corrections were neglected.
