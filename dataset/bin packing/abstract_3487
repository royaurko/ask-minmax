We investigate the intermittency of energy dissipation in magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence by identifying dissipative structures and measuring their
characteristic scales. We find that the probability distribution of energy
dissipation rates exhibits a power law tail with index very close to the
critical value of -2.0, which indicates that structures of all intensities
contribute equally to energy dissipation. We find that energy dissipation is
uniformly spread among coherent structures with lengths and widths in the
inertial range. At the same time, these structures have thicknesses deep within
the dissipative regime. As the Reynolds number is increased, structures become
thinner and more numerous, while the energy dissipation continues to occur
mainly in large-scale coherent structures. This implies that in the limit of
high Reynolds number, energy dissipation occurs in thin, tightly packed current
sheets which nevertheless span a continuum of scales up to the system size,
exhibiting features of both coherent structures and nanoflares previously
conjectured as a coronal heating mechanism.
