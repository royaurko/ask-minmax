We discuss the non-equilibrium fluctuation problem, which corresponds to the
hydrodynamic limit established in \cite{FS}, for the dynamics of
two-dimensional Young diagrams associated with the uniform and restricted
uniform statistics, and derive linear stochastic partial differential equations
in the limit. We show that their invariant measures are identical to the
Gaussian measures which appear in the fluctuation limits in the static
situations.
