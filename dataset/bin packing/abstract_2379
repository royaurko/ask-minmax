In order to calculate the rho - omega mixing we extend the chiral couplings
of the low-lying vector mesons in chiral perturbation theory to a lagrangian
that contains two vector fields. We determine the momentum dependence of the
two-point function and recover an earlier result for the on-shell expression.
We discuss the off-shell behaviour of the mixing.
