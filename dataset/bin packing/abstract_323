In particulate systems with short-range interactions, such as granular matter
or simple fluids, local structure plays a pivotal role in determining the
macroscopic physical properties. Here, we analyse local structure metrics
derived from the Voronoi diagram of configurations of oblate ellipsoids, for
various aspect ratios $\alpha$ and global volume fractions $\phi_g$. We focus
on jammed static configurations of frictional ellipsoids, obtained by
tomographic imaging and by discrete element method simulations. In particular,
we consider the local packing fraction $\phi_l$, defined as the particle's
volume divided by its Voronoi cell volume. We find that the probability
$P(\phi_l)$ for a Voronoi cell to have a given local packing fraction shows the
same scaling behaviour as function of $\phi_g$ as observed for random sphere
packs. Surprisingly, this scaling behaviour is further found to be independent
of the particle aspect ratio. By contrast, the typical Voronoi cell shape,
quantified by the Minkowski tensor anisotropy index $\beta=\beta_0^{2,0}$,
points towards a significant difference between random packings of spheres and
those of oblate ellipsoids. While the average cell shape $\beta$ of all cells
with a given value of $\phi_l$ is very similar in dense and loose jammed sphere
packings, the structure of dense and loose ellipsoid packings differs
substantially such that this does not hold true. This non-universality has
implications for our understanding of jamming of aspherical particles.
