In this work, we introduce the concept of term ergodicity for action
semigroups and construct semigroups on two dimensional manifolds which are
$C^{1+\alpha}$-robustly term ergodic. Moreover, we illustrate the term
ergodicity by some exciting examples. At last, we study a problem in the
context of circle packing which is concerned to term ergodic.
