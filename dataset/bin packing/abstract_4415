In the Mixed Chinese Postman Problem (MCPP), given an edge-weighted mixed
graph $G$ ($G$ may have both edges and arcs), our aim is to find a minimum
weight closed walk traversing each edge and arc at least once. The MCPP
parameterized by the number of edges was known to be fixed-parameter tractable
using a simple argument. Solving an open question of van Bevern et al., we
prove that the MCPP parameterized by the number of arcs is also fixed-parameter
tractable. Our proof is more involved and, in particular, uses a well-known
result of Marx, O'Sullivan and Razgon (2013) on the treewidth of torso graphs
with respect to small separators. We obtain a small cut analog of this result,
and use it to construct a tree decomposition which, despite not having bounded
width, has other properties allowing us to design a fixed-parameter algorithm.
