OMC-VAR is the first catalogue of variable sources observed by the Optical
Monitoring Camera (OMC) on board INTEGRAL. It includes photometry and
variability data for more than 5000 sources of very different nature. In order
to study the multi-wavelength similarities and differences of the engines
powering AGN and X-ray binaries, especially those powered by a black hole, we
have searched for counterparts in several high-energy and infrared catalogues,
including the 4th IBIS/ISGRI soft gamma-ray survey catalogue, the XMM-Newton
Serendipitous Source catalogue, the 2MASS All-Sky catalogue of Point Sources,
the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog and the WISE All-Sky Data Release.
Preliminary multiwavelength results for the IBIS counterparts are presented and
discussed.
