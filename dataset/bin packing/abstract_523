Given a set $V$, a subset $S$, and a permutation $\pi$ of $V$, we say that
$\pi$ permutes $S$ if $\pi (S) \cap S = \emptyset$. Given a collection $\cS =
\{V; S_1,\ldots , S_m\}$, where $S_i \subseteq V ~~(i=1,\ldots ,m)$, we say
that $\cS$ is invertible if there is a permutation $\pi$ of $V$ such that $\pi
(S_i) \subseteq V-S_i$. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient
conditions for the invertibility of a collection and construct a polynomial
algorithm which determines whether a given collection is invertible. For an
arbitrary collection, we give a lower bound for the maximum number of sets
that can be inverted. Finally, we consider the problem of constructing a
collection of sets such that no sub-collection of size three is invertible.
Our constructions of such collections come from solutions to the packing
problem with unbounded block sizes. We prove several new lower and upper
bounds for the packing problem and present a new explicit construction of
packing.
