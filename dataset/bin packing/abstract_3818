We analyze the atmospheric neutrino data in the context of three flavor
neutrino oscillations taking account of the matter effects in the earth. With
the hierarchy among the vacuum mass eigenvalues $\mu_3^2 \gg \mu_2^2 \geq
\mu_1^2$, the solution of the atmospheric neutrino problem depends on
$\delta_{31}=\mu_3^2 - \mu_1^2$ and the $13$ and $23$ mixing angles $\phi$ and
$\psi$. Whereas the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino data imposes only a lower
limit on $\delta_{31} > 10^{-3} eV^2$, the zenith angle dependent suppression
observed in the multi-GeV data limits $\delta_{31}$ from above also. The
allowed regions of the parameter space are strongly constrained by the
multi-GeV data. Combined with our earlier solution to the solar neutrino
problem which depends on $\delta_{21}= \mu_2^2-\mu_1^2$ and the $12$ and $13$
mixing angles $\omega$ and $\phi$, we have obtained the ranges of values of the
five neutrino parameters which solve both the solar and the atmospheric
neutrino problems simultaneously.
