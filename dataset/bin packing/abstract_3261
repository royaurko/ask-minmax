Convolution and cross-correlation are the basis of filtering and pattern or
template matching in multimedia signal processing. We propose two throughput
scaling options for any one-dimensional convolution kernel in programmable
processors by adjusting the imprecision (distortion) of computation. Our
approach is based on scalar quantization, followed by two forms of tight
packing in floating-point (one of which is proposed in this paper) that allow
for concurrent calculation of multiple results. We illustrate how our approach
can operate as an optional pre- and post-processing layer for off-the-shelf
optimized convolution routines. This is useful for multimedia applications that
are tolerant to processing imprecision and for cases where the input signals
are inherently noisy (error tolerant multimedia applications). Indicative
experimental results with a digital music matching system and an MPEG-7 audio
descriptor system demonstrate that the proposed approach offers up to 175%
increase in processing throughput against optimized (full-precision)
convolution with virtually no effect in the accuracy of the results. Based on
marginal statistics of the input data, it is also shown how the throughput and
distortion can be adjusted per input block of samples under constraints on the
signal-to-noise ratio against the full-precision convolution.
