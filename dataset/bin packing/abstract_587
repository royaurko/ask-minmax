We numerically simulate mechanically stable packings of soft-core,
frictionless, bidisperse disks in two dimensions, above the jamming packing
fraction phi_J. For configurations with a fixed isotropic global stress tensor,
we investigate the fluctuations of the local packing fraction phi(r) to test
whether such configurations display the hyperuniformity that has been claimed
to exist exactly at phi_J. For our configurations, generated by a rapid quench
protocol, we find that hyperuniformity persists only out to a finite length
scale, and that this length scale appears to remain finite as the system stress
decreases towards zero, i.e. towards the jamming transition. Our result
suggests that the presence of hyperuniformity at jamming may be sensitive to
the specific protocol used to construct the jammed configurations.
