We report on experimental realization of impulsive rotational Raman
scattering from neutral nitrogen molecules in a femtosecond laser filament
using an intense self-induced white-light seeding "air laser" generated during
the filamentation of an 800 nm Ti: Sapphire laser in nitrogen gas. The
impulsive rotational Raman fingerprint signals are observed with a maximum
conversion efficiency of ~0.8%. Our observation provides a promising way of
remote identification and location of chemical species in atmosphere by
rotational Raman scattering of molecules.
