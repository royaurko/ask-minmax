The Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory measures the
atmospheric depth, $X_{max}$, where the longitudinal profile of the high energy
air showers reaches its maximum. This is sensitive to the nuclear mass
composition of the cosmic rays. Due to its hybrid design, the Pierre Auger
Observatory also provides independent experimental observables obtained from
the Surface Detector for the study of the nuclear mass composition. We present
$X_{max}$-distributions and an update of the average and RMS values in
different energy bins and compare them to the predictions for different nuclear
masses of the primary particles and hadronic interaction models. We also
present the results of the composition-sensitive parameters derived from the
ground level component.
