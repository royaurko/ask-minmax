The aim of this paper is to develop a crowd motion model designed to handle
highly packed situations. The model we propose rests on two principles: We
first define a spontaneous velocity which corresponds to the velocity each
individual would like to have in the absence of other people; The actual
velocity is then computed as the projection of the spontaneous velocity onto
the set of admissible velocities (i.e. velocities which do not violate the
non-overlapping constraint). We describe here the underlying mathematical
framework, and we explain how recent results by J.F. Edmond and L. Thibault on
the sweeping process by uniformly prox-regular sets can be adapted to handle
this situation in terms of well-posedness. We propose a numerical scheme for
this contact dynamics model, based on a prediction-correction algorithm.
Numerical illustrations are finally presented and discussed.
