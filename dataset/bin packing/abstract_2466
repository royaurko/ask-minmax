We examine the effectiveness of the weak gravity conjecture in constraining
the dark energy by comparing with observations. For general dark energy models
with plausible phenomenological interactions between dark sectors, we find that
although the weak gravity conjecture can constrain the dark energy, the
constraint is looser than that from the observations.
