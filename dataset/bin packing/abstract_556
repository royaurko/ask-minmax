We use discontinuous molecular dynamics and grand-canonical transition-matrix
Monte Carlo simulations to explore how confinement between parallel hard walls
modifies the relationships between packing fraction, self-diffusivity, partial
molar excess entropy, and total excess entropy for binary hard-sphere mixtures.
To accomplish this, we introduce an efficient algorithm to calculate partial
molar excess entropies from the transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulation data.
We find that the species-dependent self-diffusivities of confined fluids are
very similar to those of the bulk mixture if compared at the same,
appropriately defined, packing fraction up to intermediate values, but then
deviate negatively from the bulk behavior at higher packing fractions. On the
other hand, the relationships between self-diffusivity and partial molar excess
entropy (or total excess entropy) observed in the bulk fluid are preserved
under confinement even at relatively high packing fractions and for different
mixture compositions. This suggests that the partial molar excess entropy,
calculable from classical density functional theories of inhomogeneous fluids,
can be used to predict some of the nontrivial dynamical behaviors of fluid
mixtures in confined environments.
