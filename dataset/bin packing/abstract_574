Packings of frictionless athermal particles that interact only when they
overlap experience a jamming transition as a function of packing density. Such
packings provide the foundation for the theory of jamming. This theory rests on
the observation that, despite the multitude of disordered configurations, the
mechanical response to linear order depends only on the distance to the
transition. We investigate the validity and utility of such measurements that
invoke the harmonic approximation and show that, despite particles coming in
and out of contact, there is a well-defined linear regime in the thermodynamic
limit.
