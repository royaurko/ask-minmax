The Paper discusses the use of the regular packing of identical balls with
the coordination number 4 as a model of a medium consisting of fluid and solid
particles in the conditions of fluidization. It is proposed to use the examined
packing of balls as an initial condition for the calculations by the Discrete
Elements Method (DEM) in technological processes in the fluidized bed in
industry, as well as in the modeling of processes that occur in hydraulic and
pneumatic transport of granular materials. Filtration properties of such
packing required for its use as an initial condition in calculations by DEM are
estimated.
