The fixed-target MIPP experiment, Fermilab E907, was designed to measure the
production of hadrons from the collisions of hadrons of momenta ranging from 5
to 120 GeV/c on a variety of nuclei. These data will generally improve the
simulation of particle detectors and predictions of particle beam fluxes at
accelerators. The spectrometer momentum resolution is between 3 and 4%, and
particle identification is performed for particles ranging between 0.3 and 80
GeV/c using $dE/dx$, time-of-flight and Cherenkov radiation measurements. MIPP
collected $1.42 \times10^6$ events of 120 GeV Main Injector protons striking a
target used in the NuMI facility at Fermilab. The data have been analyzed and
we present here charged pion yields per proton-on-target determined in bins of
longitudinal and transverse momentum between 0.5 and 80 GeV/c, with combined
statistical and systematic relative uncertainties between 5 and 10%.
