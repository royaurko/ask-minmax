Dark energy interacting with dark matter is a promising model to solve the
cosmic coincidence problem. We study the signature of such interaction on large
scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies. Based on the
detail analysis in perturbation equations of dark energy and dark matter when
they are in interaction, we find that the large scale CMB, especially the late
Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect, is a useful tool to measure the coupling between
dark sectors. We also discuss the possibility to detect the coupling by
cross-correlating CMB maps with tracers of the large scale structure. We
finally perform the global fitting to constrain the coupling by using the CMB
power spectrum data together with other observational data. We find that in the
$1\sigma$ range, the constrained coupling between dark sectors can solve the
coincidence problem.
