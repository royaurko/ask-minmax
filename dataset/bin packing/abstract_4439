In this paper, we study the M5-brane configurations in AdS$_4 \times
Q^{1,1,1}$ spacetime. We consider the configurations with an AdS$_2$ factor
embedding into AdS$_4$, and manage to construct two solutions, which could be
dual to line defects in the boundary gauge theory. Moreover we discuss their
BPS nature and find that neither of them is supersymmetric. We show that the
M5-brane with a R$_t$ or an AdS$_3$ factor found before is half-BPS.
