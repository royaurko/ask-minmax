Many well-known graph drawing techniques, including force directed drawings,
spectral graph layouts, multidimensional scaling, and circle packings, have
algebraic formulations. However, practical methods for producing such drawings
ubiquitously use iterative numerical approximations rather than constructing
and then solving algebraic expressions representing their exact solutions. To
explain this phenomenon, we use Galois theory to show that many variants of
these problems have solutions that cannot be expressed by nested radicals or
nested roots of low-degree polynomials. Hence, such solutions cannot be
computed exactly even in extended computational models that include such
operations.
