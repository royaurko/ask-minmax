We study a phenomenological ansatz for merging next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO) calculations with Monte Carlo event generators. We reweight them to
match bin-integrated NNLO differential distributions. To test this procedure,
we study the Higgs boson production cross-section at the LHC, for which a fully
differential partonic NNLO calculation is available. We normalize PYTHIA and
MC@NLO Monte Carlo events for Higgs production in the gluon fusion channel to
reproduce the bin integrated NNLO double differential distribution in the
transverse momentum and rapidity of the Higgs boson. These events are used to
compute differential distributions for the photons in the pp \to H \to \gamma
\gamma decay channel, and are compared to predictions from fixed-order
perturbation theory at NNLO. We find agreement between the reweighted
generators and the NNLO result in kinematic regions where we expect a good
description using fixed-order perturbation theory. Kinematic boundaries where
resummation is required are also modeled correctly using this procedure. We
then use these events to compute distributions in the pp \to H \to W^+W^- \to
l^+l^- \nu\bar{\nu} channel, for which an accurate description is needed for
measurements at the LHC. We find that the final state lepton distributions
obtained from PYTHIA are not significantly changed by the reweighting
procedure.
