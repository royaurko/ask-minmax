The random sequential adsorption of various particle shapes is studied in
order to determine the influence of particle anisotropy on the saturated random
packing. For all tested particles there is an optimal level of anisotropy which
maximizes the saturated packing fraction. It is found that a concave shape
derived from a dimer of disks gives a packing fraction of 0.5833, which is
comparable to the maximum packing fraction of ellipsoids and spherocylinders
and higher than any other studied shape. Discussion why this shape is so
beneficial for random sequential adsorption is given.
