Time-resolved optical and infrared polarimetric observations of black hole
and neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries are presented. Data were acquired with
the VLT, UKIRT and HIPPO on the SAAO 1.9-m. We find that for some sources in
outburst, a rapidly variable component of polarization is evident that is
stronger in the redder wavebands. We attribute this to the polarimetric
signature of synchrotron emission from jets in these systems, the emission of
which is known to dominate these redder bands. Such synchrotron emission from
jets launched close to black holes and neutron stars can be highly linearly
polarized, depending on the configuration of the magnetic field. The
variability of the polarization is suggestive of a tangled and turbulent
magnetic field at the location of the compact jet. For some sources the
position angle of polarization is consistent with a magnetic field that is
parallel to the observed radio jet. These are some of the first observational
constraints of the geometry and magnetic structure at the inner regions of the
outflow. We also present the first ever simultaneous optical polarization and
X-ray campaign of an X-ray binary, using data taken simultaneously with HIPPO
and RXTE with sub-second time resolution.
