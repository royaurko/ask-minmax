In this paper, we give the sharp estimates for the degree of symmetry and the
semi-simple degree of symmetry of certain four dimensional fiber bundles by
virtue of the rigidity theorem of harmonic maps due to Schoen and Yau. As a
corollary of this estimate, we compute the degree of symmetry and the
semi-simple degree of symmetry of ${\Bbb C}P^2\times V$, where $V$ is closed
smooth manifold admitting a real analytic Riemannian metric of non-positive
curvature. In addition, by the Albanese map, we obtain the sharp estimate of
the degree of symmetry of a compact smooth manifold with some restrictions on
its one dimensional cohomology.
