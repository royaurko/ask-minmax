The European VLBI Network is a collaboration of the major radio astronomical
institutes in Europe, Asia, South Africa and Puerto Rico. Established four
decades ago, since then it has constantly improved its performance in terms
made using resolution, data bit-rate and image fidelity with improvements in
performance, and the addition of new stations and observing capabilities. The
EVN provides open skies access and has over time become a common-user facility.
In this contribution we discuss the present status and perspectives for the
array in a continuously changing environment, especially in the era of ALMA and
with the Square Kilometre Array ante portas.
