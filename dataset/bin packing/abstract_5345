We present initial results from the Jubilee ISW project, which models the
expected \LambdaCDM Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in the Jubilee
simulation. The simulation volume is (6 Gpc/h)^3, allowing power on very
large-scales to be incorporated into the calculation. Haloes are resolved down
to a mass of 1.5x10^12 M_sun/h, which allows us to derive a catalogue of mock
Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) for cross-correlation analysis with the ISW
signal. We find the ISW effect observed on a projected sky to grow stronger at
late times with the evolution of the ISW power spectrum matching expectations
from linear theory. Maps of the gravitational lensing effect, including the
convergence and deflection fields, are calculated using the same potential as
for the ISW. We calculate the redshift dependence of the ISW-LRG
cross-correlation signal for a full sky survey with no noise considerations.
For l < 30, the signal is strongest for lower redshift bins (z ~ 0.2 to 0.5),
whereas for l > 30 the signal is best observed with surveys covering z ~
0.6-1.0.
