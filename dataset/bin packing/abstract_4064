Superconductivity at about 15.6 K was achieved in Tb_{1-x}Ca_xFeAsO by
partially substituting Tb^{3+} with Ca^{2+} in the nominal doping region x =
0.40 \sim 0.50. A detailed investigation was carried out in a typical sample
with doping level of x = 0.44. The upper critical field of this sample was
estimated to be 77 Tesla from the magnetic field dependent resistivity data.
The domination of hole-like charge carriers in the low-temperature region was
confirmed by Hall effect measurements. The comparison between the calcium-doped
sample Pr_{1-x}Ca_xFeAsO (non-superconductive) and the Strontium-doped sample
Pr_{1-x}Sr_xFeAsO (superconductive) suggests that a lager ion radius of the
doped alkaline-earth element compared with that of the rare-earth element may
be a necessary requirement for achieving superconductivity in the hole-doped
1111 phase.
