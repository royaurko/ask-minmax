We extend our theory of amorphous packings of hard spheres to binary mixtures
and more generally to multicomponent systems. The theory is based on the
assumption that amorphous packings produced by typical experimental or
numerical protocols can be identified with the infinite pressure limit of long
lived metastable glassy states. We test this assumption against numerical and
experimental data and show that the theory correctly reproduces the variation
with mixture composition of structural observables, such as the total packing
fraction and the partial coordination numbers.
