In this paper, we consider the problem of constellation design for a visible
light communication (VLC) system using red/green/blue light-emitting diodes
(RGB LED), and propose a method termed DC-informative joint color-frequency
modulation (DCI-JCFM). This method jointly utilizes available diversity
resources including different optical wavelengths, multiple baseband
subcarriers, and adaptive DC-bias. Constellation is designed in a high
dimensional space, where the compact sphere packing advantage over lower
dimensional counterparts is utilized. Taking into account multiple practical
illumination constraints, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated,
seeking the least error rate with a fixed spectral efficiency. The proposed
scheme is compared with a decoupled scheme, where constellation is designed
separately for each LED. Notable gains for DCI-JCFM are observed through
simulations where balanced, unbalanced and very unbalanced color illuminations
are considered.
