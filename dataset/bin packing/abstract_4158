In this paper the cognitive interference channel with a common message, a
variation of the classical cognitive interference channel in which the
cognitive message is decoded at both receivers, is studied. For this channel
model new outer and inner bounds are developed as well as new capacity results
for both the discrete memoryless and the Gaussian case. The outer bounds are
derived using bounding techniques originally developed by Sato for the
classical interference channel and Nair and El Gamal for the broadcast channel.
A general inner bound is obtained combining rate-splitting, superposition
coding and binning. Inner and outer bounds are shown to coincide in the "very
strong interference" and the "primary decodes cognitive" regimes. The first
regime consists of channels in which there is no loss of optimality in having
both receivers decode both messages while in the latter regime interference
pre-cancellation at the cognitive receiver achieves capacity. Capacity for the
Gaussian channel is shown to within a constant additive gap and a constant
multiplicative factor.
