The effect of structural disorder on the stress response inside three
dimensional particle assemblies is studied using computer simulations of
frictionless sphere packings. Upon applying a localised, perturbative force
within the packings, the resulting {\it Green's} function response is mapped
inside the different assemblies, thus providing an explicit view as to how the
imposed perturbation is transmitted through the packing. In weakly disordered
arrays, the resulting transmission of forces is of the double-peak variety, but
with peak widths scaling linearly with distance from the source of the
perturbation. This behaviour is consistent with an anisotropic elasticity
response profile. Increasing the disorder distorts the response function until
a single-peak response is obtained for fully disordered packings consistent
with an isotropic description.
