A Delaunay cell decomposition of a surface with constant curvature gives rise
to a circle pattern, consisting of the circles which are circumscribed to the
facets. We treat the problem whether there exists a Delaunay cell decomposition
for a given (topological) cell decomposition and given intersection angles of
the circles, whether it is unique and how it may be constructed. Somewhat more
generally, we allow cone-like singularities in the centers and intersection
points of the circles. We prove existence and uniqueness theorems for the
solution of the circle pattern problem using a variational principle. The
functionals (one for the euclidean, one for the hyperbolic case) are convex
functions of the radii of the circles. The analogous functional for the
spherical case is not convex, hence this case is treated by stereographic
projection to the plane. From the existence and uniqueness of circle patterns
in the sphere, we derive a strengthened version of Steinitz' theorem on the
geometric realizability of abstract polyhedra.
  We derive the variational principles of Colin de Verdi\`ere, Br\"agger, and
Rivin for circle packings and circle patterns from our variational principles.
In the case of Br\"agger's and Rivin's functionals. Leibon's functional for
hyperbolic circle patterns cannot be derived directly from our functionals. But
we construct yet another functional from which both Leibon's and our
functionals can be derived.
  We present Java software to compute and visualize circle patterns.
