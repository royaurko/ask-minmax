We consider a special case of the generalized P\'{o}lya's urn model
introduced by Benaim et al (2013). Given a finite connected graph $G$, place a
bin at each vertex. Two bins are called a pair if they share an edge of $G$. At
discrete times, a ball is added to each pair of bins. In a pair of bins, one of
the bins gets the ball with probability proportional to its current number of
balls. A question of essential interest for the model is to understand the
limiting behavior of the proportion of balls in the bins for different graphs
$G$. In this paper, we present two results regarding this question. If $G$ is
not balanced-bipartite, we prove that the proportion of balls converges to some
deterministic point $v=v(G)$ almost surely. If $G$ is regular bipartite, we
prove that the proportion of balls converges to a point in some explicit
interval almost surely. The question of convergence remains open in the case
when $G$ is non-regular balanced-bipartite (see a final remark in the paper).
