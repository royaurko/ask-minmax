Massive multicolor digital surveys in the near infrared provide new
opportunities for statistical analyses of the properties of groups and
clusters. These galaxy systems provide a natural laboratory for studying
dynamical processes and galaxy evolution, and serve as powerful cosmological
diagnostics. The immediate scientific returns to be expected from near-infrared
surveys such as DENIS and 2MASS are presented, and illustrated with simulated
images of a Coma-like rich cluster.
