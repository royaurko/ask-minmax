We examine the influence of percent-level dark energy corrections to the
nonlinear matter power spectrum on constraints of the dark energy equation of
state from future weak lensing probes. We explicitly show that a poor
approximation (off by > 10%) to the nonlinear corrections causes a > 1 sigma
bias on the determination of the dark energy equation of state. Future weak
lensing surveys must therefore incorporate dark energy modifications to the
nonlinear matter power spectrum accurate to the percent-level, to avoid
introducing significant bias in their measurements. For the WMAP5 cosmology,
the more accurate power spectrum is more sensitive to dark energy properties,
resulting in a factor of two improvement in dark energy equation of state
constraints. We explore the complementary constraints on dark energy from
future weak lensing and supernova surveys. A space-based, JDEM-like survey
measures the equation of state in five independent redshift bins to ~10%, while
this improves to ~5% for a wide-field ground-based survey like LSST. These
constraints are contingent upon our ability to control weak lensing systematic
uncertainties to the sub-percent level.
