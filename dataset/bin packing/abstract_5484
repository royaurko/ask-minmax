Hands-On Universe (HOU) is an educational program that enables students to
investigate the Universe while applying tools and concepts from science, math,
and technology. Using the Internet, HOU participants around the world request
observations from an automated telescope, download images from a large image
archive, and analyze them with the aid of user-friendly image processing
software. This program is developing now in many countries, including the USA,
France, Germany, Sweden, Japan, Australia, and others. A network of telescopes
has been established among these countries, many of them remotely operated, as
shown in the accompanying demo. Using this feature, students in the classroom
are able to make night observations during the day, using a telescope placed in
another country. An archive of images taken on large telescopes is also
accessible, as well as resources for teachers. Students are also dealing with
real research projects, e.g. the search for asteroids, which resulted in the
discovery of a Kuiper Belt object by high-school students. Not only Hands-On
Universe gives the general public an access to professional astronomy, but it
is also a more general tool to demonstrate the use of a complex automated
system, the techniques of data processing and automation. Last but not least,
through the use of telescopes located in many countries over the globe, a form
of powerful and genuine cooperation between teachers and children from various
countries is promoted, with a clear educational goal.
