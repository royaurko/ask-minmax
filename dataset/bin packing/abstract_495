We present new techniques to perform adaptive spatial binning of
two-dimensional (2D) data to reach a chosen constant signal-to-noise ratio per
bin. These methods are required particularly for the proper analysis of
Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) observations, but can also be used for
standard photometric imagery. Various schemes are tested and compared using
data obtained with the panoramic IFS SAURON.
