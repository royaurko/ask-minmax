We describe plans for a search for long-lived particles which will become
stopped by the CMS detector. We will look for the subsequent decay of these
particles during time intervals where there are no $pp$ collisions in CMS:
during gaps between crossings in the LHC beam structure, and during inter-fill
periods between the beam being dumped and re-injection. Such long living
particles decays will be recorded with dedicated calorimeter triggers. For
models predicting these particles, such as split-susy gluinos, the large
cross-section combined with good stopping power of CMS, yields a significant
number of triggerable decays. If LHC instantaneous luminosity approaches 10^32
cm^-2 s^-1 in 2009-10, 5-sigma significance can be established in a matter of
days, since these decays occur on top of a negligible background.
  Due to limited size, this paper concentrates on main idea and expected
results. More details are available in
