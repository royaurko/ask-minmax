Recently it has been conjectured that the ground-state of a Markovian
Hamiltonian, with one boundary operator, acting in a link pattern space is
related to vertically and horizontally symmetric alternating-sign matrices
(equivalently fully-packed loop configurations (FPL) on a grid with special
boundaries).We extend this conjecture by introducing an arbitrary boundary
parameter. We show that the parameter dependent ground state is related to
refined vertically symmetric alternating-sign matrices i.e. with prescribed
configurations (respectively, prescribed FPL configurations) in the next to
central row.
  We also conjecture a relation between the ground-state of a Markovian
Hamiltonian with two boundary operators and arbitrary coefficients and some
doubly refined (dependence on two parameters) FPL configurations. Our
conjectures might be useful in the study of ground-states of the O(1) and XXZ
models, as well as the stationary states of Raise and Peel models.
