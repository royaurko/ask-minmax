We have carried out car-following experiments with a 25-car-platoon on an
open road section to study the relation between a car's speed and its spacing
under various traffic conditions, in the hope to resolve a controversy
surrounding this fundamental relation of vehicular traffic. In this paper we
extend our previous analysis of these experiments, and report new experimental
findings. In particular, we reveal that the platoon length (hence the average
spacing within a platoon) might be significantly different even if the average
velocity of the platoon is essentially the same. The findings further
demonstrate that the traffic states span a 2D region in the speed-spacing (or
density) plane. The common practice of using a single speed-spacing curve to
model vehicular traffic ignores the variability and imprecision of human
driving and is therefore inadequate. We have proposed a car-following model
based on a mechanism that in certain ranges of speed and spacing, drivers are
insensitive to the changes in spacing when the velocity differences between
cars are small. It was shown that the model can reproduce the experimental
results well.
