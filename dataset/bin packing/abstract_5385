Human development has far-reaching impacts on the surface of the globe. The
transformation of natural land cover occurs in different forms and urban growth
is one of the most eminent transformative processes. We analyze global land
cover data and extract cities as defined by maximally connected urban clusters.
The analysis of the city size distribution for all cities on the globe confirms
Zipf's law. Moreover, by investigating the percolation properties of the
clustering of urban areas we assess the closeness to criticality for various
countries. At the critical thresholds, the urban land cover of the countries
undergoes a transition from separated clusters to a gigantic component on the
country scale. We study the Zipf-exponents as a function of the closeness to
percolation and find a systematic decrease with increasing scale, which could
be the reason for deviating exponents reported in literature. Moreover, we
investigate the average size of the clusters as a function of the proximity to
percolation and find country specific behavior. By relating the standard
deviation and the average of cluster sizes -- analogous to Taylor's law -- we
suggest an alternative way to identify the percolation transition. We calculate
spatial correlations of the urban land cover and find long-range correlations.
Finally, by relating the areas of cities with population figures we address the
global aspect of the allometry of cities, finding an exponent $\delta\approx
0.85$, i.e. large cities have lower densities.
