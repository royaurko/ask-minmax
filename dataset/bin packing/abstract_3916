Within an isospin-dependent transport model for nuclear reactions involving
neutron-rich nuclei, we study the first-order direct transverse flow of protons
and their second-order differential elliptic flow as a function of transverse
momentum. It is found that the differential elliptic flow of mid-rapidity
protons, especially at high transverse momenta, is much more sensitive to the
isospin dependence of the nuclear equation of state than the direct flow.
Origins of these different sensitivities and their implications to the
experimental determination of the isospin dependence of the nuclear equation of
state by using neutron-rich heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies are
discussed.
