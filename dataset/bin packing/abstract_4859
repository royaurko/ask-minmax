In the large-scale, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), thousands of
fiber positioners will be used. Those are robotic positioners, with two axis,
and having the size of a pen. They are tightly packed on the focal plane of the
telescope. Dedicated micro-robots have been developed and they use 4mm
brushless DC motors. To simplify the implementation and reduce the space
occupancy, each actuator will integrate its own electronic control board. This
board will be used to communicate with the central trajectory generator, manage
low level control tasks and motor current feeding. In this context, we present
a solution for a highly compact electronic. This electronic is composed of two
layers. The first is the power stage that can drive simultaneously two
brushless motors. The second one consists of a fast microcontroller and deals
with different control tasks: communication, acquisition of the hall sensor
signals, commutation of the motors phases, and performing position and current
regulation. A set of diagnostic functions are also implemented to detect
failure in the motors or the sensors, and to sense abnormal load change that
may be the result of two robots colliding.
