A coupled Volterra system is proposed. The model can be considered as one of
the integrable discrete form of the coupled integrable KdV system which is a
significant physical model. Many types of cnoidal waves, positons, negatons
(solitons) and complexitons of the model are obtained by a simple rational
expansion method of the Jacobi elliptic functions, trigonometric functions and
hyperbolic functions.
