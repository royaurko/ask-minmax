This paper studies the constrained-space probabilistic threshold range query
(CSPTRQ) for moving objects. We differentiate two kinds of CSPTRQs: implicit
and explicit ones. Specifically, for each moving object $o$, we assume $o$
cannot be located in some specific areas, we model its location as a closed
region, $u$, together with a probability density function, and model a query
range, $R$, as an arbitrary polygon. An implicit CSPTRQ can be reduced to a
search (over all the $u$) that returns a set of objects, which have
probabilities higher than a probability threshold $p_t$ to be located in $R$,
where $0\leq p_t\leq 1$. In contrast, an explicit CSPTRQ returns a set of
tuples in form of ($o$, $p$) such that $p\geq p_t$, where $p$ is the
probability of $o$ being located in $R$. A straightforward adaptation of
existing method is inefficient due to its weak pruning/validating capability.
In order to efficiently process such queries, we propose targeted solutions, in
which three main ideas are incorporated: (1) swapping the order of geometric
operations based on the computation duality; (2) pruning unrelated objects in
the early stages using the location unreachability; and (3) computing the
probability using the multi-step mechanism. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
