We consider metrics determined by hierarchical posets and give explicit
formulae for the main parameters of a linear code (packing, covering and
Chebyshev radii and minimal distance), in terms of the corresponding Hamming
parameters. We also give ten characterizations of hierarchical poset metrics,
including new characterizations and simple new proofs to the known ones.
