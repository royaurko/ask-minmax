Analysis of correlation of multiplicities between various rapidity bins is
carried out in the framework of a superposition approach consisting of three
phases of the ultra-relativistic nuclear collision: early partonic phase,
intermediate collective evolution, and statistical hadronization. Simple
relations between the moments of produced hadrons and the moments of the
sources produced in the initial partonic phase are presented. They involve only
a few effective parameters describing the of microscopic dynamics of the
system. We illustrate the practicality of the approach with the Glauber model
simulations. Our study carries direct relevance for the interpretation of the
upcoming results for the multibin multiplicity correlations from the LHC, which
will help in an assessment of the correlation features of the state formed in
the earliest stage of the reaction.
