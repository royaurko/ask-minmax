MiniBooNE charge current quasi-elastic double differential cross section data
are analyzed and confronted with predictions of two theoretical nucleus models:
Fermi gas and spectral function. The fitting procedure includes the overall
flux uncertainty multiplicative factor. In order to obtain a reliable value of
the axial mass, bins with large contribution from small momentum transfer are
eliminated from the analysis. It is shown that the best fit axial mass value
becomes smaller as the momentum transfer cut is more restrictive. For
$q_{cut}=500$~MeV/c the obtained values of axial mass are $M_A=1350\pm 66$~MeV
for the Fermi gas and $M_A=1343\pm 60$~MeV for the spectral function. The value
$M_A=1030$~MeV is excluded on the level which goes far beyond $5\sigma$.
