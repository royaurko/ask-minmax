Hayashi and Carthew (Nature 431 [2004], 647) have shown that the packing of
cone cells in the Drosophila retina resembles soap bubble packing, and that
changing E- and N-cadherin expression can change this packing, as well as cell
shape.
  The analogy with bubbles suggests that cell packing is driven by surface
minimization. We find that this assumption is insufficient to model the
experimentally observed shapes and packing of the cells based on their cadherin
expression. We then consider a model in which adhesion leads to a surface
increase, balanced by cell cortex contraction. Using the experimentally
observed distributions of E- and N-cadherin, we simulate the packing and cell
shapes in the wildtype eye. Furthermore, by changing only the corresponding
parameters, this model can describe the mutants with different numbers of
cells, or changes in cadherin expression.
