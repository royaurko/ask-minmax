Let K_r^- denote the graph obtained from K_r by deleting one edge. We show
that for every integer r\ge 4 there exists an integer n_0=n_0(r) such that
every graph G whose order n\ge n_0 is divisible by r and whose minimum degree
is at least (1-1/chi_{cr}(K_r^-))n contains a perfect K_r^- packing, i.e. a
collection of disjoint copies of K_r^- which covers all vertices of G. Here
chi_{cr}(K_r^-)=r(r-2)/(r-1) is the critical chromatic number of K_r^-. The
bound on the minimum degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of
Kawarabayashi for large n.
