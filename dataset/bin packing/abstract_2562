We report the distribution of time bin entangled photon pairs over 300 km of
optical fiber. We realized this by using a high speed and high signal to noise
ratio entanglement generation and evaluation setup that consists of
periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides and superconducting single photon
detectors. The observed two-photon interference fringes exhibited a visibility
of 84 %. We confirmed the violation of Bell's inequality by 2.9 standard
deviations.
