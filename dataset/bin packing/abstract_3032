For a restricted class of potentials (harmonic+Gaussian potentials), we
express the resolvent integral for the correlation functions of simple traces
of powers of complex matrices of size $N$, in term of a determinant; this
determinant is function of four kernels constructed from the orthogonal
polynomials corresponding to the potential and from their Cauchy transform. The
correlation functions are a sum of expressions attached to a set of fully
packed oriented loops configurations; for rotational invariant systems,
explicit expressions can be written for each configuration and more
specifically for the Gaussian potential, we obtain the large $N$ expansion ('t
Hooft expansion) and the so-called BMN limit.
