Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) model is considered as a viable theory of
gravity. It produces the Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics in the
nonrelativistic weak field limit and is free from ghosts. This model has been
tested against various cosmological observations. Here we investigate whether
new observations such as the galaxy velocity power spectrum measured by 6dF and
the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect power spectrum measured by ACT/SPT can
put further constraints on the TeVeS model. Furthermore, we perform the test of
TeVeS cosmology with a sterile neutrino by confronting to Planck data, and find
it incompatible with CMB measurements.
