We investigate the mechanical properties of a static dense granular assembly
in response to a local forcing. To this end, a small cyclic displacement is
applied on a grain in the bulk of a 2D disordered packing under gravity and the
displacement fields are monitored. We evidence a dominant long range radial
response in the upper half part above the sollicitation and after a large
number of cycles the response is `quasi-reversible' with a remanent dissipation
field exhibiting long range streams and vortex-like symmetry.
