We analyze the local structure of two dimensional packings of frictional
disks numerically. We focus on the fractions x_i of particles that are in
contact with i neighbors, and systematically vary the confining pressure p and
friction coefficient \mu. We find that for all \mu, the fractions x_i exhibit
powerlaw scaling with p, which allows us to obtain an accurate estimate for x_i
at zero pressure. We uncover how these zero pressure fractions x_i vary with
\mu, and introduce a simple model that captures most of this variation. We also
probe the correlations between the contact numbers of neighboring particles.
