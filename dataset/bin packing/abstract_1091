In the 1980s, measurements of the cumulative $\beta$ spectra of the fission
products following the thermal neutron induced fission of $^{235}$U,
$^{239}$Pu, and $^{241}$Pu were performed at the magnetic spectrometer BILL at
the ILL in Grenoble. This data was published in bins of 250 keV. In this paper,
we re-publish the original data in a binning of 50 keV for $^{235}$U and 100
keV for $^{239}$Pu and $^{241}$Pu.
