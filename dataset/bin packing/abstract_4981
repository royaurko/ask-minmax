We perform a systematic analysis of the effects of photometric redshift
uncertainties on weak lensing tomography. We describe the photo-z distribution
with a bias and Gaussian scatter that are allowed to vary arbitrarily between
intervals of dz = 0.1 in redshift.While the mere presence of bias and scatter
does not substantially degrade dark energy information, uncertainties in both
parameters do. For a fiducial next-generation survey each would need to be
known to better than about 0.003-0.01 in redshift for each interval in order to
lead to less than a factor of 1.5 increase in the dark energy parameter errors.
The more stringent requirement corresponds to a larger dark energy parameter
space, when redshift variation in the equation of state of dark energy is
allowed.Of order 10^4-10^5 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts fairly sampled
from the source galaxy distribution will be needed to achieve this level of
calibration. If the sample is composed of multiple galaxy types, a fair sample
would be required for each. These requirements increase in stringency for more
ambitious surveys; we quantify such scalings with a convenient fitting formula.
No single aspect of a photometrically binned selection of galaxies such as
their mean or median suffices, indicating that dark energy parameter
determinations are sensitive to the shape and nature of outliers in the photo-z
redshift distribution.
