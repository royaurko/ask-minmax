We report the experimental observation of novel vortex patterns in vertically
vibrated granular rods. Above a critical packing fraction, moving ordered
domains of nearly vertical rods spontaneously form and coexist with horizontal
rods. The domains of vertical rods coarsen in time to form large vortices. We
investigate the conditions under which the vortices occur by varying the number
of rods, vibration amplitude and frequency. The size of the vortices increases
with the number of rods. We characterize the growth of the ordered domains by
measuring the area fraction of the ordered regions as a function of time. A
{\em void filling} model is presented to describe the nucleation and growth of
the vertical domains. We track the ends of the vertical rods and obtain the
velocity fields of the vortices. The rotation speed of the rods is observed to
depend on the vibration velocity of the container and on the packing. To
investigate the impact of the direction of driving on the observed phenomena,
we performed experiments with the container vibrated horizontally. Although
vertical domains form, vortices are not observed. We therefore argue that the
motion is generated due to the interaction of the inclination of the rods with
the bottom of a vertically vibrated container. We also perform simple
experiments with a single row of rods in an annulus. These experiments directly
demonstrate that the rod motion is generated when the rods are inclined from
the vertical, and is always in the direction of the inclination.
