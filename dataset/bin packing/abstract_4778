Bi-2212 round wire is made by the powder-in-tube technique. An unavoidable
property of powder-in-tube conductors is that there is about 30% void space in
the as-drawn wire. We have recently shown that the gas present in the as-drawn
Bi-2212 wire agglomerates into large bubbles and that they are presently the
most deleterious current limiting mechanism. By densifying short 2212 wires
before reaction through cold isostatic pressing (CIPping), the void space was
almost removed and the gas bubble density was reduced significantly, resulting
in a doubled engineering critical current density (JE) of 810 A/mm2 at 5 T, 4.2
K. Here we report on densifying Bi-2212 wire by swaging, which increased JE
(4.2 K, 5 T) from 486 A/mm2 for as-drawn wire to 808 A/mm2 for swaged wire.
This result further confirms that enhancing the filament packing density is of
great importance for making major JE improvement in this round-wire magnet
conductor.
