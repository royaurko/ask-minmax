We present improved results on the measurement of the angular power spectrum
of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies using the
data from the last Archeops flight. This refined analysis is obtained by using
the 6 most sensitive photometric pixels in the CMB bands centered at 143 and
217 GHz and 20% of the sky, mostly clear of foregrounds. Using two different
cross-correlation methods, we obtain very similar results for the angular power
spectrum. Consistency checks are performed to test the robustness of these
results paying particular attention to the foreground contamination level which
remains well below the statistical uncertainties. The multipole range from l=10
to l=700 is covered with 25 bins, confirming strong evidence for a plateau at
large angular scales (the Sachs-Wolfe plateau) followed by two acoustic peaks
centered around l=220 and l=550 respectively. These data provide an independent
confirmation, obtained at different frequencies, of the WMAP first year
results.
