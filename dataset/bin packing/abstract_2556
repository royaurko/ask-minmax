For any spherically symmetric black hole spacetime with an ideal fluid
source, we establish a dual fluid system on a hypersurface near the black hole
horizon. The dual fluid is incompressible and obeys Navier-Stokes equation
subject to some external force. The force term in the fluid equation consists
in two parts, one comes from the curvature of the hypersurface, the other comes
from the stress-energy of the bulk fluid.
