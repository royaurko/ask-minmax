The measurement of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) for
heavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions tests predictions for cold- and
hot-nuclear-matter effects. Heavy-flavor production in \pp\ collisions tests
pQCD calculations and serves as a reference for understanding heavy-flavor
production in heavy-ion collisions. Using the PHENIX muon-arm spectrometers,
the transverse momentum spectra of inclusive muon candidates are measured for
\pp\ and $\cucu$ collisions at $\snn = 200$\,GeV. After subtracting
backgrounds, we obtain the measured invariant yields of negative muons from the
decay of heavy flavor mesons. For \pp\ collisions, we measure the
charm-production cross section integrated over $\pt$ and in the rapidity range
$1.4<y<1.9$ to be $d\sigma_{c\bar{c}}/dy = 0.139\pm 0.029\ {\rm
(stat)\,}^{+0.051}_{-0.058}\ {\rm (syst)}$ mb. This result is compared to a
recent FONLL calculation and to a PHENIX measurement at mid-rapidity. For
$\cucu$ collisions, we measure the $R_{\rm AA}$ for heavy-flavor muons in three
centrality bins for $1<\pt<4$ GeV/$c$, with suppression observed for central
collisions. We compare our measurement for central collisions to a recent
theoretical prediction.
