Much recent effort has focused on glassy and jamming properties of spherical
particles. Very little is known about such phenomena for non-spherical
particles, and we take a first step by studying ellipses. We find important
differences between the dynamical and structural properties of disks and
two-dimensional ellipses subject to continuous Couette shear. In particular,
ellipses show slow dynamical evolution, without a counterpart in disks, in the
mean velocity, local density, orientational order, and local stress. starting
from an unjammed state, ellipses can first jam under shear, and then slowly
unjam. The slow unjamming process is understood as a result of gradual changes
in their orientations, leading to a denser packing. For disks, the rotation of
particles only contributes to relaxation of frictional forces, and hence, does
not significantly cause structural changes. For the shear-jammed states, the
global building up and relaxation of stress, which occurs in the form of stress
avalanches, is qualitatively different for disks and ellipses, and is
manifested by different forms of rate-dependence for ellipses vs. disks. Unlike
the weak rate dependence typical for many granular systems, ellipses show
power-law dependence on the shearing rate, {\Omega}.
