The Bi/Ag(111), Pb/Ag(111), and Sb/Ag(111) surface alloys exhibit a
two-dimensional band structure with a strongly enhanced Rashba-type
spin-splitting, which is in part attributed to the structural asymmetry
resulting from an outward relaxation of the alloy atoms. In order to gain
further insight into the spin-splitting mechanism, we have experimentally
determined the outward relaxation of the alloy atoms in these surface alloys
using quantitative low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The structure plays
an important role in the size of the spinsplitting as it dictates the potential
landscape, the symmetry as well as the orbital character. Furthermore, we
discuss the band ordering of the Pb/Ag(111) surface alloy as well as the
reproducible formation of Sb/Ag(111) surface alloys with unfaulted
(face-centered cubic) and faulted (hexagonally close-packed) toplayer stacking.
