Several security models of multiple-access channel (MAC) are investigated.
First, we study the degraded MAC with confidential messages, where two users
transmit their confidential messages (no common message) to a destination, and
each user obtains a degraded version of the output of the MAC. Each user views
the other user as a eavesdropper, and wishes to keep its confidential message
as secret as possible from the other user. Measuring each user's uncertainty
about the other user's confidential message by equivocation, the inner and
outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation region for this model have been
provided. The result is further explained via the binary and Gaussian examples.
  Second, the discrete memoryless multiple-access wiretap channel (MAC-WT) is
studied, where two users transmit their corresponding confidential messages (no
common message) to a legitimate receiver, while an additional wiretapper wishes
to obtain the messages via a wiretap channel. This new model is considered into
two cases: the general MAC-WT with cooperative encoders, and the degraded
MAC-WT with non-cooperative encoders. The capacity-equivocation region is
totally determined for the cooperative case, and inner and outer bounds on the
capacity-equivocation region are provided for the non-cooperative case. For
both cases, the results are further explained via the binary examples.
