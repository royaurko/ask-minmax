Ongoing and planned wide-area surveys at optical and infrared wavelengths
should detect a few times 10^5 galaxy clusters, roughly 10% of which are
expected to be at redshifts >~ 0.8. We investigate what can be learned about
the X-ray emission of these clusters from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. While
individual clusters at redshifts >~ 0.5 contribute at most a few photons to the
survey, a significant measurement of the mean flux of cluster subsamples can be
obtained by stacking cluster fields. We show that the mean X-ray luminosity of
clusters with mass M >~ 2 x 10^{14} M_sun/h selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey should be measurable out to redshift unity with signal-to-noise >~ 10,
even if clusters are binned with Delta z=0.1 and Delta ln M ~ 0.3. For such
bins, suitably chosen hardness ratio allows the mean temperature of clusters to
be determined out to z ~ 0.7 with a relative accuracy of Delta T/T <~ 0.15 for
M > 10^{14} M_sun/h.
