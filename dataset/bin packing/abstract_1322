This paper gives a lower bound on the complexity of epsilon-approximately
solving a packing or covering problem using a certain class of
``Lagrangian-relaxation'' algorithms: any such algorithm, given a problem
formed by a random {0,1}-matrix, requires (with high probability) a number of
iterations proportional to (rho/epsilon)^2 log m iterations. (Here rho is a
technical parameter, the "width" of the problem instance.)
  The class of algorithms in question includes Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition,
Benders' decomposition, the Lagrangian-relaxation method developed by Held and
Karp for lower-bounding TSP, and algorithms recently studied by many contributors
including Plotkin, Shmoys, and Tardos. The lower bound matches the known upper
bounds within a constant factor. The lower bound is useful because, in
practice, the dependence on epsilon limits the applicability of these
algorithms. The lower bound provides some insight into what is necessary to
surmount this dependence.
