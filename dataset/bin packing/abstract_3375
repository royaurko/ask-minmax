We present a set of Langmuir binding models in which electrostatic
cooperativity effects to protein sorption is incorporated in the spirit of
Guoy-Chapman-Stern models, where the global substrate (microgel) charge state
is modified by bound reactants (charged proteins). Application of this approach
to lysozyme sorption to oppositely charged core-shell microgels allows us to
extract the intrinsic, binding affinity of the protein to the gel, which is
salt-concentration independent and mostly hydrophobic in nature. The total
binding affinity is found to be mainly electrostatic in nature, changes many
orders of magnitude during the sorption process, and is significantly
influenced by osmotic deswelling effects. The intrinsic binding affinity is
determined to be about 7 kBT for our system. We additionally show that Langmuir
binding models and those based on excludedvolume interactions are formally
equivalent for low to moderate protein packing, if the nature of the bound
state is consistently defined. Having appreciated this, a more quantitative
interpretation of binding isotherms in terms of separate physical interactions
is possible in future for a wide variety of experimental approaches.
