The color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of three intermediate-age LMC clusters,
NGC 2173, SL556 and NGC2155 are analyzed to determine their age and metallicity
basing on Padova stellar models. Synthetic CMDs are compared with cluster data.
The best match is obtained using two fitting functions based on star counts in
the different bins of the cluster CMD. Two different criteria are used. One of
them takes into account the uncertainties in the color of the red clump stars.
Given the uncertainties on the experimental values of the clusters metallicity,
we provide a set of acceptable solutions. They define the correspondent values
of metallicity, age, reddening and distance modulus (for the assumed IMF). The
comparison with Padova models suggests for NGC 2173 a prolonged star formation
(spanning a period of about 0.3 Gyr), beginning 1.7 Gyr and ending 1.4 Gyr ago.
The metallicity Z is in the range 0.0016 $-$ 0.003. Contrary to what suggested
for NGC 2173 a period of extended star formation was not required to fit the SL
556 and the NGC 2155 observations. For SL 556 an age of 2.0 Gyr is obtained.
The metallicity value is in the range 0.002 $-$ 0.004, depending on the adopted
comparison criterium. The derived age for NGC 2155 is 2.8 Gyr and its
metallicity Z is in the range 0.002 $-$ 0.003. The CMD features of this cluster
suggest that a more efficient overshoot should be adopted in the evolutionary
models.
