In this paper, we consider a scalar stochastic balance law and gain the
existence for stochastic entropy solutions. Our proof relies on the BGK
approximation and the generalized It\^{o} formula. Moreover, as an application,
we derive the existence of stochastic entropy solutions for stochastic
Buckley-Leverett type equations.
