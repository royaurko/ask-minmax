The transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity and
their ratio are evaluated in a statistical model with the longitudinal and
transverse flows for different centrality bins at RHIC at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=130$
and 200 GeV. Full description of decays of hadron resonances is applied in
these estimations. The predictions of the model at the freeze-out parameters,
which were determined independently from measured particle yields and $p_{T}$
spectra, agree qualitatively well with the experimental data. The observed
overestimation of the ratio can be explained for more central collisions by the
redefinition of $dN_{ch}/d\eta|_{mid}$.
