In this paper, we study Whittaker modules for graded Lie algebras. We define
Whittaker modules for a class of graded Lie algebras and obtain a bijective
correspondence between the set of isomorphism classes of Whittaker modules and
the set of ideals of a polynomial ring, parallel to a result from the classical
setting and the case of the Virasoro algebra. As a consequence of this, we
obtain a classification of simple Whittaker modules for such algebras. Also, we
study some concrete algebras as examples.
