Given a convex disk $K$ and a positive integer $k$, let $\delta_T^k(K)$ and
$\delta_L^k(K)$ denote the $k$-fold translative packing density and the
$k$-fold lattice packing density of $K$, respectively. Let $T$ be a triangle.
In a very recent paper, K. Sriamorn proved that
$\delta_L^k(T)=\frac{2k^2}{2k+1}$. In this paper, I will show that
$\delta_T^k(T)=\delta_L^k(T)$.
