We formulate a model for a cooperative ballistic deposition (CBD) process
whereby the incoming particles are correlated with the ones already adsorbed
via attractive force. The strength of the correlation is controlled by a
tunable parameter $a$ that interpolates the classical car parking problem at
$a=0$, the ballistic deposition at $a=1$ and the CBD model at $a>1$. The
effects of the correlation in the CBD model are as follows. The jamming
coverage $q(a)$ increases with the strength of attraction $a$ due to an ever
increasing tendency of cluster formation. The system almost reaches the closest
packing structure as $a\to\infty$ but never forms a percolating cluster which
is typical to 1D system. In the large $a$ regime, the mean cluster size $k$
increases as $a^{1/2}$. Furthermore, the asymptotic approach towards the
closest packing is purely algebraic both with $a$ as $q(\infty)-q(a) \sim
a^{-1/2}$ and with $k$ as $q(\infty)-q(k) \sim k^{-1}$ where $q(\infty)\simeq
1$.
