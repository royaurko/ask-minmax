Using a silicon vertex detector, we measure the charged particle
pseudorapidity distribution over the range 1.5 to 5.5 using data collected from
PbarP collisions at root s = 630 GeV. With a data sample of 3 million events,
we deduce a result with an overall normalization uncertainty of 5%, and typical
bin to bin errors of a few percent. We compare our result to the measurement of
UA5, and the distribution generated by the Lund Monte Carlo with default
settings. This is only the second measurement at this level of precision, and
only the second measurement for pseudorapidity greater than 3.
