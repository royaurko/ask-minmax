A new method of estimating high-order virial coefficients for fluids composed
of equal three-dimensional rigid spheres is proposed. The predicted $B_{11}$
and $B_{12}$ values are in good agreement with reliable estimates previously
reported. A new application of the Levin's transformations is developed, as
well as a new way of using Levin's transformations is suggested. For the virial
series of packing factor powers, this method estimates the $B_{13}$ value near
173.
