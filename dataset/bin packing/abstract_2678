Inclusive jet and dijet cross sections have been measured in proton-proton
collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the
Large Hadron Collider. The cross sections were measured using jets clustered
with the anti-kT algorithm with parameters R=0.4 and R=0.6. These measurements
are based on the 2010 data sample, consisting of a total integrated luminosity
of 37 inverse picobarns. Inclusive jet double-differential cross sections are
presented as a function of jet transverse momentum, in bins of jet rapidity.
Dijet double-differential cross sections are studied as a function of the dijet
invariant mass, in bins of half the rapidity separation of the two leading
jets. The measurements are performed in the jet rapidity range |y|<4.4,
covering jet transverse momenta from 20 GeV to 1.5 TeV and dijet invariant
masses from 70 GeV to 5 TeV. The data are compared to expectations based on
next-to-leading order QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects,
as well as to next-to-leading order Monte Carlo predictions. In addition to a
test of the theory in a new kinematic regime, the data also provide sensitivity
to parton distribution functions in a region where they are currently not
well-constrained.
