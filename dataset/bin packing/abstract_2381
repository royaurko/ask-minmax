The spectra of baryons containing two heavy quarks test the form of the $QQ$
potential through the spin-averaged masses and hyperfine splittings. The mass
splittings in these spectra are calculated in a nonrelativistic potential model
and the effects of varying the potential studied. The simple description in
terms of light quark and pointlike diquark is not yet valid for realistic heavy
quark masses.
