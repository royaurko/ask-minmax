We use variable-temperature (150--300\,K) single-crystal X-ray diffraction to
re-examine the interplay between structure and dynamics in the ambient phase of
the isotropic negative thermal expansion (NTE) material Cd(CN)$_2$. We find
strong experimental evidence for the existence of low-energy vibrational modes
that involve off-centering of Cd$^{2+}$ ions. These modes have the effect of
increasing network packing density---suggesting a mechanism for NTE that is
different to the generally-accepted picture of correlated Cd(C/N)$_4$ rotation
modes. Strong local correlations in the displacement directions of neighbouring
cadmium centres are evident in the existence of highly-structured diffuse
scattering in the experimental X-ray diffraction patterns. Monte Carlo
simulations suggest these patterns might be interpreted in terms of a basic set
of `ice-rules' that establish a mapping between the dynamics of Cd(CN)$_2$ and
proton ordering in cubic ice VII.
