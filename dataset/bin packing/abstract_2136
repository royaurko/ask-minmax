Motivated by recent simulations and by experiments on aggregation of gliding
bacteria, we study a model of the collective dynamics of self-propelled hard
rods on a substrate in two dimensions. The rods have finite size, interact via
excluded volume and their dynamics is overdamped by the interaction with the
substrate. Starting from a microscopic model with non-thermal noise sources, a
continuum description of the system is derived. The hydrodynamic equations are
then used to characterize the possible steady states of the systems and their
stability as a function of the particles packing fraction and the speed of self
propulsion.
