Femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy is applied to identify transient optical
signatures of phase transitions in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} films. To
elucidate the dynamics of superconducting and pseudogap phases, the slow
thermal component is removed from the time-domain traces of photo-induced
reflectivity in a high-flux regime with low frequency pulse rate. The rescaled
data exhibit distinct signatures of the phase separation with abrupt changes at
the onsets of TSC and TPG in excellent agreement with transport data. Compared
to the superconducting phase, the response of the pseudogap phase is
characterized by the strongly reduced reflectivity change accompanied by a
faster recovery time.
