We simulate with hydrodynamics a suspension of active disks squirming through
a Newtonian fluid. We explore numerically the full range of squirmer area
fractions from dilute to close packed and show that "motility induced phase
separation" (MIPS), which was recently proposed to arise generically in active
matter, and which has been seen in simulations of active Brownian disks, is
strongly suppressed by hydrodynamic interactions. We give an argument for why
this should be the case and support it with counterpart simulations of active
Brownian disks in a parameter regime that provides a closer counterpart to
hydrodynamic suspensions than in previous studies.
