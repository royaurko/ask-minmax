An upper bound to the roughening temperature of a close-packed singular
surface, fcc Al (111), is obtained via free energy calculations based on
thermodynamic integration using the embedded-atom interaction model. Roughening
of Al (111) is predicted to occur at around 890 K, well below bulk melting (933
K), and it should therefore be observable, save for possible kinetic hindering.
