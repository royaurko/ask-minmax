In this paper, we study the holographic description of the generic
four-dimensional non-extremal Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black holes. We find that if
focusing on the near-horizon region, for the massless scalar scattering in the
low-frequency limit, there exists hidden conformal symmetry on the solution
space. Similar to the Kerr case, this suggests that the Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS
black hole is dual to a two-dimensional CFT with central charges
$c_L=c_R=\frac{6a(r_++r_\ast)}{k}$ and temperatures
$T_L=\frac{k(r_+^2+r_\ast^2+2a^2)}{4\pi a\Xi(r_++r_\ast)},
T_R=\frac{k(r_+-r_\ast)}{4\pi a\Xi}$. The macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy could be recovered from the microscopic counting in dual CFT via the
Cardy formula. Using the Minkowski prescription, we compute the real-time
correlators of the scalar, photon and graviton in near horizon geometry of near
extremal Kerr-AdS-dS black hole. In all these cases, the retarded Green's
function and the corresponding absorption cross section are in perfect match
with CFT prediction. We further discuss the low-frequency scattering of a
charged scalar by a Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black hole and find the dual CFT
description.
