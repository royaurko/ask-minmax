(Abridged) We explore the evolution of field early-type galaxies on a sample
extracted from GOODS/CDFS. The galaxies are selected by means of a
non-parametric analysis followed by visual inspection. We exclude those
galaxies which are not consistent with an evolution into the Kormendy relation.
The final set comprises 249 galaxies with a median redshift z=0.7. The
distribution of number counts versus apparent magnitude suggests a substantial
decrease of the comoving number density with redshift. The majority of the
galaxies feature passively evolving old stellar populations. One third of those
in the upper half of the redshift distribution have blue colors, in contrast to
only 10% in the lower redshift subsample. An adaptive binning of the color maps
is performed to explore the internal color distribution. We find that most blue
galaxies in our sample feature blue cores whereas most of the red early-types
are passively evolving stellar populations with red cores. The color gradients
and scatter do not evolve with redshift and are compatible with the
observations at z=0 assuming a radial dependence of the metallicity within each
galaxy. This work emphasizes the need for a careful sample selection, as we
found that most of those galaxies which were visually classified as early types
-- but then rejected based on the Kormendy relation -- feature blue colors
characteristic of recent star formation.
