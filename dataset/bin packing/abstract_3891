Results are presented of a two-pion interferometry (HBT) analysis in Pb+Au
collisions at 40, 80, and 158 AGeV. A detailed study of the Bertsch-Pratt HBT
radius parameters has been performed as function of the mean pair transverse
momentum $k_t$ and in bins of the centrality of the collision. From these
results we extract model dependent information about the space-time evolution
of the reaction. An investigation of the effective volume of the pion emitting
system provides an important tool to study the properties of thermal pion
freeze-out.
