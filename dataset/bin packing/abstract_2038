The dodecahedral conjecture states that the volume of the Voronoi polyhedron
of a sphere in a packing of equal spheres is at least the volume of a regular
dodecahedron with inradius 1. The contributors prove the conjecture following the
methodology of the proof the Kepler conjecture. (See math.MG/9811071.)
