The formation of bundles composed of actin filaments and cross-linking
proteins is an essential process in the maintenance of the cells' cytoskeleton.
It has also been recreated by in-vitro experiments, where actin networks are
routinely produced to mimic and study the cellular structures. It has long been
observed that these bundles seem to have a well defined width distribution,
which has not been adequately described theoretically. We propose here that
packing defects of the filaments, quenched and random, contribute an effective
repulsion that counters the cross-linking adhesion energy and leads to a well
defined bundle width. This is a two-dimensional strain-field version of the
classic Rayleigh instability of charged droplets.
