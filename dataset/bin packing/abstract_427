Boyd (1974) proposed a class of infinite ball packings that are generated by
inversions. Later, Maxwell (1983) interpreted Boyd's construction in terms of
Lorentzian Coxeter systems. In Maxwell's work, the simple roots form a basis of
the representations space of the Coxeter group. With a new definition for the
notion of "level", we extend Boyd--Maxwell's results to the case where the
simple roots are positively independent. Our main theorem is that, with the new
definition, the space-like weights of a Lorentzian Coxeter system correspond to
a ball packing if and only if the Coxeter system is of level $2$. We also
present a partial classification of level-$2$ Coxeter $d$-polytopes with $d+2$
facets.
