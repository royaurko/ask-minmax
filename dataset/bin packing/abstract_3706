Fluctuations of the soft X-ray background are investigated using harmonic
analysis. A section of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey around the north galactic pole
is used. The flux distribution is expanded into a set of harmonic functions and
the power spectrum is determined. Several subsamples of the RASS have been used
and the spectra for different regions and energies are presented. The effects
of the data binning in pixels are assessed and taken into account. The spectra
of the analyzed samples reflect both small scale effects generated by strong
discrete sources and the large scale gradients of the XRB distribution. Our
results show that the power spectrum technique can be effectively used to
investigate anisotropy of the XRB at various scales. This statistics will
become a useful tool in the investigation of various XRB components.
