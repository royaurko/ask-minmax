We prove here that the Poincar\'e exponent of a geometrically finite group od
isometries of the 3-dimensionnal hyperbolic space coincides with the Hausdorff
dimension of its limit set. We also compare the natural measures supported by
this set: the Patterson measure and the Hausdorff and packing measures
corresponding to the standart jauge.
