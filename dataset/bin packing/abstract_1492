All atmosphere-less planetary bodies are covered with a dust layer, the
so-called regolith, which determines the optical, mechanical and thermal
properties of their surface. These properties depend on the regolith material,
the size distribution of the particles it consists of, and the porosity to
which these particles are packed. We performed experiments in parabolic flights
to determine the gravity dependency of the packing density of regolith for
solid-particle sizes of 60 $\mu$m and 1 mm as well as for 100-250 $\mu$m-sized
agglomerates of 1.5 $\mu$m-sized solid grains. We utilized g-levels between 0.7
m s$^{-2}$ and 18 m s$^{-2}$ and completed our measurements with experiments
under normal gravity conditions. Based on previous experimental and theoretical
literature and supported by our new experiments, we developed an analytical
model to calculate the regolith stratification of celestial rocky and icy
bodies and estimated the mechanical yields of the regolith under the weight of
an astronaut and a spacecraft resting on these objects.
