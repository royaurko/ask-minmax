A 1972 duality conjecture due to Pietsch asserts that the entropy numbers of
a compact operator acting between two Banach spaces and those of its adjoint
are (in an appropriate sense) equivalent. This is equivalent to a dimension
free inequality relating covering (or packing) numbers for convex bodies to
those of their polars. The duality conjecture has been recently proved (see
math.FA/0407236) in the central case when one of the Banach spaces is
Hilbertian, which - in the geometric setting - corresponds to a duality result
for symmetric convex bodies in Euclidean spaces. In the present paper we define
a new notion of "convexified packing," show a duality theorem for that notion,
and use it to prove the duality conjecture under much milder conditions on the
spaces involved (namely, that one of them is K-convex).
