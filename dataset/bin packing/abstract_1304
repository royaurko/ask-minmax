Loosely packed granular materials are intensively studied nowadays.
Electrical and thermal transport properties should reflect the granular
structure as well as intrinsic properties. We have compacted crystalline $CaAl$
based metallic grains and studied the electrical resistivity and the
thermoelectric power as a function of temperature ($T$) from 15 to 300K. Both
properties show three regimes as a function of temperature. It should be
pointed out : (i) The electrical resistivity continuously decreases between 15
and 235 K (ii) with various dependences, e.g. $\simeq$ $T^{-3/4}$ at low $T$,
while (iii) the thermoelectric power (TEP) is positive, (iv) shows a bump near
60K, and (v) presents a rather unusual square root of temperature dependence at
low temperature. It is argued that these three regimes indicate a competition
between geometric and thermal processes, - for which a theory seems to be
missing in the case of TEP. The microchemical analysis results are also
reported indicating a complex microstructure inherent to the phase diagram
peritectic intricacies of this binary alloy.
