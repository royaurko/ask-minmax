We analyze the jamming transition that occurs as a function of increasing
packing density in a disordered two-dimensional assembly of disks at zero
temperature for ``Point J'' of the recently proposed jamming phase diagram. We
measure the total number of moving disks and the transverse length of the
moving region, and find a power law divergence as the packing density increases
toward a critical jamming density. This provides evidence that the T = 0
jamming transition as a function of packing density is a {\it second order}
phase transition. Additionally we find evidence for multiscaling, indicating
the importance of long tails in the velocity fluctuations.
