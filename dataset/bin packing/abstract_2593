The Monte Carlo integrator HAWK provides precision predictions for Higgs
production at hadron colliders in vector-boson fusion and Higgs strahlung, i.e.
in production processes where the Higgs boson is Attached to WeaK bosons. The
fully differential predictions include the full QCD and electroweak
next-to-leading-order corrections. Results are computed as integrated cross
sections and as binned distributions for important hadron-collider observables.
