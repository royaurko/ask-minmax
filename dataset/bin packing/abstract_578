If you walk on sand, it supports your weight. How do the disordered forces
between particles in sand organize, to keep you from sinking? This simple
question is surprisingly difficult to answer experimentally: measuring forces
in three dimensions, between deeply buried grains, is challenging. We describe
here experiments in which we have succeeded in measuring forces inside a
granular packing subject to controlled deformations. We connect the measured
micro-scale forces to the macro-scale packing force response with an averaging,
mean field calculation. This calculation explains how the combination of
packing structure and contact deformations produce the unexpected mechanical
response of the packing, and reveals a surprising microscopic particle
deformation enhancement mechanism.
