This paper introduces the SEQ BIN meta-constraint with a polytime algorithm
achieving general- ized arc-consistency according to some properties. SEQ BIN
can be used for encoding counting con- straints such as CHANGE, SMOOTH or
INCREAS- ING NVALUE. For some of these constraints and some of their variants
GAC can be enforced with a time and space complexity linear in the sum of
domain sizes, which improves or equals the best known results of the
literature.
