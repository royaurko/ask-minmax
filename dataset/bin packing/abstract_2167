This paper studies the random-coding exponent of joint source-channel coding
for a scheme where source messages are assigned to disjoint subsets (referred
to as classes), and codewords are independently generated according to a
distribution that depends on the class index of the source message. For
discrete memoryless systems, two optimally chosen classes and product
distributions are found to be sufficient to attain the sphere-packing exponent
in those cases where it is tight.
