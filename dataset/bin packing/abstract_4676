We describe efficient methods for screening clone libraries, based on
pooling schemes which we call ``random $k$-sets designs''. In these designs,
the pools in which any clone occurs are equally likely to be any possible
selection of $k$ from the $v$ pools. The values of $k$ and $v$ can be chosen
to optimize desirable properties. Random $k$-sets designs have substantial
advantages over alternative pooling schemes: they are efficient, flexible,
easy to specify, require fewer pools, and have error-correcting and
error-detecting capabilities. In addition, screening can often be achieved in
only one pass, thus facilitating automation. For design comparison, we assume
a binomial distribution for the number of ``positive'' clones, with parameters
$n$, the number of clones, and $c$, the coverage. We propose the expected
number of {\em resolved positive} clones---clones which are definitely
positive based upon the pool assays---as a criterion for the efficiency of a
pooling design. We determine the value of $k$ which is optimal, with respect
to this criterion, as a function of $v$, $n$ and $c$. We also describe
superior $k$-sets designs called $k$-sets packing designs. As an illustration,
we discuss a robotically implemented design for a 2.5-fold-coverage, human
chromosome 16 YAC library of $n=1,298$ clones. We also estimate the
probability each clone is positive, given the pool-assay data and a model for
experimental errors.
