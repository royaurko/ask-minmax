The contributors of this paper study singular phenomena(vanishing and blowing-up
in finite time) of solutions to the homogeneous $\hbox{Dirichlet}$ boundary
value problem of nonlinear diffusion equations involving
$p(x)$-\hbox{Laplacian} operator and a nonlinear source. The contributors discuss
how the value of the variable exponent $p(x)$ and initial energy(data) affect
the properties of solutions. At the same time, we obtain the critical
extinction and blow-up exponents of solutions.
