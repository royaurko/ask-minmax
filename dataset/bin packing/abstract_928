We consider the problem of finding all enclosing rectangles of minimum area
that can contain a given set of rectangles without overlap. Our rectangle
packer chooses the x-coordinates of all the rectangles before any of the
y-coordinates. We then transform the problem into a perfect-packing problem
with no empty space by adding additional rectangles. To determine the
y-coordinates, we branch on the different rectangles that can be placed in each
empty position. Our packer allows us to extend the known solutions for a
consecutive-square benchmark from 27 to 32 squares. We also introduce three new
benchmarks, avoiding properties that make a benchmark easy, such as rectangles
with shared dimensions. Our third benchmark consists of rectangles of
increasingly high precision. To pack them efficiently, we limit the rectangles
coordinates and the bounding box dimensions to the set of subset sums of the
rectangles dimensions. Overall, our algorithms represent the current
state-of-the-art for this problem, outperforming other algorithms by orders of
magnitude, depending on the benchmark.
