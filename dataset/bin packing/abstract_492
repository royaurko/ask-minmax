Experimental analyses often use jet binning to distinguish between different
kinematic regimes and separate contributions from background processes. To
accurately model theoretical uncertainties in these measurements, a consistent
description of the jet bins is required. We present a complete framework for
the combination of resummed results for production processes in different
exclusive jet bins, focusing on Higgs production in gluon fusion as an example.
We extend the resummation of the Higgs + 1-jet cross section into the
challenging low transverse momentum region, lowering the uncertainties
considerably. We provide combined predictions with resummation for cross
sections in the Higgs + 0-jet and Higgs + 1-jet bins, and give an improved
theory covariance matrix for use in experimental studies. We estimate that the
relevant theoretical uncertainties on the signal strength in the Higgs to WW
analysis are reduced by nearly a factor of 2 compared to the current value.
