We investigate the morphologies and maximum packing density of thin wires
packed into spherical cavities. Using simulations and experiments, we find that
ordered as well as disordered structures emerge, depending on the amount of
internal torsion. We find that the highest packing densities are achieved in
low torsion packings for large systems, but in high torsion packings for small
systems. An analysis of both situations is given in terms of energetics and
comparison is made to analytical models of DNA packing in viral capsids.
