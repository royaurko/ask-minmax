We propose a sorting-based greedy algorithm called SortedGreedy[m] for
approximately solving the offline version of the d-choice weighted
balls-into-bins problem where the number of choices for each ball is equal to
the number of bins. We assume the ball weights to be non-negative. We compare
the performance of the sorting-based algorithm with a naive algorithm called
Greedy[m]. We show that by sorting the input data according to the weights we
are able to achieve an order of magnitude smaller gap (the weight difference
between the heaviest and the lightest bin) for small problems (<= 4000 balls),
and at least two orders of magnitude smaller gap for larger problems. In
practice, SortedGreedy[m] runs almost as fast as Greedy[m]. This makes
sorting-based algorithms favorable for solving offline weighted balls-into-bins
problems.
