Using the properties of SDSS DR7 QSOs catalog from Shen et al., the Baldwin
effect, its slope evolution, the underlying drive for a large sample of 35019
QSOs with reliable spectral analysis are investigated. We find that the Baldwin
effect exists in this large QSOs sample, which is almost the same in 11
different redshift bins, up to $z\sim 5$. The slope is -0.238 by the BCES
(\civ\ EW depends on the continuum), -0.787 by the BCES bisector. For 11
redshift-bins, there is an increasing of the Baldwin effect slope from
$z\sim1.5$ to $z\sim2.0$. From $z\sim2.0$ to $z\sim5.0$, the slope change is
not clear considering their uncertainties or larger redshift bins. There is a
strong correlation between the rest-frame \civ\ EW and \civ-based \mbh while
the relation between the \civ\ EW and \mgii-based \mbh is very weak. With the
correction of \civ-based \mbh from the \civ\ blueshift relative to \mgii, we
suggest that this strong correlation is due to the bias of the \civ-based \mbh,
with respect to that from the \mgii\ line. Considering the \mgii-based \mbh, a
medium strong correlation is found between the \civ\ EW and the Eddington
ratio, which implies that the Eddington ratio seems to be a better underlying
physical parameter than the central black hole mass.
