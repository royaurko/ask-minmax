Our model of shaken sand, presented in earlier work, has been extended to
include a more realistic `glassy' state, i.e., when the sandbox is shaken at
very low intensities of vibration. We revisit some of our earlier results, and
compare them with our new results on the revised model. Our analysis of the
glassy dynamics in our model shows that a variety of ground states is obtained;
these fall in two categories, which we argue are representative of regular and
irregular packings.
