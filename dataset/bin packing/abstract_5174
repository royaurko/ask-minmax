We determine star formation rates (SFRs) in a sample of color-selected,
star-forming (sBzK) galaxies (K(AB)<21.8) in the Extended Chandra Deep Field -
South. To identify and avoid active galactic nuclei, we use X-ray, IRAC color,
and IR/radio flux ratio selection methods. Photometric redshift-binned, average
flux densities are measured with stacking analyses in Spitzer-MIPS IR, BLAST
and APEX/LABOCA submillimeter, VLA and GMRT radio and Chandra X-ray data. We
include averages of aperture fluxes in MUSYC UBVRIz'JHK images to determine
UV-through-radio spectral energy distributions. We determine the total IR
luminosities and compare SFR calibrations from FIR, 24 micron, UV, radio and
X-ray wavebands. We find consistency with our best estimator, SFR(IR+UV), to
within errors for the preferred radio SFR calibration. Our results imply that
24 micron only and X-ray SFR estimates should be applied to high redshift
galaxies with caution. Average IR luminosities are consistent with luminous
infrared galaxies. We find SFR(IR+UV) for our stacked sBzKs at median redshifts
1.4, 1.8, and 2.2 to be 55+/-6 (random error), 74+/-8 and 154+/-17 Msun yr^-1
respectively, with additional systematic uncertainty of a factor of ~2.
