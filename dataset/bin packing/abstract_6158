The beam-spin asymmetry, $\Sigma$, for the reaction $\gamma d\rightarrow pn$
has been measured using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) for six photon-energy
bins between 1.1 and 2.3 GeV, and proton angles in the center-of-mass frame,
$\theta_{c.m.}$, between $25^\circ$ and $160^\circ$. These are the first
measurements of beam-spin asymmetries at $\theta_{c.m.}=90^\circ$ for
photon-beam energies above 1.6 GeV, and the first measurements for angles other
than $\theta_{c.m.}=90^\circ$. The angular and energy dependence of $\Sigma$ is
expected to aid in the development of QCD-based models to understand the
mechanisms of deuteron photodisintegration in the transition region between
hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, where both effective field theories
and perturbative QCD cannot make reliable predictions.
