We conjecture that meanders are governed by the gravitational version of a
c=-4 two-dimensional conformal field theory, allowing for exact predictions for
the meander configuration exponent \alpha=\sqrt{29}(\sqrt{29}+\sqrt{5})/12, and
the semi-meander exponent {\bar\alpha}=1+\sqrt{11}(\sqrt{29}+\sqrt{5})/24. This
result follows from an interpretation of meanders as pairs of fully packed
loops on a random surface, described by two c=-2 free fields. The above values
agree with recent numerical estimates. We generalize these results to a score
of meandric numbers with various geometries and arbitrary loop fugacities.
