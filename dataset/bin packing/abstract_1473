We consider a family of tight-binding models based on kagome lattice with
local fluxes, which have a lowest flat band in the single particle spectrum.
The flat band is spanned by eigenstates forming localized loops on the lattice,
with the maximally compact loop states typically breaking the discrete
rotational symmetry of the lattice. When populated by locally-interacting
particles, the close packing of such maximally compact loop states leads to a
nematic Wigner crystal ground state. If particles are bosons, increasing
filling beyond the close packing filling fraction, at the mean field level,
leads to formation of nematic supersolid and a nematic superfluid phases with
broken lattice rotation and $U(1)$ symmetry.
