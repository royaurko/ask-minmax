We generalize the study of entropic force to a general static spherical
spacetime and examine the acceleration, temperature, equation of gravity and
the energy associated with the holographic screen in this general background.
We show that the virtual degree of freedom on the holographic screen plays a
crucial role in interpreting field equations of gravity based on
thermodynamical perspective.
