The 1-loop partition function of the handle-body solutions in the AdS$_3$
gravity have been derived some years ago using the heat-kernel and the method
of images. In the semiclassical limit, such partition function should
correspond to the order $O (c^0)$ part in the partition function of dual
conformal field theory on the boundary Riemann surface. The higher genus
partition function could be computed by the multi-point functions in the
Riemann sphere via sewing prescription. In the large central charge limit, to
the leading order of $c$, the multi-point function is further simplified to be
a summation over the product of two-point functions, which may form links. Each
link is in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy class of the Schottky
group of the Riemann surface. Moreover, the value of a link is determined by
the eigenvalue of the element in the conjugate class. This allows us to
reproduce exactly the gravitational 1-loop partition function. The proof can be
generalized to the higher spin gravity and its dual CFT.
