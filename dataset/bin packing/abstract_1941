We performed numerical simulations on a two-dimensional inelastic hard disk
system under gravity with a heat bath to study the dynamics of granular
fluidization. Upon increasing the temperature of the heat bath, we found that
three phases, namely, the condensed phase, locally fluidized phase, and
granular turbulent phase, can be distinguished using the maximum packing
fraction and the excitation ratio, or the ratio of the kinetic energy to the
potential energy.It is shown that the system behavior in each phase is very
different from that of an ordinary vibrating bed.
