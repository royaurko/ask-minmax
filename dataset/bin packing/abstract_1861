We theoretically study the quasiparticle resonance states around a
nonmagnetic impurity in cuprate superconductors based on t-t'-J-U model. The
purpose of introducing the Coulomb repulsive interaction U is to partially
impose the double occupancy constraint by employing the Gutzwiller projected
mean-field approximation. We determine the spatial variation of the order
parameter and the local density of states (LDOS) by self-consistently solving
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. We find that in the large U limit, a
zero-energy resonance peak in the LDOS indeed appears for the impurity
potential in the unitary limit, at the same time the asymmetric superconducting
coherence peaks are strongly suppressed. As U decreases the electron double
occupancy d is permitted and gradually increases, leading to the decreasing of
order parameter. In particular the above zero-energy resonance peak begins to
evolve into a double-peaked structure since a critical value $d_{c}$. These
important feathers are qualitatively agreement with the scanning tunneling
spectroscopy experiments, and uncover the essential role played by the electron
correlation in cuprate superconductors.
