We report surface shear rheological measurements on dense insoluble
monolayers of micron sized colloidal spheres at the oil/water interface and of
the protein $\beta$-lactoglobulin at the air/water surface. As expected, the
elastic modulus shows a changing character in the response, from a viscous
liquid towards an elastic solid as the concentration is increased, and a change
from elastic to viscous as the shear frequency is increased. Surprisingly,
above a critical packing fraction, the complex elastic modulus curves measured
at different concentrations can be superposed to form a master curve, by
rescaling the frequency and the magnitude of the modulus. This provides a
powerful tool for the extrapolation of the material response function outside
the experimentally accessible frequency range. The results are discussed in
relation to recent experiments on bulk systems, and indicate that these two
dimensional monolayers should be regarded as being close to a soft glass state.
