We calculate the fragmentation function for charm quark into J/psi at the QCD
next-to-leading-order (NLO) and find that the produced J/psi is of larger
momentum fraction than it is at the leading-order. Based on the fragmentation
function and partonic processes calculated at the NLO, the transverse momentum
distribution on J/psi hadroproduction associated with a charm c (or \bar{c})
jet are predicted. We find that the distribution is enhanced by a factor of
2.0--3.3 at the NLO as p_t increased from 10 GeV to 100 GeV and it is
measurable at the LHC with charm tagger. The measurement at the LHC will supply
a first chance to directly test the QCD fragmentation mechanism on heavy
quarkonium production where the fragmentation function is calculable in
perturbative QCD. It is also applied to J/psi (Upsilon) production in the decay
of Z^0 (top quark).
