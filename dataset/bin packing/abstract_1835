The dense neutrino flux streaming from a core-collapse supernova can undergo
self-induced flavor conversion caused by neutrino-neutrino refraction.
Numerical studies of these nonlinear effects are challenging because
representing the neutrino radiation field by discrete energy and angle bins can
easily lead to unphysical solutions. In particular, if the number of angle bins
N_a is too small, flavor conversion begins too deep and produces completely
spurious results. At the same time, N_a=1 (single-angle approximation) can be a
good proxy for the N_a -> infinity limit. Based on a linearized stability
analysis, we explain some of the puzzling effects of discrete angle
distributions.
