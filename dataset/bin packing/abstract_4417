Acoustic cloaks that make object undetectable to sound waves have potential
applications in a variety of scenarios and have received increasing interests
recently. However, the experimental realization of a three-dimensional (3D)
acoustic cloak that works within broad ranges of operating frequency and
incident angle still remains a challenge despite the paramount importance for
the practical application of cloaking devices. Here we report the design and
experimental demonstration of the first 3D broadband cloak capable of
cancelling the scattering field near curved surfaces. Unlike the ground cloaks
that only work in the presence of a flat boundary, the proposed scheme can
render the invisibility effect for an arbitrarily curved boundary. The designed
cloak simply comprises homogeneous positive-index anisotropic materials, with
parameters completely independent of either the cloaked object or the boundary.
With the flexibility of applying to arbitrary boundaries and the potential of
being extended to yield 3D acoustic illusion effects, our method may take major
a step toward the application of acoustic cloaks in reality and open the avenue
to build other acoustic devices with versatile functionalities.
