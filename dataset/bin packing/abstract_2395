The production of forward jets of transverse momentum $p_T(j)\approx Q$ and
large momentum fraction $x_{jet}\gg x$ probes the onset of BFKL dynamics at
HERA. A full ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ calculation of the inclusive forward jet
cross section is presented and compared to the expected BFKL cross section.
