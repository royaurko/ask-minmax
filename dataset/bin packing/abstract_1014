We study holographic superconductors in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We
consider two particular backgrounds: a $d$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black
hole and a Gauss-Bonnet-AdS soliton. We discuss in detail the effects that the
mass of the scalar field, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the dimensionality of
the AdS space have on the condensation formation and conductivity. We also
study the ratio $\omega_g/T_c $ for various masses of the scalar field and
Gauss-Bonnet couplings.
