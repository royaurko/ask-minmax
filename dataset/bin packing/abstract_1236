Processes of mixing and segregation in a packed bed of granular material
stirred by a periodically moving rectangular bar are simulated by the discrete
element method (DEM). Influence of mechanical properties of the particle
material (dynamic friction coefficient, density, elastic modulus) on the
segregation intensity is researched. Dynamic friction coefficient was found to
have the most noticeable influence to the segregation intensity.
