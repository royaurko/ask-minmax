We investigate the method to measure both the present value of the matter
energy density contrast and the Hubble parameter directly from the measurement
of the linear growth rate which is obtained from the large scale structure of
the Universe. From this method, one can obtain the value of the nuisance
cosmological parameter $\Omo$ (the present value of the matter energy density
contrast) within 3% error if the growth rate measurement can be reached $z >
3.5$. One can also investigate the evolution of the Hubble parameter without
any prior on the value of $H_0$ (the current value of the Hubble parameter).
Especially, estimating the Hubble parameter are insensitive to the errors on
the measurement of the normalized growth rate $f \sigma_8$. However, this
method requires the high $z$ ($z > 3.5$) measurement of the growth rate in
order to get the less than 5% errors on the measurements of $H(z)$ at $z \leq
1.2$ with the redshift bin $\Delta z = 0.2$. Thus, this will be suitable for
the next generation large scale structure galaxy surveys like WFMOS and LSST.
