It has been proposed by Ngan [Phys. Rev. E 68, 011301 (2003)] that the
granular contact force distribution may be analytically derived by minimizing
the analog of a thermodynamic free energy, in this case consisting of the total
potential energy stored in the compressed contacts minus a particular form of
entropy weighted by a parameter. The parameter is identified as a mechanical
temperature. I argue that the particular form of entropy cannot be correct and
as a result the proposed method produces increasingly errant results for
increasing grain rigidity. This trend is evidenced in Ngan's published results
and in other numerical simulations and experiments.
