We calculate the scalar quasinormal modes of warped $AdS_3$ black holes
analytically. We find that in general they are not in agreement with the
prediction of the usual AdS/CFT correspondence. Nevertheless, for the black
hole not deviating far from BTZ black hole, the quasinormal frequencies are
still well consistent with AdS/CFT correspondence.
