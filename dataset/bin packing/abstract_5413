The mass of the top quark is measured in a data set corresponding to 4.6
fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions with centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=7$
TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events consistent with hadronic
decays of top-antitop quark pairs with at least six jets in the final state are
selected. The substantial background from multijetproduction is modelled with
data-driven methods that utilise the number of identified $b$-quark jets and
the transverse momentum of the sixth leading jet,which have minimal
correlation. The top-quark mass is obtained from template fits to the ratio of
three-jet to dijet mass. The three-jet mass is calculated from the three jets
produced in a top-quark decay. Using these three jets the dijet mass is
obtained from the two jets produced in the $W$ boson decay. The top-quark mass
obtained from this fit is thus less sensitive to the uncertainty in the energy
measurement of the jets. A binned likelihood fit yields a top-quark mass of
$m_{t} = 175.1 \pm 1.4$ (stat) $\pm 1.2$ (syst) GeV.
