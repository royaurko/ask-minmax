The cold component of large transverse momentum dilepton production via
semi-coherent two-photon interaction is calculated. The cold contribution is
essential to the dilepton spectra in the soft region for different mass bins.
The results are compared with the PHENIX experimental data at RHIC, and we find
that the modification of semi-coherent two-photon processes is more evident
with the rising dilepton mass bins.
