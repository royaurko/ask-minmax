We examine the dynamics of a baryon number zero lump in the Skyrme picture,
as a model for annihilation in the $\bar{N}N$ system. We find that radiation
propagates at the causal limit as a localized pulse and that the linearized
theory gives a good approximation. Both of these results are contrary to
findings in the Sine-Gordon model.
