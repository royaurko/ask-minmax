Size segregation of granular mixtures which are almost completely packed in a
rotating drum is discussed with an effective simulation and a brief analysis.
Instead of a 3D drum, we simulate 2D rotating thin box which is almost
completely packed with granular mixtures. The phase inversion of radially
segregated pattern which was found in a 3D experiment are qualitatively
reproduced with this simulation, and a brief analysis is followed. Moreover in
our simulation, a global convection appears after radial segregation pattern is
formed, and this convection induces axially segregated pattern.
