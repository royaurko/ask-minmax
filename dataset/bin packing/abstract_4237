Recent CLAS data on the $p\pi^+\pi^-$ electroproduction off protons at
1.3$<$W$<$1.57 GeV and 0.25$<$$Q^{2}$$<$0.6 GeV$^{2}$ have been analyzed using
a meson-baryon phenomenological model. By fitting nine 1-fold differential
cross section data for each $W$ and $Q^{2}$ bin, the charged double pion
electroproduction mechanisms are identified from their manifestations in the
observables. We have extracted the cross sections from amplitudes of each of
the considered isobar channels as well as from their coherent sum. We also
obtained non-resonant partial wave amplitudes of all contributing isobar
channels which could be useful for advancing a complete coupled-channel
analysis of all meson electroproduction data.
