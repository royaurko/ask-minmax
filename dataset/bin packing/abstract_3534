To greatly enhance output of nuclear fusion produced neutrons in a
laser-initiated Coulomb explosion of Deuterium clusters, we propose to
accelerate the resulting ions by a quasi-$dc$ electrical pulse to the energies
where the $D^+ + D$ collision cross-section is the highest. With $D^+$ ions
bombarding then a Deuterium-rich solid-state cathode, this allows one to solve
a few problems simultaneously by (a) completely removing electron cloud
hindering the Coulomb explosion of ionic core, (b) utilizing up to 100% of the
cluster ions to collide with the high-density packed nuclei, and (c) reaching
highly increased cross-section of neutron production in a single $D^+ + D$
collision, in particular by using a multi-layered target. We also consider the
use of E-pulse acceleration for diagnostic purposes.
