How humans make decisions in non-cooperative strategic interactions is a
challenging question. For the fundamental model system of Rock-Paper-Scissors
(RPS) game, classic game theory of infinite rationality predicts the Nash
equilibrium (NE) state with every player randomizing her choices to avoid being
exploited, while evolutionary game theory of bounded rationality in general
predicts persistent cyclic motions, especially for finite populations. However,
as empirical studies on human subjects have been relatively sparse, it is still
a controversial issue as to which theoretical framework is more appropriate to
describe decision making of human subjects. Here we observe population-level
cyclic motions in a laboratory experiment of the discrete-time iterated RPS
game under the traditional random pairwise-matching protocol. The cycling
direction and frequency are not sensitive to the payoff parameter a. This
collective behavior contradicts with the NE theory but it is quantitatively
explained by a microscopic model of win-lose-tie conditional response without
any adjustable parameter. Our theoretical calculations reveal that this new
strategy may offer higher payoffs to individual players in comparison with the
NE mixed strategy, suggesting that high social efficiency is achievable through
optimized conditional response.
