We construct the intermediate coverings of cluster-tilted algebras by
defining the generalized cluster categories. These generalized cluster
categories are Calabi-Yau triangulated categories with fraction CY-dimension
and have also cluster tilting objects (subcategories). Furthermore we study the
representations of these intermediate coverings of cluster-tilted algebras.
