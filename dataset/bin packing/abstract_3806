We present a preliminary measurement of the inclusive jet cross-sections
based on an integrated luminosity of 378 pb^{-1} acquired with the D0 detector
between 2002 and 2004 at a center of mass energy of \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV and a
measurement of azimuthal dijet decorrelations based on an integrated luminosity
of 150 pb^{-1}. The cross section measurements are based on an iterative cone
algorithm with a cone size of R=0.7. They are performed in two rapidity bins
between 0.0 and 0.8. The measurements are in good agreement with next to
leading order calculations.
  The azimuthal angle between the two leading jets is sensitive to higher order
QCD effects. The measurement of dijet azimuthal decorrelations therefore probes
these effects without explicitly reconstructing more than two jets.
  Except for large azimuthal angles where soft effects are important the
measurements are well described by the next to leading order perturbation
theory.
