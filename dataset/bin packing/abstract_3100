For any integer $\rho \geq 1$ and for any prime power q, the explicit
construction of a infinite family of completely regular (and completely
transitive) q-ary codes with d=3 and with covering radius $\rho$ is given. The
intersection array is also computed. Under the same conditions, the explicit
construction of an infinite family of q-ary uniformly packed codes (in the wide
sense) with covering radius $\rho$, which are not completely regular, is also
given. In both constructions the Kronecker product is the basic tool that has
been used.
