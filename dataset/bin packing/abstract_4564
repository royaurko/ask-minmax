We provide a prescription for setting initial conditions for cosmological
N-body simulations, which simultaneously employ Lagrangian meshes (`particles')
and Eulerian grids (`fields'). Our description is based on coordinate systems
in arbitrary geometry, and can therefore be used in any metric theory of
gravity. We apply our prescription to a choice of Effective Field Theory of
Modified Gravity, and show how already in the linear regime, particle
trajectories are curved. For some viable models of modified gravity, the Dark
Matter trajectories are affected at the level of 5% at Mpc scales. Moreover, we
show initial conditions for a simulation where a scalar modification of gravity
is modelled in a Lagrangian particle-like description.
