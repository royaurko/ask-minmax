We construct self-dual string soliton solutions in $AdS_4\times
  S^7$ spacetime, starting from the covariant equations of motion of M5-brane.
We study the properties of the solutions and find that their action are
linearized, indicating the BPS nature of the solutions, and they have the same
electric and magnetic charge. The straight string soliton solution represents
the configuration of the membranes ending on M5-brane with a straight string
intersection, and it behaves like the spiky solution in flat spacetime. The
spherical string soliton solution, which could be related to the straight one
by a conformal transformation, represents the membranes ending on M5-brane with
a spherical intersection.
