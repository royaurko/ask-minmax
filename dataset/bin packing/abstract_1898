Cell association scheme determines which base station (BS) and mobile user
(MU) should be associated with and also plays a significant role in determining
the average data rate a MU can achieve in heterogeneous networks. However, the
explosion of digital devices and the scarcity of spectra collectively force us
to carefully re-design cell association scheme which was kind of taken for
granted before. To address this, we develop a new cell association scheme in
heterogeneous networks based on joint consideration of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) which a MU experiences and the
traffic load of candidate BSs1. MUs and BSs in each tier are modeled as several
independent Poisson point processes (PPPs) and all channels experience
independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading. Data rate
ratio and traffic load ratio distributions are derived to obtain the tier
association probability and the average ergodic MU data rate. Through numerical
results, We find that our proposed cell association scheme outperforms cell
range expansion (CRE) association scheme. Moreover, results indicate that
allocating small sized and high-density BSs will improve spectral efficiency if
using our proposed cell association scheme in heterogeneous networks.
