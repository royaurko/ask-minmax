The measurement of forward-backward asymmetry in the top and anti-top quark
($t \bar{t}$) production has been recently reconfirmed by the CDF Collaboration
and shows a more than $3\sigma$ deviation from the Standard Model(SM)
prediction in the large $t \bar{t}$ invariant mass region. Models with new
W$^{\prime}$ or Z$^{\prime}$ bosons have been invoked to explain this
deviation. In the context of these models we perform a $\chi^2$ analysis with
all the available experimental numbers in different $\Delta Y$ and $M_{t
\bar{t}}$ bins. We show that for the $Z^{\prime}$ model the region of parameter
space which explain the Tevatron asymmetry can be probed in the same sign top
production channel by Tevatron itself. Moreover, we consider a recently
proposed observable, the one sided forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{OFB}$) at
the LHC and conclude that both the W$^{\prime}$ and Z$^{\prime}$ models can
lead to sizable $A_{OFB}$ even at the LHC running at a center of mass energy of
7 TeV for the model parameters consistent with the Tevatron measurements.
