For polar codes with short-to-medium code length, list successive
cancellation decoding is used to achieve a good error-correcting performance.
However, list pruning in the current list decoding is based on the sorting
strategy and its timing complexity is high. This results in a long decoding
latency for large list size. In this work, aiming at a low-latency list
decoding implementation, a double thresholding algorithm is proposed for a fast
list pruning. As a result, with a negligible performance degradation, the list
pruning delay is greatly reduced. Based on the double thresholding, a
low-latency list decoding architecture is proposed and implemented using a UMC
90nm CMOS technology. Synthesis results show that, even for a large list size
of 16, the proposed low-latency architecture achieves a decoding throughput of
220 Mbps at a frequency of 641 MHz.
