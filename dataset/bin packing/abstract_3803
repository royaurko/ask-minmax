We report on measurements of event-by-event charge fluctuations in
$\pi^{+}\rp$ and $\rK^{+}\rp$ collisions at 250 GeV/$c$. The dependence of
these fluctuations on the size of the rapidity windows are presented for the
first time in the full phase space domain. The corrections for the influence of
global charge conservation and leading-particle stopping are tested by the
data. The discrepancy due to incomplete correction given by STAR and PHENIX are
estimated. The dependence of the fluctuations on the position of the rapidity
bin and on the multiplicity at different rapidity windows are also presented.
