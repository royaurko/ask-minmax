We report ultra-high density assembly of aligned single walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) two dimensional arrays via ac dielectrophoresis using high
quality surfactant free and stable SWNT solutions. After optimization of
frequency and trapping time, we can reproducibly control the linear density of
the SWNT between prefabricated electrodes from 0.5 SWNT/\mum to more than 30
SWNT /\mum by tuning the concentration of the nanotubes in the solution. Our
maximum density of 30 SWNT/\mum is the highest for aligned arrays via any
solution processing technique reported so far. Further increase of SWNT
concentration results dense array with multiple layers. We discuss how the
orientation and density of the nanotubes vary with concentrations and channel
lengths. Electrical measurement data show that the densely packed aligned
arrays have low sheet resistances. Selective removal of metallic SWNTs via
controlled electrical breakdown produced field effect transistors (FET) with
high current on-off ratio. Ultra-high density alignment reported here will have
important implications in fabricating high quality devices for digital and
analog electronics.
