We present the complete NLO contributions to the pp -> e^+ v_e mu^- vbar_m b
bbar + X process in the four flavour scheme, i.e. with massive b quarks, and
its contribution to the H -> WW -> llvv measurement in the 1-jet bin at the
LHC. This background process includes top pair, single top and non-top
quark-resonant contributions. The uncertainty at NLO from renormalisation and
factorisation scale dependence is about +30% -20%. We show that the NLO
corrections are relatively small, and that separating this background in top
pair, Wt and b-quark associated llvv is a fair approximation.
