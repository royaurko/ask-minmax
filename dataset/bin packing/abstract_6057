In this work we introduce a new way of binning sunspot group data with the
purpose of better understanding the impact of the solar cycle on sunspot
properties and how this defined the characteristics of the extended minimum of
cycle 23. Our approach assumes that the statistical properties of sunspots are
completely determined by the strength of the underlying large-scale field and
have no additional time dependencies. We use the amplitude of the cycle at any
given moment (something we refer to as activity level) as a proxy for the
strength of this deep-seated magnetic field.
  We find that the sunspot size distribution is composed of two populations:
one population of groups and active regions and a second population of pores
and ephemeral regions. When fits are performed at periods of different activity
level, only the statistical properties of the former population, the active
regions, is found to vary.
  Finally, we study the relative contribution of each component (small-scale
versus large-scale) to solar magnetism. We find that when hemispheres are
treated separately, almost every one of the past 12 solar minima reaches a
point where the main contribution to magnetism comes from the small-scale
component. However, due to asymmetries in cycle phase, this state is very
rarely reached by both hemispheres at the same time. From this we infer that
even though each hemisphere did reach the magnetic baseline, from a
heliospheric point of view the minimum of cycle 23 was not as deep as it could
have been.
