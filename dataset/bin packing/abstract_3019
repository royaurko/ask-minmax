Predictions for the ratio $M_W/m_t$ arise in top condensation models from
different methods. One type of prediction stems from Pagels--Stokar relations
based on the use of Ward Identities in the calculation of the \GB decay
constants and expresses $M_W$ in terms of integrals containing the dynamically
generated mass function $\Sigma_t(p^2)$. Another type of prediction emerges
from the renormalization group equations via infrared quasi--fixed--points of
the running top quark Yukawa coupling. We demonstrate in this paper that in the
limit of a high cutoff these two methods lead to the same predictions for
$M_W/m_t$ and $M_W/M_H$ in lowest loop order.
