The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect is the inverse Compton-scattering of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons by hot electrons in the intervening
gas throughout the universe. The effect has a distinct spectral signature that
allows its separation from other signals in multifrequency CMB datasets. Using
CMB anisotropies measured at three frequencies by the BOOMERanG 2003 flight we
constrain SZ fluctuations in the 10 arcmin to 1 deg angular range. Propagating
errors and potential systematic effects through simulations, we obtain an
overall upper limit of 15.3 uK (2 sigma) for rms SZ fluctuations in a broad bin
between multipoles of of 250 and 1200 at the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) end of the
spectrum. When combined with other CMB anisotropy and SZ measurements, we find
that the local universe normalization of the density perturbations is
sigma-8(SZ) < 0.96 at the 95% confidence level, consistent with sigma-8
determined from primordial perturbations.
