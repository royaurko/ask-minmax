We analyze the 1258-day Super-Kamiokande day and night solar neutrino energy
spectra with various $\chi^2$ definitions. The best-fit lies in the LMA region
at $(\Delta m^2, tan^2 \theta)=(5.01\times 10^{-5} eV^2, 0.60)$, independently
of whether systematic errors are included in the $\chi^2$-definition. We
compare the exclusion and allowed regions from the different definitions and
choose the most suitable definition to predict the regions from SNO at the end
of three years of data accumulation. We first work under the assumption that
Super-Kamiokande sees a flux-suppressed flat energy spectrum. Then, we consider
the possibility of each one of the three MSW regions being the solution to the
solar neutrino problem. We find that the exclusion and allowed regions for the
flat spectrum hypothesis and the LMA and LOW solutions are alike. In three
years, we expect SNO to find very similar regions to that obtained by
Super-Kamiokande. We evaluate whether the zenith angle distribution at SNO with
optimum binning will add anything to the analysis of the day and night spectra;
for comparison, we show the results of our analysis of the 1258-day zenith
angle distribution from Super-Kamiokande, for which the best-fit parameters are
$(\Delta m^2, tan^2 \theta)=(5.01\times 10^{-5} eV^2, 0.56)$.
