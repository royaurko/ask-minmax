We employ 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations to study the influence of
cholesterol on structural and dynamic properties of
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers in the fluid phase. The effects
of the cholesterol content on the bilayer structure are considered by varying
the cholesterol concentration between 0 and 50%. We concentrate on the free
area in the membrane and investigate quantities that are likely to be affected
by changes in the free area and free volume properties. It is found that
cholesterol has a strong impact on the free area properties of the bilayer. The
changes in the amount of free area are shown to be intimately related to
alterations in molecular packing, ordering of phospholipid tails, and
compressibility. Further, the behavior of the lateral diffusion of both DPPC
and cholesterol molecules with an increasing amount of cholesterol can in part
be understood in terms of free area. Summarizing, our results highlight the
central role of free area in comprehending the structural and dynamic
properties of membranes containing cholesterol.
