We study the interacting dark energy model with time varying dark energy
equation of state. We examine the stability in the perturbation formalism and
the degeneracy among the coupling between dark sectors, the time-dependent dark
energy equation of state and dark matter abundance in the cosmic microwave
background radiation. Further we discuss the possible ways to break such
degeneracy by doing global fitting using the latest observational data and we
get a tight constraint on the interaction between dark sectors.
