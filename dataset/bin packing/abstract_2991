The temperature dependence of dark conductivity at low temperatures (300-15
K) was studied on a wide microstructural range of well-characterized highly
crystallized single phase undoped microcrystalline silicon samples. Our study
reveals two different temperature dependences in films having different
microstructures. A T^(-0.5) dependence of dark conductivity supporting
tunneling of carriers between neighboring conducting crystals, similar to
percolation-hopping model proposed for metal-insulator composite systems, is
seen in microcrystalline silicon films that are fully crystallized with tightly
packed large columnar grains and negligible density deficit. A
T^(-0.25)dependence of dark conductivity supporting variable range hopping
model with an exponential tail state distribution in the gap is seen in
microcrystalline silicon films having mostly small crystalline grains, low
degree of conglomeration and relatively higher density deficit. The correlation
between the microstructural attributes and conductivity behavior is discussed
by analyzing the physical plausibility of the hopping parameters and material
properties derived by applying different transport models.
