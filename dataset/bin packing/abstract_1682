In source coding, either with or without side information at the decoder, the
ultimate performance can be achieved by means of random binning. Structured
binning into cosets of performing channel codes has been successfully employed
in practical applications. In this letter it is formally shown that various
convolutional- and turbo-syndrome decoding algorithms proposed in literature
lead in fact to the same estimate. An equivalent implementation is also
delineated by directly tackling syndrome decoding as a maximum a posteriori
probability problem and solving it by means of iterative message-passing. This
solution takes advantage of the exact same structures and algorithms used by
the conventional channel decoder for the code according to which the syndrome
is formed.
