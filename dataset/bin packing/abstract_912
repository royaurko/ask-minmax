We propose a method for effectively upscaling incompressible viscous flow in
large random polydispersed sphere packings: the emphasis of this method is on
the determination of the forces applied on the solid particles by the fluid.
Pore bodies and their connections are defined locally through a regular
Delaunay triangulation of the packings. Viscous flow equations are upscaled at
the pore level, and approximated with a finite volume numerical scheme. We
compare numerical simulations of the proposed method to detailed finite element
(FEM) simulations of the Stokes equations for assemblies of 8 to 200 spheres. A
good agreement is found both in terms of forces exerted on the solid particles
and effective permeability coefficients.
