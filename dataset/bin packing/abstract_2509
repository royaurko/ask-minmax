Issues of Frequency-to-Amplitude modulation (FM-to-AM) conversion occurred in
phase-modulated third-harmonic generation (THG) process are investigated. An
expression about group-velocity is theoretically derived to suppress the
FM-to-AM conversion, which appears to be dependant on the ratio of modulation
depth of fundamental to second-harmonic when given the same modulation
frequencies of them. Simulation results indicate that the induced AM in THG
process can be suppressed effectively when the expression about group-velocity
is satisfied.
