By generalizing the measurements on the game experiments of mixed strategy
Nash equilibrium, we study the dynamical pattern in a representative dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE). The DSGE model describes the
entanglements of the three variables (output gap [$y$], inflation [$\pi$] and
nominal interest rate [$r$]) which can be presented in 3D phase space. We find
that, even though the trajectory of $\pi\!-\!y\!-\!r$ in phase space appears
highly stochastic, it can be visualized and quantified. It exhibits as
clockwise cycles, counterclockwise cycles and weak cycles, respectively, when
projected onto $\pi\!-\!y$, $y\!-\!r$ and $r\!-\!\pi$ phase planes. We find
also that empirical data of United State (1960-2013) significantly exhibit same
cycles. The resemblance between the cycles in general equilibrium and the
cycles in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium suggest that, there generally exists
dynamical fine structures accompanying with equilibrium. The fine structure,
describing the entanglement of the non-equilibrium (the constantly deviating
from the equilibrium), displays as endless cycles.
