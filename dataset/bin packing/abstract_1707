Finding and sampling multiple reaction channels for molecular transitions
remains an important challenge in physical chemistry. Here we show that the
weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling method can readily sample multiple
channels. In a first test, both the WE and transition path sampling methods are
applied to two-dimensional model potentials. The comparison explains why the
weighted ensemble approach will not be trapped in one channel. The WE approach
is then used to sample the full transition path ensemble in implicitly solvated
alanine dipeptide at two different temperatures. The ensembles are of
sufficient quality to permit quantification of the fractional importance of
each channel, even at T=300K when brute-force simulation is prohibitively
expensive.
