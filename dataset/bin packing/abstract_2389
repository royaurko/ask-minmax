Open heavy flavour production at $e^+e^-$ colliders in deeply inelastic
$e\gamma$ scattering has an interesting feature: the structure function
$F_2(x,Q^2)$ for this process is calculable for $x>0.01$, and is essentially
proportional to the gluon density in the photon for smaller $x$ values. We give
estimates for event rates at LEP2 and a Next Linear Collider in $x,Q^2$ bins,
and present differential distributions in the transverse momentum and rapidity
of the heavy quark for the case of charm. We include all next-to-leading-order
QCD corrections, and find theoretical uncertainties are well under control.
