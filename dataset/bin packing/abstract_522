This paper derives an improved sphere-packing (ISP) bound targeting codes of
short to moderate block lengths. We first review the 1967 sphere-packing (SP67)
bound for discrete memoryless channels, and a recent improvement by Valembois
and Fossorier. These concepts are used for the derivation of a new lower bound
on the decoding error probability (referred to as the ISP bound) which is
uniformly tighter than the SP67 bound and its recent improved version. Under a
mild condition, the ISP bound is applicable to general memoryless channels, and
some of its applications are exemplified. Its tightness is studied by comparing
it with bounds on the ML decoding error probability. It is exemplified that the
ISP bound suggests an interesting alternative to the 1959 sphere-packing (SP59)
bound of Shannon for the Gaussian channel, especially for digital modulations
of high spectral efficiency.
