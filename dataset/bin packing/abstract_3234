Suspensions are of wide interest and form the basis for many smart fluids.
For most suspensions, the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate, i.e.
they shear thin. Few are reported to do the opposite, i.e. shear thicken,
despite the longstanding expectation that shear thickening is a generic type of
suspension behavior. Here we resolve this apparent contradiction. We
demonstrate that shear thickening can be masked by a yield stress and can be
recovered when the yield stress is decreased below a threshold. We show the
generality of this argument and quantify the threshold in rheology experiments
where we control yield stresses arising from a variety of sources, such as
attractions from particle surface interactions, induced dipoles from applied
electric and magnetic fields, as well as confinement of hard particles at high
packing fractions. These findings open up possibilities for the design of smart
suspensions that combine shear thickening with electro- or magnetorheological
response.
