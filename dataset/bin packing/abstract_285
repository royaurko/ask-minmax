Moser asked whether the collection of rectangles of dimensions 1 x 1/2, 1/2 x
1/3, 1/3 x 1/4, ..., whose total area equals 1, can be packed into the unit
square without overlap, and whether the collection of squares of side lengths
1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... can be packed without overlap into a rectangle of area
pi^2/6-1. Computational investigations have been made into packing these
collections into squares of side length 1+epsilon and rectangles of area
pi^2/6-1+epsilon, respectively, and one can consider the apparently weaker
question whether such packings are possible for every positive number epsilon.
In this paper we establish a general theorem on sequences of geometrical
packings that implies in particular that the ``for every epsilon'' versions of
these two problems are actually equivalent to the original tiling problems.
