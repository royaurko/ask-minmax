The polarization of inclusive Upsilon(nS) at the Fermilab Tevatron is
calculated within the nonrelativistic QCD factorization framework. We use a
recent determination of the NRQCD matrix elements from fitting the CDF data on
bottomonium production from Run IB of the Tevatron. The result for the
polarization of Upsilon(1S) integrated over the transverse momentum bin 8 < p_T
< 20 GeV is consistent with a recent measurement by the CDF Collaboration. The
transverse polarization of Upsilon(1S) is predicted to increase steadily for
p_T greater than about 10 GeV. The Upsilon(2S) and Upsilon(3S) are predicted to
have significantly larger transverse polarizations than Upsilon(1S).
