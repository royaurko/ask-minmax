Packing density is a permutation occurrence statistic which describes the
maximal number of permutations of a given type that can occur in another
permutation. In this article we focus on containment of sets of permutations.
Although this question has been tangentially considered previously, this is the
first systematic study of it. We find the packing density for various special
sets of permutations and study permutation and pattern co-occurrence.
