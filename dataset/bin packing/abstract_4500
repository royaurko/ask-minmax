We discuss possible interpretations of the 37 high energy neutrino events
observed by the IceCube experiment in the South Pole. We examine the
possibility to explain the observed neutrino spectrum exclusively by the decays
of a heavy long-lived particle of mass in the PeV range. We compare this with
the standard scenario, namely, a single power-law spectrum related to neutrinos
produced by astrophysical sources and a viable hybrid situation where the
spectrum is a product of two components: a power-law and the long-lived
particle decays. We present a simple extension of the Standard Model that could
account for the heavy particle decays that are needed in order to explain the
data. We show that the current data equally supports all above scenarios and
try to evaluate the exposure needed in order to falsify them in the future.
