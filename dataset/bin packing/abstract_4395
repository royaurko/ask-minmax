The performance of spectral clustering can be considerably improved via
regularization, as demonstrated empirically in Amini et. al (2012). Here, we
provide an attempt at quantifying this improvement through theoretical
analysis. Under the stochastic block model (SBM), and its extensions, previous
results on spectral clustering relied on the minimum degree of the graph being
sufficiently large for its good performance. By examining the scenario where
the regularization parameter $\tau$ is large we show that the minimum degree
assumption can potentially be removed. As a special case, for an SBM with two
blocks, the results require the maximum degree to be large (grow faster than
$\log n$) as opposed to the minimum degree.
  More importantly, we show the usefulness of regularization in situations
where not all nodes belong to well-defined clusters. Our results rely on a
`bias-variance'-like trade-off that arises from understanding the concentration
of the sample Laplacian and the eigen gap as a function of the regularization
parameter. As a byproduct of our bounds, we propose a data-driven technique
\textit{DKest} (standing for estimated Davis-Kahan bounds) for choosing the
regularization parameter. This technique is shown to work well through
simulations and on a real data set.
