We report the discovery of 152 new high proper motion systems (mu >= 0.4"/yr)
in the southern sky (Declination = -47 degrees to 00 degrees) brighter than
UKST plate R_{59F} =16.5 via our SuperCOSMOS-RECONS (SCR) search. This paper
complements Paper XII in The Solar Neighborhood series, which covered the
region from Declination = -90 degrees to -47 degrees and discussed all 147 new
systems from the southernmost phase of the search. Among the total of 299
systems from both papers, there are 148 (71 in Paper XII, 77 in this paper) new
systems moving faster than 0.5"/yr that are additions to the classic ``LHS''
(Luyten Half Second) sample. These constitute an 8% increase in the sample of
all stellar systems with mu >= 0.5"/yr in the southern sky.
  As in Paper XII, distance estimates are provided for the systems reported
here based upon a combination of photographic plate magnitudes and 2MASS
photometry, assuming all stars are on the main sequence. Two SCR systems from
the portion of the sky included in this paper are anticipated to be within 10
pc, and an additional 23 are within 25 pc. In total, the results presented in
Paper XII and here for this SCR sweep of the entire southern sky include five
new systems within 10 pc and 38 more between 10 and 25 pc. The largest number
of nearby systems have been found in the slowest proper motion bin, 0.6"/yr >
mu >= 0.4"/yr, indicating that there may be a large population of low proper
motion systems very near the Sun.
