Fixed-complexity Sphere Decoder (FSD) is a recently proposed technique for
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) detection. It has several outstanding
features such as constant throughput and large potential parallelism, which
makes it suitable for efficient VLSI implementation. However, to our best
knowledge, no VLSI implementation of FSD has been reported in the literature,
although some FPGA prototypes of FSD with pipeline architecture have been
developed. These solutions achieve very high throughput but at very high cost
of hardware resources, making them impractical in real applications. In this
paper, we present a novel four-nodes-per-cycle parallel architecture of FSD,
with a breadth-first processing that allows for short critical path. The
implementation achieves a throughput of 213.3 Mbps at 400 MHz clock frequency,
at a cost of 0.18 mm2 Silicon area on 0.13{\mu}m CMOS technology. The proposed
solution is much more economical compared with the existing FPGA
implementations, and very suitable for practicl applications because of its
balanced performance and hardware-complexity; moreover it has the flexibility
to be expanded into an eight-nodes-per-cycle version in order to double the
throughput.
