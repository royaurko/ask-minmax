We answer the questions raised by Donev, Torquato, Stillinger, and Connelly
in their "Comment on "Jamming at zero temperature and zero applied stress: The
epitome of disorder.' " We emphasize that we follow a fundamentally different
approach than they have done to reinterpret random close packing in terms of
the "maximally random jammed" framework. We define the "maximally random jammed
packing fraction" to be where the largest number of initial states, chosen
completely randomly, have relaxed final states at the jamming threshold in the
thermodynamic limit. Thus, we focus on an ensemble of states at the jamming
threshold, while DTSC are interested in determining the amount of order and
degree of jamming for a particular configuration. We also argue that
soft-particle systems are as "clean" as those using hard spheres for studying
jammed packings and point out the benefits of using soft potentials.
