In the earlier works \cite{Sz06-1}, \cite{Sz06-2}, \cite{Sz13-3} and
\cite{Sz13-4} we have investigated the the densest packings and the least dense
coverings by congruent hyperballs (hyperspheres) to the regular prism tilings
in the $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\HYN$ ($n \in \mathbb{N},~n \ge 3)$.
  In this paper we study the problem of hyperball (hypersphere) packings in the
$3$-dimensional hyperbolic space. We describe to each saturated hyperball
packing a procedure to get a decomposition of the 3-dimensional hyperbolic
space $\HYP$ into truncated tetrahedra. Therefore, in order to get a density
upper bound to hyperball packings it is sufficient to determine the density
upper bound of hyperball packings in truncated simplices. Thus we study the
hyperball packings in truncated simplices and prove that if the truncated
tetrahedron is regular, then the density of the densest packing is $\approx
0.86338$ which is larger than the B\"or\"oczky-Florian density upper bound, but
these hyperball packing configuration can not be extended to the entirety of
hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$. Moreover, we prove that the known densest
hyperball packing relating to the regular prism tilings can be realized by
regular truncated tetrahedron tiling, as well \cite{Sz06-1}.
