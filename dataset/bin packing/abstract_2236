We study experimentally the nonequilibrium phase behaviour of a horizontal
monolayer of macroscopic rods. The motion of the rods in two dimensions is
driven by vibrations in the vertical direction. Aside from the control
variables of packing fraction and aspect ratio that are typically explored in
molecular liquid crystalline systems, due to the macroscopic size of the
particles we are also able to investigate the effect of the precise shape of
the particle on the steady states of this driven system. We find that the shape
plays an important role in determining the nature of the orientational ordering
at high packing fraction. Cylindrical particles show substantial tetratic
correlations over a range of aspect ratios where spherocylinders have
previously been shown by Bates et al (JCP 112, 10034 (2000)) to undergo
transitions between isotropic and nematic phases. Particles that are thinner at
the ends (rolling pins or bails) show nematic ordering over the same range of
aspect ratios, with a well-established nematic phase at large aspect ratio and
a defect-ridden nematic state with large-scale swirling motion at small aspect
ratios. Finally, long-grain, basmati rice, whose geometry is intermediate
between the two shapes above, shows phases with strong indications of smectic
order.
