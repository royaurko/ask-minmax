We propose a physical mechanism to explain the crystal symmetries found in
macromolecular and supramolecular micellar materials. We argue that the packing
entropy of the hard micellar cores is frustrated by the entropic interaction of
their brush-like coronas. The latter interaction is treated as a surface effect
between neighboring Voronoi cells. The observed crystal structures correspond
to the Kelvin and Weaire-Phelan minimal foams. We show that these structures
are stable for reasonable areal entropy densities.
