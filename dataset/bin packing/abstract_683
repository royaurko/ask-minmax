We identify arches in a bed of granular disks generated by a molecular
dynamic-type simulation. We use the history of the deposition of the particles
to identify the supporting contacts of each particle. Then, arches are defined
as sets of mutually stable disks. Different packings generated through tapping
are analyzed. The possibility of identifying arches from the static structure
of a deposited bed, without any information on the history of the deposition,
is discussed.
