In two recent articles Salazar and Brenig question the validity of kinetic
theory for granular gases and fluids, on the based of a supposedly exact
hierarchy of coupled equations for the velocity moments, which the contributors
derive from the BBGKY-hierarchy. Their derivation contains several errors,
which are exposed. Moreover, they support their findings with results from
direct monte carlo simulation (DSMC) of the Boltzmann equation, which
supposedly show that Haff's homogeneous cooling law only holds for times
shorter than one mean free time. However, their DSMC results have no physical
significance as they are carried out at a density, twice close packing.
