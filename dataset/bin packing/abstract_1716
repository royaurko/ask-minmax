We compare two mechanisms for the dissociation of heavy mesons in an infinite
quark-gluon plasma: dynamic Debye screening and multiple scattering. Using the
uncertainty principle inspired by a Schrodinger-like equation, we find that the
criterion a_B\simeq1/\mu\simeq 1/(\alpha_{eff}^{1/2}T) with
\alpha_{eff}\equiv\alpha(N_c+{N_f\over2}) is parametrically true both for the
dissociation of fast moving heavy mesons with a size a_B due to dynamic Debye
screening as well as for mesons at rest in the medium. In contrast, we find
that the criterion for the dissociation of heavy mesons due to uncorrelated
multiple scattering is parametrically 1/a_B \simeq
[\gamma\alpha_{eff}\ln{1/\alpha_{eff}}]^{1/3}T. Therefore, multiple scattering
is a more efficient mechanism for the dissociation of heavy mesons in an
infinite hot plasma.
