Gauge invariance in soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) is discussed in
regular (covariant) and singular (light-cone) gauges. It is argued that SCET,
as it stands, is not capable to define in a gauge invariant way certain
non-perturbative matrix elements that are an integral part of many
factorization theorems. Those matrix elements involve two quark or gluon fields
separated not only in light-cone direction but also in the transverse one. This
observation limits the range of applicability of SCET. To remedy this we argue
that one needs to introduce a new Wilson line as part of SCET formalism, that
we call T. This Wilson line depends only on the transverse component of the
gluon field. As such it is a new feature to the SCET formalism and it
guarantees gauge invariance of the non-perturbative matrix elements in both
classes of gauges.
