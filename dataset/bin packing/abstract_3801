This paper describes preliminary results on the inclusive process b --> s
gamma obtained from 20.7 fb^-1 of data recorded with the BaBar detector during
1999-2000. Signal event yields are found from a combination of twelve exclusive
decay channels after subtracting continuum and BBbar backgrounds. Cross-feed
from incorrectly reconstructed b --> s gamma events is also removed. Branching
fractions in bins of hadronic mass are calculated using corrected Monte Carlo
signal efficiencies; this is equivalent to measuring the gamma energy spectrum.
We measure the first moment of the gamma energy spectrum constraining the HQET
parameter LambdaBar = (0.37 +/- 0.09 (stat) +/- 0.07 (syst) +/- 0.10 (model))
GeV/c^2. A fit to the hadronic mass spectrum gives B(b --> s gamma) = (4.3 +/-
0.5 (stat) +/- 0.8 (syst) +/- 1.3 (model))x 10^-4 for the inclusive branching
fraction. We also constrain the HQET parameter lambda_1.
