An exact description of the complete jamming landscape is developed for a
system of hard discs of diameter $\sigma$, confined between two lines separated
by a distance $1+\sqrt{3/4} < H/\sigma < 2$. By considering all possible local
packing arrangements, the generalized ensemble partition function of jammed
states is obtained using the transfer matrix method, which allows us to
calculate the configurational entropy and the equation of state for the
packings. Exploring the relationship between structural order and packing
density, we find that the geometric frustration between local packing
environments plays an important role in determining the density distribution of
jammed states and that structural "randomness" is a non-monotonic function of
packing density. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the properties of the
equilibrium liquid are closely related to those of the landscape.
