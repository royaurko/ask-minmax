This paper illustrates the measurement and the applications of the
observable, entropy production rate (EPR), in human subject social interaction
systems. To this end, we show (1) how to test the minimax randomization model
with experimental economics' 2$\times$2 games data and with the Wimbledon
Tennis data; (2) how to identify the Edgeworth price cycle in experimental
market data; and (3) the relationship within EPR and motion in data. As a
result, in human subject social interaction systems, EPR can be measured
practically and can be employed to test models and to search for facts
efficiently.
