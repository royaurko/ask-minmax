We define Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection functors in the cluster
categories of hereditary algebras. They are triangle equivalences which provide
a natural quiver realization of the "truncated simple reflections" on the set
of almost positive roots $\Phi_{\ge -1}$ associated to a finite dimensional
semisimple Lie algebra. Combining with the tilting theory in cluster categories
developed in [4], we give a unified interpretation via quiver representations
for the generalized associahedra associated to the root systems of all Dynkin
types (a simply-laced or non-simply-laced). This confirms the conjecture 9.1 in
[4] in all Dynkin types.
