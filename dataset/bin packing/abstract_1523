We perform a frequentist analysis of q^2-dependent B-> K*(->Kpi)ll angular
observables at large recoil, aiming at bridging the gap between current
theoretical analyses and the actual experimental measurements. We focus on the
most appropriate set of observables to measure and on the role of the
q^2-binning. We highlight the importance of the observables P_i exhibiting a
limited sensitivity to soft form factors for the search for New Physics
contributions. We compute predictions for these binned observables in the
Standard Model, and we compare them with their experimental determination
extracted from recent LHCb data. Analyzing b->s and b->sll transitions within
four different New Physics scenarios, we identify several New Physics benchmark
points which can be discriminated through the measurement of P_i observables
with a fine q^2-binning. We emphasise the importance (and risks) of using
observables with (un)suppressed dependence on soft form factors for the search
of New Physics, which we illustrate by the different size of hadronic
uncertainties attached to two related observables (P_1 and S_3). We illustrate
how the q^2-dependent angular observables measured in several bins can help to
unravel New Physics contributions to B-> K*(->Kpi)ll, and show the
extraordinary constraining power that the clean observables will have in the
near future. We provide semi-numerical expressions for these observables as
functions of the relevant Wilson coefficients at the low scale.
