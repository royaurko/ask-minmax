In this paper, we give a Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis of the free dendriform
algebra as a quotient algebra of an $L$-algebra. As applications, we obtain a
normal form of the free dendriform algebra. Moreover, Hilbert series and
Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of finitely generated free dendriform algebras are
obtained.
