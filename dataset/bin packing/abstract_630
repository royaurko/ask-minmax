Based on the notion of a construction process consisting of the stepwise
addition of particles to the pure fluid, a discrete model for the apparent
viscosity as well as for the maximum packing fraction of polydisperse
suspensions of spherical, non-colloidal particles is derived. The model
connects the approaches by Bruggeman and Farris and is valid for large size
ratios of consecutive particle classes during the construction process,
appearing to be the first model consistently describing polydisperse volume
fractions and maximum packing fraction within a single approach. In that
context, the consistent inclusion of the maximum packing fraction into
effective medium models is discussed. Furthermore, new generalized forms of the
well-known Quemada and Krieger equations allowing for the choice of a
second-order Taylor coefficient for the volume fraction ($\phi^2$-coefficient),
found by asymptotic matching, are proposed. The model for the maximum packing
fraction as well as the complete viscosity model are compared to experimental
data from the literature showing good agreement. As a result, the new model is
shown to replace the empirical Sudduth model for large diameter ratios. The
extension of the model to the case of small size ratios is left for future
work.
