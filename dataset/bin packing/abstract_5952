In this catalog we present the updated set of spectral analyses of GRBs
detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) during its first four years
of operation. It contains two types of spectra, time-integrated spectral fits
and spectral fits at the brightest time bin, from 943 triggered GRBs. Four
different spectral models were fitted to the data, resulting in a compendium of
more than 7500 spectra. The analysis was performed similarly, but not
identically to Goldstein et al. 2012. All 487 GRBs from the first two years
have been re-fitted using the same methodology as that of the 456 GRBs in years
three and four. We describe, in detail, our procedure and criteria for the
analysis, and present the results in the form of parameter distributions both
for the observer-frame and rest-frame quantities. The data files containing the
complete results are available from the High-Energy Astrophysics Science
Archive Research Center (HEASARC).
