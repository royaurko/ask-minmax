We measure the two-point density correlations and Voronoi cell distributions
of cyclically sheared granular spheres obtained with a fluorescence technique
and compare them with random packing of frictionless spheres. We find that the
radial distribution function $g(r)$ is captured by the Percus-Yevick equation
for initial volume fraction $\phi=0.59$. However, small but systematic
deviations are observed because of the splitting of the second peak as $\phi$
is increased towards random close packing. The distribution of the Voronoi free
volumes deviates from postulated $\Gamma$ distributions, and the orientational
order metric $Q_6$ shows disorder compared to numerical results reported for
frictionless spheres. Overall, these measures show significant similarity of
random packing of granular and frictionless spheres, but some systematic
differences as well.
