We relate properties of nearest-neighbour resonating valence bond (nnRVB)
wavefunctions for $SU(g)$ spin systems on two dimensional bipartite lattices to
those of fully-packed classical dimer models with potential energy $V$ on the
same lattice. We define a cluster expansion of $V$ in terms of $n$-body
potentials $V_n$, which are recursively determined from the nnRVB wavefunction
on {\em finite subgraphs} of the original lattice. The magnitude of the
$n$-body interaction $V_n$ ($n>1$) is of order ${\mathcal O}(g^{-(n-1)})$ for
small $g^{-1}$, while $V_1$ reduces to a constant due to the fully-packed
nature of the model. At leading non-trivial order on the square lattice, the
interacting dimer model only has two-body interactions $V_2(g)$ that favour two
parallel dimers on elementary plaquettes. Setting $g=2$ and using the results
of earlier work on this interacting dimer model, we find that the long-distance
behaviour of the bond-energy correlation function is dominated by an
oscillatory term that decays as $ 1/|\vec{r}|^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx
1.22$ for SU(2) spins. This result is in remarkable quantitative agreement with
earlier direct numerical studies of the corresponding wavefunction, which give
$\alpha \approx 1.20$.
