We study the structural and mechanical properties of jammed ellipse packings,
and find that the nature of the jamming transition in these systems is
fundamentally different from that for spherical particles. Ellipse packings are
generically hypostatic with more degrees of freedom than constraints. The
spectra of low energy excitations possess two gaps and three distinct branches
over a range of aspect ratios. In the zero compression limit, the energy of the
modes in the lowest branch increases {\it quartically} with deformation
amplitude, and the density of states possesses a $\delta$-function at zero
frequency. We identify scaling relations that collapse the low-frequency part
of the spectra for different aspect ratios. Finally, we find that the degree of
hypostaticity is determined by the number of quartic modes of the packing.
