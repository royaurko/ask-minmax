We study the imprints of boxy/peanut structures on the 2D line-of-sight
kinematics of simulated disk galaxies. The models under study belong to a
family with varying initial gas fraction and halo triaxiality, plus few other
control runs with different structural parameters; the kinematic information
was extracted using the Voronoi-binning technique and parametrised up to the
fourth order of a Gauss-Hermite series. Building on a previous work for the
long-slit case, we investigate the 2D kinematic behaviour in the edge-on
projection as a function of the boxy/peanut strength and position angle; we
find that for the strongest structures the highest moments show characteristic
features away from the midplane in a range of position angles. We also discuss
the masking effect of a classical bulge and the ambiguity in discriminating
kinematically this spherically-symmetric component from a boxy/peanut bulge
seen end-on. Regarding the face-on case, we extend existing results to
encompass the effect of a second buckling and find that this phenomenon spurs
an additional set of even deeper minima in the fourth moment. Finally, we show
how the results evolve when inclining the disk away from perfectly edge-on and
face-on. The behaviour of stars born during the course of the simulations is
discussed and confronted to that of the pre-existing disk. The general aim of
our study is providing a handle to identify boxy/peanut structure and their
properties in latest generation IFU observations of nearby disk galaxies.
