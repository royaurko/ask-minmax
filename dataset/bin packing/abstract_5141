We develop a simple and scalable graphene patterning method using
electron-beam or ultraviolet lithography followed by a lift-off process. This
method, with the merits of: high pattern resolution and high alignment
accuracy, free from additional etching or harsh process, universal to arbitrary
substrates, compatible to Si microelectronic technology, can be easily applied
to diverse graphene-based devices, especially in array-based applications,
where large-scale graphene patterns are desired. We have applied this method to
fabricate CdSe nanobelt (NB)/graphene Schottky junction solar cells, which have
potential application in integrated nano-optoelectronic systems. Typical
as-fabricated solar cell shows excellent photovoltaic behavior with an
open-circuit voltage of ~ 0.51 V, a short-circuit current density of ~ 5.75
mA/cm2, and an energy conversion efficiency of ~1.25%. We attribute the high
performance of the cell to the as-patterned high-performance graphene, which
can form an ideal Schottky contact with CdSe NB. Our results suggest both the
developed graphene patterning method and the as-fabricated CdSe nanobelt
(NB)/graphene Schottky junction solar cells have reachable application
prospect.
