In [BL] in relation to the unsolved Bang's plank problem (1951) we obtained a
lower bound for the sum of relevant measures of cylinders covering a given
d-dimensional convex body. In this paper we provide the packing counterpart of
these estimates. We also extend bounds to the case of r-fold covering and
packing and show a packing analog of Falconer's results ([Fa]).
