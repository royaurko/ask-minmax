It is shown that, as functions of their rank, cumulants of QCD multiplicity
distributions in small phase space bins possess the quasi- oscillating behavior
similar to that found for them in the total rapidity range. First minimum moves
to lower ranks for smaller bins. For the total rapidity range, it moves to
higher ranks with energy increase. The running property of the QCD coupling
constant is in charge of these effects which can be verified in experiment.
