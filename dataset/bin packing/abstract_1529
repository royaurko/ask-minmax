We address the issue about the variation of the star cluster frequency (CF)
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in terms of the cluster spatial
distribution. We adopted the LMC regions traced by Harris & Zaritsky (2009) and
used an updated version of the cluster database compiled by Baumgardt et al.
(2013). The CFs were produced by taking into account an appropriate selection
of age bins. Since the uncertainty in a cluster's age can be large compared to
the size of the age bins, we account for the fact that a cluster could actually
reside in one of a few adjacent age bins. We confirm that there exist some
variations of the LMC CFs in terms of their spatial distributions, although
some caveats should be pointed out. 30 Doradus resulted to be the region with
the highest relative frequency of youngest clusters, while the log($t$) = 9-9.5
(1-3 Gyr) age range is featured by cluster formation at a higher rate in the
inner regions than in the outer ones. We compared the observed CFs to
theoretical CFs, which are based on the star formation histories of the field
stars in each region of the LMC, and found the former predicting more or fewer
clusters than observed depending on the field and age range considered.
