We propose a new method to characterize the geometrical texture of a granular
packing at the particle scale including the steric hindrance effect. This
method is based on the assumption of a maximum disorder (entropy) compatible
both with strain-induced anisotropy of the contact network and steric
exclusions. We show that the predicted statistics for the local configurations
is in a fairly agreement with our numerical data.
