The quasistatic behavior of a simple 2D model of a cohesive powder under
isotropic loads is investigated by Discrete Element simulations. The loose
packing states, as studied in a previous paper, undergo important structural
changes under growing confining pressure P, while solid fraction \Phi
irreversibly increases by large amounts. The system state goes through three
stages, with different forms of the plastic consolidation curve \Phi(P*), under
growing reduced pressure P* = Pa/F0, defined with adhesion force F0 and grain
diameter a. In the low-confinement regime (I), plastic compaction is
negligible, and the structure is influenced by the assembling process. The
following stage (regime II) is independent of initial conditions. The void
ratio varies linearly with log P, as described in the engineering literature.
In the last stage of compaction (III), a maximum solid fraction is approached,
and properties of cohesionless granular packs are retrieved. Under
consolidation, while the fractal range of density correlations decreases, force
patterns reorganize, and elastic moduli increase by a large factor. Plastic
deformation events correspond to very small changes in the network topology,
while the denser regions tend to move like rigid bodies. Elastic properties are
dominated by the bending of thin junctions in loose systems. For growing RR
those tend to reduce to particle chains, the folding of which, rather than
tensile ruptures, controls plastic compaction.
