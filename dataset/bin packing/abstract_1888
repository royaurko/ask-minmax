VV Pup is typical system of AM Her stars, where the main accreting pole
rotates in and out of view during the orbital cycle. In the present paper we
present ROSAT data analysis for the magnetic cataclysmic variable VV Pup. We
obtained the X-ray light curves of VV Pup in high state, the PSPC count rate
0.1-2.0 keV is plotted as a function of time with bins of 10 sec and the count
rate is folded over the orbital period of 100.4 min with bin size of 100 sec
for individual observations. We calculate the mean best-fit PSPC spectrum, with
a three-component spectral fit including a soft X-ray blackbody, hard X-ray
bremsstrahlung, and Gaussian line covers the phase intervals, for a bright
phase (phi_orb=0.9-1.1), the dip data (phi_orb=0.18-0.7), the egress from the
dip (phi_orb=0.7-0.8), the phase interval phi = 0.1-0.18 and the mean best-fit
spectrum for all data (phi_orb=0.0-1.0). We calculate spectral parameters, the
hardness ratios, count rate and total integrated black body flux.
