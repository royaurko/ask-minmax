The paper is devoted to the development of general theory of packing measures
and dimensions via introducing the notion of <<faithfulness of a packing family
for $\dim_P$ calculation>> and the packing analogues of the Billingsley
dimension. To this aim we study equivalent definitions of packing dimension and
prove theorems which can be considered as packing analogues of the famous
Billingsley's theorems. The main result of the paper gives necessary and
sufficient condition for the packing dimension faithfulness of the family of
cylinders generated by the Cantor series expansion. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first known sharp condition of the packing dimension
faithfulness for a class of packing families containing both faithful and
non-faithful ones.
