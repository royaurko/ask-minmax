We present a solution of Einstein equations with quintessential matter
surrounding a $d$-dimensional black hole, whose asymptotic structures are
determined by the state of the quintessential matter. We examine the
thermodynamics of this black hole and find that the mass of the black hole
depends on the equation of state of the quintessence, while the first law is
universal. Investigating the Hawking radiation in this black hole background,
we observe that the Hawking radiation dominates on the brane in the low-energy
regime. For different asymptotic structures caused by the equation of state of
the quintessential matter surrounding the black hole, we learn that the
influences by the state parameter of the quintessence on Hawking radiation are
different.
