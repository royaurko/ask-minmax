We focus on the dynamical aspects of Newton-Hooke space-time ${\cal NH}_+$
mainly from the viewpoint of geometric contraction of the de Sitter spacetime.
We first discuss the Newton-Hooke classical mechanics, especially the
continuous medium mechanics, in this framework. Then, we establish a consistent
theory of gravity on the Newton-Hooke space-time as a kind of
Newton-Cartan-like theory, parallel to the Newton's gravity in the Galilei
space-time. Finally, we give the Newton-Hooke invariant Schr\"odinger equation
from the geometric contraction, where we can relate the conservative
probability in some sense to the mass density in the Newton-Hooke continuous
medium mechanics. Similar consideration may apply to the Newton-Hooke
space-time ${\cal NH}_-$ contracted from anti-de Sitter spacetime.
