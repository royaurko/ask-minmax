We apply a recent one-dimensional algorithm for predicting random close
packing fractions of polydisperse hard spheres [Farr and Groot, J. Chem. Phys.
133, 244104 (2009)] to the case of lognormal distributions of sphere sizes and
mixtures of such populations. We show that the results compare well to two much
slower algorithms for directly simulating spheres in three dimensions, and show
that the algorithm is fast enough to tackle inverse problems in particle
packing: designing size distributions to meet required criteria. The
one-dimensional method used in this paper is implemented as a computer code in
the C programming language, available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/spherepack1d/ under the terms of the GNU
general public licence (version 2).
