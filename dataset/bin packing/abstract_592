We have investigated the redshift evolution of the
colour--cluster-centric-radius relation and the
morphology--cluster-centric-radius relation in three redshift bins,
  $0.02\leq z\leq 0.14$, $0.14< z\leq 0.20$, and $0.20< z\leq 0.30$ using a
homogeneous sample of 736 galaxy clusters selected from the Sloan
 Digital Sky Survey. Both the relations are well-defined in all the redshift
bins; the fraction of blue/late-type galaxies increases toward outside of
clusters.Blue/late-type galaxy fractions are found to decrease with decreasing
redshift at any cluster-centric radius. The trend is consistent with the
Butcher-Oemler effect and the morphological Butcher-Oemlereffect. In addition,
we find that colour (spectral) evolution is almost completed by $z\sim0.2$,
whereas morphological evolution continues to the present day. The colour-radius
relation is smooth inall the redshift bins, while the morphology--radius
relation has a break only in the highest redshift bin. It is also found
thatfractions of blue-late type galaxies decreases mostly between the highest
and the intermediate redshift bins, while fractions of red-late type galaxies
continuously decreases with decreasing redshift through all the redshift bins.
 These results are consistent with the interpretation that the timescale of the
colour (spectral) evolution is shorter than that of the morphological
evolution. It is suggested that red-late type galaxies in the middle of the
transformation are observed as passive spiral galaxies.
