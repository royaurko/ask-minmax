The RooUnfold package provides a common framework to evaluate and use
different unfolding algorithms, side-by-side. It currently provides
implementations or interfaces for the Iterative Bayes, Singular Value
Decomposition, and TUnfold methods, as well as bin-by-bin and matrix inversion
reference methods. Common tools provide covariance matrix evaluation and
multi-dimensional unfolding. A test suite allows comparisons of the performance
of the algorithms under different truth and measurement models. Here I outline
the package, the unfolding methods, and some experience of their use.
