We perform an independent analysis of data from the CoGeNT direct detection
experiment to quantify the evidence for dark matter recoils. We critically
re-examine the assumptions that enter the analysis, focusing specifically on
the separation of bulk and surface events, the latter of which constitute a
large background. This separation is performed using the event rise-time, with
the surface events being slower on average. We fit the rise-time distributions
for the bulk and surface events with a log-normal and Pareto distribution
(which gives a better fit to the tail in the bulk population at high
rise-times) and account for the energy-dependence of the bulk fraction using a
cubic spline. Using Bayesian and frequentist techniques and additionally
investigating the effect of varying the rise-time cut, the bulk background
spectrum and bin-sizes, we conclude that the CoGeNT data show a preference for
light dark matter recoils at less than 1 sigma.
