This paper describes the analysis used to determine the neutral current
$\pi^0$ production in MiniBooNE in bins of momentum. Additionally, a
measurement of the relative coherent production of $\pi^0$s is discussed. The
coherent production rate is found to be (19.5 $\pm$1.1 (stat) $\pm$2.5 (sys))%
of the total exclusive neutral current $\pi^0$ production rate.
