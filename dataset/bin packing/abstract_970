Event-to-event fluctuations of the spatial patterns of the final states of
high-enery collisions, referred to as erraticity, are studied for the data
generated by a soft-interaction model called ECOMB. The moments $C_{p,q}$ do
not show simple power-law dependences on the bin size. New measures of
erraticity are proposed that generalizes the bin-size dependence. The method
should be applied not only to the soft production data of NA22 and NA27 to
check the dynamical content of ECOMB, but also to other collision processes,
such as $e^+e^-$ annihilation and heavy-ion collisions.
