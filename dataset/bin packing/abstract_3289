We consider a mechanism of dark matter production in the course of first
order phase transition. We assume that there is an asymmetry between X- and
anti-X-particles of dark sector. In particular, it may be related to the baryon
asymmetry. We also assume that the phase transition is so strongly first order,
that X-particles do not permeate into the new phase. In this case, as the
bubbles of old phase collapse, X-particles are packed into Q-balls with huge
mass defect. These Q-balls compose the present dark matter. We find that the
required present dark matter density is obtained for the energy scale of the
theory in the ballpark of 1-10 TeV. As an example we consider a theory with
effective potential of one-loop motivated form.
