Random binning is an efficient, yet complex, coding technique for the
symmetric L-description source coding problem. We propose an alternative
approach, that uses the quantized samples of a bandlimited source as
"descriptions". By the Nyquist condition, the source can be reconstructed if
enough samples are received. We examine a coding scheme that combines sampling
and noise-shaped quantization for a scenario in which only K < L descriptions
or all L descriptions are received. Some of the received K-sets of descriptions
correspond to uniform sampling while others to non-uniform sampling. This
scheme achieves the optimum rate-distortion performance for uniform-sampling
K-sets, but suffers noise amplification for nonuniform-sampling K-sets. We then
show that by increasing the sampling rate and adding a random-binning stage,
the optimal operation point is achieved for any K-set.
