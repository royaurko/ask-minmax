Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, where $n$ is even, we consider
the following question: How many plane perfect matchings can be packed into
$P$? We prove that at least $\lceil\log_2{n}\rceil-2$ plane perfect matchings
can be packed into any point set $P$. For some special configurations of point
sets, we give the exact answer. We also consider some extensions of this
problem.
