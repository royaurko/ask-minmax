Multigrid preconditioners and solvers for the indefinite Helmholtz equation
suffer from non-stability of the stationary smoothers due to the indefinite
spectrum of the operator. In this paper we explore GMRES as a replacement for
the stationary smoothers of the standard multigrid method. This results in a
robust and efficient solver for a complex shifted or stretched Helmholtz
problem that can be used as a preconditioner. Very few GMRES iterations are
required on each level to build a good multigrid method. The convergence
behavior is compared to a theoretically derived stable polynomial smoother. We
test this method on some benchmark problems and report on the observed
convergence behavior.
