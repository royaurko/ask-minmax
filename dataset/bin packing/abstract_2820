We discuss the static and kinetic properties of a Ginzburg-Landau spherically
symmetric $O(N)$ model recently introduced (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 75}, 2176,
(1995)) in order to generalize the so called Phase field model of Langer. The
Hamiltonian contains two $O(N)$ invariant fields $\phi$ and $U$ bilinearly
coupled. The order parameter field $\phi$ evolves according to a non conserved
dynamics, whereas the diffusive field $U$ follows a conserved dynamics. In the
limit $N \to \infty$ we obtain an exact solution, which displays an interesting
kinetic behavior characterized by three different growth regimes. In the early
regime the system displays normal scaling and the average domain size grows as
$t^{1/2}$, in the intermediate regime one observes a finite wavevector
instability, which is related to the Mullins-Sekerka instability; finally, in
the late stage the structure function has a multiscaling behavior, while the
domain size grows as $t^{1/4}$.
