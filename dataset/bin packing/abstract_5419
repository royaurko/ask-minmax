By systematic chemical substitution of Pt and Ni in the newly-discovered
superconductor Nb$_2$PdS$_5$ ($T_c\sim$6 K), we study the evolution of its
superconducting properties with doping, focussing on the behavior of the upper
critical field $H_{c2}$. In contrast to the previous results of Se doping on S
sites, superconductivity is found to be rather robust against the Pt and Ni
dopants on the one-dimensional Pd chains. Most strikingly, the reduced
$H_{c2}$, i.e., the ratio of $H_{c2}/T_c$, is seen to be significantly enhanced
by the heavier Pt doping but suppressed in the Ni-doped counterparts, distinct
from the nearly constant value in the Se doped samples. Our findings therefore
suggest that the upper critical field of this system can be modified in a
tunable fashion by chemical doping on the Pd chains with elements of varying
mass numbers. The spin-orbit coupling on the Pd sites, by inference, should
play an important role in the observed superconductivity and on the large upper
critical field beyond the Pauli pair-breaking field.
