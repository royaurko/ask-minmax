We simulate the dynamics of polydisperse hard spheres at high packing
fractions, $\phi$, with an experimentally-realistic particle size distribution
(PSD) and other commonly-used PSDs such as gaussian or top hat. We find that
the mode of kinetic arrest depends on the PSD's shape and not only on its
variance. For the experimentally-realistic PSD, the largest particles undergo
an ideal glass transition at $\phi\sim 0.588$ while the smallest particles
remain mobile. Such species-specific localisation was previously observed only
in asymmetric binary mixtures. Our findings suggest that the recent observation
of ergodic behavior up to $\phi \sim 0.6$ in a hard-sphere system is not
evidence for activated dynamics, but an effect of polydispersity.
