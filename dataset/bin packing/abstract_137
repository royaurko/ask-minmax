We present the densest known packing of regular tetrahedra with density phi =
4000/4671 = 0.856347... Like the recently discovered packings of Kallus et al.
[arXiv:0910.5226] and Torquato-Jiao [arXiv:0912.4210], our packing is
crystalline with a unit cell of four tetrahedra forming two triangular
dipyramids (dimer clusters). We show that our packing has maximal density
within a three-parameter family of dimer packings. Numerical compressions
starting from random configurations suggest that the packing may be optimal at
least for small cells with up to 16 tetrahedra and periodic boundaries.
