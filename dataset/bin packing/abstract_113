We perform a detailed analysis of the contact force network in a dense
confined packing of pentagonal particles simulated by means of the contact
dynamics method. The effect of particle shape is evidenced by comparing the
data from pentagon packing and from a packing with identical characteristics
except for the circular shape of the particles. A counterintuitive finding of
this work is that, under steady shearing, the pentagon packing develops a lower
structural anisotropy than the disk packing. We show that this weakness is
compensated by a higher force anisotropy, leading to enhanced shear strength of
the pentagon packing. We revisit "strong" and "weak" force networks in the
pentagon packing, but our simulation data provide also evidence for a large
class of "very weak" forces carried mainly by vertex-to-edge contacts. The
strong force chains are mostly composed of edge-to-edge contacts with a marked
zig-zag aspect and a decreasing exponential probability distribution as in a
disk packing.
