We numerically study structural properties of mechanically stable packings of
hard spheres (HS), in a wide range of packing fractions $0.53 \le \phi \le
0.72$. Detailed structural information is obtained from the analysis of
orientational order parameters, which clearly reveals a disorder-order phase
transition at the random close packing (RCP) density, $\phi_{\rm c} \simeq
0.64$. Above $\phi_{\rm c}$ the crystalline nuclei form 3D-like clusters, which
upon further desification, transform into alternating planar-like layers. We
also find that particles with icosahedral symmetry survive only in a narrow
density range in the vicinity of the RCP transition.
