All-sky data from the Planck survey and the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected
Clusters of galaxies (MCXC) are combined to investigate the relationship
between the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal and X-ray luminosity. The
sample comprises ~ 1600 X-ray clusters with redshifts up to ~ 1 and spans a
wide range in X-ray luminosity. The SZ signal is extracted for each object
individually, and the statistical significance of the measurement is maximised
by averaging the SZ signal in bins of X-ray luminosity, total mass, or
redshift. The SZ signal is detected at very high significance over more than
two decades in X-ray luminosity (10^43 erg/s < L_500 E(z)^-7/3 < 2 X 10^45
erg/s). The relation between intrinsic SZ signal and X-ray luminosity is
investigated and the measured SZ signal is compared to values predicted from
X-ray data. Planck measurements and X-ray based predictions are found to be in
excellent agreement over the whole explored luminosity range. No significant
deviation from standard evolution of the scaling relations is detected. For the
first time the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between SZ signal and
X-ray luminosity is measured and found to be consistent with the one in the
luminosity -- mass relation from X-ray studies. There is no evidence of any
deficit in SZ signal strength in Planck data relative to expectations from the
X-ray properties of clusters, underlining the robustness and consistency of our
overall view of intra-cluster medium properties.
