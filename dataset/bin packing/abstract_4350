We have performed a principal component analysis on the X-ray spectra of the
microquasar Cygnus X-3 from RXTE, INTEGRAL and Swift during a major flare
ejection event in 2006 May-July. The analysis showed that there are two main
variability components in play, i.e. two principal components explained almost
all the variability in the X-ray lightcurves. According to the spectral shape
of these components and spectral fits to the original data, the most probable
emission components corresponding to the principal components are
inverse-Compton scattering and bremsstrahlung. We find that these components
form a double-peaked profile when phase-folded with the peaks occurring in
opposite phases. This could be due to an asymmetrical wind around the companion
star with which the compact object is interacting.
