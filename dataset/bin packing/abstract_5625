We present measurements of the UV galaxy luminosity function and the
evolution of luminosity density from GALEX observations matched to the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We analyze galaxies in the Medium Imaging Survey
overlapping the SDSS DR1 with a total coverage of 44 deg^2. Using the combined
GALEX+SDSS photometry, we compute photometric redshifts and study the LF in
three redshift shells between z=0.07 and 0.25. The Schechter function fits
indicate that the faint-end slope alpha is consistent with -1.1 at all
redshifts but the characteristic UV luminosity M* brightens by 0.2 mag from
z=0.07 to 0.25. In the lowest redshift bin, early and late type galaxies are
studied separately and we confirm that red galaxies tend to be brighter and
have a shallower slope alpha than blue ones. The derived luminosity densities
are consistent with other GALEX results based on a local spectroscopic sample
from 2dF and the evolution follows the trend reported by deeper studies.
