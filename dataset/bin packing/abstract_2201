We compute the free energy minimizing structures of particle monolayers in
the presence of enthalpic barriers of a finite height \b{eta}Vext using
classical density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. We show that a
periodic square template with dimensions up to at least ten times the particle
diameter disrupts the formation of the entropically favored hexagonally
close-packed 2D lattice in favor of a square lattice. The results illustrate
how graphoepitaxy can successfully order nanoparticulate films into desired
patterns many times smaller than those of the prepatterned template.
