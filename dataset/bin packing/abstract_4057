The magnetization reversal in a single molecular magnet (SMM) weakly coupled
to an electrode with spin-dependent splitting of chemical potentials (spin
bias) is theoretically investigated by means of the rate equation. A
microscopic mechanism for the reversal is demonstrated by the avalanche
dynamics at the reversal point. The magnetization as a function of the spin
bias shows hysteresis loops tunable by the gate voltage and varying with
temperature. The nondestructive measurement to the orientation of giant spin in
SMM is presented by measuring the fully polarized electric current in the
response to a small spin bias. For Mn$_{12}$ac molecule, its small transverse
anisotropy only slightly violates the results above. The situation when there
is an angle between the easy axis of the SMM and the spin quantization
direction of the electrode is also studied.
