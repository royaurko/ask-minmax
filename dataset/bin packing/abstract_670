The dynamics of compaction of hard cross-shaped pentamers on the 2D square
lattice is investigated. The addition of new particles is controlled by
diffusive relaxation. It is shown that the filling process terminates at a
glassy phase with a limiting coverage density \rho_{rcp}=0.171626(3), lower
than the density of closest packing \rho_{cp}=0.2, and the long time filling
rate vanishes like (\rho_{rcp}-\rho(t))^2. For the entire density regime the
particles form an amorphous phase, devoid of any crystalline order. Therefore,
the model supports a stable random packing state, as opposed to the hard disks
system. Our results may be relevant to recent experiments studying the
clustering of proteins on bilayer lipid membranes.
