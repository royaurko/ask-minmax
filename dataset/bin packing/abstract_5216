Located within 10 degrees of the North Pole, northern Ellesmere Island offers
continuous darkness in the winter months. This capability can greatly enhance
the detection efficiency of planetary transit surveys and other time domain
astronomy programs. We deployed two wide-field cameras at 80 degrees North,
near Eureka, Nunavut, for a 152-hour observing campaign in February 2012. The
16-megapixel-camera systems were based on commercial f/1.2 lenses with 70mm and
42mm apertures, and they continuously imaged 504 and 1,295 square degrees
respectively. In total, the cameras took over 44,000 images and produced
better-than-1% precision light curves for approximately 10,000 stars. We
describe a new high-speed astrometric and photometric data reduction pipeline
designed for the systems, test several methods for the precision flat-fielding
of images from very-wide-angle cameras, and evaluate the cameras' image
qualities. We achieved a scintillation-limited photometric precision of 1-2% in
each 10s exposure. Binning the short exposures into 10-min chunks provided a
photometric stability of 2-3 millimagnitudes, sufficient for the detection of
transiting exoplanets around the bright stars targeted by our survey. We
estimate that the cameras, when operated over the full arctic winter, will be
capable of discovering several transiting exoplanets around bright (V<9) stars.
