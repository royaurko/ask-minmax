The packing problem of long thin filaments that are injected into confined
spaces is of fundamental interest for physicists, biologists and materials
engineers alike. How linear threads pack and coil is well known only for the
ideal case of rigid containers, however. Here, we force long elastic rods into
flexible spatial confinement borne by an elastic shell to examine under which
conditions recently acquired knowledge on wire packing in rigid spheres breaks
down. We find that unlike in rigid cavities, friction plays a key role by
giving rise to the emergence of two distinct packing patterns. At low friction,
the wire densely coils into an ordered toroidal bundle with semi-ellipsoidal
cross section, while at high friction, it packs into a highly disordered,
self-similar structure. These two morphologies are shown to be separated by a
continuous phase transition.
