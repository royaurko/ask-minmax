In two-dimensional rotating drum experiments, we find two separate influences
of the packing fraction of a granular heap on its stability. For a fixed grain
shape, the stability increases with packing fraction. However, in determining
the relative stability of different grain shapes, those with the lowest average
packing fractions tend to form the most stable heaps. We also show that only
the configuration close to the surface of the pile figures prominently.
