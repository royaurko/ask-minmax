We find and study a variety of the spectral-temporal behavior during the
decay phase of long and bright GRB pulses. Even though only a small fraction of
observed bursts exhibit such pulses, these are of interest to study as they
reflect individual emission episodes during the burst. We have previously found
that for about half of these decays, the instantaneous photon flux ~ 1/time,
which is a consequence of the validity of both a power-law hardness-intensity
correlation (HIC) and an exponential hardness-fluence correlation (HFC). Here,
we study a complete sample of 25 BATSE pulses (having a peak flux in 1 s
resolution of > 5 photons/s/cm^2 and a S/N of 30 in at least 8 time bins) and,
specifically, search for other types of decay behaviors. First, we find that a
power law gives a better description of the pulse decays than a stretched
exponential, the most commonly assumed pulse shape so far. Then we find that
about half of the decays behave approximately as 1/time, and the other half
approximately as 1/time^3. For a few of the latter decays, the two
correlations, the HIC and the HFC, are constrained and found to be consistent
with the light curve behavior. For these cases, the HIC is still a power law
while the HFC is described by a generalized function. Finally, we briefly
discuss our results in a physical context.
