We present an updated analysis of all available solar and reactor neutrino
data, emphasizing in particular the totality of the KamLAND (314d live time)
results and including for the first time the solar $SNO$ (391d live time, phase
II NaCl-enhanced) spectrum data. As a novelty of the statistical analysis, we
study the variability of the KamLand results with respect the use of diverse
statistics. A new statistic, not used before is proposed. Moreover, in the
analysis of the SNO spectrum a novel technique is used in order to include full
correlated errors among bins. Combining all data, we obtain the following
best-fit parameters: we determine individual neutrino mixing parameters and
their errors $ \Delta m^2= 8.2\pm 0.08\times 10^{-5} \eV^2,\quad \tan^2\theta=
0.50^{+0.12}_{-0.07}.$ The impact of these results is discussed. We also
estimate the individual elements of the neutrino mass matrix. In the framework
of three neutrino oscillations we obtain the mass matrix: \begin{eqnarray}M&=&
eV \pmatrix{1.0+ 4.0\pm 3.2 10^{-5}& 4.2\pm 3.2 10^{-5} &-13.5\pm 14.0 10^{-5}
\cr 4.2\pm 3.2 10^{-5}& 1.0+4.3\pm 3.5 10^{-5} &-13.5\pm 14.5 10^{-5} \cr
13.5\pm 14.0 10^{-5}& -13.5\pm 14.5 10^{-5} &1.0+100.0\pm 30.0\
10^{-5}}.\end{eqnarray}
