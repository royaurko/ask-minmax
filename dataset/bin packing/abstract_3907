Using hadron dynamics we calculate nuclear transparencies for protons,
knocked-out in high-$Q^2$, semi-inclusive reactions. Predicted transparencies
are, roughly half a standard deviation above the NE18 data. The latter contain
the effects of binned proton missing momenta and mass, and of finite detector
acceptances. In order to test sensitivity we compare computed transparencies
without restrictions and the same with maximal cuts for missing momenta and the
electron energy loss. We find hardly any variation, enabling a meaningful
comparison with data and predictions based on hadron dynamics. Should
discrepancies persist in high-statistics data, the above may with greater
confidence be attributed to exotic components in the description of the
outgoing proton.
