Upon the expansion of Cloud Computing and the positive outlook of
organizations with regard to the movements towards using cloud computing and
their expanding utilization of such valuable processing method, as well as the
solutions provided by the cloud infrastructure providers with regard to the
reduction of the costs of processing resources, the problem of organizing
resources in a cloud environment gained a high importance. One of the major
preoccupations of the minds of cloud infrastructure clients is their lack of
knowledge on the quantity of their required processing resources in different
periods of time. The managers and technicians are trying to make the most use
of scalability and the flexibility of the resources in cloud computing. The
main challenge is with calculating the amount of the required processing
resources per moment with regard to the quantity of incoming requests of the
service. Through deduction of the accurate amount of these items, one can have
an accurate estimation of the requests per moment. This paper aims at
introducing a model for automatic scaling of the cloud resources that would
reduce the cost of renting the resources for the clients of cloud
infrastructure. Thus, first we start with a thorough explanation of the
proposal and the major components of the model. Then through calculating the
incomings of the model through clustering and introducing the way that each of
these components work in different phases,...
