The mechanical response of static, unconfined, overcompressed face centred
cubic, granular arrays is studied using large-scale, discrete element method
simulations. Specifically, the stress response due to the application of a
localised force perturbation - the Green function technique - is obtained in
granular packings generated over several orders of magnitude in both the
particle friction coefficient and the applied forcing. We observe crossover
behaviour in the mechanical state of the system characterised by the changing
nature of the resulting stress response. The transition between anisotropic and
isotropic stress response exhibits critical-like features through the
identification of a diverging length scale that distinguishes the spatial
extent of anisotropic regions from those that display isotropic behaviour. A
multidimensional phase diagram is constructed that parameterises the response
of the system due to changing friction and force perturbations.
