A Lie theoretic interpretation is given to a pattern with five-fold symmetry
occurring in aperiodic Penrose tiling based on isosceles triangles with length
ratios equal to the Golden Section. Specifically a $B(\infty)$ crystal based on
that of Kashiwara is constructed exhibiting this five-fold symmetry. It is
shown that it can be represented as a Kashiwara $B(\infty)$ crystal in type
$A_4$. Similar crystals with $(2n+1)$-fold symmetry are represented as
Kashiwara crystals in type $A_{2n}$. The weight diagrams of the latter inspire
higher aperiodic tiling. In another approach alcove packing is seen to give
aperiodic tiling in type $A_4$. Finally $2m$-fold symmetry is related to type
$B_m$.
