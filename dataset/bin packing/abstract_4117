We study real-time correlators in the Kerr/CFT correspondence. The
near-horizon geometry of extreme and near-extremal Kerr black holes can be
taken as warped spacetimes with the warping factors depending on the transverse
radius and the angular variable. By considering the Kerr/CFT correspondence as
a generalized warped AdS/CFT correspondence, we show how to compute the CFT
real-time correlation functions. We find that the retarded Green's functions,
the cross sections and the quasi-normal modes are all in perfect match with the
predictions of the dual CFT. The same analysis is also generalized to the
charged Newman-Kerr black holes .
