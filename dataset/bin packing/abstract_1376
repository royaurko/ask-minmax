When a single long piece of elastic wire is injected trough channels into a
confining two-dimensional cavity, a complex structure of hierarchical loops is
formed. In the limit of maximum packing density, these structures are described
by several scaling laws. In this paper it is investigated this packing process
but using plastic wires which give origin to completely irreversible structures
of different morphology. In particular, it is studied experimentally the
plastic deformation from circular to oblate configurations of crumpled wires,
obtained by the application of an axial strain. Among other things, it is shown
that in spite of plasticity, irreversibility, and very large deformations,
scaling is still observed.
