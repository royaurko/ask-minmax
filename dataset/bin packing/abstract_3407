Self-assembled monolayers of 1,3,5-tris(4'-biphenyl-4"-carbonitrile)benzene,
a large functional trinitrile molecule, on the (111) surfaces of copper and
silver under ultrahigh vacuum conditions were studied by scanning tunneling
microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. A densely packed
hydrogen-bonded polymorph was equally observed on both surfaces. Additionally,
deposition onto Cu(111) yielded a well-ordered metal-coordinated porous
polymorph that coexisted with the hydrogen-bonded structure. The required
coordination centers were supplied by the adatom gas of the Cu(111) surface. On
Ag(111), however, the well-ordered metal-coordinated network was not observed.
Differences between the adatom reactivities on copper and silver and the
resulting bond strengths of the respective coordination bonds are held
responsible for this substrate dependence. By utilizing ultralow deposition
rates, we demonstrate that on Cu(111) the adatom kinetics plays a decisive role
in the expression of intermolecular bonds and hence structure selection.
