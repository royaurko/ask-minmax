We reconstruct an $f(R)$ gravity model that gives rise to the particular
$\Lambda$CDM background evolution of the universe. We find well-defined,
real-valued analytical forms for the $f(R)$ model to describe the universe both
in the early epoch from the radiation to matter dominated eras and the late
time acceleration period. We further examine the viability of the derived
$f(R)$ model and find that it is viable to describe the evolution of the
universe in the past and there does not exist the future singularity in the
Lagrangian.
