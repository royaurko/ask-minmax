A novel method of preparing a single photon in temporally-delocalized
entangled modes is proposed and analyzed. We show that two single-photon pulses
propagating in a driven nonabsorbing medium with different group velocities are
temporally split under parametric interaction into well-separated pulses. As a
consequence, the single-photon "time-bin-entangled" states are generatedwith a
programmable entanglement, which is easily controlled by driving field
intensity. The experimental study of nonclassical features and nonlocality in
generated states by means of balanced homodyne tomography is discussed.
