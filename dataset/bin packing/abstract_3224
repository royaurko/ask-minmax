We explore some issues in slow roll inflation in situations where field
excursions are small compared to $M_p$. We argue that for small field
inflation, minimizing fine tuning requires low energy supersymmetry and a
tightly constrained structure. Hybrid inflation is {\it almost} an inevitable
outcome. The resulting theory can be described in terms of a supersymmetric low
energy effective action and inflation completely characterized in terms of a
small number of parameters. Demanding slow roll inflation significantly
constrains these parameters. In this context, the generic level of fine tuning
can be described as a function of the number of light fields, there is an upper
bound on the scale of inflation, and an (almost) universal prediction for the
spectral index. Models of this type need not suffer from a cosmological moduli
problem.
