We present the Extended Hipparcos Compilation (XHIP), a database of all stars
in the New Reduction of the Hipparcos Catalog extensively cross-referenced with
data from a broad survey of presently available sources. The resulting
collection uniquely assigns 116,096 spectral classifications, 46,392 radial
velocities, and 18,549 homogenized iron abundances [Fe/H] to Hipparcos stars.
Stellar classifications from SIMBAD, indications of multiplicity from CCDM or
WDS, stellar ages from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey III, supplemental
photometry from 2MASS and SIMBAD, and identifications of exoplanet host stars
are also included. Parameters for solar encounters and Galactic orbits are
calculated for a kinematically complete subset. Kinetic bias is found to be
minimal. Our compilation is available through the Centre de Donn\'ees
astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) as Catalog V/137B.
