We quantify the amplitude of the lopsidedness, the azimuthal angular
asymmetry index, and the concentration of star forming regions, as represented
by the distribution of the H$\alpha$ emission, in a sample of 78 late-type
irregular galaxies. We bin the observed galaxies in two groups representing
blue compact galaxies (BCDs) and low surface brightness dwarf galaxies (LSBs).
The light distribution is analysed with a novel algorithm, which allows
detection of details in the light distribution pattern.
 We find that while the asymmetry of the underlying continuum light,
representing the older stellar generations, is relatively small, the H$\alpha$
emission is very asymmetric and is correlated in position angle with the
continuum light.
 We test a model of random star formation over the extent of a galaxy by
simulating HII regions in artificial dwarf galaxies. The implication is that
random star formation over the full extent of a galaxy may be generated in LSB
dwarf-irregular galaxies but not in BCD galaxies.
