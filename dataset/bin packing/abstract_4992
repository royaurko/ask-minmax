We present a catalog of nearby exoplanets, available at http://exoplanets.org
and ApJ 646, 505 (published version available at the link above). It contains
the 172 known low mass companions with orbits established through radial
velocity and transit measurements around stars within 200 pc. We include 5
previously unpublished exoplanets orbiting the stars HD 11964, HD 66428, HD
99109, HD 107148, and HD 164922. We update orbits for 90 additional exoplanets
including many whose orbits have not been revised since their announcement, and
include radial velocity time series from the Lick, Keck, and Anglo-Australian
Observatory planet searches. Both these new and previously published velocities
are more precise here due to improvements in our data reduction pipeline, which
we applied to archival spectra. We present a brief summary of the global
properties of the known exoplanets, including their distributions of orbital
semimajor axis, minimum mass, and orbital eccentricity.
