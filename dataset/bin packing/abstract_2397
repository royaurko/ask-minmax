CP violating signals in semileptonic $\tau$ decays are studied. These can be
observed in decays of unpolarized single $\tau$'s even if their rest frame
cannot be reconstructed. No beam polarization is required. The importance of
the two meson channel, in particular the $K\pi$ final state is emphasized.
