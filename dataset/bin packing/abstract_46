Let A be a matrix, c be any linear objective function and x be a fractional
vector, say an LP solution to some discrete optimization problem. Then a
recurring task in theoretical computer science (and in approximation algorithms
in particular) is to obtain an integral vector y such that Ax is roughly Ay and
c*y exceeds c*x by only a moderate factor.
  We give a new randomized rounding procedure for this task, provided that A
has bounded Delta-approximate entropy. This property means that for uniformly
chosen random signs chi(j) in {-1,+1} on any subset of the columns, the outcome
A*chi can be approximately described using a sub-linear number of bits in
expectation.
  To achieve this result, we modify well-known techniques from the field of
discrepancy theory, especially we rely on Beck's entropy method, which to the
best of our knowledge has never been used before in the context of
approximation algorithms. Our result can be made constructive using the Bansal
framework based on semidefinite programming.
  We demonstrate the versatility of our procedure by rounding fractional
solutions to column-based linear programs for some generalizations of Bin
Packing. For example we obtain a polynomial time OPT + O(log^2 OPT)
approximation for Bin Packing With Rejection and the first AFPTAS for the Train
Delivery problem.
