Recent studies show that volume fractions $\phiJ$ at the jamming transition
of frictionless hard spheres and discs are not uniquely determined but exist
over a continuous range. Motivated by this observation, we numerically
investigate dependence of $\phiJ$ on the initial configurations of the parent
fluids equilibrated at a fraction $\phiini$, before compressing to generate a
jammed packing. We find that $\phiJ$ remains constant when $\phiini$ is small
but sharply increases when $\phiini$ exceeds the dynamic transition point which
the mode-coupling theory predicts. We carefully analyze configurational
properties of both jammed packings and parent fluids and find that, while all
jammed packings remain isostatic, the increase of $\phiJ$ is accompanied with
subtle but distinct changes of (i) local orders, (ii) a static length scale,
and (iii) an exponent of the finite size scaling. These results quantitatively
support the scenario of the random first order transition theoryof the glass
transition.
