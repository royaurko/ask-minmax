In geometry, there are several challenging problems studying numbers
associated to convex bodies. For example, the packing density problem, the
kissing number problem, the covering density problem, the packing-covering
constant problem, Hadwiger's covering conjecture and Borsuk's partition
conjecture. They are fundamental and fascinating problems about the same
objects. However, up to now, both the methodology and the technique applied to
them are essentially different. Therefore, a common foundation for them has
been much expected. By treating problems of these types as functionals defined
on the spaces of n-dimensional convex bodies, this paper tries to create such a
foundation. This article suggests an ideal theoretic structure and a couple of
research topics such as supderivatives and integral sums of these functionals
which seem to be important. In addition, it proves an inequality between the
Hausdorff metric and the Banach-Mazur metric and obtains some estimations on
the supderivatives.
