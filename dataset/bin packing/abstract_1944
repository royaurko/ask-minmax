Hard spheres with an attraction of range a tenth to a hundredth of the sphere
diameter are constrained to remain fluid even at densities when monodisperse
particles at equilibrium would have crystallised, in order to compare with
experimental systems which remain fluid. They are found to have a fluid-fluid
transition at high density. As the range of the attraction tends to zero, the
density at the critical point tends towards the random-close-packing density of
hard spheres.
