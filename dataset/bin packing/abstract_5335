The high energy spectral shape of 3C 273 is usually understood in terms of
Inverse-Compton emission in a relativistic leptonic jet. This model predicts
variability patterns and delays which could be tested if simultaneous
observations are available from the infrared to the GeV range. The instruments
IBIS, SPI, JEM-X on board INTEGRAL, PCA on board RXTE and LAT on board Fermi
have enough sensitivity to follow the spectral variability from the keV to the
GeV and to compare them with model predictions. We are presenting preliminary
results on the high energy spectrum of 3C 273 and its variability and compare
these results to predictions. We found that a single component is not able to
adequately fit the multiwavelength spectrum (5 keV - 10 GeV) when the
statistics in Fermi data is sufficient to constraint {\gamma}-ray emission.
This suggests that the X-rays emission is not originated in the jet. A possible
explanation could be that X-rays are dominated by a Seyfert-like thermal
inverse Compton.
