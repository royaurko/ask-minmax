We have studied the quasinormal modes and the late-time tail behaviors of
scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in the Schwarzschild
black hole pierced by a cosmic string. Although the metric is locally identical
to that of the Schwarzschild black hole so that the presence of the string will
not imprint in the motion of test particles, we found that quasinormal modes
and the late-time tails can reflect physical signatures of the cosmic string.
Compared with the scalar and electromagnetic fields, the gravitational
perturbation decays slower, which could be more interesting to disclose the
string effect in this background.
