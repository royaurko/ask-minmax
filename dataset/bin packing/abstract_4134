Recently, the use and deployment of web services has dramatically increased.
This is due to the easiness, interoperability, and flexibility that web
services offer to the software systems, which other software structures don't
support or support poorly. Web services discovery became more important and
research conducted in this area became more critical. With the increasing
number of published and publicly available web services, speed in web service
discovery process is becoming an issue which cannot be neglected. This paper
proposes a generic non-functional based web services classification algorithm.
Classification algorithm depends on information supplied by web service
provider at the registration time. Authors have proved mathematically and
experimentally the usefulness and efficiency of proposed algorithm.
