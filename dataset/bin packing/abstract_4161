Charged particle transverse momentum (pT) spectra have been measured by CMS
for pp and PbPb collisions at the same sqrt(sNN)=2.76 TeV collision energy per
nucleon pairs. Calorimeter-based jet triggers are employed to enhance the
statistical reach of the high-pT measurements. The nuclear modification factor
(R_AA) is obtained in bins of collision centrality for the PbPb data sample
dividing by the measured pp reference spectrum. In the range pT = 5-10 GeV/c,
the charged particle yield in the most central PbPb collisions is suppressed by
up to a factor of 7. At higher pT, this suppression is significantly reduced,
approaching a factor of 2 for particles with pT = 40-100 GeV/c.
