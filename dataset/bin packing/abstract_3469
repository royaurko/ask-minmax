We analyse the potential of the electric solar wind sail for solar system
space missions. Applications studied include fly-by missions to terrestrial
planets (Venus, Mars and Phobos, Mercury) and asteroids, missions based on
non-Keplerian orbits (orbits that can be maintained only by applying continuous
propulsive force), one-way boosting to outer solar system, off-Lagrange point
space weather forecasting and low-cost impactor probes for added science value
to other missions. We also discuss the generic idea of data clippers (returning
large volumes of high resolution scientific data from distant targets packed in
memory chips) and possible exploitation of asteroid resources. Possible orbits
were estimated by orbit calculations assuming circular and coplanar orbits for
planets. Some particular challenge areas requiring further research work and
related to some more ambitious mission scenarios are also identified and
discussed.
