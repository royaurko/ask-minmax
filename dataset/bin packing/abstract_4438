We present a scheme for using stellar catalogues to map the three-dimensional
distributions of extinction and dust within our Galaxy. Extinction is modelled
as a Gaussian random field, whose covariance function is set by a simple
physical model of the ISM that assumes a Kolmogorov-like power spectrum of
turbulent fluctuations. As extinction is modelled as a random field, the
spatial resolution of the resulting maps is set naturally by the data
available; there is no need to impose any spatial binning. We verify the
validity of our scheme by testing it on simulated extinction fields and show
that its precision is significantly improved over previous dust-mapping
efforts. The approach we describe here can make use of any photometric,
spectroscopic or astrometric data; it is not limited to any particular survey.
Consequently, it can be applied to a wide range of data from both existing and
future surveys.
