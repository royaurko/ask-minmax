This paper establishes the asymptotic normality of frequency polygons in the
context of stationary strongly mixing random fields indexed by $\Z^d$. Our
method allows us to consider only minimal conditions on the width bins and
provides a simple criterion on the mixing coefficients. In particular, we
improve in several directions a previous result by Carbon, Francq and Tran
(2010).
