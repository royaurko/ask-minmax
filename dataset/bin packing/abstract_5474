Observables which discriminate boosted topologies from massive QCD jets are
of great importance for the success of the jet substructure program at the
Large Hadron Collider. Such observables, while both widely and successfully
used, have been studied almost exclusively with Monte Carlo simulations. In
this paper we present the first all-orders factorization theorem for a
two-prong discriminant based on a jet shape variable, $D_2$, valid for both
signal and background jets. Our factorization theorem simultaneously describes
the production of both collinear and soft subjets, and we introduce a novel
zero-bin procedure to correctly describe the transition region between these
limits. By proving an all orders factorization theorem, we enable a
systematically improvable description, and allow for precision comparisons
between data, Monte Carlo, and first principles QCD calculations for jet
substructure observables. Using our factorization theorem, we present numerical
results for the discrimination of a boosted $Z$ boson from massive QCD
background jets. We compare our results with Monte Carlo predictions which
allows for a detailed understanding of the extent to which these generators
accurately describe the formation of two-prong QCD jets, and informs their
usage in substructure analyses. Our calculation also provides considerable
insight into the discrimination power and calculability of jet substructure
observables in general.
