We investigate the thick brane model in Palatini $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity.
The brane is generated by a real scalar field with a scalar potential. We solve
the system analytically and obtain a series of thick brane solutions for the
$f(\mathcal{R})=\mathcal{R}+\alpha \mathcal{R}^2$-brane model. It is shown that
tensor perturbations of the metric are stable for
$df({\mathcal{R}})/d{\mathcal{R}}>0$. For nonconstant curvature solutions, the
graviton zero mode can be localized on the brane, which indicates that the
four-dimensional gravity can be recovered on the brane. Mass spectrum of
graviton KK modes and their corrections to the Newtonian potential are also
discussed.
