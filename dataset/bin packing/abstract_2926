During the last decade, the laser trapping technique has been actively
applied to elucidate the property of macromolecules, DNA, RNA, cytoskeleton
fibres, etc. Due to the inherent difficulty in the direct trapping of single
molecules at approximately 300 K, most of the current studies on laser trapping
utilize the experimental technique to grasp microbeads that are attached to a
single macromolecule, instead of using direct trapping. A few studies have
demonstrated the applicability of laser trapping for highly packed compact DNA
under a `poor' solvent condition without any beads. The present study achieves
laser trapping on a single DNA molecule under a `good' solvent condition
without any microbeads. The time-dependent change of the conformation
accompanied by ON/OFF laser irradiation was measured and analysed in terms of
the entrapment and release of a coiled polymer around a micrometer-sized
potential.
