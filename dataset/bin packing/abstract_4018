We report the first interferomteric detection of 183 GHz water emission in
the low-mass protostar Serpens SMM1 using the Submillimeter Array with a
resolution of 3$"$ and rms of $\sim$7 Jy in a 3 km s$^{-1}$ bin. Due to the
small size and high brightnessof more than 240 Jy/beam, it appears to be maser
emission. In total three maser spots were detected out to $\sim$ 700 AU from
the central protostar, lying along the red-shifted outflow axis, outside the
circumstellar disk but within the envelope region as evidenced by the continuum
measurements. Two of the maser spots appear to be blue-shifted by about 1 to 2
km s$^{-1}$. No extended or compact thermal emission from a passively heated
protostellar envelope was detected with a limit of 7 Jy (16 K), in agreement
with recent modelling efforts. We propose that the maser spots originate within
the cavity walls due to the interaction of the outflow jet with the surrounding
protostellar envelope. Hydrodynamical models predict that such regions can be
dense and warm enough to invert the 183 GHz water transition.
