The structure and the corresponding electron diffraction patterns of
quasicrystals are explained by unit-cell twinning. The twinning operation is
applied to the primitive golden rhombohedra, obtained by a slight deformation
of a parent cubic close-packed structure. The deformation is determined by the
requirement that the applied multiple twinning fills the space exactly,
resembling thus the five-fold rotational symmetry. It is further shown that
both, the rotational and translational symmetries are in accord with all rules
of classical crystallography and that quasicrystals do not represent an
exception to the huge family of solid state structures. The stacking of
multiply twinned star polyhedra, called "stellae dodecangulae", keeps the basic
golden prolate rhombohedra of adjacent "stellae" in-phase. A strong dynamical
scattering accounts for all remaining reflections in the reciprocal space, not
being accounted for by the primary diffraction. Simulated diffraction patterns
are in accord with the published experimental patterns of MnAl6.
