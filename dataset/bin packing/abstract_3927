Experimenters report an upper limit if the signal they are trying to detect
is non-existent or below their experiment's sensitivity. Such experiments may
be contaminated with a background too poorly understood to subtract. If the
background is distributed differently in some parameter from the expected
signal, it is possible to take advantage of this difference to get a stronger
limit than would be possible if the difference in distribution were ignored. We
discuss the ``Maximum Gap'' method, which finds the best gap between events for
setting an upper limit, and generalize to ``Optimum Interval'' methods, which
use intervals with especially few events. These methods, which apply to the
case of relatively small backgrounds, do not use binning, are relatively
insensitive to cuts on the range of the parameter, are parameter independent
(i.e., do not change when a one-one change of variables is made), and provide
true, though possibly conservative, classical one-sided confidence intervals.
