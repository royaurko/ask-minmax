We report scanning tunneling microscopy observations, which imply that all
atoms in a close-packed copper surface move frequently, even at room
temperature. Using a low density of embedded indium `tracer' atoms, we
visualize the diffusive motion of surface atoms. Surprisingly, the indium atoms
seem to make concerted, long jumps. Responsible for this motion is an ultra-low
density of surface vacancies, diffusing rapidly within the surface. This
interpretation is supported by a detailed analysis of the displacement
distribution of the indium atoms, which reveals a shape characteristic for the
vacancy mediated diffusion mechanism that we propose.
