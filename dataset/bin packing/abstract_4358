Recent developments in stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy
achieved nanometer scale resolution and showed great potential in live cell
imaging. Yet, STED nanoscopy techniques are based on single point-scanning.
This constitutes a drawback for wide field imaging, since the gain in spatial
resolution requires dense pixelation and hence long recording times. Here we
achieve massive parallelization of STED nanoscopy using wide-field excitation
together with well-designed optical lattices for depletion and a fast camera
for detection. Acquisition of large field of view super-resolved images
requires scanning over a single unit cell of the optical lattice which can be
as small as 290 nm*290nm. Interference STED (In-STED) images of 2.9 {\mu}m* 2.9
{\mu}m with resolution down to 70 nm are obtained at 12.5 frames per second.
The development of this technique opens many prospects for fast wide-field
nanoscopy.
