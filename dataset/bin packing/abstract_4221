In this paper we discuss the use of cooperative game theory for analyzing
interference channels. We extend our previous work, to games with N players as
well as frequency selective channels and joint TDM/FDM strategies.
  We show that the Nash bargaining solution can be computed using convex
optimization techniques. We also show that the same results are applicable to
interference channels where only statistical knowledge of the channel is
available. Moreover, for the special case of two players $2\times K$ frequency
selective channel (with K frequency bins) we provide an $O(K \log_2 K)$
complexity algorithm for computing the Nash bargaining solution under mask
constraint and using joint FDM/TDM strategies. Simulation results are also
provided.
