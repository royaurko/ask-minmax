With the goal of measuring localization in disordered interacting systems, we
examine the finite-size scaling of the geometrically-averaged density of states
calculated from the local Green's function with finite energy resolution. Our
results show that, unlike in a simple energy binning procedure, there is no
limit in which the finite energy resolution is irrelevant.
