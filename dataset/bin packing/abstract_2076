We demonstrate an all-optical delay line in hot cesium vapor that tunably
delays 275 ps input pulses up to 6.8 ns and 740 input ps pulses up to 59 ns
(group index of approximately 200) with little pulse distortion. The delay is
made tunable with a fast reconfiguration time (hundreds of ns) by optically
pumping out of the atomic ground states.
