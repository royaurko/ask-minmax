In the HARP experiment the large-angle spectrometer is using a cylindrical
TPC as main tracking and particle identification detector. The momentum scale
of reconstructed tracks in the TPC is the most important systematic error for
the majority of kinematic bins used for the HARP measurements of the
double-differential production cross-section of charged pions in proton
interactions on nuclear targets at large angle. The HARP TPC operated with a
number of hardware shortfalls and operational mistakes. Thus it was important
to control and characterize its momentum calibration. While it was not possible
to enter a direct particle beam into the sensitive volume of the TPC to
calibrate the detector, a set of physical processes and detector properties
were exploited to achieve a precise calibration of the apparatus. In the
following we recall the main issues concerning the momentum measurement in the
HARP TPC, and describe the cross-checks made to validate the momentum scale. As
a conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that the measurement of momentum is
correct within the published precision of 3%.
