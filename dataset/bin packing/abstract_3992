A two-dimensional strongly-coupled dusty plasma is modeled using Langevin and
frictionless molecular dynamical simulations. The static viscosity $\eta$ and
the wave-number-dependent viscosity $\eta(k)$ are calculated from the
microscopic shear in the random motion of particles. A recently developed
method of calculating the wave-number-dependent viscosity $\eta(k)$ is
validated by comparing the results of $\eta(k)$ from the two simulations. It is
also verified that the Green-Kubo relation can still yield an accurate measure
of the static viscosity $\eta$ in the presence of a modest level of friction as
in dusty plasma experiments.
