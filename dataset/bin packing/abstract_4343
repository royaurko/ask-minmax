We report a detailed calorimetric study on single crystals of the
5$d$-transition metal pnictide SrPt2As2 with a superconducting critical
temperature $T_c$ $\sim$5K. The peculiar field dependence of the electronic
specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ can be decomposed into two linear
components. Moreover, the temperature evolution of the electronic specific heat
below $T_c$ is best described by a two-gap model. These findings suggest that
two energy gaps are associated with the superconductivity. In parallel, we show
that the spin-lattice relaxation time $T_1$, through nuclear magnetic resonance
measurement, obeys the so-called Korringa relation well. This, along with the
$T^2$ dependence of resistivity at low temperatures, points to a Fermi liquid
ground state in this material.
