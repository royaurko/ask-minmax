A new class of spherical codes is constructed by selecting a finite subset of
flat tori from a foliation of the unit sphere S^{2L-1} of R^{2L} and designing
a structured codebook on each torus layer. The resulting spherical code can be
the image of a lattice restricted to a specific hyperbox in R^L in each layer.
Group structure and homogeneity, useful for efficient storage and decoding, are
inherited from the underlying lattice codebook. A systematic method for
constructing such codes are presented and, as an example, the Leech lattice is
used to construct a spherical code in R^{48}. Upper and lower bounds on the
performance, the asymptotic packing density and a method for decoding are
derived.
