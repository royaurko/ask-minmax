A packing of a graph G with Hamilton cycles is a set of edge-disjoint
Hamilton cycles in G. Such packings have been studied intensively and recent
results imply that a largest packing of Hamilton cycles in G_n,p a.a.s. has
size \lfloor delta(G_n,p) /2 \rfloor. Glebov, Krivelevich and Szab\'o recently
initiated research on the `dual' problem, where one asks for a set of Hamilton
cycles covering all edges of G. Our main result states that for log^{117}n / n
< p < 1-n^{-1/8}, a.a.s. the edges of G_n,p can be covered by \lceil
Delta(G_n,p)/2 \rceil Hamilton cycles. This is clearly optimal and improves an
approximate result of Glebov, Krivelevich and Szab\'o, which holds for p >
n^{-1+\eps}. Our proof is based on a result of Knox, K\"uhn and Osthus on
packing Hamilton cycles in pseudorandom graphs.
