We utilize Kepler data to study the precision differential photometric
variability of solar-type and cooler stars at different timescales, ranging
from half an hour to 3 months. We define a diagnostic that characterizes the
median differential intensity change between data bins of a given timescale. We
apply the same diagnostics to SOHO data that has been rendered comparable to
Kepler. The Sun exhibits similar photometric variability on all timescales as
comparable solar-type stars in the Kepler field (it is not unusually quiet).
The previously-defined photometric "range" serves as our activity proxy (driven
by starspot coverage). We revisit the fraction of comparable stars in the
Kepler field that are more active than the Sun. The exact active fraction
depends on what is meant by "more active than the Sun", and on the magnitude
limit of the sample of stars considered. This active fraction is between a
quarter and a third (depending on the timescale). We argue that a reliable
result requires timescales of half a day or longer and stars brighter than
Kepler magnitude of 14, otherwise non-stellar noise distorts it. We also
analyze main sequence stars grouped by temperature from 6500-3500K. As one
moves to cooler stars, the active fraction of stars becomes steadily larger
(greater than 90% for early M dwarfs). The Sun is a good photometric model at
all timescales for those cooler stars that have long-term variability within
the span of solar variability.
