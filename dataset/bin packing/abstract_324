We present a model of (modified) gravity on spacetimes with fractal structure
based on packing of spheres, which are (Euclidean) variants of the Packed Swiss
Cheese Cosmology models. As the action functional for gravity we consider the
spectral action of noncommutative geometry, and we compute its asymptotic
expansion on a space obtained as an Apollonian packing of 3-dimensional spheres
inside a 4-dimensional ball. Using information from the zeta function of the
Dirac operator of the spectral triple, we show that the leading terms in the
asymptotic expansion of the spectral action consist of a zeta regularization of
the divergent sum of the leading terms of the spectral actions of the
individual spheres in the packing, which accounts for the contribution of the
points 1 and 3 in the dimension spectrum (as in the case of a 3-sphere). There
is also an additional term coming from the residue at the additional point in
the dimension spectrum that corresponds to the packing constant. It detects the
fractality of the residue set of the sphere packing. We show that the presence
of fractality influences the shape of the slow-roll potential for inflation,
obtained from the spectral action. We also discuss the effect of truncating the
fractal structure at a certain scale related to the energy scale in the
spectral action.
