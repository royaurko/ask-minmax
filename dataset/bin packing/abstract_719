Loose granular structures stabilized against gravity by an effective cohesive
force are investigated on a microscopic basis using contact dynamics. We study
the influence of the granular Bond number on the density profiles and the
generation process of packings, generated by ballistic deposition under
gravity. The internal compaction occurs discontinuously in small avalanches and
we study their size distribution. We also develop a model explaining the final
density profiles based on insight about the collapse of a packing under changes
of the Bond number.
