We present results of a search for a possible signal from small scale solar
transient events (such as flares and interplanetary shocks) as well as possible
counterparts to Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) observed simultaneously by the Tupi muon
telescope Niteroi-Brazil, 22.90S, 43.20W, 3 m above sea level) and the Pierre
Auger Observatory surface detectors (Malargue-Argentina, 69.30S, 35.30W,
altitude 1400 m). Both cosmic ray experiments are located inside the South
Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. Our analysis of several examples shows
similarities in the behavior of the counting rate of low energy (above 100 MeV)
particles in association with the solar activity (solar flares and
interplanetary shocks). We also report an observation by the Tupi experiment of
the enhancement of muons at ground level with a significance higher than 8
sigma in the 1-sec binning counting rate (raw data) in close time coincidence
(T-184 sec) with the Swift-BAT GRB110928B (trigger=504307). The GRB 110928B
coordinates are in the field of view of the vertical Tupi telescope, and the
burst was close to the MAXI source J1836-194. The 5-min muon counting rate in
the vertical Tupi telescope as well as publicly available data from Auger (15
minutes averages of the scaler rates) show small peaks above the background
fluctuations at the time following the Swift-BAT GRB 110928B trigger. In
accordance with the long duration trigger, this signal can possibly suggest a
long GRB, with a precursor narrow peak at T-184 sec.
