The multi-particle Bose-Einstein correlations are the source of
''intermittency'' in high energy hadronic collisions. The power-law like
increase of factorial moments with decreasing bin size was obtained by complete
event weighing technique with gaussian approximation of space-time particle
emitting source shape. The value of source size parameter was found to be
higher than the common one fitted with the help of the standard Handbury
Brown-Twiss procedure.
