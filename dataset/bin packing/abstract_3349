Using a combination of isothermal-isobaric Monte Carlo and microcanonical
molecular dynamics we investigate the relation between structure and
self-diffusion in various phases of a model liquid crystal using the
Gay-Berne-Kihara potential. These molecules are confined to a mesoscopic
slit-pore with atomically smooth substrate surfaces. As reported recently [see
M. G. Mazza {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 105}, 227802 (2010)], a
reentrant nematic (RN) phase may form at sufficiently high pressures/densities.
This phase is characterized by a high degree of nematic order and a
substantially enhanced self-diffusivity in the direction of the director
$\hat{\bm{n}}$ which exceeds that of the lower-density nematic and an
intermittent smectic A phase by about an order of magnitude. Here we
demonstrate that the unique transport behavior in the RN phase may be linked to
a confinement-induced packing effect which causes the formation of
supramolecular, string-like conformations. The strings consist of several
individual molecules that are capable of travelling in the direction of
$\hat{\bm{n}}$ as individual "trains" consisting of chains of molecular "cars".
Individual trains run in parallel and may pass each other at sufficiently high
pressures.
