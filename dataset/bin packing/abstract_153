This paper investigates several global rigidity issues for polyhedral
surfaces including inversive distance circle packings. Inversive distance
circle packings are polyhedral surfaces introduced by P. Bowers and K.
Stephenson as a generalization of Andreev-Thurston's circle packing. They
conjectured that inversive distance circle packings are rigid. Using a recent
work of R. Guo on variational principle associated to the inversive distance
circle packing, we prove rigidity conjecture of Bowers-Stephenson in this
paper. We also show that each polyhedral metric on a triangulated surface is
determined by various discrete curvatures introduced in our previous work,
verifying a conjecture in \cite{Lu1}. As a consequence, we show that the
discrete Laplacian operator determines a Euclidean polyhedral metric up to
scaling.
