We study invariant measures for random countable (finite or infinite)
conformal iterated function systems (IFS) with arbitrary overlaps. We do not
assume any type of separation condition. We prove, under a mild assumption of
finite entropy, the dimensional exactness of the projections of invariant
measures from the shift space, and we give a formula for their dimension, in
the context of random infinite conformal iterated function systems with
overlaps. There exist many differences between our case and the finite
deterministic case studied in [7], and we introduce new methods specific to the
infinite and random case. We apply our results towards a problem related to a
conjecture of Lyons about random continued fractions ([10]), and show that for
Lebesgue-almost all parameters \lambda > 0, the invariant measure \nu_\lambda
is exact dimensional. The finite IFS determining these continued fractions is
not hyperbolic, but we can associate to it a random infinite IFS of
contractions which have overlaps. We study then also other large classes of
random countable iterated function systems with overlaps, namely: a) several
types of random iterated function systems related to Kahane-Salem sets; and b)
randomized infinite IFS in the plane which have uniformly bounded number of
disc overlaps. For all the above classes, we find lower and upper estimates for
the pointwise (and Hausdorff, packing) dimensions of the invariant measures.
