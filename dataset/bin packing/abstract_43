This paper describes an integrated framework for SOC test automation. This
framework is based on a new approach for Wrapper/TAM co-optimization based on
rectangle packing considering the diagonal length of the rectangles to
emphasize on both TAM widths required by a core and its corresponding testing
time .In this paper, an efficient algorithm has been proposed to construct
wrappers that reduce testing time for cores. Rectangle packing has been used to
develop an integrated scheduling algorithm that incorporates power constraints
in the test schedule. The test power consumption is important to consider since
exceeding the system's power limit might damage the system.
