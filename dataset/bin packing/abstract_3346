Controlling anisotropy is a key concept to generate complex functionality in
advanced materials. For this, oriented attachment of nanocrystal building
blocks, a self assembly of particles into larger single crystalline objects, is
one of the most promising approaches in nanotechnology. We report here the 2D
oriented attachment of PbS nanocrystals into ultra-thin single crystal sheets
with dimensions on the micrometer scale. We found that this process is
initiated by co-solvents which alter nucleation and growth rates during the
primary nanocrystal formation and finally driven by dense packing of oleic acid
ligands on {100} facets of PbS. The obtained nanosheets can be readily
integrated in a photo-detector device without further treatment.
