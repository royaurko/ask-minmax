We study the following question: Given an open set $\Omega$, symmetric about
0, and a continuous, integrable, positive definite function $f$, supported in
$\Omega$ and with $f(0)=1$, how large can $\int f$ be? This problem has been
studied so far mostly for convex domains $\Omega$ in Euclidean space. In this
paper we study the question in arbitrary locally compact abelian groups and for
more general domains. Our emphasis is on finite groups as well as Euclidean
spaces and $\ZZ^d$. We exhibit upper bounds for $\int f$ assuming geometric
properties of $\Omega$ of two types: (a) packing properties of $\Omega$ and (b)
spectral properties of $\Omega$. Several examples and applications of the main
theorems are shown. In particular we recover and extend several known results
concerning convex domains in Euclidean space. Also, we investigate the question
of estimating $\int_{\Omega}f$ over possibly dispersed sets solely in
dependence of the given measure $m:=|\Omega|$ of $\Omega$. In this respect we
show that in $\RR$ and $\ZZ$ the integral is maximal for intervals.
