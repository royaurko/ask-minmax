The structural and dynamical properties of suspensions of self-propelled
Brownian particles of spherical shape are investigated in three spatial
dimensions. Our simulations reveal a phase separation into a dilute and a dense
phase, above a certain density and strength of self-propulsion. The packing
fraction of the dense phase approaches random close packing at high activity,
yet the system remains fluid. Although no alignment mechanism exists in this
model, we find long-lived cooperative motion of the particles in the dense
regime. This behavior is probably due to an interface-induced sorting process.
Spatial displacement correlation functions are nearly scale-free for systems
with densities close to or above the glass transition density of passive
systems.
