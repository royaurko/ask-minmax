We test the FLRW cosmology by reconstructing in a model-independent way both
the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the comoving distance $D(z)$ via the most
recent Hubble and Supernovae Ia data. In particular we use: data binning with
direct error propagation, the principal component analysis, the genetic
algorithms and the Pad\'e approximation. Using our reconstructions we evaluate
the Clarkson {\it et al} test known as $\Omega_K(z)$, whose value is constant
in redshift for the standard cosmological model, but deviates elsewise. We find
good agreement with the expected values of the standard cosmological model
within the experimental errors. Finally, we provide forecasts, exploiting the
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations measurements from the Euclid survey.
