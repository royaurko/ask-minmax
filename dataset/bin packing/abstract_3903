We present first results on D^0 meson production via direct reconstruction of
its hadronic decay channel D^0->K pi in minimum bias Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(s_(NN))=200 GeV with p_T up to ~3 GeV/c. Single electron spectra with
1<p_T<4 GeV/c from the charm semi-leptonic decays are also analyzed from the
same data set. The charm production total cross-section per nucleon-nucleon
collision is measured to be 1.11+/-0.08(stat.)+/-0.42(sys.) mb in minimum bias
Au+Au collisions, which is consistent with the N_(bin) scaling compared to d+Au
collisions. The nuclear modification factors of the single electrons in minimum
bias and 0-20% Au+Au collisions are significantly below unity at 1<p_T<4 GeV/c.
