The transverse momentum pT spectra of charged particles is measured by CMS as
a function of collision centrality in PbPb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV.
The results are compared to a pp reference spectrum, constructed by
interpolation between sqrt(s) = 0.9 and 7 TeV measurements. The nuclear
modification factor RAA is constructed by dividing the PbPb pT spectrum,
normalized to the number of binary collisions (Ncoll), by the pp spectrum.
Measured RAA in 0-5% centrality bin is compared to several theoretical
predictions.
