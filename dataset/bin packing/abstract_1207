Motivated by the question of finding a type B analogue of the bijection
between oscillating tableaux and matchings, we find a correspondence between
oscillating m-rim hook tableaux and m-colored matchings, where m is a positive
integer. An oscillating m-rim hook tableau is defined as a sequence
$(\lambda^0,\lambda^1,...,\lambda^{2n})$ of Young diagrams starting with the
empty shape and ending with the empty shape such that $\lambda^{i}$ is obtained
from $\lambda^{i-1}$ by adding an m-rim hook or by deleting an m-rim hook. Our
bijection relies on the generalized Schensted algorithm due to White. An
oscillating 2-rim hook tableau is also called an oscillating domino tableau.
When we restrict our attention to two column oscillating domino tableaux of
length 2n, we are led to a bijection between such tableaux and noncrossing
2-colored matchings on $\{1, 2,..., 2n\}$, which are counted by the product
$C_nC_{n+1}$ of two consecutive Catalan numbers. A 2-colored matching is
noncrossing if there are no two arcs of the same color that are intersecting.
We show that oscillating domino tableaux with at most two columns are in
one-to-one correspondence with Dyck path packings. A Dyck path packing of
length 2n is a pair (D, E), where D is a Dyck path of length 2n, and E is a
dispersed Dyck path of length 2n that is weakly covered by D. So we deduce that
Dyck path packings of length 2n are counted by $C_nC_{n+1}$.
