We completely solve the symplectic packing problem with equally sized balls
for any rational, ruled, symplectic 4-manifolds. We give explicit formulae for
the packing numbers, the generalized Gromov widths, the stability numbers, and
the corresponding obstructing exceptional classes. As a corollary, we give
explicit values for when an ellipsoid of type $E(a, b)$, with $\frac{b}{a} \in
\N$, embeds in a polydisc $P(s,t)$. Under this integrality assumption, we also
give an alternative proof of a recent result of M. Hutchings showing that the
ECH capacities give sharp inequalities for embedding ellipsoids into polydisks.
