It is well-known that there exists a Hawking-Page phase transition between a
spherical AdS black hole and a thermal AdS space. The phase transition does not
happen between a Ricci flat AdS black hole whose horizon is a Ricci flat space
and a thermal AdS space in the Poincare coordinates. However, the Hawking-Page
phase transition occurs between a Ricci flat AdS black hole and an AdS soliton
if at least one of horizon coordinates for the Ricci flat black hole is
compact. We show a similar phase transition betwen the Ricci flat black holes
and deformed AdS solitons in the Gauss-Bonnet gravity and the dilaton gravity
with a Liouville-type potential including the gauged supergravity coming from
the spherical reduction of Dp-branes in type II supergravity. In contrast to
Einstein gravity, we find that the high temperature phase can be dominated
either by black holes or deformed AdS solitons depending on parameters.
