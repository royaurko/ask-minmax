We calculate, for the first time using unquenched lattice QCD form factors,
the Standard Model differential branching fractions $dB/dq^2(B \to Kll)$ for
$l=e, \mu, \tau$ and compare with experimental measurements by Belle, BABAR,
CDF, and LHCb. We report on $\mathcal{B}(B \to Kll)$ in $q^2$ bins used by
experiment and predict $\mathcal{B}(B \to K \tau \tau) = (1.44 \pm 0.15)
10^{-7}$. We also calculate the ratio of branching fractions $R^\mu_e =
1.00023(63)$ and predict $R^\tau_l = 1.159(40)$, for $l=e, \mu$. Finally, we
calculate the "flat term" in the angular distribution of the differential decay
rate $F_H^{e, \mu, \tau}$ in experimentally motivated $q^2$ bins.
