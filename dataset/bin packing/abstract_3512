The effect of mechanical interaction between cells on the spreading of
bacterial population was investigated in one-dimensional space. A continuum
mechanical approach, comprising cell migration, proliferation and exclusion
process, has been employed to elucidate this dynamics. The consequent nonlinear
reaction-diffusion-like equation arises as the constitution of the bacterial
population dynamics. In this model, the bacterial cells are treated as the
rod-like particles that interact, when contacting each other, through the
hard-core repulsion. The repulsion introduces the exclusion effect that causes
the bacterial populations to migrate fast at high density. The propagation of
the bacterial density as the traveling wave front in long time behavior has
been analyzed. The analytical and numerical solutions reveal that the front
speed is enhanced by the exclusion process, which depends on the cell packing
fraction. The qualitative comparison between the theoretical results and the
experimental evidences is discussed.
