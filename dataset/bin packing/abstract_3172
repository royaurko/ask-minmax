Computer simulations of (i) a [C12mim][Tf2N] film of nanometric thickness
squeezed at kbar pressure by a piecewise parabolic confining potential reveal a
mesoscopic in-plane density and composition modulation reminiscent of
mesophases seen in 3D samples of the same room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL).
Near 2D confinement, enforced by a high normal load, relatively long aliphatic
chains are strictly required for the mesophase formation, as confirmed by
computations for two related systems made of (ii) the same [C12mim][Tf2N]
adsorbed at a neutral solid surface and (iii) a shorter-chain RTIL
([C4mim][Tf2N]) trapped in the potential well of part i. No in-plane modulation
is seen for ii and iii. In case ii, the optimal arrangement of charge and
neutral tails is achieved by layering parallel to the surface, while, in case
iii, weaker dispersion and packing interactions are unable to bring aliphatic
tails together into mesoscopic islands, against overwhelming entropy and
Coulomb forces. The onset of in-plane mesophases could greatly affect the
properties of long-chain RTILs used as lubricants.
