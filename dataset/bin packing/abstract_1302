A granular assembly composed of a collection of identical grains may pack
under different microscopic configurations with microscopic features that are
sensitive to the preparation history. A given configuration may also change in
response to external actions such as compression, shearing etc. We show using a
mechanical response function method developed experimentally and numerically,
that the macroscopic stress profiles are strongly dependent on these
preparation procedures. These results were obtained for both two and three
dimensions. The method reveals that, under a given preparation history, the
macroscopic symmetries of the granular material is affected and in most cases
significant departures from isotropy should be observed. This suggests a new
path toward a non-intrusive test of granular material constitutive properties.
