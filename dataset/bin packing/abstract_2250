Let G be a locally compact abelian group (LCA group) and U be an open,
0-symmetric set. Let F:=F(U) be the set of all real valued continuous functions
from G to R which are supported in U and are positive definite. The Turan
constant T(U) of U is then defined as the supremum of the integral of any f on
U, which belongs to F and is normalised to have f(0)=1.
  Mihalis Kolountzakis and the contributor has shown that structural properties -
like spectrality, tiling or packing with a certain set L - of subsets U in
finite or compact groups and on R^d and in Z^d, yield estimates of T(U).
However, in these estimates some notion of the size, i.e. density of L, played
a natural role, and thus in groups where we had no grasp of the notion, we
could not accomplish such estimates.
  In the present work recent new notions of uniform asymptotic upper density
are invoked, allowing a more general investigation of the Turan constant in
relation to the above structural properties. Our main result extends a result
of Arestov and Berdysheva, (also obtained independently and along different
lines by Kolountzakis and the contributor), stating that convex tiles of a Euclidean
space necessarily have T(U) =|U|/2^{d}. In our extension R^d could be replaced
by any LCA group, convexity is dropped, and the condition of tiling is also
relaxed to a certain packing type condition and positive uniform asymptotic
upper density of the set L.
