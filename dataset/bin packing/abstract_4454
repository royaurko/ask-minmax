Through the combination of X-ray diffraction, electrical transport, magnetic
susceptibility, and the heat capacity measurements, we studied the effect of Ce
doping in the newly discovered SrFBiS${2}$ system. It is found that
Sr${0.5}$Ce${0.5}$FBiS${2}$ undergoes a second-order transition below $7.5 K,
followed by a superconducting transition with the critical temperature Tc=2.8
K. Our transport, specific heat and DC-magnetization results suggest the
presence of bulk ferromagneticcorrelation of Ce ion below 7.5 K that coexist
with superconductivity when the temperature is further lowered below 2.8 K.
