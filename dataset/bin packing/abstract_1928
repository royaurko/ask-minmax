We derive, in order of magnitude, the observed astrophysical and cosmological
scales in the Universe, from neutron stars to superclusters of galaxies, up to,
asymptotically, the observed radius of the Universe. This result is obtained by
introducing a recursive scheme of alternating hierachical mechanisms of
three-dimensional and two-dimensional close packings of gravitationally
interacting objects. The iterative scheme yields a rapidly converging geometric
sequence, which can be described as a hierarchical clustering of aggregates,
having the observed radius of the Universe as its fixed point.
