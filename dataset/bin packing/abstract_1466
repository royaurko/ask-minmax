Space-saving design is a requirement that is encountered in biological
systems and the development of modern technological devices alike. Many living
organisms dynamically pack their polymer chains, filaments or membranes inside
of deformable vesicles or soft tissue like cell walls, chorions, and buds.
Surprisingly little is known about morphogenesis due to growth in flexible
confinements - perhaps owing to the daunting complexity lying in the nonlinear
feedback between packed material and expandable cavity. Here we show by
experiments and simulations how geometric and material properties lead to a
plethora of morphologies when elastic filaments are growing far beyond the
equilibrium size of a flexible thin sheet they are confined in. Depending on
friction, sheet flexibility and thickness, we identify four distinct
morphological phases emerging from bifurcation and present the corresponding
phase diagram. Four order parameters quantifying the transitions between these
phases are proposed.
