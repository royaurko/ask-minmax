We continue the analysis of S-wave production amplitudes for the reaction pi-
p -> pi+ pi- n involving the data obtained by the CERN--Cracow-Munich
collaboration on a transversely polarized target at 17.2 GeV/c pi- momentum.
This study deals with the region below the K - Kbar threshold. In particular,
we study the "up-steep" solution containing a narrow S-wave resonance under the
rho(770). This solution exhibits a considerable inelasticity (eta) which does
not have any physical interpretation. Assuming that this inelasticity behaviour
represents an unlikely fluctuation we impose eta = 1 for all data points. This
leads to non-physical results in one third of the pi+pi- effective mass bins
and in the remaining mass bins some parameters behave in a queer way. The
situation is even worse for the "down-steep" solution. We conclude that the
17.2 GeV data cannot be described by a relatively narrow f0(750). The
"down-flat" and "up-steep" solutions which easily pass the eta = 1 constraint
exhibit a slow increase of phase shifts in the rho(770) mass range.
