Pressure isotropization of an equilibrating quark-gluon plasma produced in
relativistic heavy ion collisions is studied within the framework of a
multi-phase transport model (AMPT). The time evolution of the bulk properties
of the quark-gluon plasma is found to depend on its expansion dynamics and
hadronization scheme as well as the scattering cross sections among quarks and
gluons. It is further found that the pressure isotropy of the produced
quark-gluon plasma can only be achieved temporarily, indicating that there is
only partial thermalization during the time evolution of the quark-gluon
plasma.
