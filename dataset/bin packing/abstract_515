We apply two theoretical and two numerical methods to the problem of a disk
placed in a groove and subjected to gravity and a torque. Methods assuming
rigid particles are indeterminate -- certain combinations of forces cannot be
calculated, but only constrained by inequalities. In methods assuming
deformable particles, these combinations of forces are determined by the
history of the packing. Thus indeterminacy in rigid particles becomes memory in
deformable ones. Furthermore, the torque needed to rotate the particle was
calculated. Two different paths to motion were identified. In the first,
contact forces change slowly, and the indeterminacy decreases continuously to
zero, and vanishes precisely at the onset of motion, and the torque needed to
rotate the disk is independent of method and packing history. In the second
way, this torque depends on method and on the history of the packing, and the
forces jump discontinuously at the onset of motion.
