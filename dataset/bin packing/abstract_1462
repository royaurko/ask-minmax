We report experiments investigating jamming fronts in a floating layer of
cornstarch suspension. The suspension has a packing fraction close to jamming,
which dynamically turns into a solid when impacted at a high speed. We show
that the front propagates in both axial and transverse direction from the point
of impact, with a constant ratio between the two directions of propagation of
approximately 2. Inside the jammed solid, we observe an additional compression,
which results from the increasing stress as the solid grows. During the initial
growth of the jammed solid, we measure a force response that can be completely
accounted for by added mass. Only once the jamming front reaches a boundary,
the added mass cannot account for the measured force anymore. We do not,
however, immediately see a strong force response as we would expect when
compressing a jammed packing. Instead, we observe a delay in the force response
on the pusher, which corresponds to the time it takes for the system to develop
a close to uniform velocity gradient that spans the complete system.
