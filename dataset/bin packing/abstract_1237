This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of an open source
library for mathematical morphology based on packed binary and run-length
compressed images for document imaging applications. Abstractions and patterns
useful in the implementation of the interval operations are described. A number
of benchmarks and comparisons to bit-blit based implementations on standard
document images are provided.
