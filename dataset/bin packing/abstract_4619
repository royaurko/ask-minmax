Oxygen adsorption onto Ru (10 bar 1 0) results in the formation of two
ordered overlayers, i.e. a c(2 times 4)-2O and a (2 times 1)pg-2O phase, which
were analyzed by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and density functional
theory (DFT) calculation. In addition, the vibrational properties of these
overlayers were studied by high-resolution electron loss spectroscopy. In both
phases, oxygen occupies the threefold coordinated hcp site along the densely
packed rows on an otherwise unreconstructed surface, i.e. the O atoms are
attached to two atoms in the first Ru layer Ru(1) and to one Ru atom in the
second layer Ru(2), forming zigzag chains along the troughs. While in the
low-coverage c(2 times 4)-O phase, the bond lengths of O to Ru(1) and Ru(2) are
2.08 A and 2.03 A, respectively, corresponding bond lengths in the
high-coverage (2 times 1)-2O phase are 2.01 A and 2.04 A (LEED). Although the
adsorption energy decreases by 220 meV with O coverage (DFT calculations), we
observe experimentally a shortening of the Ru(1)-O bond length with O coverage.
This effect could not be reconciled with the present DFT-GGA calculations. The
nu(Ru-O) stretch mode is found at 67 meV [c(2 times 4)-2O] and 64 meV [(2 times
1)pg-2O].
