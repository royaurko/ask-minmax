The local order units of dense simple liquid are typically three dimensional
(close packed) clusters: hcp, fcc and icosahedrons. We show that the fluid
demonstrates the superstable tetrahedral local order up to temperatures several
orders of magnitude higher than the melting temperature and down to critical
density. While the solid-like local order (hcp, fcc) disappears in the fluid at
much lower temperatures and far above critical density. We conclude that the
supercritical fluid shows the temperature (density) driven two stage "melting"
of the three dimensional local order. We also find that the structure
relaxation times in the supercritical fluid are much larger than ones estimated
for weakly interactive gas even far above the melting line.
