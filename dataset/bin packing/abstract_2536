We consider the production of W and Z bosons in hadron collisions. We present
a selection of numerical results obtained through a fully exclusive calculation
up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD perturbation theory. We
include the $\gamma$--$Z$ interference, finite-width effects, the leptonic
decay of the vector bosons and the corresponding spin correlations. The
calculation is completely realistic, since it allows us to apply arbitrary
kinematical cuts on the final-state leptons and the associated partons, and to
compute the corresponding distributions in the form of bin histograms.
