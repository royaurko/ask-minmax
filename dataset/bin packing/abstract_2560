We study the gravity duals of striped holographic superconductors in the AdS
black hole and AdS soliton backgrounds. We show the dependences of the
condensation and the critical temperature/critical chemical potential on the
inhomogeneity in these two different spacetimes. By exploring the dynamics of
the normal phase through the scalar field perturbation, we argue that the pair
susceptibility and the conductivity can be possible phenomenological
indications to disclose the property of inhomogeneity.
