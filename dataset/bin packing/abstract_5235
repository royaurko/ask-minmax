Here we report on the detailed analysis of the gamma-ray light curve of a
luminous blazar PKS1510-089 observed in the GeV range with the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite during the period 2011 September --
December. By investigating the properties of the detected three major flares
with the shortest possible time binning allowed by the photon statistics, we
find a variety of temporal characteristics and variability patterns. This
includes a clearly asymmetric profile (with a faster flux rise and a slower
decay) of the flare resolved on sub-daily timescales, a superposition of many
short uncorrelated flaring events forming the apparently coherent
longer-duration outburst, and a huge single isolated outburst unresolved down
to the timescale of three-hours. In the latter case we estimate the
corresponding gamma-ray flux doubling timescale to be below one hour, which is
extreme and never previously reported for any active galaxy in the GeV range.
The other unique finding is that the total power released during the studied
rapid and high-amplitude flares constitute the bulk of the power radiatively
dissipated in the source, and a significant fraction of the total kinetic
luminosity of the underlying relativistic outflow. Our analysis allows us to
access directly the characteristic timescales involved in shaping the energy
dissipation processes in the source, and to provide constraints on the location
and the structure of the blazar emission zone in PKS1510-089.
