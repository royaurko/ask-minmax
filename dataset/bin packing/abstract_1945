Opals are structures composed of the closed packing of spheres in the size
range of nano-to-micro meter. They are sintered to create small necks at the
points of contact. We have solved the diffusion problem in such structures. The
relation between the diffusion coefficient and the termal and electrical
conductivity makes possible to estimate the transport coefficients of opal
structures. We estimate this changes as function of the neck size and the
mean-free path of the carriers. The theory presented is also applicable to the
diffusion problem in other periodic structures.
