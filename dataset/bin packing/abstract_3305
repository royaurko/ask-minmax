In this article we study a broad class of integer programming problems in
variable dimension. We show that these so-termed {\em n-fold integer
programming problems} are polynomial time solvable. Our proof involves two
heavy ingredients discovered recently: the equivalence of linear optimization
and so-called directed augmentation, and the stabilization of certain Graver
bases.
  We discuss several applications of our algorithm to multiway transportation
problems and to packing problems. One important consequence of our results is a
polynomial time algorithm for the $d$-dimensional integer transportation
problem for long multiway tables. Another interesting application is a new
algorithm for the classical cutting stock problem.
