Experiments with acoustic waves guided along the mechanically free surface of
an unconsolidated granular packed structure provide information on the
elasticity of granular media at very low pressures that are naturally
controlled by the gravitational acceleration and the depth beneath the surface.
Comparison of the determined dispersion relations for guided surface acoustic
modes with a theoretical model reveals the dependencies of the elastic moduli
of the granular medium on pressure. The experiments confirm recent theoretical
predictions that relaxation of the disordered granular packing through
non-affine motion leads to a peculiar scaling of shear rigidity with pressure
near the jamming transition corresponding to zero pressure. Unexpectedly, and
in disagreement with the most of the available theories, the bulk modulus
depends on pressure in a very similar way to the shear modulus.
