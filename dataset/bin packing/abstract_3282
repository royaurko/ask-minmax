We study the number of edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles one can guarantee in a
sufficiently large graph G on n vertices with minimum degree d = (1/2+a)n. For
any constant a > 0, we give an optimal answer in the following sense: let
reg_even(n,d) denote the degree of the largest even-regular spanning subgraph
one can guarantee in a graph on n vertices with minimum degree d. Then the
number of edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles we find equals reg_even(n,d)/2. The
value of reg_even(n,d) is known for infinitely many values of n and d. We also
extend our results to graphs G of minimum degree d >= n/2, unless G is close to
the extremal constructions for Dirac's theorem. Our proof relies on a recent
and very general result of K\"uhn and Osthus on Hamilton decomposition of
robustly expanding regular graphs.
