Rank modulation is a way of encoding information to correct errors in flash
memory devices as well as impulse noise in transmission lines. Modeling rank
modulation involves construction of packings of the space of permutations
equipped with the Kendall tau distance.
  We present several general constructions of codes in permutations that cover
a broad range of code parameters. In particular, we show a number of ways in
which conventional error-correcting codes can be modified to correct errors in
the Kendall space. Codes that we construct afford simple encoding and decoding
algorithms of essentially the same complexity as required to correct errors in
the Hamming metric. For instance, from binary BCH codes we obtain codes
correcting $t$ Kendall errors in $n$ memory cells that support the order of
$n!/(\log_2n!)^t$ messages, for any constant $t= 1,2,...$ We also construct
families of codes that correct a number of errors that grows with $n$ at
varying rates, from $\Theta(n)$ to $\Theta(n^{2})$. One of our constructions
gives rise to a family of rank modulation codes for which the trade-off between
the number of messages and the number of correctable Kendall errors approaches
the optimal scaling rate. Finally, we list a number of possibilities for
constructing codes of finite length, and give examples of rank modulation codes
with specific parameters.
