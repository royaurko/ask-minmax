Recently quintessence is proposed to explain the observation data of
supernova indicating a time-varying cosmological constant and accelerating
universe. Inspired by this and its mysterious origin, we look for the
possibility of quintessence as the holographic dark matters dominated in the
late time in the brane world scenarios. We consider both the cases of static
and moving brane in a dilaton gravity background. For the static brane we use
the Hamilton-Jacobi method motivated by holographic renormalization group to
study the intrinsic FRW cosmology on the brane and find out the constraint on
the bulk potential for the quintessence. This constraint requires a negative
slowly varying bulk potential which implies an anti-de Sitter-like bulk
geometry and could be possibly realized from the higher dimensional
supergravities or string theory. We find the similar constraint for the moving
brane cases and that the quintessence on it has the effect as a mildly
time-varying Newton constant.
