We study packing densities for set partitions, which is a generalization of
packing words. We use results from the literature about packing densities for
permutations and words to provide packing densities for set partitions. These
results give us most of the packing densities for partitions of the set
$\{1,2,3\}$. In the final section we determine the packing density of the set
partition $\{\{1,3\},\{2\}\}$.
