Packing problems have been of great interest in many diverse contexts for
many centuries. The optimal packing of identical objects has been often invoked
to understand the nature of low temperature phases of matter. In celebrated
work, Kepler conjectured that the densest packing of spheres is realized by
stacking variants of the face-centered cubic lattice and has a packing fraction
of $\pi/(3\sqrt{2}) \sim 0.7405$. Much more recently, an unusually high density
packing of approximately 0.770732 was achieved for congruent ellipsoids. Such
studies are relevant for understanding the structure of crystals, glasses, the
storage and jamming of granular materials, ceramics, and the assembly of viral
capsid structures. Here we carry out analytical studies of the stacking of
close-packed planar layers of systems made up of truncated cones possessing
uniaxial symmetry. We present examples of high density packing whose order is
characterized by a {\em broken symmetry} arising from the shape of the
constituent objects. We find a biaxial arrangement of solid cones with a
packing fraction of $\pi/4$. For truncated cones, there are two distinct
regimes, characterized by different packing arrangements, depending on the
ratio $c$ of the base radii of the truncated cones with a transition at
$c^*=\sqrt{2}-1$.
