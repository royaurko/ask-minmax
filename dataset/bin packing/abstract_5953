There is a growing number of supernovae (SNe), mainly of Type IIn, which
present an outburst prior to their presumably final explosion. These precursors
may affect the SN display, and are likely related to some poorly charted
phenomena in the final stages of stellar evolution. Here we present a sample of
16 SNe IIn for which we have Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) observations
obtained prior to the SN explosion. By coadding these images taken prior to the
explosion in time bins, we search for precursor events. We find five Type IIn
SNe that likely have at least one possible precursor event, three of which are
reported here for the first time. For each SN we calculate the control time.
Based on this analysis we find that precursor events among SNe IIn are common:
at the one-sided 99% confidence level, more than 50% of SNe IIn have at least
one pre-explosion outburst that is brighter than absolute magnitude -14, taking
place up to 1/3 yr prior to the SN explosion. The average rate of such
precursor events during the year prior to the SN explosion is likely larger
than one per year, and fainter precursors are possibly even more common. We
also find possible correlations between the integrated luminosity of the
precursor, and the SN total radiated energy, peak luminosity, and rise time.
These correlations are expected if the precursors are mass-ejection events, and
the early-time light curve of these SNe is powered by interaction of the SN
shock and ejecta with optically thick circumstellar material.
