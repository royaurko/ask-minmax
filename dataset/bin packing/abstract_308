We present new techniques to perform adaptive spatial binning of
Integral-Field Spectroscopic (IFS) data to reach a chosen constant
signal-to-noise ratio per bin. These methods are required for the proper
analysis of IFS observations, but can also be used for standard photometric
imagery or any other two-dimensional data. Various schemes are tested and
compared by binning and extracting the stellar kinematics of the Sa galaxy
NGC2273 from spectra obtained with the panoramic IFS SAURON.
