Maximally random jammed states of hard spheres are prototypical glasses. We
study the small wavenumber $k$ behavior of the structure factor $S(k)$ of
overcompressed million-sphere packings as a function of density up to the
jammed state. We find both a precursor to the glassy jammed state evident long
before the jamming density is reached and an associated growing length scale,
extracted from the volume integral of the direct correlation function $c(r)$,
which diverges at the "critical" jammed state. We also define a nonequilibrium
index $X$ and use it to demonstrate that the packings studied are intrinsically
nonequilibrium in nature well before the critical point is reached.
