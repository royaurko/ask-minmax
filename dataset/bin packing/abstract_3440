We exhibit the existence of stable, saturated nuclear matter in the large
$N_{c}$ and heavy quark mass limits of QCD. In this limit, baryons (with the
same spin flavor structure) interact at leading order in $N_{c}$ via a
repulsive interaction due to the Pauli exclusion principle and at subleading
order in $1/N_c$ via the exchange of glueballs. Assuming that the lightest
glueball is a scalar, which implies that the subleading baryon interaction is
attractive, we find that nuclear matter saturates since the subleading
attractive interaction is longer ranged than the leading order repulsive one.
We find that the saturated matter is in the form of a crystal with either a
face-centered cubic or a hexagonal-close-packed symmetry with baryon densities
of $\mathcal{O}((\, \tilde{\alpha}_{s} m_q (\ln
(N_{c}m_{q}\Lambda_{\textrm{QCD}}^{-1}))^{-1})^3 )$. Remarkably, the leading
order expression for the density of saturated nuclear matter is independent of
the lighest glueball mass and scalar-glueball-baryon coupling in the extreme
large $N_{c}$ limit or heavy quark limit (or both), which we define precisely
in this work.
