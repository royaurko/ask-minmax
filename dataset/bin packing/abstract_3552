Dynamics and separation of mixed chiral microswimmers are numerically
investigated in a channel with regular arrays of rigid half-circle obstacles.
For zero shear flow, transport behaviors are the same for different chiral
particles: the average velocity decreases with increase of the rotational
diffusion coefficient, the direction of the transport can be reversed by tuning
the angular velocity, and there exists an optimal value of the packing fraction
at which the average velocity takes its maximal value. However, when the shear
flow is considered, different chiral particles show different behaviors. By
suitably tailoring parameters, particles with different chiralities can move in
different directions and be separated. In addition, we also proposed a space
separation method by introducing a constant load, where counterclockwise and
clockwise particles stay in different regions of the channel.
