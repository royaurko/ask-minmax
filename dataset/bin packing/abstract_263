The topic of totally separable sphere packings is surveyed with a focus on
regular constructions, uniform tilings, and contact number problems. An
enumeration of all regular totally separable sphere packings in $\mathbb{R}^2$,
$\mathbb{R}^3$, and $\mathbb{R}^4$ which are based on convex uniform
tessellations, honeycombs, and tetracombs, respectively, is presented, as well
as a construction of a family of regular totally separable sphere packings in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ that is not based on a convex uniform $d$-honeycomb for $d \geq
3$.
