We obtained long-slit optical spectra of the nuclear regions of 376 galaxies
in the local Universe using the 1.5m Cassini telescope of Bologna Observatory.
Of these spectra, 164 were either never taken before by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), or given by the Nasa Extragalactic Database (NED). With these
new spectra, we contribute investigating the occurrence of active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). Nevertheless, we stress that the present sample is by no means
complete, thus, it cannot be used to perform any demographic study. Following
the method presented in Gavazzi et al. (2011), we classify the nuclear spectra
using a six bin scheme: SEY (Seyfert), sAGN (strong AGN), and wAGN (weak AGN)
represent active galactic nuclei of different levels of activity; HII accounts
for star-forming nuclei; RET (retired) and PAS (passive) refer to nuclei with
poor or no star-formation activity. The spectral classification is performed
using the ratio of 6584 {\lambda} [NII] to H{\alpha} lines and the equivalent
width (EW) of H{\alpha} versus [NII]/H{\alpha} (WHAN diagnostic introduced by
Cid Fernandes and collaborators) after correcting H{\alpha} for underlying
absorption. The obtained spectra are made available in machine readable format
via the Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center (CDS) and NED.
