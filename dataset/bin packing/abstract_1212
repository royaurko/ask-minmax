MANIAC Challenge raises a problem of game theory, different players
strategies intertwine and the success of any player is dependent on the actions
of all players in the system. A truly fair scenario is when all the strategies
are identical, all the nodes co-operate and they all equally share the rewards
and risks that come with every transfer. A successful strategy is one that
tries to diverge from the equilibrium to maximize its own gains and it manages
to do so. We propose the wolf-pack strategy. Unlike standard game-theory based
strategies, our strategy does not penalize the nodes that diverge from fairness
or from equilibrium, as we believe most nodes will do so in an attempt to get
an advantage over the other nodes. The wolf-pack strategy will try to always
find the most successful node or nodes and penalize them. We believe that just
like in nature, a number of small predators can take down the bigger, more
profitable ones. Furthermore during the Challenge we test two different
strategies that provide completely opposite results. These offer a clear
picture of what the best strategy is and the problems of the current system.
