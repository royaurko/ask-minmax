A three-dimensional X-ray tomography is performed to investigate the internal
structure and its evolution of a crumpled aluminum foil. The upper and lower
bounds of the internal geometric fractal dimension are determined, which
increase with the compression. Contrary to the simulation results, we find that
the mass distribution changes from being inhomogeneous to uniform. Corroborated
with the evidence from previous experiments, these findings support the
physical picture that the elastic property precedes the plastic one at
dominating the deformation and mechanical response for all crumpled structures.
We show that the interior of a crumpled ball at the plastic regime can be
mapped to the compact packing of a granular system.
