We describe a novel extension of subspace codes for noncoherent networks,
suitable for use when the network is viewed as a communication system that
introduces both dimension and symbol errors. We show that when symbol erasures
occur in a significantly large number of different basis vectors transmitted
through the network and when the min-cut of the networks is much smaller then
the length of the transmitted codewords, the new family of codes outperforms
their subspace code counterparts.
  For the proposed coding scheme, termed hybrid network coding, we derive two
upper bounds on the size of the codes. These bounds represent a variation of
the Singleton and of the sphere-packing bound. We show that a simple
concatenated scheme that represents a combination of subspace codes and
Reed-Solomon codes is asymptotically optimal with respect to the Singleton
bound. Finally, we describe two efficient decoding algorithms for concatenated
subspace codes that in certain cases have smaller complexity than subspace
decoders.
