We consider the problem of communication over a three user discrete
memoryless interference channel ($3-$IC). The current known coding techniques
for communicating over an arbitrary $3-$IC are based on message splitting,
superposition coding and binning using independent and identically distributed
(iid) random codebooks. In this work, we propose a new ensemble of codes -
partitioned coset codes (PCC) - that possess an appropriate mix of empirical
and algebraic closure properties. We develop coding techniques that exploit
algebraic closure property of PCC to enable efficient communication over
$3-$IC. We analyze the performance of the proposed coding technique to derive
an achievable rate region for the general discrete $3-$IC. Additive and
non-additive examples are identified for which the derived achievable rate
region is the capacity, and moreover, strictly larger than current known
largest achievable rate regions based on iid random codebooks.
