We report first principle numerical study of domain wall (DW) depinning in
two-dimensional magnetic film, which is modeled by 2D random-field Ising system
with the dipole-dipole interaction. We observe nonconventional activation-type
motion of DW and reveal its fractal structure of DW near the depinning
transition. We determine scaling functions describing critical dynamics near
the transition and obtain universal exponents establishing connection between
thermal softening of pinning potential and critical dynamics. We observe that
tuning the strength of the dipole-dipole interaction switches DW dynamics
between two different universality classes corresponding to two distinct
dynamic regimes, motion in the random potential and that in the random force.
