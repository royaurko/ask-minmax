Far off-shell Higgs production in $H \rightarrow WW,ZZ$, is a particularly
powerful probe of Higgs properties, allowing one to disentangle Higgs width and
coupling information unavailable in on-shell rate measurements. These
measurements require an understanding of the cross section in the far off-shell
region in the presence of realistic experimental cuts. We analytically study
the effect of a $p_T$ jet veto on far off-shell cross sections, including
signal-background interference, by utilizing hard functions in the soft
collinear effective theory that are differential in the decay products of the
$W/Z$. Summing large logarithms of $\sqrt{\hat s}/p_T^{veto}$, we find that the
jet veto induces a strong dependence on the partonic centre of mass energy,
$\sqrt{\hat s}$, and modifies distributions in $\sqrt{\hat s}$ or $M_T$. The
example of $gg\rightarrow H \rightarrow WW$ is used to demonstrate these
effects at next to leading log order. We also discuss the importance of jet
vetoes and jet binning for the recent program to extract Higgs couplings and
widths from far off-shell cross sections.
