Hyperuniformity characterizes a state of matter for which density
fluctuations diminish towards zero at the largest length scales. However, the
task of determining whether or not an experimental system is hyperuniform is
experimentally challenging due to finite-resolution, noise and sample-size
effects that influence characterization measurements. Here we explore these
issues, employing video optical microscopy to study hyperuniformity phenomena
in disordered two-dimensional jammed packings of soft spheres. Using a
combination of experiment and simulation we characterize the detrimental
effects of particle polydispersity, image noise, and finite-size effects on the
assignment of hyperuniformity, and we develop a methodology that permits
improved diagnosis of hyperuniformity from real-space measurements. The key to
this improvement is a simple packing reconstruction algorithm that incorporates
particle polydispersity to minimize free volume. In addition, simulations show
that hyperuniformity can be ascertained more accurately in direct space than in
reciprocal space as a result of finite sample-size. Finally, experimental
colloidal packings of soft polymeric spheres are shown to be hyperuniform.
