Charge separation is an important consequence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect.
Within the framework of a multi-phase transport model, the effects of final
state interactions on initial charge separation are studied. We demonstrate
that charge separation can be significantly reduced by the evolution of the
Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Hadronization
and resonance decay can also affect charge separation. Moreover, our results
show that the Chiral Magnetic Effect leads to the modification of the relation
between the charge azimuthal correlation and the elliptic flow that is expected
from transverse momentum conservation only. The transverse momentum and
pseudorapidity dependences of, and the effects of background on the charge
azimuthal correlation are also discussed.
