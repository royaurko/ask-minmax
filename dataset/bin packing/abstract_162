We present an algorithm to compute the exact value of the packing measure of
self-similar sets satisfying the so called SSC and prove its convergence to the
value of the packing measure. We also test the algorithm with examples that
show both, the accuracy of the algorithm for the most regular cases and the
possibility of using the additional information provided by it to obtain
formulas for the packing measure of certain self-similar sets. For example, we
are able to obtain a formula for the packing measure of any Sierpinski gasket
with contractio factor in the interval $(0,1/3]$ (Theorem 2).
