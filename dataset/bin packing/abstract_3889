Event-by-event fluctuations in the multiplicities of charged particles and
photons, and the total transverse energy in 158$\cdot A$ GeV Pb+Pb collisions
are studied for a wide range of centralities. For narrow centrality bins the
multiplicity and transverse energy distributions are found to be near perfect
Gaussians. The effect of detector acceptance on the multiplicity fluctuations
has been studied and demonstrated to follow statistical considerations. The
centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity fluctuations in the
measured data has been found to agree reasonably well with those obtained from
a participant model. However for photons the multiplicity fluctuations has been
found to be lower compared to those obtained from a participant model. The
multiplicity and transverse energy fluctuations have also been compared to
those obtained from the VENUS event generator.
