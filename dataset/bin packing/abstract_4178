The area law of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole suggests that
the black hole should have a lower-dimensional holographic description. It has
been found recently that such holographic pictures could be set up from the
study of the thermodynamics of both outer and inner horizons for a large class
of rotating and charged black holes. For a four-dimensional dyonic
Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, its thermodynamics indicates that it has
multiple holographic pictures not only the electric and magnetic ones
corresponding to the conserved electric and magnetic charges carried by the
black hole, but also the more generic ones generated by the $SL(2,Z)$
transformations. We show that this $SL(2,Z)$ group originates from the
underlying electromagnetic duality symmetry in the Einstein-Maxwell theory. It
turns out that the thermodynamics of the black hole not only encodes the
information of holographic pictures; moreover it could reflect the symmetries
of the underlying theory.
