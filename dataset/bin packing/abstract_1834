We analyze geometrical scaling in deep inelastic scattering using
experimental data from HERA ep collider. Parallel analyses are performed for
energy and Bjorken-x data binnings. In particular, value of parameter \lambda
which governs x-dependence of saturation scale is found for both binnings:
\lambda_En = 0.352 \pm 0.008 and \lambda_Bj = 0.302 \pm 0.004. We use the
following method: \lambda_En is found as a value for which ratios
\sigma^{W1}_{\gamma*p}(\tau)/\sigma^{W2}_{\gamma*p}(\tau) are closest to 1
(\sigma^{Wi}_{\gamma*p} is a photon-proton cross section with definite energy
W_i and \tau = Q^2 x^{\lambda} is a scaling variable); \lambda_Bj is found
analogously using ratios of cross sections with definite Bjorken-x variable. We
show also that GS is present for x<0.2.
