The determination of the densest packings of regular tetrahedra (one of the
five Platonic solids) is attracting great attention as evidenced by the rapid
pace at which packing records are being broken and the fascinating packing
structures that have emerged. Here we provide the most general analytical
formulation to date to construct dense periodic packings of tetrahedra with
four particles per fundamental cell. This analysis results in six-parameter
family of dense tetrahedron packings that includes as special cases recently
discovered "dimer" packings of tetrahedra, including the densest known packings
with density $\phi= 4000/4671 = 0.856347...$. This study strongly suggests that
the latter set of packings are the densest among all packings with a
four-particle basis. Whether they are the densest packings of tetrahedra among
all packings is an open question, but we offer remarks about this issue.
Moreover, we describe a procedure that provides estimates of upper bounds on
the maximal density of tetrahedron packings, which could aid in assessing the
packing efficiency of candidate dense packings.
