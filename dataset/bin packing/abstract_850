Production and processing of colloidal particles require a deeper
understanding of surface charge of particles and interaction of mass and charge
transport in packed beds. The assessment of fundamental parameters is rather
complex due to the additional influence of the particle charge on the structure
of a packed bed. The combination of different measurement techniques (streaming
potential and electroosmosis) allows for separating the effects, based on the
postulation of a new method to quantify the ratio of surface conductance to
liquid conductance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence
of the pH value and compression on the electrohydrodynamic transport
parameters.
