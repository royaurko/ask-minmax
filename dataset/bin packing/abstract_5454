We present observations of two occultations of the extrasolar planet WASP-33b
using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the HST, which allow us to constrain
the temperature structure and composition of its dayside atmosphere. WASP-33b
is the most highly irradiated hot Jupiter discovered to date, and the only
exoplanet known to orbit a delta-Scuti star. We observed in spatial scan mode
to decrease instrument systematic effects in the data, and removed fluctuations
in the data due to stellar pulsations. The RMS for our final, binned spectrum
is approximately 1.05 times the photon noise. We compare our final spectrum,
along with previously published photometric data, to atmospheric models of
WASP-33b spanning a wide range in temperature profiles and chemical
compositions. We find that the data require models with an oxygen-rich chemical
composition and a temperature profile that increases at high altitude. We also
find that our spectrum displays an excess in the measured flux towards short
wavelengths that is best explained as emission from TiO. If confirmed by
additional measurements at shorter wavelengths, this planet would become the
first hot Jupiter with a temperature inversion that can be definitively
attributed to the presence of TiO in its dayside atmosphere.
