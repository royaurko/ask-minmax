We consider a variant of bin packing called multiple-choice vector bin
packing. In this problem we are given a set of items, where each item can be
selected in one of several $D$-dimensional incarnations. We are also given $T$
bin types, each with its own cost and $D$-dimensional size. Our goal is to pack
the items in a set of bins of minimum overall cost. The problem is motivated by
scheduling in networks with guaranteed quality of service (QoS), but due to its
general formulation it has many other applications as well. We present an
approximation algorithm that is guaranteed to produce a solution whose cost is
about $\ln D$ times the optimum. For the running time to be polynomial we
require $D=O(1)$ and $T=O(\log n)$. This extends previous results for vector
bin packing, in which each item has a single incarnation and there is only one
bin type. To obtain our result we also present a PTAS for the multiple-choice
version of multidimensional knapsack, where we are given only one bin and the
goal is to pack a maximum weight set of (incarnations of) items in that bin.
