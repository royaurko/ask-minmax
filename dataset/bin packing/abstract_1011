Kinetic equilibration during the early stage of a relativistic heavy ion
collision is studied using a radiative transport model. Thermalization is found
to dominate over expansion with medium regulated cross sections. Pressure
anisotropy shows an approximate alpha_s scaling when radiative processes are
included. It approaches an asymptotic time evolution on a time scale of 1 to 2
fm/c. Energy density is also found to approach an asymptotic time evolution
that decreases slower than the ideal hydro evolution. These observations
indicate that viscosity is important during the early longitudinal expansion
phase of a relativistic heavy ion collision.
