Using the most recent (April 2003) version of the VLA FIRST survey radio
catalog, we have searched for radio emission from $>2800$ AGN taken from the
most recent (2001) version of the Veron-Cetty and Veron AGN catalog. These AGN
lie in the ~9033 square degrees of sky already covered by the VLA FIRST survey.
Our work has resulted in positive detection of radio emission from 775 AGN of
which 214 are new detections at radio wavelengths.
