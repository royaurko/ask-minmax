Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one of the leading
candidates for Dark Matter. So far the usual procedure for constraining the
WIMP-nucleon cross sections in direct Dark Matter detection experiments have
been to fit the predicted event rate based on some model(s) of the Galactic
halo and of WIMPs to experimental data. One has to assume whether the
spin-independent (SI) or the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-nucleus interaction
dominates, and results of such data analyses are also expressed as functions of
the as yet unknown WIMP mass. In this article, I introduce methods for
extracting information on the WIMP-nucleon cross sections by considering a
general combination of the SI and SD interactions. Neither prior knowledge
about the local density and the velocity distribution of halo WIMPs nor about
their mass is needed. Assuming that an exponential-like shape of the recoil
spectrum is confirmed from experimental data, the required information are only
the measured recoil energies (in low energy ranges) and the number of events in
the first energy bin from two or more experiments.
