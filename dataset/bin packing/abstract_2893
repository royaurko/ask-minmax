We have used a tight-binding model that is fit to first-principles
electronic-structure calculations for titanium to calculate quasi-harmonic
phonons and the Gibbs free energy of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and omega
crystal structures. We show that the true zero-temperature ground-state is the
omega structure, although this has never been observed experimentally at normal
pressure, and that it is the entropy from the thermal population of phonon
states which stabilizes the hcp structure at room temperature. We present the
first completely theoretical prediction of the temperature- and
pressure-dependence of the hcp-omega phase transformation and show that it is
in good agreement with experiment. The quasi-harmonic approximation fails to
adequately treat the bcc phase because the zero-temperature phonons of this
structure are not all stable.
