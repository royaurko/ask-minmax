The flux power spectra of the Lyman-alpha forest from a sample of 27 QSOs
taken with the high resolution echelle spectrograph UVES on VLT are presented.
We find a similar fluctuation amplitude at the peak of the ``3D'' flux power
spectrum at k ~ 0.03 (km/sec)^(-1) as the study by Croft et al. (2002), in the
same redshift range. The amplitude of the flux power spectrum increases with
decreasing redshift if corrected for the increase in the mean flux level as
expected if the evolution of the flux power spectrum is sensitive to the
gravitational growth of matter density fluctuations. This is in agreement with
the findings of McDonald et al. (2000) at larger redshift. The logarithmic
slope of the "3D" flux power spectrum, P_F(k), at large scales k < 0.03
(km/sec)^(-1), is 1.4 +- 0.3, i.e. 0.3 shallower than that found by Croft et
al. (2002) but consistent within the errors.
