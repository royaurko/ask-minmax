A model which accounts for cracking avalanches in piles of grains subject to
external load is introduced and numerically simulated. The stress is
stochastically transferred from higher layers to lower ones. Cracked areas
exhibit various morphologies, depending on the degree of randomness in the
packing and on the ductility of the grains. The external force necessary to
continue the cracking process is constant in wide range of values of the
fraction of already cracked grains. If the grains are very brittle, the force
fluctuations become periodic in early stages of cracking. Distribution of
cracking avalanches obeys a power law with exponent $\tau = 2.4 \pm 0.1$.
