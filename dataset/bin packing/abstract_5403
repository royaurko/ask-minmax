We present the results of an investigation using near-infrared spectra of
Pluto taken on 72 separate nights using SpeX/IRTF. These data were obtained
between 2001 and 2013 at various sub-observer longitudes. The aim of this work
was to confirm the presence of ethane ice and to determine any longitudinal
trends on the surface of Pluto. We computed models of the continuum near the
2.405 {\mu}m band using Hapke theory and calculated an equivalent width of the
ethane absorption feature for six evenly-spaced longitude bins and a grand
average spectrum. The 2.405 {\mu}m band on Pluto was detected at the
7.5-{\sigma} level from the grand average spectrum. Additionally, the band was
found to vary longitudinally with the highest absorption occurring in the
N$_2$-rich region and the lowest absorption occurring in the visibly dark
region. The longitudinal variability of $^{12}$CO does not match that of the
2.405 {\mu}m band, suggesting a minimal contribution to the band by $^{13}$CO.
We argue for ethane production in the atmosphere and present a theory of
volatile transport to explain the observed longitudinal trend.
