If a hyperbolic 3-manifold admits an exceptional Dehn filling, then the
length of the slope of that Dehn filling is known to be at most six. However,
the bound of six appears to be sharp only in the toroidal case. In this paper,
we investigate slope lengths of other exceptional fillings. We construct
hyperbolic 3-manifolds that have the longest known slopes for reducible
fillings. As an intermediate step, we show that the problem of finding the
longest such slope is equivalent to a problem on the maximal density horoball
packings of planar surfaces, which should be of independent interest. We also
discuss lengths of slopes of other exceptional Dehn fillings, and prove that
six is not realized by a slope corresponding to a small Seifert fibered space
filling.
