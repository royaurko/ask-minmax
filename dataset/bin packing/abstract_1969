We measure the local contact forces at both the top and bottom boundaries of
three-dimensional face-centered-cubic and hexagonal-close-packed granular
crystals in response to an external force applied to a small area at the top
surface. Depending on the crystal structure, we find markedly different results
which can be understood in terms of force balance considerations in the
specific geometry of the crystal. Small amounts of disorder are found to create
additional structure at both the top and bottom surfaces.
