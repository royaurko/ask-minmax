Third sound is studied for superfluid films of 4He adsorbed on multiwall
carbon nanotubes packed into an annular resonator. The third sound is generated
with mechanical oscillation of the cell, and detected with carbon bolometers. A
filling curve at temperatures near 250 mK shows oscillations in the third sound
velocity, with maxima at the completion of the 4th and 5th atomic layers. Sharp
changes in the Q factor of the third sound are found at partial layer fillings.
Temperature sweeps at a number of fill points show strong broadening effects on
the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition, and rapidly increasing dissipation, in
qualitative agreement with the predictions of Machta and Guyer. At the 4th
layer completion there is a sudden reduction of the transition temperature
$T_{KT}$, and then a recovery back to linear variation with temperature,
although the slope is considerably smaller than the KT prediction. Some of
these effects may be related to changes in the gas-liquid coexistence regions.
