We demonstrate time-bin entanglement generation in telecom wavelength using a
7 {\mu}m radius Si micro-ring resonator pumped by a continuous wave laser. The
resonator structure can enhance spontaneous four wave mixing, leading to a
photon pair generation rate of about 90-100 Hz with a laser pump power of as
low as -3.92 dBm (0.41 mW). We succeed in observing time-bin entanglement with
the visibility over 92%. Moreover, wavelength-tunability of the entangled
photon pair is demonstrated by changing the operation temperature.
