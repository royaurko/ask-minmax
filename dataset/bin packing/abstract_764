Given a convex disk $K$ and a positive integer $j$, let $\delta_L^j(K)$ and
$\vartheta_L^j(K)$ denote the $j$-fold lattice packing density and the $j$-fold
lattice covering density of $K$, respectively. I will prove that for every
triangle $T$ we have that $\delta_L^j(T)=\frac{2j^2}{2j+1}$ and
$\vartheta_L^j(T)=\frac{2j+1}{2}$. Furthermore, I also obtain that the numbers
of lattices which attain these densities both are
$(2j+1)\prod_{p|2j+1}(1-\frac{2}{p})$, where the product is over the distinct
prime numbers dividing $2j+1$.
