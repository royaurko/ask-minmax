We present a novel framework, called balanced overlay networks (BON), that
provides scalable, decentralized load balancing for distributed computing using
large-scale pools of heterogeneous computers. Fundamentally, BON encodes the
information about each node's available computational resources in the
structure of the links connecting the nodes in the network. This distributed
encoding is self-organized, with each node managing its in-degree and local
connectivity via random-walk sampling. Assignment of incoming jobs to nodes
with the most free resources is also accomplished by sampling the nodes via
short random walks. Extensive simulations show that the resulting highly
dynamic and self-organized graph structure can efficiently balance
computational load throughout large-scale networks. These simulations cover a
wide spectrum of cases, including significant heterogeneity in available
computing resources and high burstiness in incoming load. We provide analytical
results that prove BON's scalability for truly large-scale networks: in
particular we show that under certain ideal conditions, the network structure
converges to Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graphs; our simulation results, however,
show that the algorithm does much better, and the structures seem to approach
the ideal case of d-regular random graphs. We also make a connection between
highly-loaded BONs and the well-known ball-bin randomized load balancing
framework.
