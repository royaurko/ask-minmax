Single-walled carbon nanotubes are promising nanoelectronic materials but
face long-standing challenges including production of pure semiconducting SWNTs
and integration into ordered structures. Here, highly pure semiconducting
single-walled carbon nanotubes are separated from bulk materials and
self-assembled into densely aligned rafts driven by depletion attraction
forces. Microscopy and spectroscopy revealed a high degree of alignment and a
high packing density of ~100 tubes/micron within SWNT rafts. Field-effect
transistors made from aligned SWNT rafts afforded short channel (~150 nm long)
devices comprised of tens of purely semiconducting SWNTs derived from chemical
separation within a < 1 micron channel width, achieving unprecedented high
on-currents (up to ~120 microamperes per device) with high on/off ratios. The
average on-current was ~ 3-4 microamperes per tube. The results demonstrated
densely aligned high quality semiconducting SWNTs for integration into high
performance nanoelectronics.
