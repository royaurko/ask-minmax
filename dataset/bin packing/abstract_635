Calculations of collinear correlation functions in perturbative QCD and
Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) require a prescription for subtracting
soft or zero-bin contributions in order to avoid double counting the
contributions from soft modes. At leading order in $\lambda$, where $\lambda$
is the SCET expansion parameter, the zero-bin subtractions have been argued to
be equivalent to convolution with soft Wilson lines. We give a proof of the
factorization of naive collinear Wilson lines that is crucial for the
derivation of the equivalence. We then check the equivalence by computing the
non-Abelian two-loop mixed collinear-soft contribution to the jet function in
the quark form factor. These results provide strong support for the
equivalence, which can be used to give a nonperturbative definition of the
zero-bin subtraction at lowest order in $\lambda$.
