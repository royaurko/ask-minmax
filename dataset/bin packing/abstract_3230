We study the spontaneously induced general relativity (GR) from the
scalar-tensor gravity. We demonstrate by numerical methods that a novel inner
core can be connected to the Schwarzschild exterior with cosmological constants
and any sectional curvature. Deriving an analytic core metric for a general
exterior, we show that all the nontrivial features of the core, including the
locally holographic entropy packing, are universal for the general exterior in
static spacetimes. We also investigate whether the f(R) gravity can accommodate
the nontrivial core.
