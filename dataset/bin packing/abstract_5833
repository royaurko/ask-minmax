The determination of the broad (0.1-100 keV) spectra of active galaxies is
crucial for understanding and discriminating among emission models, for
estimating the properties of the Comptonising/reflecting region around the
central black hole and for obtaining a firm description of the contribution of
AGN to the Cosmic X-ray Background. Although broad-band X-ray measurements of
AGN have been made in the past, these did not generally pertain to a complete
sample of sources. Since few years, we have started a systematic analysis of
the 0.1-100 keV spectra of a complete sample of AGN selected in the hard X-ray
band (20-40 keV) using low energy data (not always of good quality) from a set
of operating X-ray telescopes. Thanks to data obtained through an XMM-Newton
Large Programme, we have now high quality 0.1-10 keV data for all sources in
the sample; these combined with high energy observations from INTEGRAL/IBIS and
Swift/BAT will allow us to study the spectral properties of this complete
sample. Here in particular, we report the progress made on type 1 AGN, focusing
in particular on the continuum and its high energy cut-off, the reflection
fraction, the absorption properties and the presence of soft excesses and warm
absorbers in our sources. More specifically we discuss the broad-band
properties of 4 sources IGR J00333+6122, Swift J0917.2-6221, GRS 1734-292 and
NGC 6814, which can be considered as the most representative objects of our
sample.
