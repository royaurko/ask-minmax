The global variables like the transverse energy at midrapidity, the charged
particle multiplicity at midrapidity and the total multiplicity of charged
particles are evaluated in the single-freeze-out statistical model for
different centrality bins at RHIC at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=130$ and 200 GeV. Full
description of decays of hadron resonances is applied in these estimations. The
geometric parameters of the model are obtained from the fit to the final data
on the $p_{T}$ spectra. The predicted values of the global variables agree
qualitatively well with the experimental data. The centrality independence of
the total number of charged particles per participant pair has been also
reproduced.
