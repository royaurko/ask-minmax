The up-dated three-phase concept of nuclear matter evolution in course of
cooling down - from the phase of quark-qluon plasma (QGP) through the
intermediate phase allowing for massive constituent quarks (valons), pions and
kaons (QPK) to the phase of hadronic matter (H) - is exploited for the
treatment of relative hadronic yields in the central region of heavy ion
collisions. The most attention is paid to the description of the QPK-phase
which is argued to be a gaseous one and lasts until the valonic spacing
approaches the confinement radius (at the temperature about 110 MeV), when the
valons start fusing to be locked, in the end, within the hadrons. The hadronic
yields emerged from thermal treatment of QPK-phase and simple combinatorial
approach to the hadronization process are shown to fit the available
experimental data from AGS, SPS and RHIC quite well. This provides an
alternative insight into the real origin of the observed relative hadronic
yields which is (to a considerable extent) free of the well known puzzle
inherent in some conventional models where the early chemical freeze-out is
assumed: namely, why the gaseous thermal approach to actually tightly packed
(even overlapping) hadrons seems workable? Many predictions for the other
hadronic yields which could be observed at these machines as well as at LHC are
given.
