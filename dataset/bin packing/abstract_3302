We measure how strong, localized contact adhesion between grains affects the
maximum static critical angle, theta_c, of a dry sand pile. By mixing dimer
grains, each consisting of two spheres that have been rigidly bonded together,
with simple spherical monomer grains, we create sandpiles that contain strong
localized adhesion between a given particle and at most one of its neighbors.
We find that tan(theta_c) increases from 0.45 to 1.1 and the grain packing
fraction, Phi, decreases from 0.58 to 0.52 as we increase the relative number
fraction of dimer particles in the pile, nu_d, from 0 to 1. We attribute the
increase in tan(theta_c(nu_d)) to the enhanced stability of dimers on the
surface, which reduces the density of monomers that need to be accomodated in
the most stable surface traps. A full characterization and geometrical
stability analysis of surface traps provides a good quantitative agreement
between experiment and theory over a wide range of nu_d, without any fitting
parameters.
