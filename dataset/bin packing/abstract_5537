We report on the orbital architectures of Kepler systems having multiple
planet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first six
quarters of Kepler data and reported by Batalha et al. (2013). These data show
899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a
powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using
a generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in
these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable
orbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly
interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical
preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the
distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),
with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying
narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of
adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have
a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding
suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes
is in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probed
by these observations.
