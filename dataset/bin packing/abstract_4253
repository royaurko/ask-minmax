Like the majority of spiral galaxies, NGC 6155 exhibits an exponential
surface brightness profile that steepens significantly at large radii. Using
the VIRUS-P IFU spectrograph, we have gathered spatially resolved spectra of
the system. Modifying the GANDALF spectral fitting routine for use on the
complex stellar populations found in spirals, we find that the average stellar
ages increase significantly beyond the profile break radius. This result is in
good agreement with recent simulations that predict the outskirts of disk
galaxies are populated through stellar migration. With the ability to bin
multiple fibers, we are able to measure stellar population ages down to mu_V~24
mag/sq arcsec.
