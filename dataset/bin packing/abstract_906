Web Based Query Management System (WBQMS) is a methodology to design and to
implement Mobile Business, in which a server is the gateway to connect
databases with clients which sends requests and receives responses in a
distributive manner. The gateway, which communicates with mobile phone via GSM
Modem, receives the coded queries from users and sends packed results back. The
software which communicates with the gateway system via SHORT MESSAGE, packs
users' requests, IDs and codes, and sends the package to the gateway; then
interprets the packed data for the users to read on a page of GUI. Whenever and
wherever they are, the customer can query the information by sending messages
through the client device which may be mobile phone or PC. The mobile clients
can get the appropriate services through the mobile business architecture in
distributed environment. The messages are secured through the client side
encoding mechanism to avoid the intruders. The gateway system is programmed by
Java, while the software at clients by J2ME and the database is created by
Oracle for reliable and interoperable services.
