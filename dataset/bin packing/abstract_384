We study the dynamical properties of recently introduced frustrated lattice
gas models (IFLG and Tetris) for granular media under gentle shaking. We
consider both the case where grains have inter-grain surface interactions and
the case where they have not, corresponding, for instance, to the presence or
absence of moisture in the packs. To characterise the grains packing structure,
we discuss the properties of density distribution. In particular, we consider
the phenomenon of grains domains formation under compaction. New results
amenable of experimental check are discussed along with some important
differences between the dynamics of the present models.
