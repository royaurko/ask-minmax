We consider symplectic manifolds with Hamiltonian torus actions which are
"almost but not quite completely integrable": the dimension of the torus is one
less than half the dimension of the manifold. We provide a complete set of
invariants for such spaces when they are "centered" and the moment map is
proper. In particular, this classifies the moment map preimages of all
sufficiently small open sets, which is an important step towards global
classification. As an application, we construct a full packing of each of the
Grassmanians Gr^+(2,R^5) and Gr^+(2,R^6) by two equal symplectic balls.
