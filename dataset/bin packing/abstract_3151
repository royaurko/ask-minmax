The gargantuan discrepancy between the value of the observed cosmological
constant and that expected from the zero-point energy of known matter fields
can be eliminated by supposing that on macroscopic scales the overwhelming
majority of any volume of spacetime is literal nothingness. This nothingness or
void results from the proliferative nucleation of tiny void bubbles (a.k.a.
"bubbles of nothing" or "semi wormholes") that expand until their surfaces,
presumed to be 2-branes, collide. This process results in a dense packing of
void bubbles of various sizes that leaves only the vanishing interstitial
regions between bubbles for spacetime to occupy. This vast reduction in the
amount of actual space contained within any apparent volume, reduces
correspondingly the effective zero-point energy density. Unlike previous
wormhole-based attempts at vacuum energy suppression, the current approach is
entirely Lorentzian and results in a nonzero value for the cosmological
constant.
