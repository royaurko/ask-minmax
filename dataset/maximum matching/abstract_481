Suppose we are given an almost isometry $\phi:E\to \mathbb R^D$ where $E$ is
a finite subset of $\mathbb R^D$. Is it possible to decide if $\phi$ can be
extended to an almost isometry to the whole of $\mathbb R^D$? In this paper, we
study this interesting question. It turns out that this question is also basic
to problems of interpolation and matching in theoretical computer science. We
study these connections as well.
