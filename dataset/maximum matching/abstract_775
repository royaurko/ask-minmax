Several exact recovery criteria (ERC) ensuring that orthogonal matching
pursuit (OMP) identifies the correct support of sparse signals have been
developed in the last few years. These ERC rely on the restricted isometry
property (RIP), the associated restricted isometry constant (RIC) and sometimes
the restricted orthogonality constant (ROC). In this paper, three of the most
recent ERC for OMP are examined. The contribution is to show that these ERC
remain valid for a generalization of OMP, entitled simultaneous orthogonal
matching pursuit (SOMP), that is capable to process several measurement vectors
simultaneously and return a common support estimate for the underlying sparse
vectors. The sharpness of the bounds is also briefly discussed in light of
previous works focusing on OMP.
