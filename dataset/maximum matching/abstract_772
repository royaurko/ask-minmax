We demonstrate the potential of birefringence-based, all-optical, ultrafast
conversion between the transverse modes in integrated optical waveguides by
modelling the conversion process by numerically solving the multi-mode coupled
nonlinear Schroedinger equations. The observed conversion is induced by a
control beam and due to the Kerr effect, resulting in a transient index grating
which coherently scatters probe light from one transverse waveguide mode into
another. We introduce birefringent phase matching to enable efficient
all-optically induced mode conversion at different wavelengths of the control
and probe beam. It is shown that tailoring the waveguide geometry can be
exploited to explicitly minimize intermodal group delay as well as to maximize
the nonlinear coefficient, under the constraint of a phase matching condition.
The waveguide geometries investigated here, allow for mode conversion with over
two orders of magnitude reduced control pulse energy compared to previous
schemes and thereby promise nonlinear mode switching exceeding efficiencies of
90% at switching energies below 1 nJ.
