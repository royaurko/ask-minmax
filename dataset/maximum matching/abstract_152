We recently presented radio observations of a large sample of radio-loud
broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from the SDSS and FIRST surveys, as well as
a well matched sample of unabsorbed quasars, primarily to measure their radio
spectral indices and estimate ensemble orientations. Here, we analyze the SDSS
spectra of these samples and compare the rest-frame ultraviolet properties of
radio-loud BAL and non-BAL quasars. Ultraviolet properties include the
continuum shape, emission-line measurements of C IV, Al III, C III], Fe II, and
Mg II, and BAL properties including the balnicity index (BI), absorption index
(AI), and minimum and maximum outflow velocities. We find that radio-loud BAL
quasars have similar ultraviolet properties compared to radio-loud non-BAL
sources, though they do appear to have redder continua and stronger Fe II
emission, which is consistent with what is found for radio-quiet BAL sources.
No correlations exist between outflow properties and orientation (radio
spectral index), suggesting that BAL winds along any line of sight are driven
by the same mechanisms. There are also few correlations between spectral index
and other properties. We conclude that BAL outflows occur along all lines of
sight with similar strengths and velocities.
