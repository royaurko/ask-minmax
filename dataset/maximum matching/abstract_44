We computed the energy spectra of the incident (on an air shower array)
ultrahigh-energy (E > 4x10^19 eV) cosmic rays (CRs) that were accelerated in
nearby Seyfert nuclei at redshifts z<= 0.0092 and in BL Lac objects. For our
calculations, we took the distribution of these sources over the sky from
catalogs of active galactic nuclei. In accordance with the possible particle
acceleration mechanisms, the initial CR spectrum was assumed to be
monoenergetic for BL Lac's and a power law for Seyfert nuclei. The CR energy
losses in intergalactic space were computed by the Monte Carlo method. The
artificial proton statistic was 10^5 for each case considered. The computed
spectra of the particles incident on an air shower array agree with the
measurements, which indirectly confirms the adopted acceleration models. At
energies E>=10^20 eV, the spectrum of the protons from nearby Seyfert nuclei
that reached an air shower array closely matches the spectrum of the particles
from BL Lac's. BL Lac's are, on average, several hundred Mpc away. Therefore,
it is hard to tell whether a blackbody cutoff exists or not by analyzing the
shape of the measured spectrum at E>= 5x10^19 eV.
