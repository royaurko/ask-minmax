Matching of a LTB metric representing dust matter to a background FRW
universe across a null hypersurface is studied. In general, an unrestricted
matching is possible only if the background FRW is flat or open. There is in
general no gravitational impulsive wave present on the null hypersurface which
is shear-free and expanding. Special cases of the vanishing pressure or energy
density on the hypersurface is discussed. In the case of vanishing energy
momentum tensor of the null hypersurface, i.e. in the case of a null boundary,
it turns out that all possible definitions of the Hubble parameter on the null
hypersurface, being those of LTB or that of FRW, are equivalent, and that a
flat FRW can only be joined smoothly to a flat LTB.
