The role of commensurability and the interplay of correlated disorder and
interactions on vortex dynamics in the presence of columnar pins is studied via
molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations of dynamics reveal substantial
caging effects and a non-monotonic dependence of the critical current with
enhancements near integer values of the matching field $B_{\phi}$ and
$3B_{\phi}$ in agreement with experiments on the cuprates. We find qualitative
differences in the phase diagram for small and large values of the matching
field.
