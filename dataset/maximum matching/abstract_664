We explore the recent weak/strong coupling match of three-point functions in
the AdS/CFT correspondence for two semi-classical operators and one light
chiral primary operator found by Escobedo et al. This match is between the
tree-level three-point function with the two semi-classical operators described
by coherent states while on the string side the three-point function is found
in the Frolov-Tseytlin limit. We compute the one-loop correction to the
three-point function on the gauge theory side and compare this to the
corresponding correction on the string theory side. We find that the
corrections do not match. Finally, we discuss the possibility of further
contributions on the gauge theory side that can alter our results.
