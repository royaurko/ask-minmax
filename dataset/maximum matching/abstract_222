The exact matching condition is given for hadron matrix elements calculated
in any two different schemes, in particular, in the lattice and dimensional
regularization, (modified) minimal subtraction $\overline{\rm MS}$ schemes. The
result provides insight into and permits to go beyond Lepage and Mackenzie's
mean field theory of removing tadpole contributions in lattice operators.
