We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of multiple-pulse laser alignment
methods for asymmetric-top molecules. As an example, we choose SO_2 and
investigate the alignment dynamics induced by two different sequences, each
consisting of four identical laser pulses. Each sequence differs only in the
time delay between the pulses. Equally spaced pulses matching the alignment
revival of the symmetrized SO_2 rotor model are exploited in the first
sequence. The pulse separations in the second sequence are short compared to
the rotation dynamics of the molecule and monotonically increase the degree of
alignment until the maximum alignment is reached. We point out the significant
differences between the alignment dynamics of SO_2 treated as an asymmetric-top
and a symmetric-top rotor, respectively. We also explain why the fast sequence
of laser pulses creates considerably stronger one-dimensional molecular
alignment for asymmetric-top molecules. In addition, we show that
multiple-pulse trains with elliptically polarized pulses do not enhance
one-dimensional alignment or create three-dimensional alignment.
