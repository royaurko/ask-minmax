A \emph{clique} is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices in a graph. We
determine the maximum number of cliques in a graph for the following graph
classes: (1) graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges; (2) graphs with $n$
vertices, $m$ edges, and maximum degree $\Delta$; (3) $d$-degenerate graphs
with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges; (4) planar graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$
edges; and (5) graphs with $n$ vertices and no $K_5$-minor or no
$K_{3,3}$-minor. For example, the maximum number of cliques in a planar graph
with $n$ vertices is $8(n-2)$.
