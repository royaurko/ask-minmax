True phase-matched second-harmonic generation in a waveguide of crosslinkable
ferroelectric liquid crystals is demonstrated. These materials allow the
formation of macroscopically polar structures whose order can be frozen by
photopolymerization. Homeotropic alignment was chosen which offers decisive
advantages compared to other geometries. All parameters contributing to the
conversion efficiency are maximized by deliberately controlling the
supramolecular arrangement. The system has the potential to achieve practical
level of performances as a frequency doubler for low power laser diodes.
