I review the development of numerical evolution codes for general relativity
based upon the characteristic initial value problem. Progress is traced from
the early stage of 1D feasibility studies to 2D axisymmetric codes that
accurately simulate the oscillations and gravitational collapse of relativistic
stars and to current 3D codes that provide pieces of a binary black spacetime.
A prime application of characteristic evolution is to compute waveforms via
Cauchy-characteristic matching, which is also reviewed.
