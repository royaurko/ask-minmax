The contributors present an impedance-matched reduced version of acoustic cloaking
whose mass is in a reasonable range. A layered cloak design with isotropic
material is also proposed for the reduced cloak. Numerical calculations from
the transfer matrix methods show that the present layered cloak can reduce the
scattering of an air cylinder substantially.
