The superheated Meissner state in type-I superconductors is studied both
analytically and numerically within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory.
Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions we have developed a
systematic expansion for the solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equations in the
limit of small $\kappa$, and have determined the maximum superheating field
$H_{\rm sh}$ for the existence of the metastable, superheated Meissner state as
an expansion in powers of $\kappa^{1/2}$. Our numerical solutions of these
equations agree quite well with the asymptotic solutions for $\kappa<0.5$. The
same asymptotic methods are also used to study the stability of the solutions,
as well as a modified version of the Ginzburg-Landau equations which
incorporates nonlocal electrodynamics. Finally, we compare our numerical
results for the superheating field for large-$\kappa$ against recent asymptotic
results for large-$\kappa$, and again find a close agreement. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of the method of matched asymptotic expansions for
dealing with problems in inhomogeneous superconductivity involving boundary
layers.
