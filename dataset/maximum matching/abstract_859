We used fully cosmological, high resolution N-body+SPH simulations to follow
the formation of disk galaxies with a rotational velocity between 140 and 280
Km/sec in a Lambda CDM universe. The simulations include gas cooling, star
formation (SF), the effects of a uniform UV background and a physically
motivated description of feedback from supernovae (SN). Feedback parameters
have been chosen to match the star formation rate and interstellar medium (ISM)
properties of local galaxies. In cosmological simulations galaxies formed
rotationally supported disks with realistic exponential scale lengths and fall
on the I-band and baryonic Tully Fisher relations. The combination of UV
background and SN feedback drastically reduced the number of visible satellites
orbiting inside a Milky Way sized halo, bringing it in fair agreement with
observations. Feedback delays SF in small galaxies and more massive ones
contain older stellar populations. Here we focus on the SF and feedback
implementations. We also briefly discuss how high mass and force resolution and
a realistic description of SF and feedback are important ingredients to match
the observed properties of galaxies.
