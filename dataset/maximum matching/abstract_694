We analyze the results of the German Team Handball Bundesliga for ten seasons
in a model-free statistical time series approach. We will show that the home
advantage is nearly negligible compared to the total sum of goals. Specific
interest has been spent on the time evolution of the team fitness expressed in
terms of the goal difference. In contrast to soccer, our results indicate a
decay of the team fitness values over a season while the long time correlation
behavior over years is nearly comparable. We are able to explain the dominance
of a few teams by the large value for the total number of goals in a match. A
method for the prediction of match winners is presented in good accuracy with
the real results. We analyze the properties of promoted teams and indicate
drastic level changes between the Bundesliga and the second league. Our
findings reflect in good agreement recent discussions on modern successful
attack strategies.
