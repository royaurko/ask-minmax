In this letter, we describe operation of a radio-frequency superconducting
single electron transistor (RF-SSET) with an on-chip superconducting LC
matching network consisting of a spiral inductor L and its capacitance to
ground. The superconducting network has a lower parasitic capacitance and gives
a better matching for the RF-SSET than does a commercial chip inductor.
Moreover, the superconducting network has negligibly low dissipation, leading
to sensitive response to changes in the RF-SSET impedance. The charge
sensitivity 2.4*10^-6 e/(Hz)^1/2 in the sub-gap region and energy sensitivity
of 1.9 hbar indicate that the RF-SSET is operating in the vicinity of the shot
noise limit.
