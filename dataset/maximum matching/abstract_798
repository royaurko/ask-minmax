Low-coverage short-read resequencing experiments have the potential to expand
our understanding of Y chromosome haplogroups. However, the uncertainty
associated with these experiments mean that haplogroups must be assigned
probabilistically to avoid false inferences. We propose an efficient dynamic
programming algorithm that can assign haplogroups by maximum likelihood, and
represent the uncertainty in assignment. We apply this to both genotype and
low-coverage sequencing data, and show that it can assign haplogroups
accurately and with high resolution. The method is implemented as the program
YFitter, which can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/yfitter/
