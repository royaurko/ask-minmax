A matched filter maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio of a signal. In the
recent work of Corron et al. [Chaos 20, 023123 (2010)], a matched filter is
derived for the chaotic waveforms produced by a piecewise-linear system.
Motivated by these results, we describe a pseudo-matched filter, which removes
noise from the same chaotic signal. It consists of a notch filter followed by a
first-order, low-pass filter. We compare quantitatively the matched filter's
performance to that of our pseudo-matched filter using correlation functions in
a simulated radar application. On average, the pseudo-matched filter performs
with a correlation signal-to-noise ratio that is 2.0 dB below that of the
matched filter. Our pseudo-matched filter, though somewhat inferior in
comparison to the matched filter, is easily realizable at high speed (> 1 GHz)
for potential radar applications.
