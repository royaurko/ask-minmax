One-loop matching of heavy-light currents is carried out for a highly
improved lattice action, including the effects of mixings with dimension 4
O(1/M) and O(a) operators. We use the NRQCD action for heavy quarks, the Asqtad
improved naive action for light quarks, and the Symanzik improved glue action.
These results are being used in recent heavy meson decay constant and
semileptonic form factor calculations on the MILC dynamical configurations.
