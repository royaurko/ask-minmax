Stencil computations on low dimensional grids are kernels of many scientific
applications including finite difference methods used to solve partial
differential equations. On typical modern computer architectures, such stencil
computations are limited by the performance of the memory subsystem, namely by
the bandwidth between main memory and the cache. This work considers the
computation of star stencils, like the 5-point and 7-point stencil, in the
external memory model and parallel external memory model and analyses the
constant of the leading term of the non-compulsory I/Os. While optimizing
stencil computations is an active field of research, there has been a
significant gap between the lower bounds and the performance of the algorithms
so far. In two dimensions, this work provides matching constants for lower and
upper bounds closing a multiplicative gap of 4. In three dimensions, the bounds
match up to a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ improving the known results by a factor of
$2 \sqrt{3}\sqrt{B}$, where $B$ is the block (cache line) size of the external
memory model. For dimensions $d\geq 4$, the lower bound is improved between a
factor of $4$ and $6$. For arbitrary dimension~$d$, the first analysis of the
constant of the leading term of the non-compulsory I/Os is presented. For
$d\geq 3$ the lower and upper bound match up to a factor of
$\sqrt[d-1]{d!}\approx \frac{d}{e}$.
