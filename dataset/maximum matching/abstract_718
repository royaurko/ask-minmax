This paper is an addendum to the article by Candelier, Mehaddi & Vauquelin
(2013) where the motion of a particle in a stratified fluid is investigated
theoretically, at small Reynolds and P\'eclet numbers. We review briefly the
method of matched asymptotic expansions which is generally used in order to
determine the force acting on a particle embedded in a given flow, in order to
account for small, but finite, inertia effects. As part of this method, we
present an alternative matching procedure, which is based on a series expansion
of the far-field solution of the problem, performed in the sense of generalized
functions. The way to perform such a series is presented succinctly and a
simple example is provided.
