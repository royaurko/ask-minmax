Complex network null models based on entropy maximization are becoming a
powerful tool to characterize and analyze data from real systems. However, it
is not easy to extract good and unbiased information from these models: A
proper understanding of the nature of the underlying events represented in them
is crucial. In this paper we emphasize this fact stressing how an accurate
counting of configurations compatible with given constraints is fundamental to
build good null models for the case of networks with integer valued adjacency
matrices constructed from aggregation of one or multiple layers. We show how
different assumptions about the elements from which the networks are built give
rise to distinctively different statistics, even when considering the same
observables to match those of real data. We illustrate our findings by applying
the formalism to three datasets using an open-source software package
accompanying the present work and demonstrate how such differences are clearly
seen when measuring network observables.
