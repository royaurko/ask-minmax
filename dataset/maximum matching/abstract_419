Radiative corrections to gauge boson and Higgs production computed recently
using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) require the one-loop high-scale
matching coefficients in the standard model. We give explicit expressions for
the matching coefficients for the effective field theory (EFT) operators for q
qbar -> VV and q qbar -> phi^+ phi for a general gauge theory with an arbitrary
number of gauge groups. The group theory factors are given explicitly for the
standard model, including both QCD and electroweak corrections.
