We consider precolouring extension problems for proper edge-colourings of
graphs and multigraphs, in an attempt to prove stronger versions of Vizing's
and Shannon's bounds on the chromatic index of (multi)graphs in terms of their
maximum degree $\Delta$. We are especially interested in the following
question: when is it possible to extend a precoloured matching to a colouring
of all edges of a (multi)graph? For simple graphs, we conjecture that it is
guaranteed as long as the predefined set of available colours has cardinality
$\Delta+1$. This turns out to be related to the notorious list colouring
conjecture and other classic notions of choosability.
