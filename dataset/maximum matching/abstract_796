We present Finite Volume methods for diffusion equations on generic meshes,
that received important coverage in the last decade or so. After introducing
the main ideas and construction principles of the methods, we review some
literature results, focusing on two important properties of schemes (discrete
versions of well-known properties of the continuous equation): coercivity and
minimum-maximum principles. Coercivity ensures the stability of the method as
well as its convergence under assumptions compatible with real-world
applications, whereas minimum-maximum principles are crucial in case of strong
anisotropy to obtain physically meaningful approximate solutions.
