Minimum driver node sets (MDSs) play an important role in studying the
structural controllability of complex networks. Recent research has shown that
MDSs tend to avoid high-degree nodes. However, this observation is based on the
analysis of a small number of MDSs, because enumerating all of the MDSs of a
network is a #P problem. Therefore, past research has not been sufficient to
arrive at a convincing conclusion. In this paper, first, we propose a
preferential matching algorithm to find MDSs that have a specific degree
property. Then, we show that the MDSs obtained by preferential matching can be
composed of high- and medium-degree nodes. Moreover, the experimental results
also show that the average degree of the MDSs of some networks tends to be
greater than that of the overall network, even when the MDSs are obtained using
previous research method. Further analysis shows that whether the driver nodes
tend to be high-degree nodes or not is closely related to the edge direction of
the network.
