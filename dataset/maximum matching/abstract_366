By numerically integrating the three-dimensional Maxwell equations in the
time domain with reference to a dispersive quadratically nonlinear material, we
study second harmonic generation in planar photonic crystal microresonators.
The proposed scheme allows efficient coupling of the pump radiation to the
defect resonant mode. The out-coupled generated second harmonic is maximized by
impedance matching the photonic crystal cavity to the output waveguide.
