Tremendous progress has been made towards the solution of the
binary-black-hole problem in numerical relativity. The waveforms produced by
numerical relativity will play a role in gravitational wave detection as either
test-beds for analytic template banks or as template banks themselves. As the
parameter space explored by numerical relativity expands, the importance of
quantifying the effect that each parameter has on first the detection of
gravitational waves and then the parameter estimation of their sources
increases. In light of this, we present a study of equal-mass, spinning
binary-black-hole evolutions through matched filtering techniques commonly used
in data analysis. We study how the match between two numerical waveforms varies
with numerical resolution, initial angular momentum of the black holes and the
inclination angle between the source and the detector. This study is limited by
the fact that the spinning black-hole-binaries are oriented axially and the
waveforms only contain approximately two and a half orbits before merger. We
find that for detection purposes, spinning black holes require the inclusion of
the higher harmonics in addition to the dominant mode, a condition that becomes
more important as the black-hole-spins increase. In addition, we conduct a
preliminary investigation of how well a template of fixed spin and inclination
angle can detect target templates of arbitrary spin and inclination for the
axial case considered here.
