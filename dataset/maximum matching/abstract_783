A general principle is advanced allowing the classification of nonunique
solutions to nonlinear evolution equations, corresponding to different
spatio-temporal patterns. This is done by defining the probability distribution
of patterns, which characterizes multiple solutions as more or less probable
with respect to each other. The most probable pattern is naturally defined by
the maximum of the pattern distribution. This maximum is shown to be equivalent
to the {\it minimum of local contraction}. The formulated principle plays for
nonequilibrium dynamical systems the same ordering role as the condition of
minimal free energy for equilibrium statistical systems. The generality of the
principle is illustrated by several examples of different nature.
