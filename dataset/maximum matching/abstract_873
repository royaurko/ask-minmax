We develop an effective field theory of QCD and QCD-like theories, based on
the hidden local symmetry (HLS) model. We formulate the chiral perturbation
theory with loops of rho as well as pi and further include quadratic
divergences which are crucial to the chiral phase transition. Detailed
calculations of the one-loop renormalization-group equation of the parameters
of the HLS model are given, with the bare parameters (defined at cutoff Lambda)
determined by the matching (``Wilsonian matching'') with the underlying QCD at
Lambda through the operator-product expansion of current correlators. The
Wilsonian matching predicts low energy phenomenology for the three-flavored QCD
in remarkable agreement with the experiments. When the chiral symmetry
restoration takes place in the underlying QCD, the HLS model uniquely leads to
the Vector Manifestation (VM) as a new pattern of Wigner realization of chiral
symmetry, with the rho becoming degenerate with the massless pi as the chiral
partner. The VM is in fact realized in the large Nf QCD when Nf to Nf^{crit}-0,
with Nf^{crit} = 5 Nc/3 being in rough agreement with the lattice simulation
for Nc=3. The VM can be realized also in hot and/or dense QCD.
