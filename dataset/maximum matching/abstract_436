I investigate an SU(3) gauge model with 12 fundamental fermions. The
physically interesting region of this strongly coupled system can be influenced
by an ultraviolet fixed point due to lattice artifacts. I suggest to use a
gauge action with an additional negative adjoint plaquette term that lessens
this problem. I also introduce a new analysis method for the 2-lattice matching
Monte Carlo renormalization group technique that significantly reduces finite
volume effects. The combination of these two improvements allows me to measure
the bare step scaling function in a region of the gauge coupling where it is
clearly negative, indicating a positive renormalization group $\beta$ function
and infrared conformality.
