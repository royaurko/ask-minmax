We show that BTZ black hole solution of Cosmological Topological Massive
Gravity (CTMG) have a hidden conformal symmetry. In this regard, we consider
the wave equation of a massless scalar field propagating in BTZ spacetime and
find the wave equation could be written in terms of the $SL(2,R)$ quadratic
Casimir. From the conformal coordinates, the temperatures of the dual CFTs
could be read directly. Moreover, we compute the microscopic entropy of the
dual CFT by Cardy formula and find a perfect match to Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy of BTZ black hole. Then we consider Glilean conformal algebras (GCA),
which arises as a contraction of relativistic conformal algebras ($x\rightarrow
\epsilon x$, $t\rightarrow t$, $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$). We show that there is
a correspondence between $GCA_2$ on the boundary and contracted BTZ in the
bulk. For this purpose we obtain the central charges and temperatures of
$GCA_2$. Then we compute the microscopic entropy of the $GCA_2$ by Cardy
formula and find a perfect match to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BTZ black
hole in non-relativistic limit. The absorption cross section of a near region
scalar field also matches to microscopic absorption cross section of the dual
$GCA_2$. So we find further evidence that show correspondence between
contracted BTZ black hole and 2-dimensional Galilean conformal algebra.
