Two moment-matching methods for model reduction of linear switched systems
(LSSs) are presented. The methods are similar to the Krylov subspace methods
used for moment matching for linear systems. The more general one of the two
methods, is based on the so called "nice selection" of some vectors in the
reachability or observability space of the LSS. The underlying theory is
closely related to the (partial) realization theory of LSSs. In this paper, the
connection of the methods to the realization theory of LSSs is provided, and
algorithms are developed for the purpose of model reduction. Conditions for
applicability of the methods for model reduction are stated and finally the
results are illustrated on numerical examples.
