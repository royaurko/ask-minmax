In this paper we propose a matched decoding scheme for convolutionally
encoded transmission over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels and devise a
nonlinear trellis description. As an application we show that for coded
continuous phase modulation (CPM) using a non-coherent receiver the number of
states of the super trellis can be significantly reduced by means of a matched
non-linear trellis encoder.
