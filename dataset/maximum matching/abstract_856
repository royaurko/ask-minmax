We have carried out an investigation of the properties of low redshift EIS
clusters using both spectroscopy and imaging data. We present new redshifts for
738 galaxies in 21 ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) Cluster fields. We use the
``gap''-technique to search for significant overdensities in redshift space and
to identify groups/clusters of galaxies corresponding to the original EIS
matched filter cluster candidates. In this way we spectroscopically confirm 20
of the 21 cluster candidates with a matched-filter estimated redshift z_MF=0.2.
We have now obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 34 EIS cluster candidates with
z_MF=0.2 (see also Hansen et al., 2002; Olsen et al., 2003). Of those we
spectroscopically confirm 32 with redshifts ranging from z=0.064 to 0.283. We
find that: 1) the velocity dispersions of the systems range from
sigma_v<=130km/s to sigma_v=1200km/s, typical of galaxy groups to rich
clusters; 2) richnesses corresponding to Abell classes R<=1; and 3)
concentration indices ranging from C=0.2 to C=1.2. From the analysis of the
colours of the galaxy populations we find that 53% of the spectroscopically
confirmed systems have a ``significant'' red sequence. These systems are on
average richer and have higher velocity dispersions. We find that the colour of
the red sequence galaxies matches passive stellar evolution predictions.
