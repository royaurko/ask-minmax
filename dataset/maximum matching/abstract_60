A fundamental task in detecting foreground objects in both static and dynamic
scenes is to take the best choice of color system representation and the
efficient technique for background modeling. We propose in this paper a
non-parametric algorithm dedicated to segment and to detect objects in color
images issued from a football sports meeting. Indeed segmentation by pixel
concern many applications and revealed how the method is robust to detect
objects, even in presence of strong shadows and highlights. In the other hand
to refine their playing strategy such as in football, handball, volley ball,
Rugby..., the coach need to have a maximum of technical-tactics information
about the on-going of the game and the players. We propose in this paper a
range of algorithms allowing the resolution of many problems appearing in the
automated process of team identification, where each player is affected to his
corresponding team relying on visual data. The developed system was tested on a
match of the Tunisian national competition. This work is prominent for many
next computer vision studies as it's detailed in this study.
