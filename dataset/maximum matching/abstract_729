We employ the matching method to analytically investigate the holographic
superconductors with Lifshitz scaling in an external magnetic field. We discuss
systematically the restricted conditions for the matching method and find that
this analytic method is not always powerful to explore the effect of external
magnetic field on the holographic superconductors unless the matching point is
chosen in an appropriate range and the dynamical exponent $z$ satisfies the
relation $z=d-1$ or $z=d-2$. From the analytic treatment, we observe that
Lifshitz scaling can hinder the condensation to be formed, which can be used to
back up the numerical results. Moreover, we study the effect of Lifshitz
scaling on the upper critical magnetic field and reproduce the well-known
relation obtained from Ginzburg-Landau theory.
