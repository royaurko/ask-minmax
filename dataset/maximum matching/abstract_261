We present a method that compares the protein interaction networks of two
species to detect functionally similar (conserved) protein modules between
them. The method is based on an algorithm we developed to identify matching
subgraphs between two graphs. Unlike previous network comparison methods, our
algorithm has provable guarantees on correctness and efficiency. Our algorithm
framework also admits quite general connectivity and local matching criteria
that define when two subgraphs match and constitute a conserved module.
  We apply our method to pairwise comparisons of the yeast protein network with
the human, fruit fly and nematode worm protein networks, using a lenient
criterion based on connectedness and matching edges, coupled with a betweenness
clustering heuristic. We evaluate the detected conserved modules against
reference yeast protein complexes using sensitivity and specificity measures.
In these evaluations, our method performs competitively with and sometimes
better than two previous network comparison methods. Further under some
conditions (proper homolog and species selection), our method performs better
than a popular single-species clustering method. Beyond these evaluations, we
discuss the biology of a couple of conserved modules detected by our method. We
demonstrate the utility of network comparison for transferring annotations from
yeast proteins to human ones, and validate the predicted annotations.
