Feature or interest points typically use information aggregation in 2D
patches which does not remain stable at object boundaries when there is object
motion against a significantly varying background. Level or iso-intensity
curves are much more stable under such conditions, especially the longer ones.
In this paper, we identify stable portions on long iso-curves and detect
corners on them. Further, the iso-curve associated with a corner is used to
discard portions from the background and improve matching. Such CoMIC (Corners
on Maximally-stable Iso-intensity Curves) points yield superior results at the
object boundary regions compared to state-of-the-art detectors while performing
comparably at the interior regions as well. This is illustrated in exhaustive
matching experiments for both boundary and non-boundary regions in applications
such as stereo and point tracking for structure from motion in video sequences.
