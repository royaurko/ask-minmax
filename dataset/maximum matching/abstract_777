In this paper, we develop new methods for estimating average treatment
effects in observational studies, focusing on settings with more than two
treatment levels under unconfoundedness given pre-treatment variables. We
emphasize subclassification and matching methods which have been found to be
effective in the binary treatment literature and which are among the most
popular methods in that setting. Whereas the literature has suggested that
these particular propensity-based methods do not naturally extend to the
multi-level treatment case, we show, using the concept of weak
unconfoundedness, that adjusting for or matching on a scalar function of the
pre-treatment variables removes all biases associated with observed
pre-treatment variables. We apply the proposed methods to an analysis of the
effect of treatments for fibromyalgia. We also carry out a simulation study to
assess the finite sample performance of the methods relative to previously
proposed methods.
