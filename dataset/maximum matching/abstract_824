To study how balanced or unbalanced a maximal intersecting family
$\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{r}$ is we consider the ratio
$\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{F})=\frac{\Delta(\mathcal{F})}{\delta(\mathcal{F})}$ of
its maximum and minimum degree. We determine the order of magnitude of the
function $m(n,r)$, the minimum possible value of $\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{F})$,
and establish some lower and upper bounds on the function $M(n,r)$, the maximum
possible value of $\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{F})$. To obtain constructions that show
the bounds on $m(n,r)$ we use a theorem of Blokhuis on the minimum size of a
non-trivial blocking set in projective planes.
