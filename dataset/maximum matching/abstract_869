A black hole has characteristic quasi-normal modes that will be excited when
it is formed or when the geometry is perturbed. The state of a black hole when
the quasi-normal modes are excited is called the gravitational ringing, and
detections of it will be a direct confirmation of the existence of black holes.
To detect it, a method based on matched filtering needs to be developed.
Generically, matched filtering requires a large number of templates, because
one has to ensure a proper match of a real gravitational wave with one of
template waveforms to keep the detection efficiency as high as possible. On the
other hand, the number of templates must be kept as small as possible under
limited computational costs. In our previous paper, assuming that the
gravitational ringing is dominated by the least-damped (fundamental) mode with
the least imaginary part of frequency, we constructed an efficient method for
tiling the template space. However, the dependence of the template space metric
on the initial phase of a wave was not taken into account. This dependence
arises because of an unavoidable mismatch between the parameters of a signal
waveform and those given discretely in the template space. In this paper, we
properly take this dependence into account and present an improved, efficient
search method for gravitational ringing of black holes.
