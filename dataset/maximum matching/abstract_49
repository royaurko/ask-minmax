In a recent paper dealing with maximum likelihood detection of gravitational
wave chirps from coalescing binaries with unknown parameters we introduced an
accurate representation of the no-signal cumulative distribution of the
supremum of the whole correlator bank. This result can be used to derive a
refined estimate of the number of templates yielding the best tradeoff between
detector's performance (in terms of lost signals among those potentially
detectable) and computational burden.
