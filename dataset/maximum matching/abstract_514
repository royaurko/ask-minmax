We reconsider the low-energy effective theory for Higgs-less electroweak
symmetry breaking: we study the anomaly-matching in the situation where all
Goldstone fields disappear from the spectrum as a result of the Higgs
mechanism. We find that the global SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} symmetry of
the underlying theory, which is spontaneously broken to SU(2)_{L+R} x
U(1)_{B-L} has to be anomaly-free. For the sake of generality, we include the
possibility of light spin-1/2 bound states resulting from the dynamics of the
strongly-interacting symmetry-breaking sector, in addition to the Goldstone
bosons. Such composite fermions may have non-standard couplings at the leading
order, and an arbitrary total B-L charge. In order to perform the
anomaly-matching in that case, we generalize the construction of the
Wess-Zumino effective lagrangian. Composite fermions beyond the three known
generations are theoretically allowed, and there are no restrictions from the
anomaly-matching on their couplings nor on their U(1)_{B-L} charge. Absence of
global anomalies for the composite sector as a whole does not preclude
anomalous triple gauge boson couplings arising from composite fermion
triangular diagrams. On the other hand, the trace of B-L over elementary
fermions must vanish if all Goldstone modes are to disappear from the spectrum.
