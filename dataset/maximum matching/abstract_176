Using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in five
optical bandpasses corresponding to the SDSS bandpasses shifted to match their
restframe shape at z=0.1. We denote the bands {0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r},
{0.1}{i}, {0.1}{z}, with \lambda_{eff} = [3216, 4240, 5595, 6792, 8111]
Angstroms respectively. We use a maximum likelihood method which allows for a
general form for the shape of the luminosity function, simple luminosity and
number evolution, incorporates flux uncertainties, and accounts for the flux
limits of the survey. We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 in absolute AB
magnitudes in a Mpc^3 of [-14.10 \pm 0.15, -15.18 \pm 0.03, -15.90 \pm 0.03,
-16.24 \pm 0.03, -16.56 \pm 0.02] in [{0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r}, {0.1}{i},
{0.1}{z}], respectively, using \Omega_0 =0.3, \Omega_\Lambda=0.7, and h=1, and
using Petrosian magnitudes. Similar results are obtained using Sersic model
magnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the Petrosian apertures is not a
major correction. In the {0.1}{r} band, the best fit Schechter function to our
results has \phi_\ast = (1.49 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{-2} h^3 Mpc^{-3}, M_\ast -
5\log_{10} h = -20.44 \pm 0.01, and \alpha = -1.05\pm 0.01. In solar
luminosities, the luminosity density in {0.1}{r} is (1.84 \pm 0.04) h 10^8
L_{{0.1}{r},\odot} Mpc^{-3}. Our results are consistent with other estimates of
the luminosity density, from the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and
the Millenium Galaxy Catalog. They represent a substantial change (\sim 0.5
mag) from earlier SDSS luminosity density results based on commissioning data,
almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosity
function model.
