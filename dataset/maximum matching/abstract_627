Our objective is to study the vertical dust distribution in the circumbinary
ring of the binary system GG Tau and to search for evidence of stratification,
one of the first steps expected to occur during planet formation.
  We present a simultaneous analysis of four scattered light images spanning a
range of wavelength from 800 nm to 3800 nm and compare them with (i) a
parametric prescription for the vertical dust stratification, and (ii) with the
results of SPH bi-fluid hydrodynamic calculations.
  The parametric prescription and hydrodynamical calculations of stratification
both reproduce the observed brightness profiles well. These models also provide
a correct match for the observed star/ring integrated flux ratio. Another
solution with a well-mixed, but ``exotic'', dust size distribution also matches
the brightness profile ratios but fails to match the star/ring flux ratio.
These results give support to the presence of vertical stratification of the
dust in the ring of GG Tau and further predict the presence of a radial
stratification also.
