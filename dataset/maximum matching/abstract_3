A novel hierarchical search technique is presented for all-sky surveys for
continuous gravitational-wave sources, such as rapidly spinning nonaxisymmetric
neutron stars. Analyzing yearlong detector data sets over realistic ranges of
parameter space using fully coherent matched-filtering is computationally
prohibitive. Thus more efficient, so-called hierarchical techniques are
essential. Traditionally, the standard hierarchical approach consists of
dividing the data into nonoverlapping segments of which each is coherently
analyzed and subsequently the matched-filter outputs from all segments are
combined incoherently. The present work proposes to break the data into
subsegments shorter than the desired maximum coherence time span (size of the
coherence window). Then matched-filter outputs from the different subsegments
are efficiently combined by sliding the coherence window in time: Subsegments
whose timestamps are closer than coherence window size are combined coherently,
otherwise incoherently. Compared to the standard scheme at the same coherence
time baseline, data sets longer by about 50-100% would have to be analyzed to
achieve the same search sensitivity as with the sliding coherence window
approach. Numerical simulations attest to the analytically estimated
improvement.
