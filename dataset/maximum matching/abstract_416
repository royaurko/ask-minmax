We observe second harmonic generation via random quasi-phase-matching in a
2.0 \mu m periodically poled, 1-cm-long, z-cut lithium tantalate. Away from
resonance, the harmonic output profiles exhibit a characteristic pattern
stemming from a stochastic domain distribution and a quadratic growth with the
fundamental excitation, as well as a broadband spectral response. The results
are in good agreement with a simple model and numerical simulations in the
undepleted regime, assuming an anisotropic spread of the random nonlinear
component.
