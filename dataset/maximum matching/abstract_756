The likelihood ratio measures the relative weight of forensic data regarding
two hypotheses. Several levels of uncertainties arise: the assumed population
model only approximates the true and its parameters are only estimated through
a database. Moreover, it may be wise to discard part of data, especially those
indirectly related to the hypotheses. Different reductions define different
LRs. Therefore, if frequentist methods are chosen, it is more sensible to talk
about "a" LR instead of "the" LR, and the error involved in the estimation
should be quantified. Two frequentist methods are proposed in the light of
these points for the `rare type match problem', that is when a match between
the perpetrator's and the suspect's DNA profile, never observed before in the
database of reference is to be evaluated.
