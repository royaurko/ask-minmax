In this work we study an Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC) with quadratic
power constraints on the transmitter and a so-called "oblivious" jammer (along
with additional AWGN) under a maximum probability of error criterion, and no
private randomness between the transmitter and the receiver. This is in
contrast to similar AVC models under the average probability of error criterion
considered in [1], and models wherein common randomness is allowed [2] -- these
distinctions are important in some communication scenarios outlined below.
  We consider the regime where the jammer's power constraint is smaller than
the transmitter's power constraint (in the other regime it is known no positive
rate is possible). For this regime we show the existence of stochastic codes
(with no common randomness between the transmitter and receiver) that enables
reliable communication at the same rate as when the jammer is replaced with
AWGN with the same power constraint. This matches known information-theoretic
outer bounds. In addition to being a stronger result than that in [1] (enabling
recovery of the results therein), our proof techniques are also somewhat more
direct, and hence may be of independent interest.
