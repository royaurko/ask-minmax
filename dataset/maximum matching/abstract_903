We use the same physical model to simulate four galaxies that match the
relation between stellar and total mass, over a mass range that includes the
vast majority of disc galaxies. The resultant galaxies, part of the Making
Galaxies in a Cosmological Context (MaGICC) program, also match observed
relations between luminosity, rotation velocity, size, colour, star formation
rate, HI mass, baryonic mass, and metallicity. Radiation from massive stars and
supernova energy regulate star formation and drive outflows, balancing the
complex interplay between cooling gas, star formation, large scale outflows,
and recycling of gas in a manner which correctly scales with the mass of the
galaxy. Outflows also play a key role in simulating galaxies with exponential
surface brightness profiles, flat rotation curves and dark matter cores. Our
study implies that large scale outflows are the primary driver of the
dependence of disc galaxy properties on mass. We show that the amount of
outflows invoked in our model is required to meet the constraints provided by
observations of OVI absorption lines in the circum-galactic-media of local
galaxies.
