We consider time-periodically perturbed 1D Hamiltonian systems possessing one
or more separatrices. If the perturbation is weak, then the separatrix chaos is
most developed when the perturbation frequency lies in the logarithmically
small or moderate ranges: this corresponds to the involvement of resonance
dynamics into the separatrix chaos. We develop a method matching the discrete
chaotic dynamics of the separatrix map and the continuous regular dynamics of
the resonance Hamiltonian. The method has allowed us to solve the long-standing
problem of an accurate description of the maximum of the separatrix chaotic
layer width as a function of the perturbation frequency. It has also allowed us
to predict and describe new phenomena including, in particular: (i) a drastic
facilitation of the onset of global chaos between neighbouring separatrices,
and (ii) a huge increase in the size of the low-dimensional stochastic web.
