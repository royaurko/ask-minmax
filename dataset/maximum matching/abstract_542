Spectral energy distributions are computed using 2D rotating stellar models
and NLTE plane parallel model atmospheres. A rotating, 2D stellar model has
been found which matches the observed ultraviolet and visible spectrum of ?
Oph. The SED match occurs for the interferometrically deduced surface shape and
inclination, and is different from the SED produced by spherical models. The p
mode oscillation frequencies in which the latitudinal variation is modelled by
a linear combination of eight Legendre polynomials were computed for this
model. The five highest and seven of the nine highest amplitude modes show
agreement between computed axisymmetric, equatorially symmetric mode
frequencies and the mode frequencies observed by MOST to within the
observational error. Including nonaxisymmetric modes up through |m| = 2 and
allowing the possibility that the eight lowest amplitude modes could be
produced by modes which are not equatorially symmetric produces matches for 24
out of the 35 MOST modes to within the observational error and another eight
modes to within twice the observational error. The remaining three observed
modes can be fit within 4.2 times the observational error, but even these may
be fit to within the observational error if the criteria for computed modes are
expanded.
