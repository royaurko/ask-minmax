We quantify uncertainties in the Monte-Carlo simulation of inclusive and
dijet final states, which arise from using the MC@NLO technique for matching
next-to-leading order parton level calculations and parton showers. We analyse
a large variety of data from early measurements at the LHC. In regions of phase
space where Sudakov logarithms dominate over high-energy effects, we observe
that the main uncertainty can be ascribed to the free parameters of the parton
shower. In complementary regions, the main uncertainty stems from the
considerable freedom in the simulation of underlying events.
