One possible explanation for the substantial organismal differences between
humans and chimpanzees is that there have been changes in gene regulation.
Given what is known about transcription factor binding sites, this motivates
the following probability question: given a 1000 nucleotide region in our
genome, how long does it take for a specified six to nine letter word to appear
in that region in some individual? Stone and Wray [Mol. Biol. Evol. 18 (2001)
1764--1770] computed 5,950 years as the answer for six letter words. Here, we
will show that for words of length 6, the average waiting time is 100,000
years, while for words of length 8, the waiting time has mean 375,000 years
when there is a 7 out of 8 letter match in the population consensus sequence
(an event of probability roughly 5/16) and has mean 650 million years when
there is not. Fortunately, in biological reality, the match to the target word
does not have to be perfect for binding to occur. If we model this by saying
that a 7 out of 8 letter match is good enough, the mean reduces to about 60,000
years.
