Considering the constraints of the lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes
$\mu \rightarrow 3e$ and $\tau\rightarrow3\mu$ on the LFV couplings
$Z'\ell_{i}\ell_{j}$, in the contexts of the $E_{6}$ models, the left-right
(LR) models, the "alternative" left-right (ALR) models and the 331 models, we
investigate the contributions of the extra gauge boson $Z'$ to the decay rates
of the processes $\ell_{i}\rightarrow\ell_{j}\nu_{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$,
$\tau\rightarrow\mu P $ and $P\rightarrow \mu e$ with $P=\pi^{0},\eta$ and
$\eta '$. Our numerical results show that the maximal values of the branching
ratios for these processes are not dependent on the $Z'$ mass $M_{Z'}$ at
leader order. The extra gauge boson $Z'_{X}$ predicted by the $E_{6}$ models
can make the maximum value of the branching ratio
$Br(\tau\rightarrow\mu\nu_{\ell}\nu_{\ell})$ reach $1.1\times10^{-7}$. All $Z'$
models considered in this paper can produce significant contributions to the
process $\tau\rightarrow\mu P$. However, the value of $Br(P\rightarrow\mu e)$
is far below its corresponding experimental upper bound.
