We construct the potentials that describe the spectrum and decay of
electromagnetic bound states of hadrons, and are consistent with ChPT. These
potentials satisfy the matching condition which enables one to express the
parameters of the potential through the threshold scattering amplitudes
calculated in ChPT. We further analyze the ambiguity in the choice of the
short-range hadronic potentials, which satisfy this matching condition.
