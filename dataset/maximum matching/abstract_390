In every sphere of science, theories make predictions and experiments
validate them. However, common experience suggests that theoretically predicted
exact magnitude for a parameter, constitute a small subset of all the
experimentally obtained magnitudes for that particular parameter. Typically,
irrespective of the branch of science and the particular problem under
consideration, the set of obtained experimental results form an interval
[x_min,x_max], within which the theoretically predicted magnitude, say 'x',
occurs with time, apparently randomly. We attempt here to find the
characteristics of the statistical distribution of events of experimental
observation of the occurrence of theoretically predicted 'x'; in other words,
characterization of the time interval when theoretical predictions match the
experimental readings, exactly.
