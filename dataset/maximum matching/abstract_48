We consider the period-doubling and intermittency transitions in iterated
nonlinear one-dimensional maps to corroborate unambiguously the validity of
Tsallis' non-extensive statistics at these critical points. We study the map
$x_{n+1}=x_{n}+u| x_{n}| ^{z}$, $z>1$, as it describes generically the
neighborhood of all of these transitions. The exact renormalization group (RG)
fixed-point map and perturbation static expressions match the corresponding
expressions for the dynamics of iterates. The time evolution is universal in
the RG sense and the non-extensive entropy $S_{Q}$ associated to the
fixed-point map is maximum with respect to that of the other maps in its basin
of attraction. The degree of non-extensivity - the index $Q$ in $S_{Q}$ - and
the degree of nonlinearity $z$ are equivalent and the generalized Lyapunov
exponent $\lambda_{q}$, $q=2-Q^{-1}$, is the leading map expansion coefficient
$u$. The corresponding deterministic diffusion problem is similarly
interpreted. We discuss our results.
