Critical couplings and string tensions in SU(2) and SU(3) lattice gauge
theory are calculated by two-lattice matching of RG block transformations. The
transformations are of the potential moving type generating plaquette actions
with large number of group characters and exhibit rapid approach to a unique
renormalized trajectory. Fixing the critical coupling $\beta(N_\tau)$ at one
value of temporal lattice extent $N_\tau$ by MC simulation, the critical
couplings for other values of $N_\tau$ are then obtained by lattice matching of
these decimations. $\beta(N_\tau)$ values are thus obtained for a range of
$N_\tau$ and found to be in agreement with MC simulation results to within a
few percent in all cases. A similar procedure allows the calculation of string
tensions for a range of $\beta$ values with similarly good agreement with MC
data.
