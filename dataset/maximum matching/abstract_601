We propose a novel way of matching effective field theory with the underlying
QCD in the sense of a Wilsonian renormalization group equation (RGE). We derive
Wilsonian matching conditions between current correlators obtained by the
operator product expansion in QCD and those by the hidden local symmetry (HLS)
model. This determines without much ambiguity the bare parameters of the HLS at
the cutoff scale in terms of the QCD parameters. Physical quantities for the pi
and rho system are calculated by the Wilsonian RGE's from the bare parameters
in remarkable agreement with the experiment.
