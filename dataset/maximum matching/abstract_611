We propose a simple method to simulate $W/Z$ + jet productions at hadron
collisions. The simulation can be done by using existing tools with some
modifications allowed to users. $W/Z$ + 1 jet events are generated using an
ME-based event generator at the tree level. The divergence at low $p_{T}$ is
suppressed by using the Sudakov form factor. PS is added with an appropriate
consideration for PS-ME matching. The simulation for the $W$ + 1 jet production
shows a smooth matching with the $W$ + 0 jet simulation at low $p_{T}$s. The
$Z$ + 1 jet simulation in the Tevatron Run I condition well reproduces the
experimental measurement on the $p_{T}$ spectrum of $Z$.
