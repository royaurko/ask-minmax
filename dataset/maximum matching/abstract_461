We give an upper bound on the number of perfect matchings in simple graphs
with a given number of vertices and edges. We apply this result to give an
upper bound on the number of 2-factors in a directed complete bipartite
balanced graph on 2n vertices. The upper bound is sharp for n even. For n odd
we state a conjecture on a sharp upper bound.
