We calculate the parton level cross section for the production of two jets
that are far apart in rapidity, subject to a limitation on the total transverse
momentum Q_0 in the interjet region. We specifically address the question of
how to combine the approach which sums all leading logarithms in Q/Q_0 (where Q
is the jet transverse momentum) with the BFKL approach, in which leading
logarithms of the scattering energy are summed. Using an "all orders" matching,
we obtain results for the cross section which correctly reproduce the two
approaches in the appropriate limits.
