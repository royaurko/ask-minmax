Two filter based approaches for deghosting of Ocean Bottom Cable data are
presented. One of them is phase shifting of geophone followed by least square
matching of cross ghosted geophone and hydrophone data.In the second
approach,phase shifting of geophone is followed by direct matching of
geophone's amplitude spectrum with that of the hydrophone within the seismic
bandwidth.Results obtained from both approaches were found to be at par with
one of the proprietary softwares available with ONGC.
