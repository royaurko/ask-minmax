Efficient injection of spin-polarized current into a semiconductor is a basic
prerequisite for building semiconductor-based spintronic devices. Here, we use
inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy to show that the efficiency of
spin-filter-type spin injectors is limited by spin scattering of the tunneling
electrons. By matching the Fermi-surface shapes of the current injection source
and target electrode material, spin injection efficiency can be significantly
increased in epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator tunnel junctions. Our results
demonstrate that not only structural but also Fermi-surface matching is
important to suppress scattering processes in spintronic devices.
