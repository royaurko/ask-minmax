In this paper we have considered the possibility that the Standard Model, and
its minimal extension with the addition of singlets, merges with a high-scale
supersymmetric theory at a scale satisfying the Veltman condition and therefore
with no sensitivity to the cutoff. The matching of the Standard Model is
achieved at Planckian scales. In its complex singlet extension the matching
scale depends on the strength of the coupling between the singlet and Higgs
fields. For order one values of the coupling, still in the perturbative region,
the matching scale can be located in the TeV ballpark. Even in the absence of
quadratic divergences there remains a finite adjustment of the parameters in
the high-energy theory which should guarantee that the Higgs and the singlets
in the low-energy theory are kept light. This fine-tuning (unrelated to
quadratic divergences) is the entire responsibility of the ultraviolet theory
and remains as the missing ingredient to provide a full solution to the
hierarchy problem.
