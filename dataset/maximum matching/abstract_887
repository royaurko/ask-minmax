We describe a model for the formation of \zsim 2 Submillimeter Galaxies
(SMGs) which simultaneously accounts for both average and bright SMGs while
providing a reasonable match to their mean observed spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). By coupling hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers
with the high resolution 3D polychromatic radiative transfer code Sunrise, we
find that a mass sequence of merger models which use observational constraints
as physical input naturally yield objects which exhibit black hole, bulge, and
H2 gas masses similar to those observed in SMGs. The dominant drivers behind
the 850 micron flux are the masses of the merging galaxies and the stellar
birthcloud covering fraction. The most luminous (S850 ~ 15 mJy) sources are
recovered by ~10^13 Msun 1:1 major mergers with a birthcloud covering fraction
close to unity, whereas more average SMGs ~5-7 mJy) may be formed in lower mass
halos ~5x10^12 Msun. These models demonstrate the need for high spatial
resolution hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations in matching both the
most luminous sources as well as the full SEDs of SMGs. While these models
suggest a natural formation mechanism for SMGs, they do not attempt to match
cosmological statistics of galaxy populations; future efforts along this line
will help ascertain the robustness of these models.
