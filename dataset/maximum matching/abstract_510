We develop a search method for gravitational ringing of black holes. The
gravitational ringing is due to complex frequency modes called the quasi-normal
modes that are excited when a black hole geometry is perturbed. The detection
of it will be a direct confirmation of the existence of a black hole. Assuming
that the ringdown waves are dominated by the fundamental mode with least
imaginary part, we consider matched filtering and develop an optimal method to
search for the ringdown waves that have damped sinusoidal wave forms.
  When we use the matched filtering method, the data analysis with a lot of
templates required. Here we have to ensure a proper match between the filter as
a template and the real wave. It is necessary to keep the detection efficiency
as high as possible under limited computational costs.
  First, we consider the white noise case for which the matched filtering can
be studied analytically. We construct an efficient method for tiling the
template space. Then, using a fitting curve of the TAMA300 DT6 noise spectrum,
we numerically consider the case of colored noise. We find our tiling method
developed for the white noise case is still valid even if the noise is colored.
