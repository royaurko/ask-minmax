In his deathbed letter to Hardy, Ramanujan gave a vague definition of a mock
modular function: at each root of unity its asymptotics matches the one of a
modular form, though a choice of the modular function depends on the root of
unity. Recently Folsom, Ono and Rhoades have proved an elegant result about the
match for a general family related to Dyson's rank (mock theta) function and
the Andrews--Garvan crank (modular) function---the match with explicit formulae
for implied $O(1)$ constants. In this note we give another elementary proof of
Ramanujan's original claim and outline some heuristics which may be useful for
obtaining a new proof of the general Folsom--Ono--Rhoades theorem.
