We propose a novel scenario of primordial inflation in which the inflaton
goes through a spiral motion starting from around the top of a symmetry
breaking potential. We show that, even though inflation takes place for a field
value much smaller than Planck scale, it is possible to obtain relatively large
tensor to scalar ratio ($r \sim 0.1$) without fine tuning. The inflationary
observables perfectly match Planck data.
