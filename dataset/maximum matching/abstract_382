We consider a general class of empirical-type likelihoods and develop higher
order asymptotics with a view to characterizing members thereof that allow the
existence of possibly data-dependent probability matching priors ensuring
approximate frequentist validity of posterior quantiles. In particular, for the
usual empirical likelihood, positive results are obtained. This is in contrast
with what happens if only data-free priors are entertained.
