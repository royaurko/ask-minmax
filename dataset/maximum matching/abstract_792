We determine the coupling constants of $\Sigma$ hyperon with mesons in
relativistic mean field (RMF) models using $\Sigma^-$ atomic shift data and
examine the effects of $\Sigma$ on the neutron star maximum mass. We find that
we need to reduce the vector-isovector meson coupling with $\Sigma$
($g_{\rho\Sigma}$) from the value constrained by the SU(3)v symmetry in order
to explain the $\Sigma^-$ atomic shifts for light symmetric and heavy
asymmetric nuclei simultaneously. With the atomic shift fit value of
$g_{\rho\Sigma}$, $\Sigma^-$ can emerge in neutron star matter overcoming the
repulsive isoscalar potential for $\Sigma$ hyperons. Admixture of $\Sigma^-$ in
neutron stars is found to reduce the neutron star maximum mass slightly.
