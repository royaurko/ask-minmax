If supersymmetry (SUSY) has a compressed spectrum then the current mass
limits from the LHC can be drastically reduced. We consider a possible 'worst
case' scenario where the gluino and/or squarks are degenerate with the lightest
SUSY particle (LSP). The most sensitive searches for these compressed spectra
are via the final state LSPs recoiling against initial state radiation (ISR).
Therefore it is vital that the ISR is understood and possible uncertainties in
the predictions are evaluated. We use both MLM (with Pythia 6) and CKKW- L
(with Pythia 8) matching and vary matching scales and parton shower properties
to accurately determine the theoretical uncertainties in the kinematic
distributions. All current LHC SUSY and monojet analyses are employed and we
find the most constraining limits come from the CMS Razor and CMS monojet
searches. For a scenario of squarks degenerate with the LSP and decoupled
gluinos we find $M_{\tilde{q}}>340$ GeV. For gluinos degenerate with the LSP
and decoupled squarks, $M_{\tilde{g}}>500$ GeV. For equal mass squarks and
gluinos degenerate with the LSP, $M_{\tilde{q},\tilde{g}}>650$ GeV.
