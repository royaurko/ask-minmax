The order $\alpha_s$ corrections to the Wilson coefficients of the dipole
operators ($O_7,O_8$) at the matching scale $\mu =m_W$ are a crucial ingredient
for a complete next- to-leading logarithmic calculation of the branching ratio
for $b \to s \gamma$. Given the phenomenological relevance and the fact that
this two-loop calculation has been done so far only by one group [1], we
present a detailed re-calculation using a different method. Our results are in
complete agreement with those in ref. [1].
