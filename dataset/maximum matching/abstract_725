Ontologies are considered as the backbone of the Semantic Web. With the
rising success of the Semantic Web, the number of participating communities
from different countries is constantly increasing. The growing number of
ontologies available in different natural languages leads to an
interoperability problem. In this paper, we discuss several approaches for
ontology matching; examine similarities and differences, identify weaknesses,
and compare the existing automated approaches with the manual approaches for
integrating multilingual ontologies. In addition to that, we propose a new
architecture for a multilingual ontology matching service. As a case study we
used an example of two multilingual enterprise ontologies - the university
ontology of Freie Universitaet Berlin and the ontology for Fayoum University in
Egypt.
