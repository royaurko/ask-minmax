We study the problem of recovering the sparsity pattern of block-sparse
signals from noise-corrupted measurements. A simple, efficient recovery method,
namely, a block-version of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method, is
considered in this paper and its behavior for recovering the block-sparsity
pattern is analyzed. We provide sufficient conditions under which the
block-version of the OMP can successfully recover the block-sparse
representations in the presence of noise. Our analysis reveals that exploiting
block-sparsity can improve the recovery ability and lead to a guaranteed
recovery for a higher sparsity level. Numerical results are presented to
corroborate our theoretical claim.
