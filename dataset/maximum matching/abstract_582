Searching techniques for Case Based Reasoning systems involve extensive
methods of elimination. In this paper, we look at a new method of arriving at
the right solution by performing a series of transformations upon the data.
These involve N-gram based comparison and deduction of the input data with the
case data, using Morphemes and Phonemes as the deciding parameters. A similar
technique for eliminating possible errors using a noise removal function is
performed. The error tracking and elimination is performed through a
statistical analysis of obtained data, where the entire data set is analyzed as
sub-categories of various etymological derivatives. A probability analysis for
the closest match is then performed, which yields the final expression. This
final expression is referred to the Case Base. The output is redirected through
an Expert System based on best possible match. The threshold for the match is
customizable, and could be set by the Knowledge-Architect.
