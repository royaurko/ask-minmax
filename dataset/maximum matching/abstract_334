Using a recursive algorithm to solve the renormalization group equations of
N=1 QCD (DGLAP), we describe the most general supersymmetric evolution of the
parton distributions. The analysis involves the regular DGLAP evolution, a
partial supersymmetric intermediate evolution and a final supersymmetric
evolution combined at various matching scales. We use a model in which
supersymmetric distributions are radiatively generated at each susy threshold
due to the mixing of the QCD anomalous dimensions with the N=1 sector. Various
types of matching conditions are considered, reflecting partially broken and
exact supersymmetric scenarios with a wide range of susy-breaking mass
parameters. Numerical results for all the distributions are presented.
