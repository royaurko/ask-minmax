The hard-scattering contributions to heavy-to-light form factors at large
recoil are studied systematically in soft-collinear effective theory (SCET).
Large logarithms arising from multiple energy scales are resummed by matching
QCD onto SCET in two stages via an intermediate effective theory. Anomalous
dimensions in the intermediate theory are computed, and their form is shown to
be constrained by conformal symmetry. Renormalization-group evolution equations
are solved to give a complete leading-order analysis of the hard-scattering
contributions, in which all single and double logarithms are resummed. In two
cases, spin-symmetry relations for the soft-overlap contributions to form
factors are shown not to be broken at any order in perturbation theory by
hard-scattering corrections. One-loop matching calculations in the two
effective theories are performed in sample cases, for which the relative
importance of renormalization-group evolution and matching corrections is
investigated. The asymptotic behavior of Sudakov logarithms appearing in the
coefficient functions of the soft-overlap and hard-scattering contributions to
form factors is analyzed.
