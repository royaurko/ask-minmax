The paper is motivated by observation of a kind of branes in the vacuum state
of the lattice SU(2) gluodynamics. The branes represent two-dimensional
vortices whose total area scales in physical units while the non-Abelian action
diverges in the ultraviolet. We consider the question whether effects of the
branes can be accommodated into the continuum theory. We demonstrate that at
least in case of the gluon condensate (plaquette action) and of the heavy quark
potential the contribution of the branes corresponds to the ultraviolet
renormalon. Thus, the vortices might represent a non-perturbative match of the
ultraviolet renormalon. Such an identification constrains, in turn, properties
of the branes.
