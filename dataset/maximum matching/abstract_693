Bayesian learning is often hampered by large computational expense. As a
powerful generalization of popular belief propagation, expectation propagation
(EP) efficiently approximates the exact Bayesian computation. Nevertheless, EP
can be sensitive to outliers and suffer from divergence for difficult cases. To
address this issue, we propose a new approximate inference approach, relaxed
expectation propagation (REP). It relaxes the moment matching requirement of
expectation propagation by adding a relaxation factor into the KL minimization.
We penalize this relaxation with a $l_1$ penalty. As a result, when two
distributions in the relaxed KL divergence are similar, the relaxation factor
will be penalized to zero and, therefore, we obtain the original moment
matching; In the presence of outliers, these two distributions are
significantly different and the relaxation factor will be used to reduce the
contribution of the outlier. Based on this penalized KL minimization, REP is
robust to outliers and can greatly improve the posterior approximation quality
over EP. To examine the effectiveness of REP, we apply it to Gaussian process
classification, a task known to be suitable to EP. Our classification results
on synthetic and UCI benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement of
REP over EP and Power EP--in terms of algorithmic stability, estimation
accuracy and predictive performance.
