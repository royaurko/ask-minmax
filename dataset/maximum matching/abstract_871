We apply the method of matched asymptotic expansions to analyse whether
cosmological variations in physical `constants' and scalar fields are
detectable, locally, on the surface of local gravitationally bound systems such
as planets and stars, or inside virialised systems like galaxies and clusters.
We assume spherical symmetry and derive a sufficient condition for the local
time variation of the scalar fields that drive varying constants to track the
cosmological one. We calculate a number of specific examples in detail by
matching the Schwarzschild spacetime to spherically symmetric inhomogeneous
Tolman-Bondi metrics in an intermediate region by rigorously construction
matched asymptotic expansions on cosmological and local astronomical scales
which overlap in an intermediate domain. We conclude that, independent of the
details of the scalar-field theory describing the varying `constant', the
condition for cosmological variations to be measured locally is almost always
satisfied in physically realistic situations. The proof of this statement
provides a rigorous justification for using terrestrial experiments and solar
system observations to constrain or detect any cosmological time variations in
the traditional `constants' of Nature.
