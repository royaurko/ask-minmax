We have used maximum-likelihood estimation to determine the quadrupole
amplitude $Q_{\rm rms-PS}$ and the spectral index $n$ of the density
fluctuation power spectrum at recombination from the \cobe\ DMR data. We find a
strong correlation between the two parameters of the form $Q_{\rm
rms-PS}=(15.7\pm 2.6)\exp[0.46(1-n)]\mk$ for fixed $n$. Our result is slightly
smaller than and has a smaller statistical uncertainty than the 1992 estimate
of Smoot et al.
