In this draft we comment on the results concerning the performances of
matched filters, scale adaptive filters and Mexican hat wavelet that recently
appeared in literature in the context of point source detection in Cosmic
Microwave Background maps. In particular, we show that, contrary to what has
been claimed, the use of the matched filters still appear to be the most
reliable and efficient method to disantangle point sources from the
backgrounds, even when using detection criterion that, differently from the
classic $n\sigma$ thresholding rule, takes into account not only the height of
the peaks in the signal corresponding to the candidate sources but also their
curvature.
