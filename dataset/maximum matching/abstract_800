We present $\rm BVR_{c}I_{c}$ broad band CCD photometry of the Type Ia
supernova SN 2004S, which appeared in the galaxy MCG-05-16-021, obtained during
2004 February 12 to March 22. Multiband and bolometric light curves constructed
using our data as well as other available data are presented. The time of B
band maximum and the peak magnitudes in different bands are obtained using the
fits of light curve and colour templates. We clearly see a strong shoulder in
$\rm R_{c}$ band and a second maximum in $\rm I_{c}$ band. SN 2004S closely
resembles SN 1992al after maximum. From the peak bolometric luminosity we
estimate the ejected mass of $\rm ^{\rm 56}Ni$ to be 0.41 $\rm M_{\odot}$.
