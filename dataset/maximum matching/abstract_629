We consider a non-critical five dimensional string setup which could provide
a dual description of QCD in the limit of large number of colors and flavors.
The model corresponds to N_c color D3-branes and N_f D4/anti D4-brane pairs
supporting flavor degrees of freedom. The matching of the string model spectrum
with the dual field theory one is considered. We discuss the consequences of
the possible matching of the gravity modes with the light glueballs and the
interpretation of the brane spectrum in Yang-Mills and QCD.
