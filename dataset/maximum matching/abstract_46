Recent time-dependent, ideal-magnetohydrodynamic (ideal-MHD) simulations of
polar magnetic burial in accreting neutron stars have demonstrated that stable,
magnetically confined mountains form at the magnetic poles, emitting
gravitational waves at $f_{*}$ (stellar spin frequency) and $2 f_{*}$. Global
MHD oscillations of the mountain, whether natural or stochastically driven, act
to modulate the gravitational wave signal, creating broad sidebands (full-width
half-maximum $\sim 0.2f_*$) in the frequency spectrum around $f_{*}$ and $2
f_{*}$. The oscillations can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio achieved by a
long-baseline interferometer with coherent matched filtering by up to 15 per
cent, depending on where $f_*$ lies relative to the noise curve minimum.
Coherent, multi-detector searches for continuous waves from nonaxisymmetric
pulsars should be tailored accordingly.
