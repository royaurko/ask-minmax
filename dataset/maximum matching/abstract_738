Point constellation recognition is a common problem with many pattern
matching applications. Whilst useful in many contexts, this work is mainly
motivated by fingerprint matching. Fingerprints are traditionally modelled as
constellations of oriented points called minutiae. The fingerprint verifier's
task consists in comparing two point constellations. The compared
constellations may differ by rotation and translation or by much more involved
transforms such as distortion or occlusion. This paper presents three new
constellation matching algorithms. The first two methods generalize an
algorithm by Bringer and Despiegel. Our third proposal creates a very
interesting analogy between mechanical system simulation and the constellation
recognition problem.
