The ideal black body fully absorbs all incident rays, that is, all
propagating waves created by arbitrary sources. The known idealized realization
of a black body is the perfectly matched layer (PML), widely used in numerical
electromagnetics. However, ideal black bodies and PMLs do not interact with
evanescent fields existing near any finite-size source, and the energy stored
in these fields cannot be harvested. Here we introduce the concept of the ideal
conjugate matched layer (CML), which fully absorbs energy of both propagating
and evanescent fields of sources acting as an ideal sink for electromagnetic
energy. Conjugate matched absorbers have exciting application potentials, as
resonant attractors of electromagnetic energy into the absorber volume. We
derive the conditions on the constitutive parameters of media which can serve
as CML materials, numerically study the performance of planar and cylindrical
CML and discuss possible realizations of such materials as metal-dielectric
composites.
