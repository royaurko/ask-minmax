In this review a new method is presented for attaching parton shower
algorithms to NLO partonic jet cross sections in electron-positron
annihilation. Our method is based on the Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction
method and also uses an adaptation of the matching scheme of Catani, Krauss,
Kuhn, and Webber.
