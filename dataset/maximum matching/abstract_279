Allometric scaling is one of the most pervasive laws in biology. Its origin,
however, is still a matter of dispute. Recent studies have established that
maximum metabolic rate scales with an exponent larger than that found for basal
metabolism. This unpredicted result sets a challenge that can decide which of
the concurrent hypotheses is the correct theory. Here we show that both scaling
laws can be deduced from a single network model. Besides the 3/4-law for basal
metabolism, the model predicts that maximum metabolic rate scales as $M^{6/7}$,
maximum heart rate as $M^{-1/7}$, and muscular capillary density as $M^{-1/7}$,
in agreement with data.
