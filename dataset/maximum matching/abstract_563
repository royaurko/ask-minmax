We model a matching market in which nonstrategic vendors sell items of
different types and offer discounted prices on the bundle of all items
triggered by demand volumes. Each buyer acts strategically in order to maximize
her utility, given by the difference between product valuations and price paid.
In a market with transferable utility, buyers might be willing to cooperate by
exchanging side-payments, to induce discounts. The core of the market is in
general empty, therefore we consider a notion of stability that looks at
unilateral deviations. We show that efficient matchings -- the ones maximizing
the social welfare - can be stabilized by transfers between buyers that enjoy
desirable properties of rationality (according to which a buyer subsidizes only
buyers who contribute to the activation of the desired discount) and fairness
(according to which transfers amounts are balanced between buyers). Building on
this existence results, and letting $N$, $M$ and $c$ be the numbers of buyers,
vendors and product types, we propose a $O(N^2+NM^c)$ algorithm that, given an
efficient matching, computes stabilizing transfers that are rational and fair,
by first determining transfers between groups of buyers with an equal product
choice, and then between single buyers. Our results show that if cooperation is
allowed then social efficiency and stability can coexists in a market
presenting subtle externalities, and determining the right amount of
cooperation is computationally tractable.
