Score matching is a recently developed parameter learning method that is
particularly effective to complicated high dimensional density models with
intractable partition functions. In this paper, we study two issues that have
not been completely resolved for score matching. First, we provide a formal
link between maximum likelihood and score matching. Our analysis shows that
score matching finds model parameters that are more robust with noisy training
data. Second, we develop a generalization of score matching. Based on this
generalization, we further demonstrate an extension of score matching to models
of discrete data.
