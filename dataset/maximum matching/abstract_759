A thin conducting sheet - graphene, for example - transmits, absorbs, and
reflects radiation. A sheet that is very thin, even vanishingly so, can still
produce 50% absorption at normal incidence if it has conductivity corresponding
to half the impedance of free space. We find that, regardless of the sheet
conductivity, there exists a combination of polarization and angle of incidence
that achieves this impedance half-matching condition. If the conducting medium
can be inverted, the conductivity is formally negative and the sheet amplifies
the incident radiation. To the extent that a negative half-match in a thin
sheet can be maintained, enormous single-pass gain in both transmission and
reflection is possible. Known semiconductors (e.g. gallium nitride) have the
optical properties necessary to give large amplification in a structure that
is, remarkably, both thin and non-resonant.
