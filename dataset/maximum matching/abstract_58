Consider communication over a binary-input memoryless output-symmetric
channel with low density parity check (LDPC) codes and maximum a posteriori
(MAP) decoding. The replica method of spin glass theory allows to conjecture an
analytic formula for the average input-output conditional entropy per bit in
the infinite block length limit. Montanari proved a lower bound for this
entropy, in the case of LDPC ensembles with convex check degree polynomial,
which matches the replica formula. Here we extend this lower bound to any
irregular LDPC ensemble. The new feature of our work is an analysis of the
second derivative of the conditional input-output entropy with respect to
noise. A close relation arises between this second derivative and correlation
or mutual information of codebits. This allows us to extend the realm of the
interpolation method, in particular we show how channel symmetry allows to
control the fluctuations of the overlap parameters.
