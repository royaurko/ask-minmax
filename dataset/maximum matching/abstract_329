We express the leading electromagnetic corrections in K-> pi pi amplitudes as
integrals over the virtual photon squared-momentum Q^2. The high Q^2 behavior
is obtained via the operator product expansion. The low Q^2 behavior is
calculated using chiral perturbation theory. We model the intermediate Q^2
region using resonance contributions in order to enforce the matching of these
two regimes. The results confirm our previous estimates that the
electromagnetic corrections provide a reasonably small shift in the delta I -
3/2 amplitude.
