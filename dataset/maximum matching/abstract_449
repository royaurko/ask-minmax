Let $\mathbf{G}$ be a split algebrac group of type $E_n$ defined over a
$p$-adic field. This group contains a dual pair $G \times G'$ where one of the
groups is of type $G_2$. The minimal representation of $\mathbf{G}$, when
restricted to the dual pair, gives a correspondence of representations of the
two groups in the dual pair. We prove a matching of spherical Hecke algebras of
$G$ and $G'$, when acting on the minimal representation. This implies that the
correspondence is functorial, in the sense of Arthur and Langlands, for
spherical representations.
