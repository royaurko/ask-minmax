We propose the design of a reconfigurable impedance matching network for the
lower RF frequency band, based on a developed RF-MEMS technology. The circuit
is composed of RF-MEMS ohmic relays, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors and
suspended spiral inductors, all integrated on a high resistivity Silicon
substrate. The presented circuit is well-suited for all applications requiring
adaptive impedance matching between two in principle unknown cascaded
RF-circuits. The fabrication and testing of a monolithic integrated prototype
in RF-MEMS technology from ITC-irst is currently underway.
