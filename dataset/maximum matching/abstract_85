A graph is $k$-degenerate if any induced subgraph has a vertex of degree at
most $k$. In this paper we prove new algorithms for cliques and similar
structures for these graphs. We design linear time Fixed-Parameter Tractable
algorithms for induced and non induced bicliques. We prove an algorithm listing
all maximal bicliques in time $\mathcal{O}(k^{3}(n-k)2^{k})$, improving the
result of [D. Eppstein, Arboricity and bipartite subgraph listing algorithms,
Information Processing Letters, (1994)]. We construct an algorithm listing all
cliques of size $l$ in time $\mathcal{O}(l(n-k)k(k-1)^{l-2})$, improving a
result of [N. Chiba and T. Nishizeki, Arboricity and subgraph listing
algorithms, SIAM, (1985)]. As a consequence we can list all triangles in such
graphs in time $\mathcal{O}((n-k)k^{2})$ improving the previous bound of
$\mathcal{O}(nk^2)$. We show another optimal algorithm listing all maximal
cliques in time $\mathcal{O}(k(n-k)3^{k/3})$, matching the best possible
complexity proved in [D. Eppstein, M. L\"offler, and D. Strash, Listing all
maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs, JEA, (2013)]. Finally we
prove $(2-\frac{1}{k})$ and $\mathcal{O}(k(\log\log k)^{2}\slash (\log
k)^{3})$-approximation algorithms for the minimum vertex cover and the maximum
clique problems, respectively.
