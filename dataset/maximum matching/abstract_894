The evolving necessity of the Internet increases the demand on the bandwidth.
Therefore, this demand opens the doors for the hackers' community to develop
new methods and techniques to gain control over networking systems. Hence, the
intrusion detection systems (IDS) are insufficient to prevent/detect
uncontributorized access the network. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is
one example that still suffers from performance degradation due the increase of
the link speed in today's networks. In This paper we proposed a novel algorithm
to detect the intruders, who's trying to gain access to the network using the
packets header parameters such as; source/destination address,
source/destination port, and protocol without the need to inspect each packet
content looking for signatures/patterns. However, the "Packet Header Matching"
algorithm enhances the overall speed of the matching process between the
incoming packet headers against the rule set. We ran the proposed algorithm to
proof the proposed concept in coping with the traffic arrival speeds and the
various bandwidth demands. The achieved results were of significant enhancement
of the overall performance in terms of detection speed.
