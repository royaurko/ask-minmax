We discuss optical and infrared photometric properties of stars matched in
the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
commissioning data for 50 deg2 of sky. About 98% (63,000) of objects listed in
the 2MASS Point Source Catalog in the analyzed area are matched within 2 arcsec
to an SDSS source. The matched sources represent 8% of the about 800,000 SDSS
sources in this area, and 15% of them are resolved in SDSS imaging data,
although they are detected as point sources in 2MASS data.
  For about 14,000 stars with the smallest photometric errors (< 10%) in both
surveys, we present optical and infrared color-magnitude and color-color
diagrams. We use optical (SDSS) colors to identify the stellar spectral
sequence and show that stars of different spectral types can have similar
infrared colors, thus making the classification of stars based on only 2MASS
data very difficult. However, a broad separation into ``early'' and ``late''
spectral types (relative to type K0) is possible with a reliability of about
95% even with 2MASS colors alone.
  The distributions of matched sources in color-magnitude and color-color
diagrams are compared to the predictions of a stellar population synthesis
code. We find that the models are in fair overall agreement with the data. The
most significant discrepancies are found for the number ratio of ``early'' to
``late'' type stars (by about a factor of 2) and in the colors of M stars (up
to 0.2 mag).
