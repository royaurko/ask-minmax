Photonic crystals create dramatic new possibilities for nonlinear optics.
Line defects are shown to support modes suitable for the production of pairs of
photons by the material's second order nonlinearity even if the phase-matching
conditions cannot be satisfied in the bulk. These structures offer the
flexibility to achieve specific dispersion characteristics and potentially very
high brightness. In this work, two phase matching schemes are identified and
analyzed regarding their dispersive properties.
