In this paper the problem of matching Forward Kinematics (FK) motion of a 3
Dimensional (3D) joint chain to the Inverse Kinematics (IK) movement and vice
versa has been addressed. The problem lies at the heart of animating a 3D
character having controller and manipulator based rig for animation within any
3D modeling and animation software. The seamless matching has been achieved
through the use of pseudo-inverse of Jacobian Matrix. The Jacobian Matrix is
used to determine the rotation values of each joint of character body part such
as arms, between the inverse kinematics and forward kinematics motion. Then
moving the corresponding kinematic joint system to the desired place,
automatically eliminating the jumping or popping effect which would reduce the
complexity of the system.
