In genetic association studies, a single marker is often associated with
multiple, correlated phenotypes (e.g., obesity and cardiovascular disease, or
nicotine dependence and lung cancer). A pervasive question is then whether that
marker has independent effects on all phenotypes. In this article, we address
this question by assessing whether there is a direct genetic effect on one
phenotype that is not mediated through the other phenotypes. In particular, we
investigate how to identify and estimate such direct genetic effects on the
basis of (matched) case-control data. We discuss conditions under which such
effects are identifiable from the available (matched) case-control data. We
find that direct genetic effects are sometimes estimable via standard
regression methods, and sometimes via a more general G-estimation method, which
has previously been proposed for random samples and unmatched case-control
studies (Vansteelandt, 2009) and is here extended to matched case-control
studies. The results are used to assess whether the FTO gene is associated with
myocardial infarction other than via an effect on obesity.
