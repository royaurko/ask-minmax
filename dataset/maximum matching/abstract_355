A recent approach to the control of underactuated systems is to look for
control laws which will induce some specified structure on the closed loop
system. This basic idea is used in several papers already. In this paper, we
will describe one matching condition and an approach for finding all control
laws that fit the condition. After an analysis of the resulting control laws
for linear systems, we will present the results from an experiment on a ball
and beam system.
