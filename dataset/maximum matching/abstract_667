Let m be a positive integer and let G be a cubic graph of order 2n. We
consider the problem of covering the edge-set of G with the minimum number of
matchings of size m. This number is called excessive [m]-index of G in
literature. The case m=n, that is a covering with perfect matchings, is known
to be strictly related to an outstanding conjecture of Berge and Fulkerson. In
this paper we study in some details the case m=n-1. We show how this parameter
can be large for cubic graphs with low connectivity and we furnish some
evidence that each cyclically 4-connected cubic graph of order 2n has excessive
[n-1]-index at most 4. Finally, we discuss the relation between excessive
[n-1]-index and some other graph parameters as oddness and circumference.
