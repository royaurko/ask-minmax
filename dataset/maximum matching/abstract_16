The conventional semi-empirical formula for collapse distance [Phys. Rev.
179, 862 (1969), Prog. Quant. Electr. 4, 35 (1975)] has been widely used in
many applications. However, it is not applicable when the dispersion length is
smaller than or has similar order-of-magnitude as the collapse distance. For
the "enough short" pulses, there exists a threshold for the initial peak power,
with which the collapse distance has a maximum value due to the competition
between the Kerr self-focusing and the group velocity dispersion. New
semi-empirical formulas are obtained for the collapse distance of the pulse
with the initial power being less or larger than the threshold, and they can
match the numerical simulations gracefully.
