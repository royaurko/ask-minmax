First-principles full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW)
calculations have been performed for lattice-mismatched common-atom III-V
interfaces. In particular, we have examined the effects of epitaxial strain
and ordering direction on the valence band offset in [001] and [111]
GaSb/InSb and InAs/InSb superlattices, and found that the valence band
maximum is always higher at the InSb side of the heterojunction, except
for the common-anion system grown on an InSb substrate. The comparison
between equivalent structures having the same substrate lattice constant, but
different growth axis, shows that for comparable strain conditions, the
ordering direction slightly influences the band line-up, due to small
differences of the charge readjustment at the [001] and [111] interfaces. On
the other hand, strain is shown to strongly affect the VBO; in particular, as
the pseudomorphic growth conditions are varied, the bulk contribution to the
band line-up changes markedly, whereas the interface term is almost constant.
On the whole, our calculations yield a band line-up that decreases linearly
as the substrate lattice constant is increased, showing its high tunability
as a function of different pseudomorphic growth conditions. Finally, the band
line-up at the lattice matched InAs/GaSb interface determined using the
transitivity rule gave perfect agreement between predicted and experimental
results.
