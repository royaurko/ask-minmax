Some consequences of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) of matrices have
been applied to develop a greedy algorithm called "ROMP" (Regularized
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) to recover sparse signals and to approximate
non-sparse ones. These consequences were subsequently applied to other greedy
and thresholding algorithms like "SThresh", "CoSaMP", "StOMP" and "SWCGP". In
this paper, we find another consequence of the RIP property and use it to
analyze the approximation to k-sparse signals with Stagewise Weak versions of
Gradient Pursuit (SWGP), Matching Pursuit (SWMP) and Orthogonal Matching
Pursuit (SWOMP). We combine the above mentioned algorithms with another
selection rule similar to the ones that have appeared in the literature showing
that results are obtained with less restrictions in the RIP constant, but we
need a smaller threshold parameter for the coefficients. The results of some
experiments are shown.
