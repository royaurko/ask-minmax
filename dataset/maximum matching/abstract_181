We obtain models for a triaxial Milky Way spheroid based on data by Newberg
and Yanny. The best fits to the data occur for a spheroid center that is
shifted by 3kpc from the Galactic Center. We investigate effects of the
triaxiality on the microlensing optical depth to the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC). The optical depth can be used to ascertain the number of Massive Compact
Halo Objects (MACHOs); a larger spheroid contribution would imply fewer Halo
MACHOs. On the one hand, the triaxiality gives rise to more spheroid mass along
the line of sight between us and the LMC and thus a larger optical depth.
However, shifting the spheroid center leads to an effect that goes in the other
direction: the best fit to the spheroid center is_away_ from the line of sight
to the LMC. As a consequence, these two effects tend to cancel so that the
change in optical depth due to the Newberg/Yanny triaxial halo is at most 50%.
After subtracting the spheroid contribution in the four models we consider, the
MACHO contribution (central value) to the mass of the Galactic Halo varies from
\~(8-20)% if all excess lensing events observed by the MACHO collaboration are
assumed to be due to MACHOs. Here the maximum is due to the original MACHO
collaboration results and the minimum is consistent with 0% at the 1 sigma
error level in the data.
