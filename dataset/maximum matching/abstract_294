A catalog of nearby clusters in the 5800 deg$^2$ area in the southern
Galactic cap is constructed by applying a matched-filter cluster-finding
algorithm to the sample of 3.3 million galaxies from the APM Galaxy Survey. I
have preliminarily detected more than 4000 cluster candidates with estimated
redshift of less than 0.2 and with richness similar to those of ACO clusters.
Generally, a good correspondence is found between the nearest cluster
candidates in our catalog and the ACO clusters which have measured redshift.
While the ACO catalog becomes incomplete at z>0.08, the completeness limit of
our cluster catalog reaches z=0.15.
