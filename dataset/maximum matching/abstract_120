This paper focuses on finite-dimensional upper and lower bounds on decodable
thresholds of Zm and binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, assuming
belief propagation decoding on memoryless channels. A concrete framework is
presented, admitting systematic searches for new bounds. Two noise measures are
considered: the Bhattacharyya noise parameter and the soft bit value for a
maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder on the uncoded channel. For Zm
LDPC codes, an iterative m-dimensional bound is derived for
m-ary-input/symmetric-output channels, which gives a sufficient stability
condition for Zm LDPC codes and is complemented by a matched necessary
stability condition introduced herein. Applications to coded modulation and to
codes with non-equiprobable distributed codewords are also discussed.
  For binary codes, two new lower bounds are provided for symmetric channels,
including a two-dimensional iterative bound and a one-dimensional non-iterative
bound, the latter of which is the best known bound that is tight for binary
symmetric channels (BSCs), and is a strict improvement over the bound derived
by the channel degradation argument. By adopting the reverse channel
perspective, upper and lower bounds on the decodable Bhattacharyya noise
parameter are derived for non-symmetric channels, which coincides with the
existing bound for symmetric channels.
