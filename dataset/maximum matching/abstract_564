Let G be a finite connected graph, and let \rho be the spectral radius of its
universal cover. For example, if G is k-regular then \rho=2\sqrt{k-1}. We show
that for every d, there is a d-sheeted covering of G where all the new
eigenvalues are bounded from above by \rho. It follows that a bipartite
Ramanujan graph has a d-sheeted Ramanujan covering for every d. This
generalizes the d=2 case due to Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava (2013).
  Every d-sheeted covering of G corresponds to a labeling of the edges of G by
elements of the symmetric group S_d. We generalize this notion to labeling the
edges by various groups and present a broader scenario where Ramanujan
coverings are guaranteed to exist.
  An important ingredient of our proof is a new generalization of the matching
polynomial of a graph. We define the d-th matching polynomial of G to be the
average matching polynomial of all d-coverings of G. We show this polynomial
shares many properties with the original matching polynomial. For example, it
is real rooted with all its roots inside [-\rho,\rho] .
  Inspired by Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava, a crucial component of our proof is
the existence of interlacing families of polynomials for complex reflection
groups. The core argument of this component is taken from a recent manuscript
of them.
