Black holes in core-collapse of massive stars are expected to surge in mass
and angular momentum by hyper-accretion immediately following their formation.
We here describe a general framework of extended emission in gravitational
waves from non-axisymmetric accretion flows from fallback matter of the
progenitor envelope. It shows (a) a maximum efficiency in conversion of
accretion energy into gravitational waves at hyper-accretion rates exceeding a
critical value set by the ratio of the quadrupole mass inhomogeneity and
viscosity with (b) a peak characteristic strain amplitude at the frequency
$f_b=\Omega_b/\pi$, where $\Omega_b$ is the Keplerian angular velocity at which
viscous torques equal angular momentum loss in gravitational radiation, with
$h_{char}\propto f^{1/6}$ at $f<f_b$ and $h_{char}\propto f^{-1/6}$ at $f>f_b$.
Upcoming gravitational wave observations may probe this scaling by extracting
broadband spectra using time-sliced matched filtering with chirp templates,
recently developed for identifying turbulence in noisy time series.
