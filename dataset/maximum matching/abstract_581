Ternary and quaternary cubic c-AlxIn1-xN/GaN and c-AlxGayIn1-x-y/GaN
heterostructures lattice-matched to c-GaN on freestanding 3C-SiC substrates
were grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The c-AlxGayIn1-x-y alloy
permits the independent control of band gap and lattice parameter. The ternary
and quaternary films were grown at 620 C. Different alloy compositions were
obtained by varying the Al and Ga fluxes. The alloy composition was measured by
Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and Rutherford Backscattering
Spectrometry (RBS). X-ray reciprocal space map of asymmetric (-1-13) reflex
were used to measure the lattice parameters and to verify the lattice match
between the alloy and the c-GaN buffer.
