There are many image fusion methods that can be used to produce
high-resolution mutlispectral images from a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN)
image and low-resolution multispectral (MS) of remote sensed images. This paper
attempts to undertake the study of image fusion techniques with different
Statistical techniques for image fusion as Local Mean Matching (LMM), Local
Mean and Variance Matching (LMVM), Regression variable substitution (RVS),
Local Correlation Modeling (LCM) and they are compared with one another so as
to choose the best technique, that can be applied on multi-resolution satellite
images. This paper also devotes to concentrate on the analytical techniques for
evaluating the quality of image fusion (F) by using various methods including
Standard Deviation (SD), Entropy(En), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Signal-to
Noise Ratio (SNR), Normalization Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Deviation
Index (DI) to estimate the quality and degree of information improvement of a
fused image quantitatively.
