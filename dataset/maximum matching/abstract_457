We summarize recent developments in the VINCIA parton shower. After a brief
review of the basics of the formalism, the extension of VINCIA to hadron
collisions is sketched. We then turn to improvements of the efficiency of
tree-level matching by making the shower history unique and by incorporating
identified helicities. We conclude with an overview of matching to one-loop
matrix elements.
