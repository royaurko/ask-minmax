For any fixed integer $R \geq 2$ we characterise the typical structure of
undirected graphs with vertices $1, ..., n$ and maximum degree $R$, as $n$
tends to infinity. The information is used to prove that such graphs satisfy a
labelled limit law for first-order logic. If $R \geq 5$ then also an unlabelled
limit law holds.
