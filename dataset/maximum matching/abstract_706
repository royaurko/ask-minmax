Matching Pursuit LASSIn Part I \cite{TanPMLPart1}, a Matching Pursuit LASSO
({MPL}) algorithm has been presented for solving large-scale sparse recovery
(SR) problems. In this paper, we present a subspace search to further improve
the performance of MPL, and then continue to address another major challenge of
SR -- batch SR with many signals, a consideration which is absent from most of
previous $\ell_1$-norm methods. As a result, a batch-mode {MPL} is developed to
vastly speed up sparse recovery of many signals simultaneously. Comprehensive
numerical experiments on compressive sensing and face recognition tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of MPL and BMPL over other methods
considered in this paper, in terms of sparse recovery ability and efficiency.
In particular, BMPL is up to 400 times faster than existing $\ell_1$-norm
methods considered to be state-of-the-art.O Part II: Applications and Sparse
