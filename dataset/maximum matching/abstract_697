The Internet has enabled the creation of a growing number of large-scale
knowledge bases in a variety of domains containing complementary information.
Tools for automatically aligning these knowledge bases would make it possible
to unify many sources of structured knowledge and answer complex queries.
However, the efficient alignment of large-scale knowledge bases still poses a
considerable challenge. Here, we present Simple Greedy Matching (SiGMa), a
simple algorithm for aligning knowledge bases with millions of entities and
facts. SiGMa is an iterative propagation algorithm which leverages both the
structural information from the relationship graph as well as flexible
similarity measures between entity properties in a greedy local search, thus
making it scalable. Despite its greedy nature, our experiments indicate that
SiGMa can efficiently match some of the world's largest knowledge bases with
high precision. We provide additional experiments on benchmark datasets which
demonstrate that SiGMa can outperform state-of-the-art approaches both in
accuracy and efficiency.
