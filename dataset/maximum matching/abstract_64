We present the design and performance of a 2x2 prototype array of corrugated
feed-horns in W-band. The module is fabricated using a so-called "platelet"
technique by milling Aluminum plates. This technique is suitable for low-cost
and scalable high performance applications. Room temperature Return Loss
measurements show a low (<-30 dB) reflection over a 30% bandwidth with a
maximum matching of -42 dB at 100 GHz for all four antennas. Beam pattern
measurements indicate good repeatability and a low (-25 dB) sidelobe and
crosspolarisation levels. This work is particularly relevant for future Cosmic
Microwave Background polarisation measurements, which require large microwave
cryogenic detector arrays coupled to high performance corrugated feed horns.
