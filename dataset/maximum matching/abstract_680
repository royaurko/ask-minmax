We investigate implementations of biometric cryptosystems protecting
fingerprint templates (which are mostly based on the fuzzy vault scheme by
Juels and Sudan in 2002) with respect to the security they provide. We show
that attacks taking advantage of the system's false acceptance rate, i.e.
false-accept attacks, pose a very serious risk --- even if brute-force attacks
are impractical to perform. Our observations lead to the clear conclusion that
currently a single fingerprint is not sufficient to provide a secure biometric
cryptosystem. But there remain other problems that can not be resolved by
merely switching to multi-finger: Kholmatov and Yanikoglu in 2007 demonstrated
that it is possible to break two matching vault records at quite a high rate
via the correlation attack.
  We propose an implementation of a minutiae fuzzy vault that is inherently
resistant against cross-matching and the correlation attack. Surprisingly,
achieving cross-matching resistance is not at the cost of authentication
performance. In particular, we propose to use a randomized decoding procedure
and find that it is possible to achieve a GAR=91% at which no false accepts are
observed on a database generally used. Our ideas can be adopted into an
implementation of a multibiometric cryptosystem. All experiments described in
this paper can fully be reproduced using software available for download.
