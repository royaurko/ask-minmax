A calculation of the hadronic matrix elements for K\to\pi\pi including
\pi-\pi rescattering effects in a dispersion integral is presented. I study the
dependence of the results on the matching scale \mu and use them to calculate
the CP-parameter (\epsilon\prime/\epsilon). I find improved stability on the
matching scale and good agreement with the experimental results.
