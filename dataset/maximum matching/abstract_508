Time-dependent density functional theory is extended to include dissipative
systems evolving under a master equation, providing a Hamiltonian treatment for
molecular electronics. For weak electric fields, the isothermal conductivity is
shown to match the adiabatic conductivity, thereby recovering the Landauer
result.
