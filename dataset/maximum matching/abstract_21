Epitaxial layers of the topological insulator Bi2Se3 have been grown by
molecular beam epitaxy on laterally lattice-matched InP(111)B substrates. High
resolution X-ray diffraction shows a significant improvement of Bi2Se3 crystal
quality compared to layers deposited on other substrates. The measured full
width at half maximum of the rocking curve is Delta omega=13 arcsec, and the
(omega-2theta) scans exhibit clear layer thickness fringes. Atomic force
microscope images show triangular twin domains with sizes increasing with layer
thickness. The structural quality of the domains is confirmed on the
microscopic level by transmission electron microscopy.
