We construct a static axisymmetric wormhole from the gravitational field of
two Schwarzschild particles which are kept in equilibrium by strings (ropes)
extending to infinity. The wormhole is obtained by matching two
three-dimensional timelike surfaces surrounding each of the particles and thus
spacetime becomes non-simply connected. Although the matching will not be exact
in general it is possible to make the error arbitrarily small by assuming that
the distance between the particles is much larger than the radius of the
wormhole mouths. Whenever the masses of the two wormhole mouths are different,
causality violating effects will occur.
