We investigate timelike junctions (with surface layer) between spherically
symmetric solutions of the Einstein-field equation. In contrast to previous
investigations this is done in a coordinate system in which the junction
surface motion is absorbed in the metric, while all coordinates are continuous
at the junction surface.
  The evolution equations for all relevant quantities are derived. We discuss
the no-surface layer case (boundary surface) and study the behaviour for small
surface energies. It is shown that one should expect cases in which the speed
of light is reached within a finite proper time.
  We carefully discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for a possible
matching of spherically symmetric sections.
  For timelike junctions between spherically symmetric space-time sections we
show explicitly that the time component of the Lanczos equation always reduces
to an identity (independently of the surface equation of state).
  The results are applied to the matching of FLRW models. We discuss `vacuum
bubbles' and closed-open junctions in detail. As illustrations several
numerical integration results are presented, some of them indicate that the
junction surface can reach the speed of light within a finite time.
