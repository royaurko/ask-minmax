The main Higgs production channel at hadron colliders is gluon fusion via
heavy-quark loops. We present the results of a fully exclusive simulation of
gluon fusion Higgs production based on the matrix elements for h + 0, 1, 2
partons including full heavy-quark loop dependence, matched to a parton shower.
We consider a Higgs with standard model couplings as well as models where the
Higgs has enhanced couplings to bottom quarks (b-philic). We study the most
relevant kinematic distributions, such as jet and Higgs pT spectra and find
that matched samples provide an accurate description of the final state. For
the SM Higgs, we confirm the excellent accuracy of the large heavy-quark-mass
approximation also in differential distributions over all phase space, with
significant effects arising only at large pT . For a b-philic Higgs however,
the loops have a dramatic impact on the kinematics of the Higgs as well as of
the jets and need to be accounted for exactly to achieve reliable event
simulations.
