The enumeration of perfect matchings of graphs is equivalent to the dimer
problem which has applications in statistical physics. A graph $G$ is said to
be $n$-rotation symmetric if the cyclic group of order $n$ is a subgroup of the
automorphism group of $G$. Jockusch (Perfect matchings and perfect squares, J.
Combin. Theory Ser. A, 67(1994), 100-115) and Kuperberg (An exploration of the
permanent-determinant method, Electron. J. Combin., 5(1998), #46) proved
independently that if $G$ is a plane bipartite graph of order $N$ with
$2n$-rotation symmetry, then the number of perfect matchings of $G$ can be
expressed as the product of $n$ determinants of order $N/2n$. In this paper we
give this result a new presentation. We use this result to compute the entropy
of a bulk plane bipartite lattice with $2n$-notation symmetry. We obtain
explicit expressions for the numbers of perfect matchings and entropies for two
types of cylinders. Using the results on the entropy of the torus obtained by
Kenyon, Okounkov, and Sheffield (Dimers and amoebae, Ann. Math. 163(2006),
1019--1056) and by Salinas and Nagle (Theory of the phase transition in the
layered hydrogen-bonded $SnCl^2\cdot 2H_2O$ crystal, Phys. Rev. B, 9(1974),
4920--4931), we show that each of the cylinders considered and its
corresponding torus have the same entropy. Finally, we pose some problems.
