It is shown that the description of collapse given by the classic model of
Oppenheimer and Snyder fails to satisfy a crucial matching condition at the
surface of the ball. After correcting the model so that the interior and
exterior metrics match correctly, it is established that the contraction
process stops at the Schwarzschild radius, that there is an accumulation of
particles at the surface of the ball, and that in the limit of infinite time
lapse the density of particles at the surface becomes infinite. A black hole
cannot form. This result confirms the judgements of both Einstein and Eddington
about gravitational collapse when the collapse velocity approaches that of
light.
