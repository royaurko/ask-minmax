We study deterministic distributed broadcasting in synchronous
multiple-access channels. Packets are injected into $n$ nodes by a window-type
adversary that is constrained by a window $w$ and injection rates individually
assigned to all nodes. We investigate what queue size and packet latency can be
achieved with the maximum aggregate injection rate of one packet per round,
depending on properties of channels and algorithms. We give a non-adaptive
algorithm for channels with collision detection and an adaptive algorithm for
channels without collision detection that achieve $O(\min(n+w,w\log n))$ packet
latency. We show that packet latency has to be either $\Omega(w \max (1,\log_w
n))$, when $w\le n$, or $\Omega(w+n)$, when $w>n$, as a matching lower bound to
these algorithms. We develop a non-adaptive algorithm for channels without
collision detection that achieves $O(n+w)$ queue size and $O(nw)$ packet
latency. This is in contrast with the adversarial model of global injection
rates, in which non-adaptive algorithms with bounded packet latency do not
exist [18]. Our algorithm avoids collisions produced by simultaneous
transmissions; we show that any algorithm with this property must have
$\Omega(nw)$ packet latency.
