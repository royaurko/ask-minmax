This paper presents the experimental comparison of fourteen stereo matching
algorithms in variant illumination conditions. Different adaptations of global
and local stereo matching techniques are chosen for evaluation The variant
strength and weakness of the chosen correspondence algorithms are explored by
employing the methodology of the prediction error strategy. The algorithms are
gauged on the basis of their performance on real world data set taken in
various indoor lighting conditions and at different times of the day
