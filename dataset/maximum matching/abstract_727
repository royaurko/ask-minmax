We present a new computational method for smoothly matching general
relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to its force-free limit. The
method is based on a flux-conservative formalism for MHD and its force-free
limit, and a vector potential formulation for the induction equation to
maintain the zero divergence constraint for the magnetic field. The force-free
formulation we adopt evolves the magnetic field and the Poynting vector,
instead of the magnetic and electric fields. We show that our force-free code
passes a robust suite of tests, performed both in 1D flat spacetime and in 3D
black hole spacetimes. We also demonstrate that our matching technique
successfully reproduces the aligned rotator force-free solution. Our new
techniques are suitable for studying electromagnetic effects and predicting
electromagnetic signals arising in many different curved spacetime scenarios.
For example, we can treat spinning neutron stars, either in isolation or in
compact binaries, that have MHD interiors and force-free magnetospheres.
