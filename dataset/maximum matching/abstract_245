The high-intensity rare-isotope accelerator (RAON) of the Rare Isotope
Science Project (RISP) in Daejeon, Korea, has been designed to accelerate
multiple-charge-state beams. The ion beams, which are generated by Electron
Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECR-IS), will be transported through the main
Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) system to the Radio Frequency Quadrupole
(RFQ). While passing the beams through LEBT, we should keep the transverse beam
size and longitudinal emittance small. Furthermore, the matching of required
twiss parameter at the RFQ entrance will be performed by using electro-static
quadrupoles at the main LEBT matching section which is from the multi-harmonic
buncher (MHB) to the entrance of RFQ. We will briefly review the new aspects of
main LEBT lattice and the beam matching at the main LEBT matching section will
be presented. In addition, the effects of various errors on the beam orbit and
the correction of distorted orbit will be discussed.
