We show that even a rather minimal extension of the Einstein - Hilbert action
by a nonminimal coupling of the scalar field to the Ricci curvature scalar
results in configurations that resemble more the dark energy stars then the
ordinary boson stars. Even though many of those configurations are endowed by
negative principal pressures, the strong energy condition, as a signal of
repulsive gravity, is not significantly violated in these configurations. When
imposing restrictions on matter from energy conditions we find that the
maximally allowed masses are shifted to the lower values due to the violation
of the weak and dominant energy conditions. We also calculate the effective
compactness and show that its maximum value is attained in the region of
negative pressures, and is greater then that in ordinary boson stars. Moreover,
we develop a universality technique which allows to efficiently map small
configurations, that are easily solved by numerical methods, to large
astrophysical objects.
