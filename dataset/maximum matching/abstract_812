The transmission of a dipole-dominated spin wave in a ferromagnetic film
through a localised inhomogeneity in the form of a magnetic field produced by a
dc current through a wire placed on the film surface was studied experimentally
and theoretically. It was shown that the amplitude and phase of the transmitted
wave can be simultaneously affected by the current induced field, a feature
that will be relevant for logic based on spin wave transport.
  The direction of the current creates either a barrier or well for spin wave
transmission. The main observation is that the current dependence of the
amplitude of the spin wave transmitted through the well inhomogeneity is
non-monotonic. The dependence has a minimum and an additional maximum. A theory
was constructed to clarify the nature of the maximum. It shows that the
transmission of spin waves through the inhomogeneity can be considered as a
scattering process and that the additional maximum is a scattering resonance.
