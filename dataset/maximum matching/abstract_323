Using staggered fermions, we calculate the perturbative corrections to the
bilinear and four-fermion operators that are used in the numerical study of
weak matrix elements for $\epsilon'/\epsilon$. We present results for one-loop
matching coefficients between continuum operators, calculated in the Naive
Dimensional Regularization (NDR) scheme, and gauge invariant staggered fermion
operators. These results, combined with existing results for penguin diagrams,
provide the complete one-loop renormalization of the staggered four-fermion
operators.
