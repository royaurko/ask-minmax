We implement a cutoff-independent regularization of four-fermion interactions
to calculate the color-superconducting gap parameter in quark matter. The
traditional cutoff regularization has difficulties for chemical potentials \mu
of the order of the cutoff \Lambda, predicting in particular a vanishing gap at
\mu \sim \Lambda. The proposed cutoff-independent regularization predicts a
finite gap at high densities and indicates a smooth matching with the weak
coupling QCD prediction for the gap at asymptotically high densities.
