We study the eclipsing nova-like variable V347 Pup by matching its UV
emission line profiles in and out of eclipse to synthetic lines using a 3D
kinematic and radiation transfer model. Our results support the accretion disk
origin of winds in non-magnetic CVs as opposite to the WD origin. Our main
point concerns the importance of rotation for the UV emission line shapes in
such systems. In particular, we show that the narrowing of the UV emission
lines in V347 Pup during eclipse can be easily explained by the eclipse of the
innermost part of the wind by the secondary and the resulting reduction in the
contribution of rotational broadening to the width of the lines. During the
eclipse, the residual line flux is very sensitive to the maximal temperature of
disk radiation. Good fits for reasonable mass-loss rates have been obtained for
maximum disk temperatures of 50,000 degrees. This constraint was imposed either
by leveling off the inner disk temperature profiles, in agreement with recent
observations of some nova-like objects, or by assuming that the accretion disk
does not extend to the surface of the white dwarf, in which case V347 up would
be an intermediate polar. In anticipation of high-speed spectrophotometry of
CVs by the HST, we provide numerical model of a time-resolved eclipse of V347
Pup or similar such system to be verified by future observations.
