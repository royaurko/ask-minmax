In this paper we propose a matched encoding (ME) scheme for convolutionally
encoded transmission over intersymbol interference (usually called ISI)
channels. A novel trellis description enables to perform equalization and
decoding jointly, i.e., enables efficient super-trellis decoding. By means of
this matched non-linear trellis description we can significantly reduce the
number of states needed for the receiver-side Viterbi algorithm to perform
maximum-likelihood sequence estimation. Further complexity reduction is
achieved using the concept of reduced-state sequence estimation.
