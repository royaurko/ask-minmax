In this work we test the most widely used methods for fitting the composition
fraction in data, namely maximum likelihood, $\chi^2$, mean value of the
distributions and mean value of the posterior probability function. We discuss
the discrimination power of the four methods in different scenarios: signal to
noise discrimination; two signals; and distributions of Xmax for mixed primary
mass composition. We introduce a "distance" parameter, which can be used to
estimate, as a rule of thumb, the precision of the discrimination. Finally, we
conclude that the most reliable methods in all the studied scenarios are the
maximum likelihood and the mean value of the posterior probability function.
