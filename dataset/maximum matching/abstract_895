XEFT is a low energy effective theory for the X(3872) that can be used to
systematically analyze the decay and production of the X(3872) meson, assuming
that it is a weakly bound state of charmed mesons. In a previous paper, we
calculated the decays of X(3872) into \chi_{cJ} plus pions using a two-step
procedure in which Heavy Hadron Chiral Perturbation Theory (HH\chiPT)
amplitudes are matched onto XEFT operators and then X(3872) decay rates are
then calculated using these operators. The procedure leads to IR divergences in
the three-body decay X(3872) \to \chi_{cJ} \pi \pi when virtual D mesons can go
on-shell in tree level HH\chiPT diagrams. In previous work, we regulated these
IR divergences with the $D^{*0}$ width. In this work, we carefully analyze
X(3872) \to \chi_{cJ} \pi^0 and X(3872) \to \chi_{cJ} \pi \pi using the
operator product expansion (OPE) in XEFT. Forward scattering amplitudes in
HH\chiPT are matched onto local operators in XEFT, the imaginary parts of which
are responsible for the decay of the X(3872). Here we show that the IR
divergences are regulated by the binding momentum of the X(3872) rather than
the width of the D^{*0} meson. In the OPE, these IR divergences cancel in the
calculation of the matching coefficients so the correct predictions for the
X(3872) \to \chi_{c1} \pi \pi do not receive enhancements due to the width of
the D^{*0}. We give updated predictions for the decay X(3872) \to \chi_{c1} \pi
\pi at leading order in XEFT.
