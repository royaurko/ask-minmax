Let H be an r-partite r-graph, all of whose sides have the same size n.
Suppose that there exist two sides of H, each satisfying the following
condition: the degree of each legal (r-1)-tuple contained in the complement of
this side is strictly larger than n/2. We prove that under this condition H
must have a perfect matching. This answers a question of Kuhn and Osthus.
