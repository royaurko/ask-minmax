Measuring and maximising the influence of individuals is the key to
understand and leverage the multiplicative potential of viral spreading over
social networks. Yet these have been recognized as problems requiring global
structural information, and extremely difficult for the enormous size and
complexity of online social networks. Based on the percolation phenomenon, we
show that they can be essentially reduced to local problems. Our estimated
global influence of individuals based on local structural information matches
that of brute-force search. Furthermore this measure leads to an efficient
algorithm to identify the best seed spreaders for maximum viral influence. Its
time complexity is independent of network size, making it practically useful
for real networks. The underlying theoretical framework enables a thorough
analytical assessment of the prediction accuracy and the absolute performance
of the proposed methods.
