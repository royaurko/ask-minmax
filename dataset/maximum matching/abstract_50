The general problem of computing the false-alarm rate vs. detection-threshold
relationship for a bank of correlators is addressed, in the context of
maximum-likelihood detection of gravitational waves, with specific reference to
chirps from coalescing binary systems. Accurate (lower-bound) approximants for
the cumulative distribution of the whole-bank supremum are deduced from a class
of Bonferroni-type inequalities. The asymptotic properties of the cumulative
distribution are obtained, in the limit where the number of correlators goes to
infinity. The validity of numerical simulations made on small-size banks is
extended to banks of any size, via a gaussian-correlation inequality. The
result is used to estimate the optimum template density, yielding the best
tradeoff between computational cost and detection efficiency, in terms of
undetected potentially observable sources at a prescribed false-alarm level,
for the simplest case of Newtonian chirps.
