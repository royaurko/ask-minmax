We match the continuum and lattice axial vector and vector currents at one
loop in perturbation theory. For the heavy quarks we use the nonrelativistic
QCD (NRQCD) action and for the light quarks the Highly Improved Staggered Quark
(HISQ) action. We present results for both massless and massive HISQ quarks and
as part of the matching procedure we include a discussion of the one loop HISQ
renormalisation parameters.
