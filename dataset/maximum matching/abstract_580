We argue that a simple way to bypass reflections at the boundaries of a
finite Luttinger liquid (LL) connected to electrodes is to match load and drain
impedances to the characteristic impedance of the LL viewed as a mesoscopic
transmission line. For an impedance matched LL, this implies that the AC and DC
shot noise properties of a finite LL are identical to those of an infinite LL.
Even for an impedance mismatched LL, we show by a careful analysis of
reflections that the intrinsic infinite LL properties can still be extracted
yielding possibly irrational charges for the LL elementary excitations. We
improve on existing results for AC shot noise by deriving expressions with
explicit dependence on the charges of the fractional states. Most notably these
results can be established quite straightforwardly without resort to the
Keldysh technique. We apply these arguments to two experimental setups which
allow the observation of different sets of fractional quasiparticles: (i)
injection of current by a STM tip in the bulk of a LL; (ii) backscattering of
current by an impurity. An Appendix reviews pedagogically the 'fractional
states picture' of the LL.
