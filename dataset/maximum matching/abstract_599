We study the effects of the one-loop matching conditions on Higgs boson and
top quark masses on the triviality bounds on the Higgs boson mass using
$\beta_{\lambda}$ with corrected two-loop coefficients. We obtain quite higher
results than previous ones and observe that the triviality bounds are not
nearly influenced by varying top quark mass over the range measured at CDF and
D0. The effects of typo errors in $\beta_{\lambda}^{(2)}$ and the one-loop
matching condition on the top quark mass are negligible. We estimate the size
of effects on the triviality bounds from the one-loop matching condition on the
Higgs boson mass.
