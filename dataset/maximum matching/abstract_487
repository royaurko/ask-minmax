In this paper, we analyze the uniqueness of the sparse time frequency
decomposition and investigate the efficiency of the nonlinear matching pursuit
method. Under the assumption of scale separation, we show that the sparse time
frequency decomposition is unique up to an error that is determined by the
scale separation property of the signal. We further show that the unique
decomposition can be obtained approximately by the sparse time frequency
decomposition using nonlinear matching pursuit.
