We present an analysis of planetary moves, encoded in DE406 ephemerides. We
show resonance cycles between most planets in Solar System, of differing
quality. The most precise resonance - between Earth and Venus, which not only
stabilizes orbits of both planets, locks planet Venus rotation in tidal
locking, but also affects the Sun:
  This resonance group (E+V) also influences Sunspot cycles - the position of
syzygy between Earth and Venus, when the barycenter of the resonance group most
closely approaches the Sun and stops for some time, relative to Jupiter planet,
well matches the Sunspot cycle of 11 years, not only for the last 400 years of
measured Sunspot cycles, but also in 1000 years of historical record of "severe
winters". We show, how cycles in angular momentum of Earth and Venus planets
match with the Sunspot cycle and how the main cycle in angular momentum of the
whole Solar system (854-year cycle of Jupiter/Saturn) matches with climatologic
data, assumed to show connection with Solar output power and insolation. We
show the possible connections between E+V events and Solar global p-Mode
frequency changes.
  We futher show angular momentum tables and charts for individual planets, as
encoded in DE405 and DE406 ephemerides. We show, that inner planets orbit on
heliocentric trajectories whereas outer planets orbit on barycentric
trajectories.
