We present an exploratory tool that extracts person names from multilingual
news collections, matches name variants referring to the same person, and
infers relationships between people based on the co-occurrence of their names
in related news. A novel feature is the matching of name variants across
languages and writing systems, including names written with the Greek, Cyrillic
and Arabic writing system. Due to our highly multilingual setting, we use an
internal standard representation for name representation and matching, instead
of adopting the traditional bilingual approach to transliteration. This work is
part of the news analysis system NewsExplorer that clusters an average of
25,000 news articles per day to detect related news within the same and across
different languages.
