We derive a lower bound on the secrecy capacity of the compound wiretap
channel with channel state information at the transmitter which matches the
general upper bound on the secrecy capacity of general compound wiretap
channels given by Liang et al. and thus establishing a full coding theorem in
this case. We achieve this with a stronger secrecy criterion and the maximum
error probability criterion, and with a decoder that is robust against the
effect of randomisation in the encoding. This relieves us from the need of
decoding the randomisation parameter which is in general not possible within
this model. Moreover we prove a lower bound on the secrecy capacity of the
compound wiretap channel without channel state information and derive a
multi-letter expression for the capacity in this communication scenario.
