Recently sparse coding have been highly successful in image classification
mainly due to its capability of incorporating the sparsity of image
representation. In this paper, we propose an improved sparse coding model based
on linear spatial pyramid matching(SPM) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT ) descriptors. The novelty is the simultaneous non-convex and
non-negative characters added to the sparse coding model. Our numerical
experiments show that the improved approach using non-convex and non-negative
sparse coding is superior than the original ScSPM[1] on several typical
databases.
