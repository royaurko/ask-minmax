In this second paper on match analysis, we analyze in deep the competition
steps showing the evolution of this tool at National Federation level.On the
basis of our,first classification. Furthermore, it is the most important source
of technical assessment. Studying competition with this tool is essential for
the coaches because they can obtain useful information for their coaching.
Match Analysis is today the master key in situation sports like Judo, to help
in useful way the difficult task of coach or best for National or Olympic
coaching equips. In this paper it is presented a deeper study of the judo
competitions at high level both from the male and female point of view,
explaining at light of biomechanics, not only the throws evolution in time,
introduction of Innovative and Chaotic techniques, but also the evolution of
fighting style in these high level competitions, both connected with the grow
of this Olympic Sport in the Word Arena. It is shown how new interesting ways
are opened by this powerful coaching tool, very useful for National team
technical management.In the last part of this paper we analyze advanced
mathematical tools describing Couple of Athletes motion as Fractal Poisson
Point Processes based on Fractional Brownian Motion to show how strategic
evaluation, probability and short term forecast can be applied to Judo
competition.
