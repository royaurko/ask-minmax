The non-perturbative renormalization of four-quark operators plays a
significant role in lattice studies of flavor physics. For this purpose, we
define regularization-independent symmetric momentum-subtraction (RI/SMOM)
schemes for Delta S=1 flavor-changing four-quark operators and provide one-loop
matching factors to the MS-bar scheme in naive dimensional regularization. The
mixing of two-quark operators is discussed in terms of two different classes of
schemes. We provide a compact expression for the finite one-loop amplitudes
which allows for a straightforward definition of further RI/SMOM schemes.
