In many-to-many matching models, substitutable preferences constitute the
largest domain for which a pairwise stable matching is guaranteed to exist. In
this note, we extend the recently proposed algorithm of Hatfield et al. [3] to
test substitutability of weak preferences. Interestingly, the algorithm is
faster than the algorithm of Hatfield et al. by a linear factor on the domain
of strict preferences.
