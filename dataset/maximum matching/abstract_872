We apply heavy-quark effective theory to separate long- and short-distance
effects of heavy quarks in lattice gauge theory. In this approach, the inverse
heavy-quark mass and the lattice spacing are treated as short distances, and
their effects are lumped into short-distance coefficients. We show how to use
this formalism to match lattice gauge theory to continuum QCD, order by order
in the heavy-quark expansion. In this paper, we focus on heavy-light currents.
In particular, we obtain one-loop results for the matching factors of lattice
currents, needed for heavy-quark phenomenology, such as the calculation of
heavy-light decay constants, and heavy-to-light transition form factors.
Results for the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie scale $q^*$ are also given.
