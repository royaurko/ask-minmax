We investigate a simple model for globular cluster (GC) formation. We
simulate the violent relaxation of initially homogeneous isothermal stellar
spheres and show that it leads to the formation of clusters with radial density
profiles that match the observed profiles of GCs. The best match is achieved
for dynamically unevolved clusters. In this model, all the observed
correlations between global GC parameters are accurately reproduced if one
assumes that all the clusters initially had the same value of the stellar
density and the velocity dispersion. This suggests that the gas which formed
GCs had the same values of density and temperature throughout the universe.
