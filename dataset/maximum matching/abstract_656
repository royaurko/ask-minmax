The correspondence between Lie algebras, Lie groups, and algebraic groups, on
one side and commutative Hopf algebras on the other side are known for a long
time by works of Hochschild-Mostow and others. We extend this correspondence by
associating a noncommutative noncocommutative Hopf algebra to any matched pair
of Lie algebras, Lie groups, and affine algebraic groups. We canonically
associate a modular pair in involution to any of these Hopf algebras. More
precisely, to any locally finite representation of a matched pair object as
above we associate a SAYD module to the corresponding Hopf algebra. At the end,
we compute the Hopf cyclic cohomology of the associated Hopf algebra with
coefficients in the aforementioned SAYD module in terms of Lie algebra
cohomology of the Lie algebra associated to the matched pair object relative to
an appropriate Levi subalgebra with coefficients induced by the original
representation.
