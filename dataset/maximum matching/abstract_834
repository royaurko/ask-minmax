We have investigated the relation between magnetic ordered structure and
magnetic refrigeration efficiency in the Ising model on a simple cubic lattice
using Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetic entropy behaviors indicate that the
protocol, which was first proposed in [Appl. Phys. Lett. {\bf 104}, 052415
(2014).], can produce the maximum isothermal magnetic entropy change and the
maximum adiabatic temperature change in antiferromagnets. Furthermore, the
total amount of heat transfer under the proposed protocol reaches a maximum.
The relation between measurable physical quantities and magnetic refrigeration
efficiency is also discussed.
