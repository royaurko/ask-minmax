In one-dimensional optical setups, light-matter interaction is drastically
enhanced by the interference between the incident and scattered fields.
Particularly, in the impedance-matched \Lambda-type three-level systems, a
single photon deterministically induces the Raman transition and switches the
electronic state of the system. Here we show that such a \Lambda system can be
implemented by using dressed states of a driven superconducting qubit and a
resonator. The input microwave photons are perfectly absorbed and are
down-converted into other frequency modes in the same waveguide. The proposed
setup is applicable to single-photon detection in the microwave domain.
