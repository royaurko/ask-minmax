We demonstrate experimentally the frequency time entanglement of photon pairs
produced in a CW pumped quasi phased matched AlGaAs superlattice waveguide. A
visibility of 96.0+-0.7% without background subtraction has been achieved,
which corresponds the violation of Bell inequality by 52 standard deviations.
