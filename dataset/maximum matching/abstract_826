We consider a non-linear stochastic wave equation driven by space-time white
noise in dimension 1. First of all, we state some results about the
intermittency of the solution, which have only been carefully studied in some
particular cases so far. Then, we establish a comparison principle for the
solution, following the ideas of Mueller. We think it is of particular interest
to obtain such a result for a hyperbolic equation. Finally, using the results
mentioned above, we aim to show that the solution exhibits a chaotic behavior,
in a similar way as was established by Conus, Joseph, and Khoshnevisan for the
heat equation. We study the two cases where 1. the initial conditions have
compact support, where the global maximum of the solution remains bounded and
2. the initial conditions are bounded away from 0, where the global maximum is
almost surely infinite. Interesting estimates are also provided on the behavior
of the global maximum of the solution.
