This paper describes universal lossless coding strategies for compressing
sources on countably infinite alphabets. Classes of memoryless sources defined
by an envelope condition on the marginal distribution provide benchmarks for
coding techniques originating from the theory of universal coding over finite
alphabets. We prove general upper-bounds on minimax regret and lower-bounds on
minimax redundancy for such source classes. The general upper bounds emphasize
the role of the Normalized Maximum Likelihood codes with respect to minimax
regret in the infinite alphabet context. Lower bounds are derived by tailoring
sharp bounds on the redundancy of Krichevsky-Trofimov coders for sources over
finite alphabets. Up to logarithmic (resp. constant) factors the bounds are
matching for source classes defined by algebraically declining (resp.
exponentially vanishing) envelopes. Effective and (almost) adaptive coding
techniques are described for the collection of source classes defined by
algebraically vanishing envelopes. Those results extend ourknowledge concerning
universal coding to contexts where the key tools from parametric inference
