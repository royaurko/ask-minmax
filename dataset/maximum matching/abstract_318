We investigate the solutions of Einstein equations such that a hedgehog
solution is matched to different exterior or interior solutions via a spherical
shell. In the case where both the exterior and the interior regions are
hedgehog solutions or one of them is flat, the resulting spherical shell
becomes a stringy shell. We also consider more general matchings and see that
in this case the shell deviates from its stringy character.
