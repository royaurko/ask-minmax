We construct an exact relativistic cosmology in which an inhomogeneous but
isotropic local region has fractal number counts and matches to a homogeneous
background at a scale of the order of $10^2$ Mpc. We show that Einstein's
equations and the matching conditions imply either a nonlinear Hubble law or a
very low large-scale density.
