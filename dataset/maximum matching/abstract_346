In this paper we consider the matching coefficients up to two loops between
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) for the vector,
axial-vector, scalar and pseudo-scalar currents. The structure of the effective
theory is discussed and analytical results are presented. Particular emphasis
is put on the singlet diagrams.
