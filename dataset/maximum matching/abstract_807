Chinese text processing systems are using Double Byte Coding , while almost
all existing Sanskrit Based Indian Languages have been using Single Byte coding
for text processing. Through observation, Chinese Information Processing
Technique has already achieved great technical development both in east and
west. In contrast,Indian Languages are being processed by computer, more or
less, for word processing purpose. This paper mainly emphasizes the method of
processing Indian languages from a Computational Linguistic point of view. An
overall design method is illustrated in this paper.This method concentrated on
maximum resource utilization and compatibility: the ultimate goal is to have a
Multiplatform Multilingual System. Keywords Text Procrssing, Multilingual Text
