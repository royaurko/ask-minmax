Service-oriented computing (SOC) is an interdisciplinary paradigm that
revolutionizes the very fabric of distributed software development applications
that adopt service-oriented architectures (SOA) can evolve during their
lifespan and adapt to changing or unpredictable environments more easily. SOA
is built around the concept of Web Services. Although the Web services
constitute a revolution in Word Wide Web, they are always regarded as
non-autonomous entities and can be exploited only after their discovery. With
the help of software agents, Web services are becoming more efficient and more
dynamic. The topic of this paper is the development of an agent based approach
for Web services discovery and selection in witch, OWL-S is used to describe
Web services, QoS and service customer request. We develop an efficient
semantic service matching which takes into account concepts properties to match
concepts in Web service and service customer request descriptions. Our approach
is based on an architecture composed of four layers: Web service and Request
description layer, Functional match layer, QoS computing layer and Reputation
computing layer.
