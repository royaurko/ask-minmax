The goal of cross-domain object matching (CDOM) is to find correspondence
between two sets of objects in different domains in an unsupervised way. Photo
album summarization is a typical application of CDOM, where photos are
automatically aligned into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian
coordinate system. CDOM is usually formulated as finding a mapping from objects
in one domain (photos) to objects in the other domain (frame) so that the
pairwise dependency is maximized. A state-of-the-art CDOM method employs a
kernel-based dependency measure, but it has a drawback that the kernel
parameter needs to be determined manually. In this paper, we propose
alternative CDOM methods that can naturally address the model selection
problem. Through experiments on image matching, unpaired voice conversion, and
photo album summarization tasks, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is
demonstrated.
