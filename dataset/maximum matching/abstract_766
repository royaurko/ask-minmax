We address the problem of specific video event retrieval. Given a query video
of a specific event, eg. a concert of Madonna, the goal is to retrieve other
videos of the same event that temporally overlap with the query.
  Our approach encodes the frame descriptors of a video to jointly represent
their appearance and temporal order. It exploits the properties of circulant
matrices to efficiently compare the videos in the frequency domain. This offers
a significant gain in complexity and accurately localizes the matching parts of
videos. The descriptors can be compressed in the frequency domain with a
product quantizer adapted to complex numbers. In this case, video retrieval is
performed without decompressing the descriptors.
  The second problem we consider is the temporal alignment of a set of videos.
We exploit the matching confidence and an estimate of the temporal offset
computed for all pairs of videos by our retrieval approach. Our robust
algorithm aligns the videos on a global timeline by maximizing the set of
temporally consistent matches. The global temporal alignment enables
synchronous playback of the videos of a given scene.
