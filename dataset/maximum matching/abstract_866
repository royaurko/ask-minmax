We study the possibility of generalising the Einstein--Straus model to
anisotropic settings, by considering the matching of locally cylindrically
symmetric static regions to the set of $G_4$ on $S_3$ locally rotationally
symmetric (LRS) spacetimes. We show that such matchings preserving the symmetry
are only possible for a restricted subset of the LRS models in which there is
no evolution in one spacelike direction. These results are applied to spatially
homogeneous (Bianchi) exteriors where the static part represents a finite
bounded interior region without holes. We find that it is impossible to embed
finite static strings or other locally cylindrically symmetric static objects
(such as bottle or coin-shaped objects) in reasonable Bianchi cosmological
models, irrespective of the matter content. Furthermore, we find that if the
exterior spacetime is assumed to have a perfect fluid source satisfying the
dominant energy condition, then only a very particular family of LRS stiff
fluid solutions are compatible with this model.
  Finally, given the interior/exterior duality in the matching procedure, our
results have the interesting consequence that the Oppenheimer-Snyder model of
collapse cannot be generalised to such anisotropic cases.
