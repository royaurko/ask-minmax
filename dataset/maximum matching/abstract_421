We investigate whether the recovery chances of highly spinning waveforms by
matched filtering with randomly chosen spinning waveforms generated with the
LAL package are improved by a cross-correlation of the simulated output of the
L1 and H1 LIGO detectors. We find that a properly defined correlated overlap
improves the mass estimates and enhances the recovery of spin angles.
