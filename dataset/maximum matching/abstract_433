Following the scheme developed by Misner and Sharp, we discuss the dynamics
of gravitational collapse. For this purpose, an interior cylindrically
symmetric spacetime is matched to an exterior charged static cylindrically
symmetric spacetime using the Darmois matching conditions. Dynamical equations
are obtained with matter dissipating in the form of shear viscosity. The effect
of charge and dissipative quantities over the cylindrical collapse are studied.
Finally, we show that homogeneity in energy density and conformal flatness of
spacetime are necessary and sufficient for each other.
