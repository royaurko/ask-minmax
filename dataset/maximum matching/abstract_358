We investigate the problem of reconstructing sparse multivariate
trigonometric polynomials from few randomly taken samples by Basis Pursuit and
greedy algorithms such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Thresholding.
While recovery by Basis Pursuit has recently been studied by several contributors,
we provide theoretical results on the success probability of reconstruction via
Thresholding and OMP for both a continuous and a discrete probability model for
the sampling points. We present numerical experiments, which indicate that
usually Basis Pursuit is significantly slower than greedy algorithms, while the
recovery rates are very similar.
