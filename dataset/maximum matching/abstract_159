We report on the discovery with Chandra of a strong modulation (~90% pulsed
fraction) at ~6.4 h from the source CXOU J123030.3+413853 in the star-forming,
low-metallicity spiral galaxy NGC 4490, which is interacting with the irregular
companion NGC 4485. This modulation, confirmed also by XMM-Newton observations,
is interpreted as the orbital period of a binary system. The spectra from the
Chandra and XMM-Newton observations can be described by a power-law model with
photon index ~1.5. During these observations, which span from 2000 November to
2008 May, the source showed a long-term luminosity variability by a factor of
~5, between ~2E+38 and 1.1E+39 erg/s (for a distance of 8 Mpc). The maximum
X-ray luminosity, exceeding by far the Eddington limit of a neutron star,
indicates that the accretor is a black hole. Given the high X-ray luminosity,
the short orbital period and the morphology of the orbital light curve, we
favour an interpretation of CXOU J123030.3+413853 as a rare high-mass X-ray
binary system with a Wolf-Rayet star as a donor, similar to Cyg X-3. This would
be the fourth system of this kind known in the local Universe. CXOU
J123030.3+413853 can also be considered as a transitional object between high
mass X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), the study of which
may reveal how the properties of persistent black-hole binaries evolve entering
the ULX regime.
