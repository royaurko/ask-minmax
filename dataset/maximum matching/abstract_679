Given a collection $\{Z_1,Z_2,\ldots,Z_m\}$ of $n$-sided polygons in the
plane and a query polygon $W$ we give algorithms to find all $Z_\ell$ such that
$W=f(Z_\ell)$ with $f$ an unknown similarity transformation in time independent
of the size of the collection. If $f$ is a known affine transformation, we show
how to find all $Z_\ell$ such that $W=f(Z_\ell)$ in $O(n+\log(m))$ time.
  For a pair $W,W^\prime$ of polygons we can find all the pairs
$Z_\ell,Z_{\ell^\prime}$ such that $W=f(Z_\ell)$ and
$W^\prime=f(Z_{\ell^\prime})$ for an unknown affine transformation $f$ in
$O(m+n)$ time.
  For the case of triangles we also give bounds for the problem of matching
triangles with variable vertices, which is equivalent to affine matching
triangles in noisy conditions.
