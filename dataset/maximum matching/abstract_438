This paper demonstrates that if the restricted isometry constant
$\delta_{K+1}$ of the measurement matrix $A$ satisfies $$ \delta_{K+1} <
\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}+1}, $$ then a greedy algorithm called Orthogonal Matching
Pursuit (OMP) can recover every $K$--sparse signal $\mathbf{x}$ in $K$
iterations from $A\x$. By contrast, a matrix is also constructed with the
restricted isometry constant $$ \delta_{K+1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{K}} $$ such that
OMP can not recover some $K$-sparse signal $\mathbf{x}$ in $K$ iterations. This
result positively verifies the conjecture given by Dai and Milenkovic in 2009.
