In this paper we address a method to align English-Chinese bilingual news
reports from China News Service, combining both lexical and satistical
approaches. Because of the sentential structure differences between English and
Chinese, matching at the sentence level as in many other works may result in
frequent matching of several sentences en masse. In view of this, the current
work also attempts to create shorter alignment pairs by permitting finer
matching between clauses from both texts if possible. The current method is
based on statiscal correlation between sentence or clause length of both texts
and at the same time uses obvious anchors such as numbers and place names
appearing frequently in the news reports as lexcial cues.
