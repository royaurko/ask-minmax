We compute the number of perfect matchings of an $M\times N$ Aztec rectangle
where $|N-M|$ vertices have been removed along a line. A particular case solves
a problem posed by Propp. Our enumeration results follow from certain
identities for Schur functions, which are established by the combinatorics of
nonintersecting lattice paths.
