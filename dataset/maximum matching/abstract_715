The State of Washington sells patient-level health data for $50. This
publicly available dataset has virtually all hospitalizations occurring in the
State in a given year, including patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures,
attending physician, hospital, a summary of charges, and how the bill was paid.
It does not contain patient names or addresses (only ZIPs). Newspaper stories
printed in the State for the same year that contain the word "hospitalized"
often include a patient's name and residential information and explain why the
person was hospitalized, such as vehicle accident or assault. News information
uniquely and exactly matched medical records in the State database for 35 of
the 81 cases (or 43 percent) found in 2011, thereby putting names to patient
records. A news reporter verified matches by contacting patients. Employers,
financial organizations and others know the same kind of information as
reported in news stories making it just as easy for them to identify the
medical records of employees, debtors, and others.
