The Cauchy+characteristic matching (CCM) problem for the scalar wave equation
is investigated in the background geometry of a Schwarzschild black hole.
Previously reported work developed the CCM framework for the coupled
Einstein-Klein-Gordon system of equations, assuming a regular center of
symmetry. Here, the time evolution after the formation of a black hole is
pursued, using a CCM formulation of the governing equations perturbed around
the Schwarzschild background. An extension of the matching scheme allows for
arbitrary matching boundary motion across the coordinate grid. As a proof of
concept, the late time behavior of the dynamics of the scalar field is
explored. The power-law tails in both the time-like and null infinity limits
are verified.
