We reexamine stochastic Fermi acceleration (STFA) in the low energy
(Newtonian) regime in the context of solar flares. The particle energization
rate depends a dispersive term and a coherent gain term. The energy dependence
of pitch angle scattering is important for determining the electron energy
spectrum. For scattering by whistler wave turbulence, STFA produces a
quasi-thermal spectrum. A second well-constrained scattering mechanism is
needed for STFA to match the observed 10-100keV non-thermal spectrum. We
suggest that STFA most plausibly acts as phase one of a two phase particle
acceleration engine in impulsive flares: STFA can match the thermal spectrum
below 10kev, and possibly the power law spectrum between 10 and 100keV, given
the proper pitch angle scattering. However, a second phase, such as shock
acceleration at loop tops, is likely required to match the spectrum above the
observed knee at 100keV. Understanding this knee, if it survives further
observations, is tricky.
