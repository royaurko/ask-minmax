We present an implementation of the matched-filter technique to detect tidal
tails of globular clusters. The method was tested using SDSS data for the
globular cluster Palomar 5 revealing its well known tidal tails. We also ran a
simulation of a globular cluster with a tidal tail where we successfully
recover the tails for a cluster at the same position and with the same
characteristics of NGC 2298. Based on the simulation we estimate that the
matched-filter increases the contrast of the tail relative to the background of
stars by a factor of 2.5 for the case of NGC 2298. We also present the
photometry of the globular cluster NGC 2298 using the MOSAIC2 camera installed
on the CTIO 4m telescope. The photometry covers ~ 3deg2 reaching V ~ 23. A fit
of a King profile to the radial density profile of NGC 2298 shows that this
cluster has a tidal radius of 15.91' \pm 1.07' which is twice as in the
literature. The application of the matched-filter to NGC 2298 reveals several
extra-tidal structures, including a leading and trailing tail. We also find
that NGC 2298 has extra-tidal structures stretching towards and against the
Galactic disk, suggesting strong tidal interaction. Finally, we assess how the
matched-filter performs when applied to a globular cluster with and without
mass segregation taken into account. We find that disregarding the effects of
mass segregation may significantly reduce the detection limit of the
matched-filter.
