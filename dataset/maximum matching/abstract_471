We find the formula for the maximal cardinality of the family of $n$-tuples
from ${[n]\choose k}$ with does not have $\ell$--matching. This formula after
some analytical issues can be reduce to the Erd\"os's Matching formula. Also we
prove the conjecture about the cardinality of maximal $s$-wise $t$-intersecting
family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$. In the proofs we use original method
which we have already used in the proof of Mikl\'os-Manikam-Singhi conjecture
in \cite{1}. We call this method Symmetrical smoothing method
