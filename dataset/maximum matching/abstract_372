The confinement problem has been solved in the anisotropic (2+1)-dimensional
SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at weak coupling. In this paper, we find the low-lying
spectrum for N=2. The lightest excitations are pairs of fundamental particles
of the (1+1)-dimensional SU(2)XSU(2) principal chiral sigma model bound in a
linear potential, with a specified matching condition where the particles
overlap. This matching condition can be determined from the exactly-known
S-matrix for the sigma model.
