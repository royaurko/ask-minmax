Sampling rate is the bottleneck for spectrum sensing over multi-GHz
bandwidth. Recent progress in compressed sensing (CS) initialized several
sub-Nyquist rate approaches to overcome the problem. However, efforts to design
CS reconstruction algorithms for wideband spectrum sensing are very limited. It
is possible to further reduce the sampling rate requirement and improve
reconstruction performance via algorithms considering prior knowledge of
cognitive radio spectrum usages. In this paper, we group the usages of
cognitive radio spectrum into three categories and propose a modified
orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for wideband spectrum sensing.
Simulation results show that this modified OMP algorithm outperforms two
modified basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) algorithms in terms of reconstruction
performance and computation time.
