In this contribution the QCD next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) matching
coefficients to the branching ratio $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ in the Standard Model
(SM) and to $\bar{B}\to X_s \gamma$ in the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) are
discussed. In both cases a three-loop matching between the full and effective
theory was performed, which leads to a significant reduction of the scale
uncertainty.
