We investigate the recovery chances of highly spinning waveforms immersed in
LIGO S5-like noise by performing a matched filtering with 10^6 randomly chosen
spinning waveforms generated with the LAL package. While the masses of the
compact binary are reasonably well recovered (slightly overestimated), the same
does not hold true for the spins. We show the best fit matches both in the
time-domain and the frequency-domain. These encompass some of the spinning
characteristics of the signal, but far less than what would be required to
identify the astrophysical parameters of the system. An improvement of the
matching method is necessary, though may be difficult due to the noisy signal.
