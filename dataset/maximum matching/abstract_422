This paper presents a new analysis for the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
algorithm. It is shown that if the restricted isometry property (RIP) is
satisfied at sparsity level $O(\bar{k})$, then OMP can recover a
$\bar{k}$-sparse signal in 2-norm. For compressed sensing applications, this
result implies that in order to uniformly recover a $\bar{k}$-sparse signal in
$\Real^d$, only $O(\bar{k} \ln d)$ random projections are needed. This analysis
improves earlier results on OMP that depend on stronger conditions such as
mutual incoherence that can only be satisfied with $\Omega(\bar{k}^2 \ln d)$
random projections.
