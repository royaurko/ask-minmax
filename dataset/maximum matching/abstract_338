We report on recent advances on the computation of the matrix elements of the
electroweak penguins Q_7 and Q_8 which are relevant for the Delta I=3/2
contribution to epsilon'_K in the chiral limit. The matching of scale and
scheme dependences between Wilson coefficients and these matrix elements is
done analytically at NLO in alpha_S.
