We reduce the best known approximation ratio for finding a weighted matching
of a graph using a one-pass semi-streaming algorithm from 5.828 to 5.585. The
semi-streaming model forbids random access to the input and restricts the
memory to O(n*polylog(n)) bits. It was introduced by Muthukrishnan in 2003 and
is appropriate when dealing with massive graphs.
