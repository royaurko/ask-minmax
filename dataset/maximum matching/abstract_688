We provide a detailed correspondence between G_4 gauge fluxes in F-theory
compactifications with SU(n) and SU(n)x(1) gauge symmetry and their Type IIB
orientifold limit. Based on the resolution of the relevant F-theory Tate models
we classify the factorisable G_4-fluxes and match them with the set of
universal D5-tadpole free U(1)-fluxes in Type IIB. Where available, the global
version of the universal spectral cover flux corresponds to Type IIB gauge flux
associated with a massive diagonal U(1). In U(1)-restricted Tate models extra
massless abelian fluxes exist which are associated with specific linear
combinations of Type IIB fluxes. Key to a quantitative match between F-theory
and Type IIB is a proper treatment of the conifold singularity encountered in
the Sen limit of generic F-theory models. We also shed further light on the
brane recombination process relating generic and U(1)-restricted Tate models.
