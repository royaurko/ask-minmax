Motivated by the prospects of increased measurement bandwidth, improved
signal to noise ratio and access to the full complex magnetic susceptibility we
develop a technique to extract microwave voltages from our high resistance (10
k{\Omega}) (Ga,Mn)As microbars. We drive magnetization precession with
microwave frequency current, using a mechanism that relies on the spin orbit
interaction. A capacitively coupled lambda/2 microstrip resonator is employed
as an impedance matching network, enabling us to measure the microwave voltage
generated during magnetisation precession.
