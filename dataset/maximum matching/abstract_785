In this paper we investigate the solubility of a hard - sphere gas in a
solvent modeled as an associating lattice gas (ALG). The solution phase diagram
for solute at 5% is compared with the phase diagram of the original solute free
model. Model properties are investigated thr ough Monte Carlo simulations and a
cluster approximation. The model solubility is computed via simulations and
shown to exhibit a minimum as a function of temperature. The line of minimum
solubility (TmS) coincides with the line of maximum density (TMD) for different
solvent chemical potentials.
