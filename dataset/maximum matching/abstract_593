We test the asymptotic scaling behavior of state-of-the-art simulations of
QCD with two flavors of light Wilson fermions. This is done by matching $\pi$
and $\rho$ masses on lattices of size $16^3\times32$ and $8^3\times16$. We find
that at $\beta=6/g^2=5.3$ matching is not possible over a range extending down
to $\beta=3.5$. The large lattice data at $\beta=5.5$ matches the small lattice
values at $\beta=4.9(1)$ leading to a shift $\Delta\beta=0.6(1)$, considerably
larger than the perturbative prediction of $0.45$. In both cases we conclude
that the simulations are very far from the asymptotic scaling region.
