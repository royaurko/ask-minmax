We consider the quark--anti-quark potential on the three sphere or the
generalized cusp anomalous dimension in planar N=4 SYM. We concentrate on the
vacuum potential in the near BPS limit with $L$ units of R-charge.
Equivalently, we study the anomalous dimension of a super-Wilson loop with L
local fields inserted at a cusp. The system is described by a recently proposed
infinite set of non-linear integral equations of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
(TBA) type. That system of TBA equations is very similar to the one of the
spectral problem but simplifies a bit in the near BPS limit. Using techniques
based on the Y-system of functional equations we first reduced the infinite
system of TBA equations to a Finite set of Nonlinear Integral Equations
(FiNLIE). Then we solve the FiNLIE system analytically, obtaining a simple
analytic result for the potential! Surprisingly, we find that the system has
equivalent descriptions in terms of an effective Baxter equation and in terms
of a matrix model. At L=0, our result matches the one obtained before using
localization techniques. At all other L's, the result is new. Having a new
parameter, L, allows us to take the large L classical limit. We use the matrix
model description to solve the classical limit and match the result with a
string theory computation. Moreover, we find that the classical string
algebraic curve matches the algebraic curve arising from the matrix model.
