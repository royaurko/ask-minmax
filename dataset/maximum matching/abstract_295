Given the dimensions(including thickness) of an axisymmetric galaxy, Newton's
law is used in integral form to find the density distributions required to
match a wide range of orbital speed profiles. Newton's law is not modified and
no dark-matter halos are required. The speed distributions can have extreme
shapes if they are reasonably smooth. Several examples are given.
