We simulated and experimentally investigated the sputter yield of ZnO and
GaAs nanowires, which were implanted with energetic Mn ions at room
temperature. The resulting thinning of the nanowires and the dopant
concentration with increasing Mn ion fluency were measured by accurate scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and nano-X-Ray Fluorescence (nanoXRF) quantification,
respectively. We observed a clear enhanced sputter yield for the irradiated
nanowires compared to bulk, which is also corroborated by iradina simulations.
These show a maximum if the ion range matches the nanowire diameter. As a
consequence of the erosion thinning of the nanowire, the incorporation of the
Mn dopants is also enhanced and increases non-linearly with increasing ion
fluency.
