We have investigated the microwave response of nanotube Josephson junctions
at 600-900 MHz at microwave powers corresponding to currents from 0 to $2\times
I_{\mathrm C}$ in the junction. Compared with theoretical modeling, the
response of the junctions correspond well to the lumped element model of
resistively and capacitively shunted junction. We demonstrate the operation of
these superconducting FETs as charge detectors at high frequencies without any
matching circuits. Gate-voltage-induced charge $Q_{\rm G}$ modifies the
critical current $I_{\rm C}$, which changes the effective impedance of the
junction under microwave irradiation. This change, dependent on the transfer
characteristics $dI_{\mathrm C}/dQ_{\rm G}$, modifies the reflected signal and
it can be used for wide band electrometry. We measure a sensitivity of
$3.1\times10^{-5}$ $e/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ from a sample which has a maximum
switching current of 2.6 nA.
