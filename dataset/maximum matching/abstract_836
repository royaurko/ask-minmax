We use Indian temperature data of more than 100 years to study the influence
of solar activity on climate. We study the Sun-climate relationship by
averaging solar and climate data at various time scales; decadal, solar
activity and solar magnetic cycles. We also consider the minimum and maximum
values of sunspot number (SSN) during each solar cycle. This parameter SSN is
correlated better with Indian temperature when these data are averaged over
solar magnetic polarity epochs (SSN maximum to maximum). Our results indicate
that the solar variability may still be contributing to ongoing climate change
and suggest for more investigations.
