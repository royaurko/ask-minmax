In this paper we invoke a nonanticipative information Rate Distortion
Function (RDF) for sources with memory, and we analyze its importance in
probabilistic matching of the source to the channel so that transmission of a
symbol-by-symbol code with memory without anticipation is optimal, with respect
to an average distortion and excess distortion probability. We show
achievability of the symbol-by-symbol code with memory without anticipation,
and we evaluate the probabilistic performance of the code for a Markov source.
