We present a method to match the multi-parton states generated by the High
Energy Jets Monte Carlo with parton showers generated by the Ariadne program
using the colour dipole model. The High Energy Jets program already includes a
full resummation of soft divergences. Hence, in the matching it is important
that the corresponding divergences in the parton shower are subtracted, keeping
only the collinear parts. We present a novel, shower-independent method for
achieving this, enabling us to generate fully exclusive and hadronized events
with multiple hard jets, in hadronic collisions. We discuss in detail the
arising description of the soft, collinear and hard regions by examples in pure
QCD jet-production.
