We present a laboratory study of silicate glasses of astrophysically relevant
compositions including olivines, pyroxenes and melilites. With emphasis on the
classic Si-O stretching feature near 10 microns, we compare infrared spectra of
our new samples with laboratory spectra on ostensibly similar compositions, and
also with synthetic silicate spectral data commonly used in dust modeling.
Several different factors affect spectral features including sample chemistry
(e.g., polymerization, Mg/Fe ratio, oxidation state and Al-content) and
different sample preparation techniques lead to variations in porosity, density
and water content. The convolution of chemical and physical effects makes it
difficult to attribute changes in spectral parameters to any given variable. It
is important that detailed chemical and structural characterization be provided
along with laboratory spectra. In addition to composition and density, we
measured the glass transition temperatures for the samples which place upper
limits on the formation/processing temperatures of these solids in space.
Popular synthetically-generated optical functions do not have spectral features
that match any of our glass samples. However, the ~10 microns feature generated
by the synthetic data rarely exactly matches the shape and peak position of
astronomically observed silicate features. Our comparison with the synthetic
spectra allows astronomers to determine likely candidates amongst our glass
samples for matching astronomical observations.
