We quantize the space of 2-charge fuzzballs in IIB supergravity on $K3$. The
resulting entropy precisely matches the D1-D5 black hole entropy, including a
specific numerical coefficient. A partial match (ie., a smaller coefficient)
was found by Rychkov a decade ago using the Lunin-Mathur subclass of solutions
- we use a simple observation to generalize his approach to the full moduli
space of $K3$ fuzzballs, filling a small gap in the literature.
