The Skyrme model is a low energy, effective field theory for QCD which when
coupled to a gravitational field provides an ideal semi-classical model to
describe neutron stars. We use the Skyrme crystal solution composed of a
lattice of $\alpha$-like particles as a building block to construct minimum
energy neutron star configurations, allowing the crystal to be strained
anisotropically. We find that below 1.49 solar masses the stars' crystal
deforms isotropically and that above this critical mass, it undergoes
anisotropic strain. We then find that the maximum mass allowed for a neutron
star is 1.90 solar masses, in close agreement with a recent observation of the
most massive neutron star yet found. The radii of the computed solutions also
match the experimentally estimated values of approximately 10km.
