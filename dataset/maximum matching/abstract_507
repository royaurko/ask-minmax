We have investigated the periodic pinning of magnetic flux quanta in thin Nb
films with rectangular arrays of magnetic dots. In this type of pinning
geometry, a change in the periodicity and shape of the minima in the
magnetoresistance occurs for magnetic fields exceeding a certain threshold
value. This has been explained recently in terms of a reconfiguration
transition of the vortex lattice due to an increasing vortex-vortex interaction
with increasing magnetic field. In this picture the dominating elastic energy
at high fields forces the vortex lattice to form a square symmetry rather than
being commensurate to the rectangular geometry of the pinning array. In this
paper we present a comparative study of rectangular arrays with Ni-dots,
Co-dots and holes. In the magnetic dot arrays, we found a strong fractional
matching effect up to the second order matching field. In contrast, no clear
fractional matching is seen after the reconfiguration. Additionally, we
discovered the existence of hysteresis in the magnetoresistance in the
crossover between the low and the high field regime. We found evidence that
this effect is correlated to the reconfiguration phenomenon rather than to the
magnetic state of the dots. The temperature and angular dependences of the
effect have been measured and possible models are discussed to explain this
behavior.
