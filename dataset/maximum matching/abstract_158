SPECT (Single-photon Emission Computerized Tomography) and PET (Positron
Emission Tomography) are essential medical imaging tools, for which the
sampling angle number, scan time should be chosen carefully to compromise
between image quality and the radiopharmaceutical dose. In this study, the
image quality of different acquisition protocol was evaluated via varied angle
number and count number per angle with Monte Carlo simulation data. It was
shown that when similar imaging counts were used, the factor of acquisition
counts was more important than that of the sampling number in ECT (Emission
Computerized Tomography). To further reduce the activity requirement and the
scan duration, an iterative image reconstruction algorithm for limited-view and
low-dose tomography based on compressed sensing theory has been developed. The
total variation regulation was added in the reconstruction process to improve
SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) and reduce the artifacts caused by the limited
angle sampling. Maximization of maximum likelihood of the estimated image and
the measured data and minimization of the total variation of the image are
alternative implemented. By using this advanced algorithm, the reconstruction
process is able to achieve image quality matching or exceeding that of normal
scan with only half of the injection radiopharmaceutical dose.
