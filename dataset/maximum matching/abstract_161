We present a photometric model of the rings of Saturn which includes the main
rings and an F ring, inclined to the main rings, with a Gaussian vertical
profile of optical depth. This model reproduces the asymmetry in brightness
between the east and west ansae of the rings of Saturn that was observed by the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) within a few hours after the Earth ring-plane
crossing (RPX) of 10 August 1995. The model shows that during this observation
the inclined F ring unevenly blocked the east and west ansae of the main rings.
The brightness asymmetry produced by the model is highly sensitive to the
vertical thickness and radial optical depth of the F ring. The F ring model
that best matches the observations has a vertical full width at half maximum of
13 +/- 7 km and an equivalent depth of 10 +/- 4 km. The model also reproduces
the shape of the HST profiles of ring brightness vs. distance from Saturn, both
before and after the time of ring-plane crossing. Smaller asymmetries observed
before the RPX, when the Earth was on the dark side of the rings, cannot be
explained by blocking of the main rings by the F ring or vice versa and are
probably instead due to the intrinsic longitudinal variation exhibited by the F
ring.
