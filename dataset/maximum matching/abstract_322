The influence of the observed relict vacuum energy on the fluctuations of
CMBR going through cosmological matter condensations is studied in the
framework of the Einstein-Strauss-de Sitter vakuola model. It is shown that
refraction of light at the matching surface of the vakuola and the expanding
Friedman universe can be very important during accelerated expansion of the
universe, when the velocity of the matching surface relative to static
Schwarzchildian observers becomes relativistic. Relevance of the refraction
effect for the temperature fluctuations of CMBR is given in terms of the
redshift and the angular extension of the fluctuating region.
