We utilize a new VLA Galactic plane catalog at 1.4 GHz covering the first and
second Galactic quadrants (340 deg <l< 120 deg, |b|<0.8 deg with |b|< 1.8 deg
for 350 deg <l< 40 deg and |b|<2.5 deg for 100 deg <l<105 deg) in conjunction
with the MSX6C Galactic plane mid-infrared catalog to supplement and better
understand our 5 GHz catalog (Giveon et al. 2005). A radio catalog of this
region was first published by Zoonematkermani et al. (1990), but we have
re-reduced the data with significantly improved calibration and mosaicing
procedures, resulting in more than a tripling of the number of 1.4 GHz sources
detected. Comparison of the new 1.4 GHz catalog and the MSX6C catalog resulted
in a sample of 556 matches, out of which we estimate only 11 to be chance
coincidences. Most of the matches show red MSX colors. The scale height of
their Galactic latitude distribution is 24'-28' (FWHM) or ~60-70 pc (for a
distance of 8.5 kpc), depending on longitude. The latitude distribution
flattens out significantly above l~40 deg and the number of matches drops off
sharply.
