We estimate the mass density fluctuations power spectrum (PS) on large scales
by applying a maximum likelihood technique to the peculiarvelocity data of the
recently completed redshift-distance survey of early-type galaxies (ENEAR). The
general results are in agreement with the high amplitude power spectra found
from similar analysis of other independent all-sky catalogs of peculiar
velocity data such as MARK III and SFI. For Lambda & Open CDM COBE normalized
PS models, the best-fit parameters are confined by a contour approximately
defined by Omega h^{1.3}=0.377+-0.08 and Omega h^{0.88}=0.517+-0.083,
respectively. Gamma-shape models, free of COBE normalization, resultsin the
weak constraint of $\Gamma \geq 0.17$ and in the rather stringent constraint of
sigma_8 Omega^{0.6}=1.0+-0.25. All quoted uncertainties refer to 3-sigma
confidence-level. The calculated PS is used as a prior for Wiener
reconstruction of the density field at different resolutions and the
three-dimensional velocity field within a volume of radius ~80 Mpc/h. All major
structures in the nearby universe are recovered and are well matched to those
predicted from all-sky redshift surveys.
