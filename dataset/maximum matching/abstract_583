This article addresses the problem of two- and higher dimensional pattern
matching, i.e. the identification of instances of a template within a larger
signal space, which is a form of registration. Unlike traditional correlation,
we aim at obtaining more selective matchings by considering more strict
comparisons of gray-level intensity. In order to achieve fast matching, a
nonlinear thresholded version of the fast Fourier transform is applied to a
gray-level decomposition of the original 2D image. The potential of the method
is substantiated with respect to real data involving the selective
identification of neuronal cell bodies in gray-level images.
