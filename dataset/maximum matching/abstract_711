In soccer, scoring goals is a fundamental objective which depends on many
conditions and constraints. Considering the RoboCup soccer 2D-simulator, this
paper presents a data mining-based decision system to identify the best time
and direction to kick the ball towards the goal to maximize the overall chances
of scoring during a simulated soccer match. Following the CRISP-DM methodology,
data for modeling were extracted from matches of major international
tournaments (10691 kicks), knowledge about soccer was embedded via
transformation of variables and a Multilayer Perceptron was used to estimate
the scoring chance. Experimental performance assessment to compare this
approach against previous LDA-based approach was conducted from 100 matches.
Several statistical metrics were used to analyze the performance of the system
and the results showed an increase of 7.7% in the number of kicks, producing an
overall increase of 78% in the number of goals scored.
