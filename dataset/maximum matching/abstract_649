In this work we deal with the problem of simultaneous multifrequency
detection of extragalactic point sources in maps of the Cosmic Microwave
Background. We apply a linear filtering technique that uses spatial information
and the cross-power spectrum. To make this, we simulate realistic and
non-realistic flat patches of the sky at two frequencies of Planck: 44 and 100
GHz. We filter to detect and estimate the point sources and compare this
technique with the monofrequency matched filter in terms of completeness,
reliability, flux and spectral index accuracy. The multifrequency method
outperforms the matched filter at the two frequencies and in all the studied
cases in the work.
