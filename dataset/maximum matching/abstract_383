We present a detailed account of the two-photon states generated by SPDC in
both type I and type II phase matching, including the effects of anisotropy of
the nonlinear medium and the frequency spread of the down-converted fields.
Accurate as well as simplified expressions are derived for type I and type II
phase matching in the context of Fourier Optics. The main results are compared
with experimental data available in the literature, showing good agreement in
all cases.
