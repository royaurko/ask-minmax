We study the influence of the different choice of unit cells on the Bloch
solutions of Schr\c{c}dinger equation for one-dimensional periodic Kronig-
Penney models with rectangular potential barriers or potential wells and
partially constant effectiv mass. We obtain generalized Kronig-Penney relations
for bulk states and exact expressions for the corresponding periodic parts of
the Bloch wave functions for the two possible choices of the matching
conditions in an unit cell. We show also that our analitic expressions reduce
to the well known expressions for the Kronig-Penney relations and Bloch waves
under constant effective mass and appropriate matching conditions.
