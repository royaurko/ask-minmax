We show that every locally finite bipartite Borel graph satisfying a
strengthening of Hall's condition has a Borel perfect matching on some comeager
invariant Borel set. We apply this to show that if a group acting by Borel
automorphisms on a Polish space has a paradoxical decomposition, then it admits
a paradoxical decomposition using pieces having the Baire property. We also
obtain a Baire category solution to the dynamical von Neumann-Day problem: if
$a$ is a nonamenable action of a group on a Polish space $X$ by Borel
automorphisms, then there is a free Baire measurable action of $\mathbb{F}_2$
on $X$ which is Lipschitz with respect to $a$.
