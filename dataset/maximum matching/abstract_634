We perform a matching of the two loop-chiral perturbation theory
representation of the scalar Kpi form factor to a dispersive one. Knowing the
value of F_K/F_pi and f_+(0) in the Standard Model (SM) allows to determine two
O(p^6) LECs, the slope of the scalar form factor and the deviation of the
Callan-Treiman theorem. Going beyond the SM and assuming the knowledge of the
slope of the scalar form factor from experiment, the matching allows us to
determine the ratio of F_K/F_pi, f_+(0), a certain combination of non-standard
couplings, the deviation of the Callan-Treiman theorem and the two O(p^6) LECs.
