Medvedev & Narayan have described a hot accretion flow onto a spinning
neutron star in which the gas viscously brakes the spin of the star. Their
self-similar solution has the surprising property that the density, temperature
and angular velocity of the gas at any radius are completely independent of the
outer boundary conditions. Hence, the solution cannot be matched to a general
external medium. We resolve this paradoxical situation by showing that there is
a second self-similar solution which bridges the gap between the original
solution and the external medium. This new solution has an extra degree of
freedom which permits it to match general outer boundary conditions. We confirm
the main features of the analytical results with a full numerical solution.
