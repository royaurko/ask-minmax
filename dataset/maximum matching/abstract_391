We demonstrate how gauge singlets can be used to find new examples of Kutasov
duality (i.e. where the matching of the dual theories relies on a non-zero
superpotential) in N}=1 SU(N) SQCD with F_Q flavours of quark and multiple
generations of adjoints, or antisymmetrics, or symmetrics. The role of the
singlets is to simplify greatly the truncation of the chiral ring whilst
maintaining an R-symmetry, and at the same time allowing an unambiguous
identification of the elementary mesons of the magnetic theory. The dual
theories satisfy all the usual tests, including the highly non-trivial 't Hooft
anomaly matching conditions.
