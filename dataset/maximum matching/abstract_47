We have grown thin films of (100) oriented
La_{0.67}(Ca_{x}Sr_{1-x})_{0.33}MnO_{3} on (100) NdGaO_{3} substrates by
off-axis sputtering. We have looked at the changes in the resistivity and
magnetoresistance of the samples as the Ca/Sr ratio was varied. We find that as
the calcium fraction is decreased, the lattice match to the substrate
decreases, and the films become more disordered, as observed in transport
measurements and the variation in Curie and peak resistance temperatures. We
find a correlation between the temperature independent and T^2 terms to the low
temperature resistivity. The room temperature magnetoresistance exhibits a
maximum as the peak temperature is increased by the substitution of Sr for Ca,
and a change in the field dependence to the resistivity at room temperature is
observed.
