We present a study of effects of QCD radiation in the production of heavy
colored states, employing inclusive multi-jet samples obtained by matching
matrix elements and parton showers. We discuss several examples showing that
matched samples are in general not only more accurate than a parton shower
alone, but also often indispensable to make reliable predictions of beyond the
Standard Model signals.
