We give an introduction to the special problems encountered in a treatment of
HQET beyond perturbation theory in the gauge coupling constant.
  In particular, we report on a recent test of HQET as an effective theory for
QCD and discuss how HQET can be implemented on the lattice including the
non-perturbative matching of the effective theory to QCD.
