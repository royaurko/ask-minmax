Quantifying individual performance in the game of Cricket is critical for
team selection in International matches. The number runs scored by batsmen and
wickets taken by bowlers serves as a natural way of quantifying the performance
of a cricketer. Traditionally the batsmen and bowlers are rated on their
batting or bowling average respectively. However in a game like Cricket it is
always important the manner in which one scores the runs or claims a wicket.
Scoring runs against a strong bowling line-up or delivering a brilliant
performance against a team with strong batting line-up deserves more credit. A
player's average is not able to capture this aspect of the game. In this paper
we present a refined method to quantify the `quality' of runs scored by a
batsman or wickets taken by a bowler. We explore the application of Social
Network Analysis (SNA) to rate the players in a team performance. We generate
directed and weighted network of batsmen-bowlers using the player-vs-player
information available for Test cricket and ODI cricket. Additionally we
generate network of batsmen and bowlers based on the dismissal record of
batsmen in the history of cricket - Test (1877-2011) and ODI (1971-2011). Our
results show that {\it M Muralitharan} is the most successful bowler in history
of Cricket. Our approach could potentially be applied in domestic matches to
judge a player's performance which in turn pave the way for a balanced team
selection for International matches.
