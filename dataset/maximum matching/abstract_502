In order to establish face recognition system in rehabilitation nursing
robots beds and achieve real-time monitor the patient on the bed. We propose a
face recognition method based on partial matching Hu moments which apply for
rehabilitation nursing robots beds. Firstly we using Haar classifier to detect
human faces automatically in dynamic video frames. Secondly we using Otsu
threshold method to extract facial features (eyebrows, eyes, mouth) in the face
image and its Hu moments. Finally, we using Hu moment feature set to achieve
the automatic face recognition. Experimental results show that this method can
efficiently identify face in a dynamic video and it has high practical value
(the accuracy rate is 91% and the average recognition time is 4.3s).
