We describe the N=1 supersymmetric evolution of the parton distributions with
coupled gluinos and scalar quarks (Exact Supersymmetric Altarelli Parisi or
ESAP). Superymmetric distributions are generated radiatively and studied as a
function of both a matching scale (the match is to an intermediate AP
evolution), parameterized by a scalar quark mass, and a final evolution scale.
The analysis involves also a comparison with the regular AP evolution.
Predictions for all the distributions are presented.
