Let each point of a homogeneous Poisson process in R^d independently be
equipped with a random number of stubs (half-edges) according to a given
probability distribution mu on the positive integers. We consider
translation-invariant schemes for perfectly matching the stubs to obtain a
simple graph with degree distribution mu. Leaving aside degenerate cases, we
prove that for any mu there exist schemes that give only finite components as
well as schemes that give infinite components. For a particular matching scheme
that is a natural extension of Gale-Shapley stable marriage, we give sufficient
conditions on mu for the absence and presence of infinite components.
