Recent literature in the last Maximum Entropy workshop introduced an analogy
between cumulative probability distributions and normalized utility functions.
Based on this analogy, a utility density function can de defined as the
derivative of a normalized utility function. A utility density function is
non-negative and integrates to unity. These two properties form the basis of a
correspondence between utility and probability. A natural application of this
analogy is a maximum entropy principle to assign maximum entropy utility
values. Maximum entropy utility interprets many of the common utility functions
based on the preference information needed for their assignment, and helps
assign utility values based on partial preference information. This paper
reviews maximum entropy utility and introduces further results that stem from
the duality between probability and utility.
