The filamentation instability driven by two spatially uniform and
counter-streaming beams of charged particles in plasmas is modelled by a
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. Each beam consists of the electrons and
positrons. The four species are equally dense and they have the same
temperature. The one-dimensional simulation direction is orthogonal to the beam
velocity vector. The magnetic field grows spontaneously and rearranges the
particles in space, such that the distributions of the electrons of one beam
and the positrons of the second beam match. The simulation demonstrates that as
a result no electrostatic field is generated by the magnetic field through its
magnetic pressure gradient prior to its saturation. This electrostatic field
would be repulsive at the centres of the filaments and limit the maximum charge
and current density. The filaments of electrons and positrons in this
simulation reach higher charge and current densities than in one with no
positrons. The oscillations of the magnetic field strength induced by the
magnetically trapped particles result in an oscillatory magnetic pressure
gradient force. The latter interplays with the statistical fluctuations in the
particle density and it probably enforces a charge separation, by which
electrostatic waves grow after the filamentation instability has saturated.
