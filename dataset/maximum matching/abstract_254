Gravitational radiation from a slightly distorted black hole with ringdown
waveform is well understood in general relativity. It provides a probe for
direct observation of black holes and determination of their physical
parameters, masses and angular momenta (Kerr parameters). For ringdown searches
using data of gravitational wave detectors, matched filtering technique is
useful. In this paper, we describe studies on problems in matched filtering
analysis in realistic gravitational wave searches using observational data.
Above all, we focus on template constructions, matches or signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs), detection probabilities for Galactic events, and accuracies in
evaluation of waveform parameters or black hole hairs. We have performed
matched filtering analysis for artificial ringdown signals which are generated
with Monte-Carlo technique and injected into the TAMA300 observational data. It
is shown that with TAMA300 sensitivity, the detection probability for Galactic
ringdown events is about 50% for black holes of masses greater than $20
M_{\odot}$ with SNR $> 10$. The accuracies in waveform parameter estimations
are found to be consistent with the template spacings, and resolutions for
black hole masses and the Kerr parameters are evaluated as a few % and $\sim 40
%$, respectively. They can be improved up to $< 0.9 %$ and $< 24 %$ for events
of ${\rm SNR} \ge 10$ by using fine-meshed template bank in the hierarchical
search strategy.
