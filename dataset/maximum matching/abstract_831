In the context of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, we apply the maximum
entropy production principle (MEPP) by enforcing a local conservation of
energy. This leads to an equation for the vorticity distribution that conserves
all the Casimirs, the energy, and that increases monotonically the mixing
entropy ($H$-theorem). Furthermore, the equation for the coarse-grained
vorticity dissipates monotonically all the generalized enstrophies. These
equations may provide a parametrization of 2D turbulence. They do not generally
relax towards the maximum entropy state. The vorticity current vanishes for any
steady state of the 2D Euler equation. Interestingly, the equation for the
coarse-grained vorticity obtained from the MEPP turns out to coincide, after
some algebraic manipulations, with the one obtained with the anticipated
vorticity method. This shows a connection between these two approaches when the
conservation of energy is treated locally. Furthermore, the newly derived
equation, which incorporates a diffusion term and a drift term, has a nice
physical interpretation in terms of a selective decay principle. This gives a
new light to both the MEPP and the anticipated vorticity method.
