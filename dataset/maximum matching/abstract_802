To search for phase lags in the optical-infrared light curves of asymptotic
giant branch stars, we have compared infrared data from the COBE DIRBE
satellite with optical light curves from the AAVSO and other sources. We found
17 examples of phase lags in the time of maximum in the infrared vs. that in
the optical, and 4 stars with no observed lags. There is a clear difference
between the Mira variables and the semi-regulars in the sample, with the
maximum in the optical preceding that in the near-infrared in the Miras, while
in most of the semi-regulars no lags are observed. Comparison to published
theoretical models indicates that the phase lags in the Miras are due to strong
titanium oxide absorption in the visual at stellar maximum, and suggests that
Miras pulsate in the fundamental mode, while at least some semi-regulars are
first overtone pulsators. There is a clear optical-near-infrared phase lag in
the carbon-rich Mira V CrB; this is likely due to C2 and CN absorption
variations in the optical.
