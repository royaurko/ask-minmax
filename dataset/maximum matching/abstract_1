For all practical purposes, the Micali-Vazirani general graph maximum
matching algorithm is still the most efficient known algorithm for the problem.
The purpose of this paper is to provide a complete proof of correctness of the
algorithm in the simplest possible terms; graph-theoretic machinery developed
for this purpose also helps simplify the algorithm.
