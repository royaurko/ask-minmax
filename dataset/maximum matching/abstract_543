We discuss radio sources in the Chandra Galactic Bulge survey region. By
cross-matching the X-ray sources in this field with the NVSS archival data, we
find 12 candidate matches. We present a classification scheme for radio/X-ray
matches in surveys taken in or near the Galactic Plane, taking into account
other multi-wavelength data. We show that none of the matches found here is
likely to be due to coronal activity from normal stars because the radio to
X-ray flux ratios are systematically too high. We show that one of the sources
could be a radio pulsar, and that one could be a planetary nebula, but that the
bulk of the sources are likely to be background active galactic nuclei (AGN),
with many confirmed through a variety of approaches. Several of the AGN are
bright enough in the near infrared (and presumably in the optical) to use as
probes of the interstellar medium in the inner Galaxy.
