This article studies a fully implicit finite volume scheme for transient
nonlinear heat transport equations coupled by nonlocal interface conditions
modeling diffuse-gray radiation between the surfaces of (both open and closed)
cavities. The model is considered in three space dimensions; modifications for
the axisymmetric case are indicated. Extending previous results, where a
similar, but not fully implicit, finite volume scheme was considered, a
discrete maximum principle is established, yielding discrete
$L^\infty$-$L^\infty$ a priori bounds as well as a unique discrete solution to
the finite volume scheme.
