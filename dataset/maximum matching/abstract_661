We compare a NLO W gamma matrix element generator with the leading order
calculation in Pythia . A matching scheme between a next-to-leading order W
gamma matrix element generator by Baur et. al. and the Pythia parton shower is
presented. The NLO package produces W gamma+0 jet and W gamma+1jet final states
in the hard scattering and the objective is to consistently match these to the
initial state radiation from Pythia parton shower. The proposed methodology
preserves both the rate of the hard scattering process as well as various
kinematic distributions of experimental interest.
