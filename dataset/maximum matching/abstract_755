The likelihood ratio (LR) is largely used to evaluate the relative weight of
available forensic data regarding two hypotheses. Both frequentist and Bayesian
interpretations of probability have advantages and drawbacks. The important
thing is to conduct the process in a rigorous and coherent way. The Bayesian
`recipe' to obtain the LR presented in literature consists in plugging-in
Bayesian estimates of the parameters into a frequentist-defined LR. This paper
provides the derivation of a careful Bayesian approach, which allows to obtain
the directly LR for the `rare type match problem', that is when a match between
the perpetrator's and the suspect's DNA profile, never observed before in the
database of reference is to be evaluated. The two most popular Bayesian models
(the beta-binomial and the Dirichlet-multinomial models) are proposed, and
compared to the corresponding plug-in versions.
