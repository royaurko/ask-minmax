Straightforward combination of tree search with matching pursuits, which was
suggested in 2001 by Cotter and Rao, and then later developed by some other
contributors, has been revisited recently as multipath matching pursuit (MMP). In
this comment, we would like to point out some major issues regarding this
publication. First, the idea behind MMP is not novel, and the related
literature has not been properly referenced. MMP has not been compared to
closely related algorithms such as A* orthogonal matching pursuit (A*OMP). The
theoretical analyses do ignore the pruning strategies applied by the contributors in
practice. All these issues have the potential to mislead the reader and lead to
misinterpretation of the results. With this short paper, we intend to clarify
the relation of MMP to existing literature in the area and compare its
performance with A*OMP.
