An analytical calculation of the interaction geometry of two interlinked
second-order nonlinear processes fulfilling phase-matching conditions is
presented. The method is developed for type-I uniaxial crystals and gives the
positions on a screen beyond the crystal of the entangled triplets generated by
the interactions. The analytical results are compared to experiments realized
in the macroscopic regime. Preliminary tests to identify the triplets are also
performed based on intensity correlations.
