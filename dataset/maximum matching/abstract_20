We investigate improving the hadronic jet energy resolution using
mass-constrained fits of pi0 decays using high granularity electromagnetic
calorimeters. Single pi0 studies have indicated a large potential for
improvement in the energy resolution of pi0's, typically reducing the average
energy resolution by a factor of two for 4 GeV pi0's. We apply this method to
fully simulated multi-hadronic events with multiple pi0's with widely varying
energies using the ILD00 detector model. Several methods for identifying the
correct pairings of photons with parent pi0's were explored. The combinatorics
become challenging as the number of pi0's increases and we employ the Blossom V
implementation of Edmonds' matching algorithm for handling this. For events
where both photons of the pi0 are detected, the resulting solutions lead to an
improvement in the pi0 component of the event energy resolution for 91.2 GeV Z0
events from 18.0%/sqrt(E) to 13.9%/sqrt(E) using the ILD00 detector and its
reconstruction algorithms. This can be compared to a maximum potential
improvement to 12.2%/sqrt(E) if all photon pairs are matched correctly using
the current photon reconstruction.
