We present an MC@NLO-like matching of next-to-leading order QCD calculations
with the Nagy-Soper parton shower. An implementation of the algorithm within
the HELAC-DIPOLES Monte Carlo generator is used to address the uncertainties
and ambiguities of the matching scheme. First results obtained using the
Nagy-Soper parton shower implementation in DEDUCTOR in conjunction with the
HELAC-NLO framework are given for the pp -> top anti-top j + X process at the
LHC with sqrt(s)=8 TeV. Effects of resummation are discussed for various
observables.
