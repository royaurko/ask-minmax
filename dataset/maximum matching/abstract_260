The performance of an artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback device for
improving ankle joint position sense was assessed in 12 young healthy adults
using an active matching task. The underlying principle of this system consists
of supplying individuals with supplementary information about the position of
the matching ankle relative to the reference ankle position through a
tongue-placed tactile output device generating electrotactile stimulation on a
36-point (6 X 6) matrix held against the surface of the tongue dorsum.
Precisely, (1) no electrodes were activated when both ankles were in a similar
angular position within a predetermined "angular dead zone" (ADZ); (2) 12
electrodes (2 X 6) of the anterior and posterior zones of the matrix were
activated (corresponding to the stimulation of the front and rear portion of
the tongue) when the matching ankle was in a too plantarflexed and dorsiflexed
position relative to the reference ankle, respectively. Two ADZ values of 0.5
degrees and 1.5 degrees were evaluated. Results showed (1) more accurate and
more consistent matching performances with than without biofeedback and (2)
more accurate and more consistent ankle joint matching performances when using
the biofeedback device with the smaller ADZ value
