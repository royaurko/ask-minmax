We outline the construction of an updated version of the New Luyten
Two-Tenths (NLTT) catalog of high proper motion stars, which will contain
improved astrometry and photometry for the vast majority of the ~59,000 stars
in NLTT. The bright end is constructed by matching NLTT stars to Hipparcos,
Tycho-2, and Starnet; the faint end by matching to USNO-A and 2MASS. In this
first paper, we detail the bright-end matching procedure. We show that for the
majority of stars in his catalog, Luyten measured positions accurate to 1" even
though he recorded his results much more coarsely. However, there is a long
tail of position errors, with one error as large as 11 deg. Proper-motion
errors for the stars with small position errors are 24 mas/yr (1 sigma) but
deteriorate to 34 mas/yr for stars with inferior positions. NLTT is virtually
100% complete for V<11.5 and |b|>15 deg, but completeness in this magnitude
range falls to about 75% at the Galactic plane. Incompleteness near the plane
is not uniform, but is rather concentrated in the interval -80<l<20, where the
Milky Way is brightest.
