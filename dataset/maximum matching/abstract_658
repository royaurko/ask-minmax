An advanced mask-less nanofabrication technique, focused electron
beam-induced deposition (FEBID), has been employed on epitaxial Nb thin films
for their ferromagnetic decoration by an array of Co stripes. These
substantially modify the non-patterned films' superconducting properties,
providing a washboard-like pinning potential landscape for the vortex motion.
At small magnetic fields B<0.1T, vortex lattice matching effects have been
investigated by magneto-transport measurements. Peculiarities in the field
dependencies of the films resistivity R(B) have been observed in particular for
the vortex motion perpendicular to the Co stripes. The deduced field values
correspond to the vortex lattice parameter matching the pinning structure's
period, whereas no fields matching the stripe width have been observed, as it
was reported previously [D. Jaque et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 81, 2851 (2002)]
for Nb films grown on periodically distributed submicrometric lines of Ni.
