This paper investigates the detection of information hidden by the Least
Significant Bit (LSB) matching scheme. In a theoretical context of known image
media parameters, two important results are presented. First, the use of
hypothesis testing theory allows us to design the Most Powerful (MP) test.
Second, a study of the MP test gives us the opportunity to analytically
calculate its statistical performance in order to warrant a given probability
of false-alarm. In practice when detecting LSB matching, the unknown image
parameters have to be estimated. Based on the local estimator used in the
Weighted Stego-image (WS) detector, a practical test is presented. A numerical
comparison with state-of-the-art detectors shows the good performance of the
proposed tests and highlights the relevance of the proposed methodology.
