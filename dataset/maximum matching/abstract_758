Evolutionary social dilemma games are extended by an additional
matching-pennies game that modifies the collected payoffs. In a spatial version
players are distributed on a square lattice and interact with their neighbors.
Firstly, we show that the matching-pennies game can be considered as the
microscopic force of the Red Queen effect that breaks the detailed balance and
induces eddies in the microscopic probability currents if the strategy update
is analogous to the Glauber dynamics for the kinetic Ising models. The
resulting loops in probability current breaks symmetry between the
chessboard-like arrangements of strategies via a bottleneck effect occurring
along the four-edge loops in the microscopic states. The impact of this
congestion is analogous to the application of a staggered magnetic field in the
Ising model, that is, the order-disorder critical transition is wiped out by
noise. It is illustrated that the congestion induced symmetry breaking can be
beneficial for the whole community within a certain region of parameters.
