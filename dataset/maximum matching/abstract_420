A non self-similar change of coordinates provides improved matching
asymptotics of the solutions of the fast diffusion equation for large times,
compared to already known results, in the range for which Barenblatt solutions
have a finite second moment. The method is based on relative entropy estimates
and a time-dependent change of variables which is determined by second moments,
and not by the scaling corresponding to the self-similar Barenblatt solutions,
as it is usually done.
