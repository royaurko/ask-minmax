We propose a new antenna selection scheme for a massive MIMO system with a
single user terminal and a base station with a large number of antennas. We
consider a practical scenario where there is a realistic correlation among the
antennas and imperfect channel estimation at the receiver side. The proposed
scheme exploits the sparsity of the channel matrix for the effective selection
of a limited number of antennas. To this end, we compute a sparse channel
matrix by minimising the mean squared error. This optimisation problem is then
solved by the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Widely used
models for spatial correlation among the antennas and channel estimation errors
are considered in this work. Simulation results demonstrate that when the
impacts of spatial correlation and imperfect channel estimation introduced, the
proposed scheme in the paper can significantly reduce complexity of the
receiver, without degrading the system performance compared to the maximum
ratio combining.
