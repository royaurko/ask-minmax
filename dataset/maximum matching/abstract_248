The use of reverse time chaos allows the realization of hardware chaotic
systems that can operate at speeds equivalent to existing state of the art
while requiring significantly less complex circuitry. Matched filter decoding
is possible for the reverse time system since it exhibits a closed form
solution formed partially by a linear basis pulse. Coefficients have been
calculated and are used to realize the matched filter digitally as a finite
impulse response filter. Numerical simulations confirm that this correctly
implements a matched filter that can be used for detection of the chaotic
signal. In addition, the direct form of the filter has been implemented in
hardware description language and demonstrates performance in agreement with
numerical results.
