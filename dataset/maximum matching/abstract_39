We present optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of the Type
Ia SN 2003cg, which exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3169. The observations
cover a period between -8.5 and +414 days post-maximum. SN 2003cg is a normal
but highly-reddened Type Ia event. Its B magnitude at maximum B_max =
15.94+/-0.04 and Delta m_15(B)_obs = 1.12+/-0.04 (Delta m_15(B)_intrinsic =
1.25+/-0.05). Allowing R_v to become a free parameter within the Cardelli et
al. (1989) extinction law, simultaneous matches to a range of colour curves of
normal SNe Ia yielded E(B-V) = 1.33+/-0.11, and R_v = 1.80+/-0.19. While the
value obtained for R_v is small, such values have been invoked in the past, and
may imply a grain size which is small compared with the average value for the
local ISM.
