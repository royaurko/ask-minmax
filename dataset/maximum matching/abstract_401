We show that every cubic bridgeless graph G has at least 2^(|V(G)|/3656)
perfect matchings. This confirms an old conjecture of Lovasz and Plummer.
  This version of the paper uses a different definition of a burl from the
journal version of the paper and a different proof of Lemma 18 is given. This
simplifies the exposition of our arguments throughout the whole paper.
