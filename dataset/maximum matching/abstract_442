The contributor has already proven that the space \Delta(\Pi_n)/G is homotopy
equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension n-3 for all natural numbers n>=3
and all subgroups G<S_1 X S_{n-1}. We wish to construct an acyclic matching on
\Delta(\Pi_n)/G that allows us to give a basis of its cohomology. This is also
a more elementary approach to determining the number of spheres. Furthermore we
give a description of the group action by an action on the spheres. We also
obtain another result that we call Equivariant Patchwork Theorem.
