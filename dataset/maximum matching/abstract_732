Earlier work has produced formulas for predicting stability of rifle bullets
of near uniform density and also for plastic-tipped rifle bullets. These
formulas have been shown to be accurate within 5%. However, the original Miller
stability formula for metal bullets of near uniform density underestimates the
stability of match style open tipped rifle bullets having a significant empty
volume in the tip. This paper presents a new formula for accurately estimating
the stability of these open tipped match style rifle bullets from parameters
easily obtained such as the bullet mass, length, and depth of the empty space
in the tip. The formula is tested by observations of whether bullets tumble and
by measuring the aerodynamic drag vs. predicted stability of several bullets
over a range of stabilities. In addition to confirmation in several test cases
with original firing data, the new stability formula is validated by comparison
with BRL spark range stability data for the 168 grain Sierra International in
.308 to an accuracy of 2% for supersonic velocities (> M1.2).
