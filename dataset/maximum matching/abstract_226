The quantity 1/lambda_B, the inverse moment of the B-meson light-cone wave
function, plays an important role in exclusive B-decays. I calculate the
matching coefficient of lambda_B defined in QCD onto lambda_B defined in HQET.
This is useful for comparing results that have been obtained in QCD to results
obtained in HQET.
