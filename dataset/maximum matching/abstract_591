We employ data taken by the JADE and OPAL experiments for an integrated QCD
study in hadronic e+e- annihilations at c.m.s. energies ranging from 35 GeV
through 189 GeV. The study is based on jet-multiplicity related observables.
The observables are obtained to high jet resolution scales with the JADE,
Durham, Cambridge and cone jet finders, and compared with the predictions of
various QCD and Monte Carlo models. The strong coupling strength, alpha_s, is
determined at each energy by fits of O(alpha_s^2) calculations, as well as
matched O(alpha_s^2) and NLLA predictions, to the data. Matching schemes are
compared, and the dependence of the results on the choice of the
renormalization scale is investigated. The combination of the results using
matched predictions gives alpha_s(MZ)=0.1187+{0.0034}-{0.0019}. The strong
coupling is also obtained, at lower precision, from O(alpha_s^2) fits of the
c.m.s. energy evolution of some of the observables. A qualitative comparison is
made between the data and a recent MLLA prediction for mean jet multiplicities.
