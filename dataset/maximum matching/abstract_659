A connected graph $G$ with at least $2m+2n+2$ vertices is said to have
property $E(m,n)$ if, for any two disjoint matchings $M$ and $N$ of size $m$
and $n$ respectively, $G$ has a perfect matching $F$ such that $M\subseteq F$
and $N\cap F=\varnothing$. In particular, a graph with $E(m,0)$ is
$m$-extendable. Let $\mu(\Sigma)$ be the smallest integer $k$ such that no
graphs embedded on a surface $\Sigma$ are $k$-extendable. Aldred and Plummer
have proved that no graphs embedded on the surfaces $\Sigma$ such as the
sphere, the projective plane, the torus, and the Klein bottle are
  $E(\mu(\Sigma)-1,1)$. In this paper, we show that this result always holds
for any surface. Furthermore, we obtain that if a graph $G$ embedded on a
surface has sufficiently many vertices, then $G$ has no property $E(k-1,1)$ for
each integer $k\geq 4$, which implies that $G$ is not $k$-extendable. In the
case of $k=4$, we get immediately a main result that Aldred et al. recently
obtained.
