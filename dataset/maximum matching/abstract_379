A microwave lens with highly reduced reflectance, as compared to conventional
dielectric lenses, is proposed. The lens is based on two-dimensional or
three-dimensional transmission-line networks that can be designed to have an
effective refractive index larger than one, while having almost perfect
impedance matching with free space. The design principles are presented and an
example lens is studied using commercial simulation software.
