Let $K$ be a set of $k$ positive integers. A biclique cover of type $K$ of a
graph $G$ is a collection of complete bipartite subgraphs of $G$ such that for
every edge $e$ of $G$, the number of bicliques need to cover $e$ is a member of
$K$. If $K=\{1,2,..., k\}$ then the maximum number of the vertices of a
complete graph that admits a biclique cover of type $K$ with $d$ bicliques,
$n(k,d)$, is the maximum possible cardinality of a $k$-neighborly family of
standard boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  In this paper, we obtain an upper bound for $n(k,d)$. Also, we show that the
upper bound can be improved in some special cases. Moreover, we show that the
existence of the biclique cover of type $K$ of the complete bipartite graph
with a perfect matching removed is equivalent to the existence of a cross
$K$-intersection family.
