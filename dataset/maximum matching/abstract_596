We apply heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) to separate long- and
short-distance effects of heavy quarks in lattice gauge theory. In this paper
we focus on flavor-changing currents that mediate transitions from one heavy
flavor to another. We stress differences in the formalism for heavy-light
currents, which are discussed in a companion paper, showing how HQET provides a
systematic matching procedure. We obtain one-loop results for the matching
factors of lattice currents, needed for heavy-quark phenomenology, such as the
calculation of zero-recoil form factors for the semileptonic decays $B\to
D^{(*)}l\nu$. Results for the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie scale $q^*$ are also
given.
