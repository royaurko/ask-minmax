A conjecture by Aharoni and Berger states that every family of $n$ matchings
of size $n+1$ in a bipartite multigraph contains a rainbow matching of size
$n$. In this paper we prove that matching sizes of $(3/2 + o(1)) n$ suffice to
guarantee such a rainbow matching, which is asymptotically the same bound as
the best known one in case we only aim to find a rainbow matching of size
$n-1$. This improves previous results by Aharoni, Charbit and Howard, and
Kotlar and Ziv.
