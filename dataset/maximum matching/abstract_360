We investigate the modulational instability of plane waves in quadratic
nonlinear materials with linear and nonlinear quasi-phase-matching gratings.
Exact Floquet calculations, confirmed by numerical simulations, show that the
periodicity can drastically alter the gain spectrum but never completely
removes the instability. The low-frequency part of the gain spectrum is
accurately predicted by an averaged theory and disappears for certain gratings.
The high-frequency part is related to the inherent gain of the homogeneous
non-phase-matched material and is a consistent spectral feature.
