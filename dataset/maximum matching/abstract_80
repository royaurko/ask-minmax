Let f_{k}(n) be the maximum number of time steps taken to reach equilibrium
by a system of n agents obeying the k-dimensional Hegselmann-Krause bounded
confidence dynamics. Previously, it was known that \Omega(n) = f_{1}(n) =
O(n^3). Here we show that f_{1}(n) = \Omega(n^2), which matches the best-known
lower bound in all dimensions k >= 2.
