We present preliminary results of matching factors of the four-fermion
operators relevant to $B_K$, which are obtained using the non-perturbative
renormalization (NPR) method in the RI-MOM scheme with HYP-smeared improved
staggered fermions. We use the MILC asqtad coarse ($a \cong 0.12\,$fm)
ensembles with $20^3 \times 64$ geometry and $am_{\ell}/am_s = 0.01/0.05$. We
compare NPR results with those of one-loop perturbative matching.
