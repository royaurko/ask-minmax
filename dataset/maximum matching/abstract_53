The one- and two-step mechanisms of the $pd\to ^3H_\Lambda K^+$ reaction in
the range of incident proton kinetic energy 1.13-3.0 GeV have been
investigated. A remarkable peculiarity of the two-step mechanism which
incorporates subprocesses $pp\to d\pi ^+$ and $\pi^+n\to K^+\Lambda $ is the so
called velocity matching providing the presence of all intermediate particles
nearly to the on-mass-shell. The differential cross section has been calculated
using a realistic model for the hypertritium $^3H_\Lambda $ wave function. The
maximum value of the cross section is estimated as $\sim $1nb/sr. The
contribution of the one-step mechanism with the elementary process $pN\to
NK\Lambda $ into the cross section has been found to be two - three orders of
magnitude smaller in comparison with the two-step mechanism.
