The dispersive properties of non-degenerate optical parametric amplification
in quasi-phase-matched (QPM) nonlinear quadratic crystals with an arbitrary
grating profile are theoretically investigated in the no-pump-depletion limit.
The spectral group delay curve of the amplifier is shown to be univocally
determined by its spectral power gain curve through a Hilbert transform. Such a
constraint has important implications on the propagation of spectrally-narrow
optical pulses through the amplifier. In particular, it is shown that anomalous
transit times, corresponding to superluminal or even negative group velocities,
are possible near local minima of the spectral gain curve. A possible
experimental observation of such effects using a QPM Lithium-Niobate crystal is
suggested.
