Sign truncated matching pursuit (STrMP) algorithm is presented in this paper.
STrMP is a new greedy algorithm for the recovery of sparse signals from the
sign measurement, which combines the principle of consistent reconstruction
with orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The main part of STrMP is as concise as
OMP and hence STrMP is simple to implement. In contrast to previous greedy
algorithms for one-bit compressed sensing, STrMP only need to solve a convex
and unconstraint subproblem at each iteration. Numerical experiments show that
STrMP is fast and accurate for one-bit compressed sensing compared with other
algorithms.
