With today's public data sets containing billions of data items, more and
more companies are looking to integrate external data with their traditional
enterprise data to improve business intelligence analysis. These distributed
data sources however exhibit heterogeneous data formats and terminologies and
may contain noisy data. In this paper, we present a novel framework that
enables business users to semi-automatically perform data integration on
potentially noisy tabular data. This framework offers an extension to Google
Refine with novel schema matching algorithms leveraging Freebase rich types.
First experiments show that using Linked Data to map cell values with instances
and column headers with types improves significantly the quality of the
matching results and therefore should lead to more informed decisions.
