The thermodynamic properties: specific heat, entropy, spin susceptibility
$\chi_s$ and charge susceptibility $\chi_c$ are studied as a function of
temperature and doping within the two-dimensional Hubbard model with various
$U/t=4 - 12$. Quantities are calculated using the finite-temperature Lanczos
method with additional phase-averaging for a system of $4\times 4$ sites.
Results show that the entropy at low $T$ reaches a maximum near half-filling at
the electron density $n \sim 1\pm 0.15$ in the whole regime of studied $U/t$.
The pseudogap in $\chi_s(T)$ becomes clearly pronounced for $U/t \geq 8$ while
$\chi_c$ shows a maximum close to half-filling. The relation of results to
those within the t-J model and to experiments is discussed.
