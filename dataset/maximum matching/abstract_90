We consider a static self-gravitating charged perfect fluid system in the
Einstein-Maxwell theory. Assume Maxwell's equation and the Einstein constraint
equation are satisfied, and the temperature of the fluid obeys Tolman's law.
Then we prove that the total entropy of the fluid achieves an extremum implies
other components of Einstein's equation for any variations of metric and
electrical potential with fixed boundary values. Conversely, if Einstein's
equation and Maxwell's equations hold, the total entropy achieves an extremum.
Our work suggests that the maximum entropy principle is consistent with
Einstein's equation when electric field is taken into account.
