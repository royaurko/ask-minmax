In this publication, uncertainties in and differences between the MC@NLO and
POWHEG methods for matching next-to-leading order QCD calculations with parton
showers are discussed. Implementations of both algorithms within the event
generator Sherpa and based on Catani-Seymour subtraction are employed to assess
the impact on a representative selection of observables. In the case of MC@NLO
a substantial simplification is achieved by using dipole subtraction terms to
generate the first emission. A phase space restriction is employed, which
allows to vary in a transparent way the amount of non-singular radiative
corrections that are exponentiated. Effects on various observables are
investigated, using the production of a Higgs boson in gluon fusion, with or
without an associated jet, as a benchmark process. The case of H+jet production
is presented for the first time in an NLO+PS matched simulation. Uncertainties
due to scale choices and non-perturbative effects are explored in the
production of W and Z bosons in association with a jet. Corresponding results
are compared to data from the Tevatron and LHC experiments.
