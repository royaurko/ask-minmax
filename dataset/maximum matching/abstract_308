The vortex dynamics in superconducting films deposited on top of a five-fold
Penrose array of magnetic dots is studied by means of transport measurements.
We show that in the low pinning regime (demagnetized dots) a few periodic and
aperiodic matching features coexist. In the strong pinning regime (magnetized
dots) a richer structure of unforeseen periodic and aperiodic vortex patterns
appear giving rise to a clear enhancement of the critical current in a broader
field range. Possible stable vortex configurations are determined by molecular
dynamics simulations.
