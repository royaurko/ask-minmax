We report on a method for matching the next-to-leading order calculation of
QCD jet production in e+e- annihilation with a Monte Carlo parton shower event
generator (MC) to produce realistic final states. The final result is accurate
to next-to-leading order (NLO) for infrared-safe one-scale quantities, such as
the Durham 3-jet fraction y_3, and agrees well with parton shower results for
multi-scale quantities, such as the jet mass distribution in 3-jet events. For
our numerical results, the NLO calculation is matched to the event generator
Pythia, though the method is more general. We compare one scale and multi-scale
quantities from pure NLO, pure MC, and matched NLO-MC calculations.
