We consider drawings of graphs in the plane in which edges are represented by
polygonal paths with at most one bend and the number of different slopes used
by all segments of these paths is small. We prove that
$\lceil\frac{\Delta}{2}\rceil$ edge slopes suffice for outerplanar drawings of
outerplanar graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\geq 3$. This matches the obvious
lower bound. We also show that $\lceil\frac{\Delta}{2}\rceil+1$ edge slopes
suffice for drawings of general graphs, improving on the previous bound of
$\Delta+1$. Furthermore, we improve previous upper bounds on the number of
slopes needed for planar drawings of planar and bipartite planar graphs.
