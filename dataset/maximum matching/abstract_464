We use an S-wave toy model for the two-nucleon system to show that the
implicit renormalization of a contact theory matches the explicit
renormalization through a flow equation which integrates out the high momentum
components. By fitting the low-momentum interaction with a new contact theory,
we show that the running of the contact strengths in both original and fitted
contact theories match over a wide cutoff range.
