In this write-up, I summarize the recent development of the hidden local
symmetry (HLS) theory as an effective field theory of QCD. I first explain how
the systematic chiral perturbation in the HLS is justified in the large Nc
limit of QCD, and summarize the basic concept of the Wilsonian matching,
through which some of the bare parameters of the HLS are determined by matching
the HLS to the operator product expansion in QCD. Then, I briefly review how to
formulate the vector manifestation in hot matter.
