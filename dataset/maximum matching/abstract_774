We compute the total cross-section for Higgs boson production in bottom-quark
fusion using the so-called FONLL method for the matching of a scheme in which
the $b$-quark is treated as a massless parton to that in which it is treated as
a massive final-state particle. We discuss the general framework for the
application of the FONLL method to this process, and then we present explicit
expressions for the case in which the next-to-next-to-leading-log five-flavor
scheme result is combined with the leading-order $\cal O(\alpha_s^2)$
four-flavor scheme computation. We compare our results in this case to the
four-and five-flavor scheme computations, and to the so-called Santander
matching.
