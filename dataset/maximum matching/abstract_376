We present results of a perturbative matching calculation performed at
one-loop for heavy-light currents. We use the Fermilab action for the heavy
quarks, the Asqtad action for the light quarks, and an improved gluon action.
We also present results for heavy-heavy currents with Fermilab heavy quarks and
improved glue.
