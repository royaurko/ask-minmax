We consider the problem of dictionary matching in a stream. Given a set of
strings, known as a dictionary, and a stream of characters arriving one at a
time, the task is to report each time some string in our dictionary occurs in
the stream. We present a randomised algorithm which takes O(log log(k + m))
time per arriving character and uses O(k log m) words of space, where k is the
number of strings in the dictionary and m is the length of the longest string
in the dictionary.
