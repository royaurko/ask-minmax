We provide a new determination of the charm quark mass using the Highly
Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action, finding m_c(3 GeV) = 0.983(23) GeV. Our
determination makes extensive use of second order lattice perturbation theory
in matching the bare lattice mass to the MSbar scheme. This matching utilises
both traditional diagrammatic perturbation theory and weak coupling
simulations. The second of these techniques allows us to extract perturbative
coefficients from Monte-Carlo simulations and the process of doing this is laid
out in some detail here.
