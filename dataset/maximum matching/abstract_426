We present a complete acyclic matching of the Hasse diagram associated with
the face lattice of a hypersimplex. Since a hypersimplex is a convex polytope,
there is a natural way to form a CW complex from its faces. We will then
utilize this matching along with discrete Morse theory and some topological
techniques to classify every subcomplex whose reduced homology groups are
concentrated in a single degree. These reduced homology groups support a
natural action of the symmetric group and a description of the characters that
this action produces is given.
