Recently exact agreement has been found between three-point correlators of
chiral operators computed in string theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 with NS-NS flux
and those computed in the symmetric orbifold CFT. However, it has also been
shown that these correlators disagree with those computed in supergravity,
under any identification of single particle operators which respects the
symmetries. In this note we resolve this disagreement: the key point is that
mixings with multi-particle operators are not suppressed even at large N in
extremal correlators. Allowing for such mixings, orbifold/string theory
operators and supergravity operators can be matched such that both non-extremal
and extremal three point functions agree, giving further evidence for the
non-renormalization of the chiral ring.
