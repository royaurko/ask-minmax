We present a new method for matching the two twin-processes gb->H+/-t and
gg->H+/-tb in Monte Carlo event generators. The matching is done by defining a
double-counting term, which is used to generate events that are subtracted from
the sum of these two twin-processes. In this way we get a smooth transition
between the collinear region of phase space, which is best described by
gb->H+/-t, and the hard region, which requires the use of the gg->H+/-tb
process. The resulting differential distributions show large differences
compared to both the gb-> H+/-t and gg->H+/-tb processes illustrating the
necessity to use matching when tagging the accompanying b-jet.
