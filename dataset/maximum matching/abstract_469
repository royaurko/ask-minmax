We evaluate the three-loop corrections to the matching coefficient of the
vector current between Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and non-relativistic QCD.
The result is presented in the MSbar scheme where large perturbative
corrections are observed. The implications on the threshold production of top
quark pairs are briefly discussed.
