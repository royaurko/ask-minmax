We present a Curry-style second-order type system with union and intersection
types for the lambda-calculus with constructors of Arbiser, Miquel and Rios, an
extension of lambda-calculus with a pattern matching mechanism for variadic
constructors. We then prove the strong normalisation and the absence of match
failure for a restriction of this system, by adapting the standard reducibility
method.
