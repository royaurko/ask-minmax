We report on our simulations with Neuberger valence fermions on CLS $N_f=2$
configurations with non-perturbatively $O(a)$-improved Wilson sea quarks. We
consider the matching of QCD to ChPT in the so called mixed-regime in which the
sea quarks are in the $p$-regime while the valence quarks are in the
$\epsilon$-regime. From this matching, we can get information on $\Sigma$,
$L_6$ and the combination $L_8+2L_6+2L_7$.
