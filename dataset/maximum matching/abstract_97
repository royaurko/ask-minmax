We present an approach enabling generation of narrow spin wave beams in thin
homogeneous ferromagnetic films. The main idea is to match the wave vector of
the spin wave with that corresponding to the spectral maximum of the exciting
microwave magnetic field only locally, in the region of space from which the
beam should be launched. We show that this can be achieved with the aid of a
properly designed coplanar waveguide transducer generating a nonuniform
microwave magnetic field. The resulting two-dimensional spin wave beams
obtained in micromagnetic simulations propagate over distances of several
micrometers. The proposed approach requires neither inhomogeneity of the
ferromagnetic film nor nonuniformity of the biasing magnetic field, and it can
be generalized to yield multiple spin wave beams of different width at the same
frequency. Other possible excitation scenarios and applications of spin wave
beam magnonics are also discussed.
