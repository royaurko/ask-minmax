A pattern matching based tracking algorithm, named MdcPatRec, is used for the
reconstruction of charged tracks in the drift chamber of the BESIII detector.
This paper addresses the shortage of segment finding in MdcPatRec algorithm. An
extended segment construction scheme and the corresponding pattern dictionary
are presented. Evaluation with Monte-Carlo and experimental data show that the
new method can achieve higher efficiency for low transverse momentum tracks.
