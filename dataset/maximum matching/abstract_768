We present a novel Visual Odometry algorithm entitled Circular FREAK-ORB
(CFORB). This algorithm detects features using the well-known ORB algorithm
[12] and computes feature descriptors using the FREAK algorithm [14]. CFORB is
invariant to both rotation and scale changes, and is suitable for use in
environments with uneven terrain. Two visual geometric constraints have been
utilized in order to remove invalid feature descriptor matches. These
constraints have not previously been utilized in a Visual Odometry algorithm. A
variation to circular matching [16] has also been implemented. This allows
features to be matched between images without having to be dependent upon the
epipolar constraint. This algorithm has been run on the KITTI benchmark dataset
and achieves a competitive average translational error of $3.73 \%$ and average
rotational error of $0.0107 deg/m$. CFORB has also been run in an indoor
environment and achieved an average translational error of $3.70 \%$. After
running CFORB in a highly textured environment with an approximately uniform
feature spread across the images, the algorithm achieves an average
translational error of $2.4 \%$ and an average rotational error of $0.009
deg/m$.
