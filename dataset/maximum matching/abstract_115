We present Keck spectropolarimetry of the unusual type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
2005hk several days before maximum light. An analysis of the high
signal-to-noise-ratio total-flux spectrum shows the object's extreme similarity
to the peculiar SN 2002cx. SN 2005hk has an optical spectrum dominated by Fe
III lines and only weak lines of intermediate-mass elements, unlike a normal SN
Ia at this epoch. The photospheric velocity measured from the minima of strong
absorption lines is very low for an SN Ia (~6000 km s^{-1}), solidifying the
connection to SN 2002cx. The spectrum-synthesis code Synow was used to identify
the presence of iron-peak elements, intermediate-mass elements, and possibly
unburned carbon at similar velocities in the outer ejecta of SN 2005hk. Many
weak spectral features remain unidentified. The spectropolarimetry shows a low
level of continuum polarization (~0.4%) after correction for the interstellar
component and only a weak Fe III line feature is detected. The level of
continuum polarization is normal for an SN Ia, implying that the unusual
features of SN 2005hk cannot be readily explained by large asymmetries.
