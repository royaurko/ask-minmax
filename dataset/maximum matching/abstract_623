On-line monitoring of beam quality for high brightness beams is only possible
using non-invasive instruments. For matching measurements, very few such
instruments are available. One candidate is a quadrupole pick-up. Therefore, a
new type of quadrupole pick-up has been developed for the 26 GeV Proton
Synchrotron (PS) at CERN, and a measurement system consisting of two such
pick-ups is now installed in this accelerator. Using the information from these
pick-ups, it is possible to determine both injection matching and emittance in
the horizontal and vertical planes, for each bunch separately. This paper
presents the measurement method and some of the results from the first year of
use, as well as comparisons with other measurement methods.
