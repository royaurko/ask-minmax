Using the asymptotic conformal invariance of perturbative QCD we derive the
expression of the coupling of external states to all conformal spin-p
components of the forward elastic amplitude. Using the wave-function formalism
for structure functions at small x, we derive the perturbative coupling of the
virtual photon for p= 1, which is maximal for linear transverse polarization.
The non-perturbative coupling to the proton is discussed in terms of
``azimuthal matching'' between the proton color dipoles and the quark-
antiquark configurations of the photon. As an application, the recent
conjecture of a second QCD Pomeron related to the conformal spin-1 component is
shown to rely upon a strong azimuthal matching of the p= 1 component in gamma*
-proton scattering.
