Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) is
an excellent method to stabilize mechanical systems in the Hamiltonian
formalism. In this paper, several improvements are made on the IDA-PBC method.
The skew-symmetric interconnection submatrix in the conventional form of
IDA-PBC is shown to have some redundancy for systems with the number of degrees
of freedom greater than two, containing unnecessary components that do not
contribute to the dynamics. To completely remove this redundancy, the use of
quadratic gyroscopic forces is proposed in place of the skew-symmetric
interconnection submatrix. Reduction of the number of matching partial
differential equations in IDA-PBC and simplification of the structure of the
matching partial differential equations are achieved by eliminating the
gyroscopic force from the matching partial differential equations. In addition,
easily verifiable criteria are provided for Lyapunov/exponential
stabilizability by IDA-PBC for all linear controlled Hamiltonian systems with
arbitrary degrees of underactuation and for all nonlinear controlled
Hamiltonian systems with one degree of underactuation. A general design
procedure for IDA-PBC is given and illustrated with examples. The duality of
the new IDA-PBC method to the method of controlled Lagrangians is discussed.
This paper renders the IDA-PBC method as powerful as the controlled Lagrangian
method.
