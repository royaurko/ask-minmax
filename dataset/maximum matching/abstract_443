Mappings between related ontologies are increasingly used to support data
integration and analysis tasks. Changes in the ontologies also require the
adaptation of ontology mappings. So far the evolution of ontology mappings has
received little attention albeit ontologies change continuously especially in
the life sciences. We therefore analyze how mappings between popular life
science ontologies evolve for different match algorithms. We also evaluate
which semantic ontology changes primarily affect the mappings. We further
investigate alternatives to predict or estimate the degree of future mapping
changes based on previous ontology and mapping transitions.
