We present data for the scaling behavior of lattice QCD with two flavors of
light Wilson fermions. This is done by matching $\pi$ n and $\rho$ masses at
the two lattice sizes of $16^3\times32 $ and $8^3\times16$. We find that at
$\beta=6/g^2\equiv5.3$ the matching does not occur over a range extending down
to $\beta=3.5$. For $\beta=5.5$ matching may be achieved at $\beta=4.8-4.9$,
leading to a $\Delta \beta =0.6-0.7$ which is higher than the perturbative
2-loop value of 0.45. In both cases we conclude that the simulations are very
far from the perturbative scaling region.
