We present results for kaon mixing parameter $B_K$ calculated using
HYP-smeared improved staggered fermions on the MILC asqtad lattices. We use
three lattice spacings ($a\approx 0.12$, $0.09$ and $0.06\;$fm), ten different
valence quark masses ($m\approx m_s/10-m_s$), and several light sea-quark
masses in order to control the continuum and chiral extrapolations. We derive
the next-to-leading order staggered chiral perturbation theory (SChPT) results
necessary to fit our data, and use these results to do extrapolations based
both on SU(2) and SU(3) SChPT. The SU(2) fitting is particularly
straightforward because parameters related to taste-breaking and matching
errors appear only at next-to-next-to-leading order. We match to the continuum
renormalization scheme (NDR) using one-loop perturbation theory. Our final
result is from the SU(2) analysis, with the SU(3) result providing a (less
accurate) cross check. We find $B_K(\text{NDR}, \mu = 2 \text{GeV}) = 0.529 \pm
0.009 \pm 0.032$ and $\hat{B}_K =B_K(\text{RGI})= 0.724 \pm 0.012 \pm 0.043$,
where the first error is statistical and the second systematic. The error is
dominated by the truncation error in the matching factor. Our results are
consistent with those obtained using valence domain-wall fermions on lattices
generated with asqtad or domain-wall sea quarks.
