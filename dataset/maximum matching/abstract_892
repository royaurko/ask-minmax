On 17 January 2010, STEREO-B observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and white
light a large-scale dome-shaped expanding coronal transient with perfectly
connected off-limb and on-disk signatures. Veronig et al. (2010, ApJL 716, 57)
concluded that the dome was formed by a weak shock wave. We have revealed two
EUV components, one of which corresponded to this transient. All of its
properties found from EUV, white light, and a metric type II burst match
expectations for a freely expanding coronal shock wave including correspondence
to the fast-mode speed distribution, while the transient sweeping over the
solar surface had a speed typical of EUV waves. The shock wave was presumably
excited by an abrupt filament eruption. Both a weak shock approximation and a
power-law fit match kinematics of the transient near the Sun. Moreover, the
power-law fit matches expansion of the CME leading edge up to 24 solar radii.
The second, quasi-stationary EUV component near the dimming was presumably
associated with a stretched CME structure; no indications of opening magnetic
fields have been detected far from the eruption region.
