Localization in indoor environments is a technique which estimates the
robot's pose by fusing data from onboard motion sensors with readings of the
environment, in our case obtained by scan matching point clouds captured by a
low-cost Kinect depth camera. We develop both an Invariant Extended Kalman
Filter (IEKF)-based and a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF)-based
solution to this problem. The two designs are successfully validated in
experiments and demonstrate the advantage of the IEKF design.
