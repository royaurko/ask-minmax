We describe an efficient method of matched filtering over long (greater than
1 day) time baselines starting from Fourier transforms of short durations
(roughly 30 minutes) of the data stream. This method plays a crucial role in
the search algorithm developed by Schutz and Papa for the detection of
continuous gravitational waves from pulsars. Also, we discuss the computational
cost--saving approximations used in this method, and the resultant performance
of the search algorithm.
