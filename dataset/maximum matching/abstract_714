[Aims] Accurate astrometry is required to reliably cross-match 20th-century
photographic catalogues against 21st-century digital surveys. The present work
provides modern-era identifications and astrometry for the 801 emission-line
objects "of stellar appearance" in the Armagh survey (the largest of its nature
to date). [Methods] Targets have been individually identified in digital images
using the Armagh Atlas and, in most cases, unambiguously matched to entries in
the UCAC astrometric catalogues. [Results] Astrometry with sub-arcsecond
precision is now available for all the major photographic spectroscopic surveys
of the LMC. The results are used to compile an annotated metacatalogue of 1675
individual, spectroscopically identified candidate H-alpha-emission stars,
including detailed cross-matching between catalogues, and resolving many
(though not all) identification ambiguities in individual primary sources.
