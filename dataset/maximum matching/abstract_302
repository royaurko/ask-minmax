In this paper, a technique for constructing quasiperiodic structures is
suggested, which allows one by the assigned matching to restore the atoms
density distribution formula of a corresponding quasicrystal. The algorithm to
restore the atom density distribution has been considered on the example of the
Penrose matching. The analytical record of a Penrose quasicrystal is given.
