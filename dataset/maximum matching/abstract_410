We derive a universal relation for the transverse part of triangle anomalies
within a class of theories whose gravity dual is described by the
Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory. This relation provides a set of sum rules
involving the masses, decay constants and couplings between resonances, and
leads to the formulas for the matrix elements of the vector and axial currents
in the presence of the soft electromagnetic field. We also discuss that this
relation is valid in real QCD at least approximately. This may be regarded as
the anomaly matching for resonances as an analogue of that for the massless
excitations in QCD.
