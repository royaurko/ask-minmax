We propose and investigate the quasi-phase matched (QPM) nonlinear optical
frequency conversion of optical vortices in periodically poled Lithium Niobate
(PPLN). Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes are used to represent the orbital angular
momentum (OAM) states, characterized with the azimuthal and radial indices.
Typical three-wave nonlinear interactions among the involved OAM modes are
studied with the help of coupling wave equations. Being different from normal
QPM process where the energy and quasi-momentum conservations are satisfied,
both of the azimuthal and radial indices of the OAM states keep constant in
most of the cases. However, abnormal change of the radial index is observed
when there is asynchronous nonlinear conversion in different parts of the
beams. The QPM nonlinear evolution of fractional OAM states is also discussed
showing some interesting properties. In comparison with the traditional
birefringent phase matching (BPM), the QPM technique avoids the undesired
walk-off effect to reserve high-quality LG modes. We believe the QPM is an
efficient way to convert, amplify and switch OAM states in various optical
vortex related applications.
