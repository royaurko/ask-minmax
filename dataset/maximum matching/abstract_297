We present a new method for analyzing multi--detector maps containing
contributions from several components. Our method, based on matching the data
to a model in the spectral domain, permits to estimate jointly the spatial
power spectra of the components and of the noise, as well as the mixing
coefficients. It is of particular relevance for the analysis of
millimeter--wave maps containing a contribution from CMB anisotropies.
