We present CCD V and I band photometry and visual observations of V1663
Aquilae (Nova Aquilae 2005). This was a classical fast nova, probably of type
Ba, observed for the first time on 2005 June 9. Maximum light occurred at HJD=
2453531.2 +/- 0.2, when the apparent V magnitude was 10.7 +/- 0.1 and the V-I
colour index 3.1. Decline times were t2,V= 17d, t2,I= 18d, t3,V= 32d and t3,I=
35d. We derived a maximum absolute V magnitude of -7.8 +/- 0.2, colour excess
E(B-V)= 2, extinction AV= 6 magnitudes and distance d= 2.9 +/- 0.4 kpc. After
maximum the V-I colour index remained between 3.1 and 3.4 for 50 days, then
gradually reduced as the nova became bluer with increasing age. We saw no
direct evidence of dust emission although this could have contributed to the
high extinction in the direction of the nova.
