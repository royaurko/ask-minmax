We discuss upon recent progress in our knowledge of the large order behavior
in perturbation theory of the pole mass and the singlet static potential. We
also discuss about the renormalon subtracted scheme, a matching scheme between
QCD and any effective field theory with heavy quarks where, besides the usual
perturbative matching, the first renormalon in the Borel plane of the pole mass
is subtracted.
