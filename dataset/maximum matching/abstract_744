In this paper, we define a concept of signal matched multirate whitening
filter bank which provides an optimum coding gain. This is achieved by
whitening the outputs, of the analysis filter bank, within as well as across
the channels, by solving a constrained projection problem. We also present a
fast time and order recursive least squares algorithm to obtain the vector
output of the proposed analysis filter bank. The recursive algorithm, developed
here, gives rise to a lattice-like structure. Since the proposed signal matched
analysis filter bank coefficients are not available directly, an order
recursive algorithm is also presented for estimating these from the lattice
parameters. Simulation results are presented to validate the theory. It is also
observed that the proposed algorithm can be used to whiten
Gaussian/non-Gaussian processes with minimum as well as non-minimum phase.
