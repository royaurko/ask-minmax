Proprioception is comprised of sensory input from several sources including
muscle spindles, joint capsule, ligaments and skin. The purpose of the present
experiment was to investigate whether the central nervous system was able to
integrate an artificial biofeedback delivered through electrotactile
stimulation of the tongue to improve proprioceptive acuity at the ankle joint.
To address this objective, nine young healthy adults were asked to perform an
active ankle-matching task with and without biofeedback. The underlying
principle of the biofeedback consisted of supplying subjects with supplementary
information about the position of their matching ankle position relative to
their reference ankle position through a tongue-placed tactile output device
(Tongue Display Unit). Measures of the overall accuracy and the variability of
the positioning were determined using the absolute error and the variable
error, respectively. Results showed more accurate and more consistent matching
performances with than without biofeedback, as indicated by decreased absolute
and variables errors, respectively. These findings suggested that the central
nervous system was able to take advantage of an artificial tongue-placed
tactile biofeedback to improve the position sense at the ankle joint.
