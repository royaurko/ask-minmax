This paper seeks to bridge the two major algorithmic approaches to sparse
signal recovery from an incomplete set of linear measurements --
L_1-minimization methods and iterative methods (Matching Pursuits). We find a
simple regularized version of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (ROMP) which has
advantages of both approaches: the speed and transparency of OMP and the strong
uniform guarantees of the L_1-minimization. Our algorithm ROMP reconstructs a
sparse signal in a number of iterations linear in the sparsity (in practice
even logarithmic), and the reconstruction is exact provided the linear
measurements satisfy the Uniform Uncertainty Principle.
