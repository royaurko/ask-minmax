We discuss some computational problems associated to matched filtering of
experimental signals from gravitational wave interferometric detectors in a
parallel-processing environment. We then specialize our discussion to the use
of the APEmille and apeNEXT processors for this task. Finally, we accurately
estimate the performance of an APEmille system on a computational load
appropriate for the LIGO and VIRGO experiments, and extrapolate our results to
apeNEXT.
