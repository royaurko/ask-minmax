The dynamics of maximum entangled coherent state travels through an amplitude
damping channel is investigated. For small values of the transmissivity rate
the travelling state is very fragile to this noise channel, where it suffers
from the phase flip error with high probability. The entanglement decays
smoothly for larger values of the transmissivity rate and speedily for smaller
values of this rate. As the number of modes increases, the travelling state
over this noise channel loses its entanglement hastily. The odd and even states
vanish at the same value of the field intensity.
