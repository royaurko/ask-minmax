This paper presents estimates of the convergence rate and complexity of an
algebraic multilevel preconditioner based on piecewise constant coarse vector
spaces applied to the graph Laplacian. A bound is derived on the energy norm of
the projection operator onto any piecewise constant vector space, which results
in an estimate of the two-level convergence rate where the coarse level graph
is obtained by matching. The two-level convergence of the method is then used
to establish the convergence of an Algebraic Multilevel Iteration that uses the
two-level scheme recursively. On structured grids, the method is proven to have
convergence rate $\approx (1-1/\log n)$ and $O(n\log n)$ complexity for each
cycle, where $n$ denotes the number of unknowns in the given problem. Numerical
results of the algorithm applied to various graph Laplacians are reported. It
is also shown that all the theoretical estimates derived for matching can be
generalized to the case of aggregates containing more than two vertices.
