We studied the ISM distribution in and around the star forming cloud L1251
with optical star counts. A careful calculation with a maximum likelihood based
statistical approach resulted in B,V,R,I extinction distributions from the star
count maps. A distance of 330+/-30 pc was derived. The extinction maps revealed
an elongated dense cloud with a bow shock at its eastern side. We estimated a
Mach number of M~2 for the bow shock. A variation of the apparent dust
properties is detected, i.e. the Rv=Av/E{B-V} total to selective extinction
ratio varies from 3 to 5.5, peaking at the densest part of L1251. The spatial
structure of the head of L1251 is well modelled with a Schuster-sphere (i.e.
n=5 polytropic sphere). The observed radial distribution of mass fits the model
with high accuracy out to 2.5pc distance from the assumed center. Unexpectedly,
the distribution of NH3 1.3 cm line widths is also well matched by the Schuster
solution even in the tail of the cloud. Since the elongated head-tail structure
of L1251 is far from the spherical symmetry the good fit of the linewidths in
the tail makes it reasonable to assume that the present cloud structure has
been formed by isothermal contraction.
