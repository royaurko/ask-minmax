The T-matrix method is widely used for the calculation of scattering by
particles of sizes on the order of the illuminating wavelength. Although the
extended boundary condition method (EBCM) is the most commonly used technique
for calculating the T-matrix, a variety of methods can be used.
  We consider some general principles of calculating T-matrices, and apply the
point-matching method to calculate the T-matrix for particles devoid of
symmetry. This method avoids the time-consuming surface integrals required by
the EBCM.
