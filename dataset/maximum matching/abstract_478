This paper presents a simple periodic parameter-switching method which can
find any stable limit cycle that can be numerically approximated in a
generalized Duffing system. In this method, the initial value problem of the
system is numerically integrated and the control parameter is switched
periodically within a chosen set of parameter values. The resulted attractor
matches with the attractor obtained by using the average of the switched
values. The accurate match is verified by phase plots and Hausdorff distance
measure in extensive simulations.
