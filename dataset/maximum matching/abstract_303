We obtain the vortex configurations, the matching fields and the
magnetization of a superconducting film with a finite cross section. The
applied magnetic field is normal to this cross section, and we use London
theory to calculate many of its properties, such as the local magnetic field,
the free energy and the induction for the mixed state. Thus previous similar
theoretical works, done for an infinitely long superconducting film, are
recovered here, in the special limit of a very long cross section.
