Metasurfaces, and in particular those containing plasmonic-based metallic
elements, constitute a particularly attractive set of materials. By means of
modern nanolithographic fabrication techniques, flat, ultrathin optical
elements may be constructed. However, in spite of their strong optical
nonlinearities, plasmonic metasurfaces have so far been investigated mostly in
the linear regime. Here we introduce full nonlinear phase control over
plasmonic elements in metasurfaces. We show that for nonlinear interactions in
a phase-gradient nonlinear metasurface a new anomalous nonlinear phase matching
condition prevails, which is the nonlinear analog of the generalized Snell law
demonstrated for linear metasurfaces. This phase matching condition is very
different from the other known phase matching schemes. The subwavelength phase
control of optical nonlinearities provides a foundation for the design of flat
nonlinear optical elements based on metasurfaces. Our demonstrated flat
nonlinear elements (i.e. lenses) act as generators and manipulators of the
frequency-converted signal.
