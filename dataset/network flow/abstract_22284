We study the transition to fermion pair superfluidity in a mixture of
interacting bosonic and fermionic atoms. The fermion interaction induced by the
bosons and the dynamical screening of the condensate phonons due to fermions
are included using the nonperturbative Hamiltonian flow equations. We determine
the bosonic spectrum near the transition towards phase separation and find that
the superfluid transition temperature may be increased substantially due to
phonon damping.
