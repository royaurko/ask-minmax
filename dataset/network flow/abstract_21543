We study expansion of quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
after switching off the confining harmonic potential. Exact solution of
dynamical equations is obtained in framework of the hydrodynamic approximation
and it is compared with the direct numerical simulation of the full problem
showing excellent agreement at realistic values of physical parameters. We
analyze the maximum of the current density and estimate the velocity of
expansion. The results of the 1D analysis provides also qualitative
understanding of some properties of BEC expansion observed in experiments.
