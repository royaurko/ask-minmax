This paper studies optimal distributed power allocation and scheduling
policies (DPASPs) for distributed total power and interference limited (DTPIL)
cognitive multiple access networks in which secondary users (SU) independently
perform power allocation and scheduling tasks using their local knowledge of
secondary transmitter secondary base-station (STSB) and secondary transmitter
primary base-station (STPB) channel gains. In such networks, transmission
powers of SUs are limited by an average total transmission power constraint and
by a constraint on the average interference power that SUs cause to the primary
base-station. We first establish the joint optimality of water-filling power
allocation and threshold-based scheduling policies for DTPIL networks. We then
show that the secondary network throughput under the optimal DPASP scales
according to $\frac{1}{\e{}n_h}\log\logp{N}$, where $n_h$ is a parameter
obtained from the distribution of STSB channel power gains and $N$ is the total
number of SUs. From a practical point of view, our results signify the fact
that distributed cognitive multiple access networks are capable of harvesting
multiuser diversity gains without employing centralized schedulers and feedback
links as well as without disrupting primary's quality-of-service (QoS)
