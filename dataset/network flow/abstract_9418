Nonlinear networks with time-delayed couplings may show strong and weak
chaos, depending on the scaling of their Lyapunov exponent with the delay time.
We study strong and weak chaos for semiconductor lasers, either with
time-delayed self-feedback or for small networks. We examine the dependence on
the pump current and consider the question whether strong and weak chaos can be
identified from the shape of the intensity trace, the auto-correlations and the
external cavity modes. The concept of the sub-Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_0$ is
generalized to the case of two time-scale separated delays in the system. We
give the first experimental evidence of strong and weak chaos in a network of
lasers which supports the sequence 'weak to strong to weak chaos' upon
monotonically increasing the coupling strength. Finally, we discuss strong and
weak chaos for networks with several distinct sub-Lyapunov exponents and
comment on the dependence of the sub-Lyapunov exponent on the number of a
laser's inputs in a network.
