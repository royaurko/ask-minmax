The mechanical behaviour and symmetry-breaking shape deformation of red blood
cells subjected to shear flows is used to demonstrate that far from being
random fluids, both the membrane and cytoplasm of every biological cell undergo
spatially organised convective and shear driven flows when the cell maintains a
Near Equilibrium state through continuousmetabolic activity. The model
demonstrates that fluid bifurcation events drive cell shape changes, rather
than a Meccano like cytoskeletal structure, and represents a significant
Gestalt shift in models of cell mechanics.
