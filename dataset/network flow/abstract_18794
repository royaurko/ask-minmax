Motivated by the Double Gyroid nanowire network we develop methods to detect
Dirac points and classify level crossings, aka. singularities in the spectrum
of a family of Hamiltonians. The approach we use is singularity theory. Using
this language, we obtain a characterization of Dirac points and also show that
the branching behavior of the level crossings is given by an unfolding of $A_n$
type singularities. Which type of singularity occurs can be read off a
characteristic region inside the miniversal unfolding of an $A_k$ singularity.
We then apply these methods in the setting of families of graph Hamiltonians,
such as those for wire networks. In the particular case of the Double Gyroid we
analytically classify its singularities and show that it has Dirac points. This
indicates that nanowire systems of this type should have very special physical
properties.
