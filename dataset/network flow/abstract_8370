We study community structure of networks. We have developed a scheme for
maximizing the modularity Q based on mean field methods. Further, we have
defined a simple family of random networks with community structure; we
understand the behavior of these networks analytically. Using these networks,
we show how the mean field methods display better performance than previously
known deterministic methods for optimization of Q.
