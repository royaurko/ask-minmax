We develop a general theory for percolation in directed random networks with
arbitrary two point correlations and bidirectional edges, that is, edges
pointing in both directions simultaneously. These two ingredients alter the
previously known scenario and open new views and perspectives on percolation
phenomena. Equations for the percolation threshold and the sizes of the giant
components are derived in the most general case. We also present simulation
results for a particular example of uncorrelated network with bidirectional
edges confirming the theoretical predictions.
