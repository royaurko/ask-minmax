A general problem formulation for energy-efficient traffic engineering for
future core networks is presented. Moreover, a distributed heuristic algorithm
that provides jointly load balancing and energy efficiency is proposed,
approaching in this way the optimal network operation in terms of throughput
and energy consumption.
