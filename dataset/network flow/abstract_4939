We construct small-amplitude steady periodic gravity water waves arising as
the free surface of water flows that contain stagnation points and possess a
discontinuous distribution of vorticity in the sense that the flows consist of
two layers of constant but different vorticities. We also describe the
streamline pattern in the moving frame for the constructed flows.
