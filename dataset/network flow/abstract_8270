In a Comment (cond-mat/0310030) on our recent paper on network glasses (Phys.
Rev. Lett., 2003, 90, 085505), Micoulaut and Boolchand (MB) compare our
predictions on glass transitions in network systems for the ratios of the
transition temperatures TA/TG and TK/TG with experimental data. They claim
significant differences between experiment and theory are seen and claim the
lack of agreement is due to flaws in our theory. Their comparison of TA/TG is
incorrect as they do not measure the same quantity that our theory predicts.
The TK/TG comparison shows remarkable agreement between theory and experiment.
