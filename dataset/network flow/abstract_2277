We introduce two notions for flows on quasi-diagonal C*-algebras,
quasi-diagonal and pseudo-diagonal flows; the former being apparently stronger
than the latter. We derive basic facts about these flows and give various
examples. In addition we extend results of Voiculescu from quasi-diagonal
C*-algebras to these flows.
