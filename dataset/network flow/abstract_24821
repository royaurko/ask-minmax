Before establishing a communication link in a cellular network, the user
terminal must activate a synchronization procedure called initial cell search
in order to acquire specific information about the serving base station. To
accomplish this task, the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary
synchronization signal (SSS) are periodically transmitted in the downlink of a
Long Term Evolution (LTE) network.
  Since SSS detection can be performed only after successful identification of
the primary signal, in this work we present a robust scheme for joint PSS
detection, sector index identification and integer frequency offset (IFO)
recovery in an LTE system. The proposed algorithm relies on the maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation criterion and exploits a suitable reduced-rank
representation of the channel frequency response to take multipath distortions
into account. We show that some PSS detection methods that were originally
introduced through heuristic reasoning can be derived from our ML framework by
selecting an appropriate model for the channel gains over the PSS subcarriers.
  Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed scheme can be effectively
applied in the presence of severe multipath propagation, where existing
alternatives provide unsatisfactory performance.
