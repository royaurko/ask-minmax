We study the inviscid multilayer Saint-Venant (or shallow-water) system in
the limit of small density contrast. We show that, under reasonable
hyperbolicity conditions on the flow, the system is well-posed on a large time
interval, despite the singular limit. By studying the asymptotic limit, we
provide a rigorous justification of the widely used rigid-lid and Boussinesq
approximations for multilayered shallow water flows. The asymptotic behaviour
is similar to that of the incompressible limit for Euler equations, in the
sense that there exists a small initial layer in time for ill-prepared initial
data, accounting for rapidly propagating "acoustic" waves (here, the so-called
barotropic mode) which interact only weakly with the "incompressible" component
(here, baroclinic).
