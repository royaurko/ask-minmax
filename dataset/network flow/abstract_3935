In this paper, the synchronization in a hyper-network of coupled dynamical
systems is investigated for the first time. An evolving hyper-network model is
proposed for better describing some complex systems. A concept of joint degree
is introduced, and the evolving mechanism of hyper-network is given with
respect to the joint degree. The hyper-degree distribution of the proposed
evolving hyper-network is derived based on a rate equation method and obeys a
power law distribution. Furthermore, the synchronization in a hyper-network of
coupled dynamical systems is investigated for the first time. By calculating
the joint degree matrix, several simple yet useful synchronization criteria are
obtained and illustrated by several numerical examples.
