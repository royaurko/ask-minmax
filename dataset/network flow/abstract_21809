Using geometric methods we constructively show the existence of a unique
completed free differential graded Lie algebra modelled on the interval, with
three generators, a, b and e in degrees -1, -1 and 0, corresponding to the two
0-cells and one 1-cell, such that the `flow' in direction e carries a to b in
unit time. The background, historical perspective and related open problems are
given at the end of the paper.
