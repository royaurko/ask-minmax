Data reflecting social and business relations has often form of network of
connections between entities (called social network). In such network important
and influential users can be identified as well as groups of strongly connected
users. Finding such groups and observing their evolution becomes an
increasingly important research problem. One of the significant problems is to
develop method incorporating not only information about connections between
entities but also information obtained from text written by the users. Method
presented in this paper combine social network analysis and text mining in
order to understand groups evolution.
