Community detection has arisen as one of the most relevant topics in the
field of graph data mining due to its importance in many fields such as
biology, social networks or network traffic analysis. The metrics proposed to
shape communities are generic and follow two approaches: maximizing the
internal density of such communities or reducing the connectivity of the
internal vertices with those outside the community. However, these metrics take
the edges as a set and do not consider the internal layout of the edges in the
community. We define a set of properties oriented to social networks that
ensure that communities are cohesive, structured and well defined. Then, we
propose the Weighted Community Clustering (WCC), which is a community metric
based on triangles. We proof that analyzing communities by triangles gives
communities that fulfill the listed set of properties, in contrast to previous
metrics. Finally, we experimentally show that WCC correctly captures the
concept of community in social networks using real and syntethic datasets, and
compare statistically some of the most relevant community detection algorithms
in the state of the art.
