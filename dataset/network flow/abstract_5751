The configuration model is one of the most successful models for generating
uncorrelated random networks. We analyze its behavior when the expected degree
sequence follows a power law with exponent smaller than two. In this situation,
the resulting network can be viewed as a weighted network with non trivial
correlations between strength and degree. Our results are tested against large
scale numerical simulations, finding excellent agreement.
