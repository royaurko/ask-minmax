Recent developments in lipid membrane models for simulations are reviewed. To
reduce computational costs, various coarse-grained molecular models have been
proposed. Among them, implicit solvent (solvent-free) molecular models are
relatively more coarse-grained and efficient for simulating large bilayer
membranes. On a $\mu$m scale, the molecular details are typically negligible
and the membrane can be described as a continuous curved surface. The
theoretical models for fluid and elastic membranes with mesh or meshless
discretizations are presented. As examples of applications, the dynamics of
vesicles in flows, vesicle formation, and membrane fusion are presented.
