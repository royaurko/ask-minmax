The emission pattern from a classical dipole located above and oriented
perpendicular to a metallic or dielectric half space is calculated for a dipole
driven at constant amplitude. This is a problem considered originally by
Sommerfeld and analyzed subsequently by numerous contributors. In contrast to most
previous treatments, however, we focus on the energy flow in the metal or
dielectric. It is shown that the radial Poynting vector in the metal points
inwards when the frequency of the dipole is below the surface plasmon resonance
frequency. In this case, energy actually flows of the interface at small radii.
The Joule heating in the metal is also calculated and it is shown explicitly
that Poynting's theorem holds for a cylindrical surface in the metal. When the
metal is replaced by a dielectric having permittivity less than that of the
medium in which the dipole is immersed, it is found that energy flows out of
the interface for sufficiently large radii. In all cases it is assumed that the
imaginary part of the permittivity of the metal or dielectric is much less than
unity.
