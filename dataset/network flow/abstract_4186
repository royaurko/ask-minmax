We consider the evolution of hypersurfaces on the unit sphere
$\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$ by their mean curvature. We prove a differential Harnack
inequality for any weakly convex solution to the mean curvature flow. As an
application, by applying an Aleksandrov reflection argument, we classify
convex, ancient solutions of the mean curvature flow on the sphere.
