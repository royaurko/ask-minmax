We present an explicit solution of the $A_r$ $T$-system for arbitrary
boundary conditions. For each boundary, this is done by constructing a network,
i.e. a graph with positively weighted edges, and the solution is expressed as
the partition function for a family of non-intersecting paths on the network.
This proves in particular the positive Laurent property, namely that the
solutions are all Laurent polynomials of the initial data with non-negative
integer coefficients.
