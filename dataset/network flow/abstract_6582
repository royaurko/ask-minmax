Recent research has shown the deep impact of the dynamics of human
interactions (or temporal social networks) on the spreading of information,
opinion formation, etc. In general, the bursty nature of human interactions
lowers the interaction between people to the extent that both the speed and
reach of information diffusion are diminished. Using a large database of 20
million users of mobile phone calls we show evidence this effect is not
homogeneous in the social network but in fact, there is a large correlation
between this effect and the social topological structure around a given
individual. In particular, we show that social relations of hubs in a network
are relatively weaker from the dynamical point than those that are poorer
connected in the information diffusion process. Our results show the importance
of the temporal patterns of communication when analyzing and modeling dynamical
process on social networks.
