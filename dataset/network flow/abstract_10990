We propose a general geometric growth model for pseudofractal scale-free web,
which is controlled by two tunable parameters. We derive exactly the main
characteristics of the networks: degree distribution, second moment of degree
distribution, degree correlations, distribution of clustering coefficient, as
well as the diameter, which are partially determined by the parameters.
Analytical results show that the resulting networks are disassortative and
follow power-law degree distributions, with a more general degree exponent
tuned from 2 to $1+\frac{\ln3}{\ln2}$; the clustering coefficient of each
individual node is inversely proportional to its degree and the average
clustering coefficient of all nodes approaches to a large nonzero value in the
infinite network order; the diameter grows logarithmically with the number of
network nodes. All these reveal that the networks described by our model have
small-world effect and scale-free topology.
