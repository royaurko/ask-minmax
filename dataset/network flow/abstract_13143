Lyapunov exponents of heavy particles and tracers advected by homogeneous and
isotropic turbulent flows are investigated by means of direct numerical
simulations. For large values of the Stokes number, the main effect of inertia
is to reduce the chaoticity with respect to fluid tracers. Conversely, for
small inertia, a counter-intuitive increase of the first Lyapunov exponent is
observed. The flow intermittency is found to induce a Reynolds number
dependency for the statistics of the finite time Lyapunov exponents of tracers.
Such intermittency effects are found to persist at increasing inertia.
