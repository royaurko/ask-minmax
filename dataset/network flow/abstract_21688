The effective action of a SU(N)-gauge theory coupled to fermions is evaluated
at a large infrared cut-off scale k within the path integral approach. The
gauge field measure includes topologically non-trivial configurations
(instantons). Due to the explicit infrared regularisation there are no gauge
field zero modes. The Dirac operator of instanton configurations shows a zero
mode even after the infrared regularisation, which leads to U_A(1)-violating
terms in the effective action. These terms are calculated in the limit of large
scales k.
