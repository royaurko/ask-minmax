In this work, we propose and address a new computer vision task, which we
call fashion item detection, where the aim is to detect various fashion items a
person in the image is wearing or carrying. The types of fashion items we
consider in this work include hat, glasses, bag, pants, shoes and so on. The
detection of fashion items can be an important first step of various e-commerce
applications for fashion industry. Our method is based on state-of-the-art
object detection method which combines object proposal methods with a Deep
Convolutional Neural Network. Since the locations of fashion items are in
strong correlation with the locations of body joints positions, we propose a
hybrid discriminative-generative model to incorporate contextual information
from body poses in order to improve the detection performance. Through the
experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baseline methods
with a large margin.
