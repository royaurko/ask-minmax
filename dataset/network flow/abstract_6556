This work addresses the problem of deriving fundamental trade-off bounds for
a 1-relay and a 2-relay wireless network when multiple performance criteria are
of interest. It proposes a simple MultiObjective (MO) performance evaluation
framework composed of a broadcast and interference-limited network model;
capacity, delay and energy performance metrics and an associated MO
optimization problem. Pareto optimal performance bounds between end-to-end
delay and energy for a capacity-achieving network are given for 1-relay and
2-relay topologies and assessed through simulations. Moreover, we also show in
this paper that these bounds are tight since they can be reached by simple
practical coding strategies performed by the source and the relays. Two
different types of network coding strategies are investigated. Practical
performance bounds for both strategies are compared to the theoretical upper
bound. Results confirm that the proposed upper bound on delay and energy
performance is tight and can be reached with the proposed combined source and
network coding strategies.
