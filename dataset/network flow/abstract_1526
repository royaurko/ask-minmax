Active Queue Management(AQM) is an efficient tool in the network to avoid
saturation of the queue by warning the sender that the queue is almost full to
reduce its speed before the queue is full. The buffer management schemes focus
on space management, in the other hand scheduling priorities (focusing on time
management) attempt to guarantee acceptable delay boundaries to applications
for which it is important that delay is bounded. Combined mechanisms (time and
space management) are possible and enable networks to improve the perceived
quality for multimedia traffic at the end users. The key idea in this paper is
to study the performance of a mechanism combining an AQM with a time-space
priority scheme applied to multimedia flows transmitted to an end user in HSDPA
network. The studied queue is shared by Real Time and Non Real Time packets. We
propose a mathematical model using Poisson and MMPP processes to model the
arrival of packets in the system. The performance parameters are analytically
deducted for the Combined EB-TSP and compared to the case of Simple EB-TSP.
Numerical results obtained show the positive impact of the AQM added to the
EB-TSP on the performance parameters of NRT packets compared to the Simple
EB-TSP.
