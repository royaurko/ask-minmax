In past years there has been increasing interest in field of Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs). One of the major issue of WSNs is development of energy
efficient routing protocols. Clustering is an effective way to increase energy
efficiency. Mostly, heterogenous protocols consider two or three energy level
of nodes. In reality, heterogonous WSNs contain large range of energy levels.
By analyzing communication energy consumption of the clusters and large range
of energy levels in heterogenous WSN, we propose BEENISH (Balanced Energy
Efficient Network Integrated Super Heterogenous) Protocol. It assumes WSN
containing four energy levels of nodes. Here, Cluster Heads (CHs) are elected
on the bases of residual energy level of nodes. Simulation results show that it
performs better than existing clustering protocols in heterogeneous WSNs. Our
protocol achieve longer stability, lifetime and more effective messages than
Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC), Developed DEEC (DDEEC) and
Enhanced DEEC (EDEEC).
