We study the two dimensional Chern insulator and spin Hall insulator on a
non-orientable Riemann surface, the Mobius strip, where the usual bandstructure
topological invariant is not defined. We show that while the flow pattern of
edge currents can detect the twist of the Mobius strip in the case of Chern
insulator, it can not do so in spin Hall insulator.
