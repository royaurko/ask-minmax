This paper considers a generalized framework to study OSNR optimization-based
end-to-end link level power control problems in optical networks. We combine
favorable features of game-theoretical approach and central cost approach to
allow different service groups within the network. We develop solutions
concepts for both cases of empty and nonempty feasible sets. In addition, we
derive and prove the convergence of a distributed iterative algorithm for
different classes of users. In the end, we use numerical examples to illustrate
the novel framework.
