We examine the validity of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation of
granular fluids for a plane shear flow under the Lees-Edwards boundary
condition derived from a weakly nonlinear analysis through the comparison with
the result of discrete element method. We verify quantitative agreements in the
time evolutions of the area fraction and the velocity fields, and also find
qualitative agreement in the granular temperature.
