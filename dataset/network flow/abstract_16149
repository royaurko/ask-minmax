We report the results of applying the 2MASS Tully-Fisher (TF) relations to
study the galaxy bulk flows. For 1141 all-sky distributed flat RFGC galaxies we
construct J, H, K_s TF relations and find that Kron $J_{fe}$ magnitudes show
the smallest dispersion on the TF diagram. For the sample of 971 RFGC galaxies
with V_{3K} < 18000 km/s we find a dispersion $\sigma_{TF}=0.42^m$ and an
amplitude of bulk flow V= 199 +/-61 km/s, directed towards l=301 degr +/-18
degr, b=-2 degr +/-15 degr. Our determination of low-amplitude coherent flow is
in good agreement with a set of recent data derived from EFAR, PSCz, SCI/SCII
samples. The resultant two- dimensional smoothed peculiar velocity field traces
well the large-scale density variations in the galaxy distributions. The
regions of large positive peculiar velocities lie in the direction of the Great
Attractor and Shapley concentration. A significant negative peculiar velocity
is seen in the direction of Bootes and in the direction of the Local void. A
small positive peculiar velocity (100 -- 150 km/s) is seen towards the
Pisces-Perseus supercluster, as well as the Hercules - Coma - Corona Borealis
supercluster regions.
