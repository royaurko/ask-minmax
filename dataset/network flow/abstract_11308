We study the effects of motor-generated stresses in disordered three
dimensional fiber networks using a combination of a mean-field, effective
medium theory, scaling analysis and a computational model. We find that motor
activity controls the elasticity in an anomalous fashion close to the point of
marginal stability by coupling to critical network fluctuations. We also show
that motor stresses can stabilize initially floppy networks, extending the
range of critical behavior to a broad regime of network connectivities below
the marginal point. Away from this regime, or at high stress, motors give rise
to a linear increase in stiffness with stress. Finally, we demonstrate that our
results are captured by a simple, constitutive scaling relation highlighting
the important role of non-affine strain fluctuations as a susceptibility to
motor stress.
