A number of examples of Hamiltonian systems that are integrable by classical
means are cast within the framework of isospectral flows in loop algebras.
These include: the Neumann oscillator, the cubically nonlinear Schr\"odinger
systems and the sine-Gordon equation. Each system has an associated invariant
spectral curve and may be integrated via the Liouville-Arnold technique. The
linearizing map is the Abel map to the associated Jacobi variety, which is
deduced through separation of variables in hyperellipsoidal coordinates. More
generally, a family of moment maps is derived, identifying certain finite
dimensional symplectic manifolds with rational coadjoint orbits of loop
algebras. Integrable Hamiltonians are obtained by restriction of elements of
the ring of spectral invariants to the image of these moment maps. The
isospectral property follows from the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem, and gives
rise to invariant spectral curves. {\it Spectral Darboux coordinates} are
introduced on rational coadjoint orbits, generalizing the hyperellipsoidal
coordinates to higher rank cases. Applying the Liouville-Arnold integration
technique, the Liouville generating function is expressed in completely
separated form as an abelian integral, implying the Abel map linearization in
the general case.
