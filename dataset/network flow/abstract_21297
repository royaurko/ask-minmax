In this work, we present a novel, robust scheme for high density WLAN
deployments. This scheme uses well known selection diversity at the
transmitter. We show that our scheme increases the number of simultaneous
transmissions at any given time without excessive overhead (compared to other
schemes such as Multi-user MIMO). Furthermore, this scheme can be easily
implemented using existing standards.
