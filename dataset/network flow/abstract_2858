Motivated by recent success in the dynamical systems approach to transitional
flow, we study the efficiency and effectiveness of extracting simple invariant
sets (recurrent flows) directly from chaotic/turbulent flows and the potential
of these sets for providing predictions of certain statistics of the flow.
Two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow (the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with a
sinusoidal body force) is studied both over a square [0, 2{\pi}]2 torus and a
rectangular torus extended in the forcing direction. In the former case, an
order of magnitude more recurrent flows are found than previously (Chandler &
Kerswell 2013) and shown to give improved predictions for the dissipation and
energy pdfs of the chaos via periodic orbit theory. Over the extended torus at
low forcing amplitudes, some extracted states mimick the statistics of the
spatially-localised chaos present surprisingly well recalling the striking
finding of Kawahara & Kida (2001) in low-Reynolds-number plane Couette flow. At
higher forcing amplitudes, however, success is limited highlighting the
increased dimensionality of the chaos and the need for larger data sets.
Algorithmic developments to improve the extraction procedure are discussed.
