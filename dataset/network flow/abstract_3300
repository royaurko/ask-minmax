This thesis investigates the nature of the development of two-dimensional
laminar nonisothermal flow of an incompressible fluid close to the reversed
stagnation-point. Proudman and Johnson (1962) \cite{proudman1962boundary} first
studied the flow and obtained an asymptotic solution by neglecting the viscous
terms. This is not practice in neglecting the viscous terms within the total
flow field. Viscous terms in this analysis are now included, and
two-dimensional nonisothermal reversed stagnation-point flow is investigated by
solving the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to energy equation.
