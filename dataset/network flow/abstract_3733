Via simulations of flowing foam, we connect the high and intermediate density
regimes of complex fluid flows into a consistent microscopic picture of
deformation. While at and above the jamming transition, elastic correlations
lead to strong spatial organization of the flow field, below jamming, the
slowly diminishing elastic correlation length leads to slowly ceasing spatial
organization, which is nevertheless still present down to densities far below
jamming. We show that the long-range correlated flow field arises from the
superposition of quadrupolar strain fields of shear zones with highly
correlated positions, strengths and orientation. These interactions are still
pertinent below jamming, where they systematically weaken with the slowly
diminishing elastic correlation length. These results demonstrate the ubiquity
and importance of elastic correlations in the flow of complex fluids even below
the jamming transition, and motivate a scale-bridging description of their flow
over wide ranges of density from solid to fluid.
