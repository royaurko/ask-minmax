Voice communication over internet not be possible without a reliable data
network, this was first available when distributed network topologies were used
in conjunction with data packets. Early network used single centre node network
in which a single workstation (Server) is responsible for the communication.
This posed problems as if there was a fault with the centre node, (workstation)
nothing would work. This problem was solved by the distributed system in which
reliability increases by spreading the load between many nodes. The idea of
packet switching & distributed network were combined, this combination were
increased reliability, speed & responsible for voice communication over
internet, Voice-over-IP (VoIP)These data packets travel through a
packet-switched network such as the Internet and arrive at their destination
where they are decompressed using a compatible Codec (audio coder/decoder) and
converted back to analogue audio. This paper deals with the Simulink
architecture for VoIP network.
