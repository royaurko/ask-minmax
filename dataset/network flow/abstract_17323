Recent experiments show that an avalanche initiated from a point source
propagates downwards by invading a triangular shaped region. The opening angle
of this triangle appears to reach 180$^o$ for a critical inclination of the
pile, beyond which avalanches also propage upwards. We propose a simple
interpretation of these observations, based on an extension of a
phenomenological model for surface flows.
