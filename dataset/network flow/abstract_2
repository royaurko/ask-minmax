We show a deterministic constant-time parallel algorithm for finding an
almost maximum flow in multisource-multitarget networks with bounded degrees
and bounded edge capacities. As a consequence, we show that the value of the
maximum flow over the number of nodes is a testable parameter on these
networks.
