Valuation networks have been proposed as graphical representations of
valuation-based systems (VBSs). The VBS framework is able to capture many
uncertainty calculi including probability theory, Dempster-Shafer's
belief-function theory, Spohn's epistemic belief theory, and Zadeh's
possibility theory. In this paper, we show how valuation networks encode
conditional independence relations. For the probabilistic case, the class of
probability models encoded by valuation networks includes undirected graph
models, directed acyclic graph models, directed balloon graph models, and
recursive causal graph models.
