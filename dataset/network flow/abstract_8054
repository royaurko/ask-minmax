Cluster cooling flow models that include both thermal conduction and AGN
heating have lower overall mass cooling rates and simultaneously sustain
density and temperature profiles similar to those observed with no ad hoc mass
dropout. To achieve this agreement, the thermal conductivity must be about 0.35
+/- 0.10 of the Spitzer value, similar to that advocated by Narayan & Medvedev.
However, when applied to galaxy/group scales the synergistic combination of AGN
heating and conduction is less satisfactory. When the computed density profile
and the global cooling rate are lowered by AGN heating to match observations of
these smaller scale flows, the gas temperatures within about 10 kpc are too
large. In addition, best-fitting flows in galaxy/groups with AGN heating and
thermal conduction require larger conductivities, about 0.5 - 1.0 of the
Spitzer value. When the gas density in galaxy/group flows is lowered by
heating, the iron enrichment by Type Ia supernovae is more effective and the
hot gas iron abundance greatly exceeds observed values. Consequently,
galactic/group flows with central heating and conduction require an additional
process that removes the iron: failure of Type Ia ejecta to go into the hot
phase, selective cooling, etc.
