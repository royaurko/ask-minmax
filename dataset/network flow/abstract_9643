The basic reproduction number R0 -- the number of individuals directly
infected by an infectious person in an otherwise susceptible population -- is
arguably the most widely used estimator of how severe an epidemic outbreak can
be. This severity can be more directly measured as the fraction people infected
once the outbreak is over, {\Omega}. In traditional mathematical epidemiology
and common formulations of static network epidemiology, there is a
deterministic relationship between R0 and {\Omega}. However, if one considers
disease spreading on a temporal contact network -- where one knows when
contacts happen, not only between whom -- then larger R0 does not necessarily
imply larger {\Omega}. In this paper, we numerically investigate the
relationship between R0 and {\Omega} for a set of empirical temporal networks
of human contacts. Among 31 explanatory descriptors of temporal network
structure, we identify those that make R0 an imperfect predictor of {\Omega}.
We find that descriptors related to both temporal and topological aspects
affect the relationship between R0 and {\Omega}, but in different ways.
