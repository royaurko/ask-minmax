The Ising models have been applied for various problems on information
sciences, social sciences, and so on. In many cases, solving these problems
corresponds to minimizing the Bethe free energy. To minimize the Bethe free
energy, a statistical-mechanical iterative algorithm is often used. We study
the statistical-mechanical iterative algorithm on complex networks. To
investigate effects of heterogeneous structures on the iterative algorithm, we
introduce an iterative algorithm based on information of heterogeneity of
complex networks, in which higher-degree nodes are likely to be updated more
frequently than lower-degree ones. Numerical experiments clarified that the
usage of the information of heterogeneity affects the algorithm in BA networks,
but does not influence that in ER networks. It is revealed that information of
the whole system propagates rapidly through such high-degree nodes in the case
of Barab{\'a}si-Albert's scale-free networks.
