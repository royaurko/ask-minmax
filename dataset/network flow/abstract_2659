This article describes the fluid dynamics video: "Effect of bubble
deformability on the vertical channel bubbly flow". The effect of bubble
deformability on the flow rate of bubbly upflow in a turbulent vertical channel
is examined using direct numerical simulations. A series of simulations with
bubbles of decreasing deformability reveals a sharp transition from a flow with
deformable bubbles uniformly distributed in the middle of the channel to a flow
with nearly spherical bubbles with a wall-peak bubble distribution and a much
lower flow rate.
