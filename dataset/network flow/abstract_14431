We report palaeointensity estimates obtained from three Oligocene volcanic
sections from the Kerguelen Archipelago (Mont des Ruches, Mont des Tempetes,
and Mont Rabouillere). Of 402 available samples, 102 were suitable for a
palaeofield strength determination after a preliminary selection, among which
49 provide a reliable estimate. Application of strict a posteriori criteria
make us confident about the quality of the 12 new mean-flow determinations,
which are the first reliable data available for the Kerguelen Archipelago. The
Virtual Dipole Moments (VDM) calculated for these flows vary from 2.78 to 9.47
10e22 Am2 with an arithmetic mean value of 6.15+-2.1 10e22 Am2. Compilation of
these results with a selection of the 2002 updated IAGA palaeointensity
database lead to a higher (5.4+-2.3 10e22 Am2) Oligocene mean VDM than
previously reported, identical to the 5.5+-2.4 10e22 Am2 mean VDM obtained for
the 0.3-5 Ma time window. However, these Kerguelen palaeointensity estimates
represent half of the reliable Oligocene determinations and thus a bias toward
higher values. Nonetheless, the new estimates reported here strengthen the
conclusion that the recent geomagnetic field strength is anomalously high
compared to that older than 0.3 Ma.
