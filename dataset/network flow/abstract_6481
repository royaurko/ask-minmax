Hierarchy seems to pervade complexity in both living and artificial systems.
Despite its relevance, no general theory that captures all features of
hierarchy and its origins has been proposed yet. Here we present a formal
approach resulting from the convergence of theoretical morphology and network
theory that allows constructing a 3D morphospace of hierarchies and hence
comparing the hierarchical organization of ecological, cellular, technological
and social networks. Embedded within large voids in the morphospace of all
possible hierarchies, four major groups are identified. Two of them match the
expected from random networks with similar connectivity, thus suggesting that
non-adaptive factors are at work. Ecological and gene networks define the other
two, indicating that their topological order is the result of functional
constraints. These results are consistent with an exploration of the
morphospace using in silico evolved networks.
