The double neutron-proton differential transverse flowtaken from two reaction
systems using different isotopes of the same element is studied at incident
beam energies of 400 and 800 MeV/nucleon within the framework of an isospin-
and momentum-dependent hadronic transport model IBUU04. The double differential
flow is found to retain about the same sensitivity to the density dependence of
the nuclear symmetry energy as the single differential flow in the more
neutron-rich reaction. Because the double differential flow reduces
significantly both the systematic errors and the influence of the Coulomb
force, it is thus more effective probe for the high-density behavior of the
nuclear symmetry energy.
