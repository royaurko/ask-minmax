In this paper, we consider delay minimization for interference networks with
renewable energy source, where the transmission power of a node comes from both
the conventional utility power (AC power) and the renewable energy source. We
assume the transmission power of each node is a function of the local channel
state, local data queue state and local energy queue state only. In turn, we
consider two delay optimization formulations, namely the decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) and Non-cooperative
partially observable stochastic game (POSG). In DEC-POMDP formulation, we
derive a decentralized online learning algorithm to determine the control
actions and Lagrangian multipliers (LMs) simultaneously, based on the policy
gradient approach. Under some mild technical conditions, the proposed
decentralized policy gradient algorithm converges almost surely to a local
optimal solution. On the other hand, in the non-cooperative POSG formulation,
the transmitter nodes are non-cooperative. We extend the decentralized policy
gradient solution and establish the technical proof for almost-sure convergence
of the learning algorithms. In both cases, the solutions are very robust to
model variations. Finally, the delay performance of the proposed solutions are
compared with conventional baseline schemes for interference networks and it is
illustrated that substantial delay performance gain and energy savings can be
achieved.
