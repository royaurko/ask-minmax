Recent genomic and bioinformatic advances have motivated the development of
numerous random network models purporting to describe graphs of biological,
technological, and sociological origin. The success of a model has been
evaluated by how well it reproduces a few key features of the real-world data,
such as degree distributions, mean geodesic lengths, and clustering
coefficients. Often pairs of models can reproduce these features with
indistinguishable fidelity despite being generated by vastly different
mechanisms. In such cases, these few target features are insufficient to
distinguish which of the different models best describes real world networks of
interest; moreover, it is not clear a priori that any of the presently-existing
algorithms for network generation offers a predictive description of the
networks inspiring them. To derive discriminative classifiers, we construct a
mapping from the set of all graphs to a high-dimensional (in principle
infinite-dimensional) ``word space.'' This map defines an input space for
classification schemes which allow us for the first time to state unambiguously
which models are most descriptive of the networks they purport to describe. Our
training sets include networks generated from 17 models either drawn from the
literature or introduced in this work, source code for which is freely
available. We anticipate that this new approach to network analysis will be of
broad impact to a number of communities.
