Cognitive Radio generates a big interest as a key cost-effective solution for
the underutilization of frequency spectrum in legacy communication networks.
The objective of this work lies in conducting a performance evaluation of the
end-to-end message delivery under both Markovian and Poissonian primary
traffics in lossy Cognitive Radio networks. We aim at inferring the most
appropriate conditions for an efficient secondary service provision according
to the Cognitive Radio network characteristics. Meanwhile, we have performed a
general analysis for many still open issues in Cognitive Radio, but at the end
only two critical aspects have been considered, namely, the unforeseen primary
reclaims in addition to the collided cognitive transmissions due to the
Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing. Some graphs, in view of the average Spectral
Efficiency, have been computed and plotted to report some comparative results
for a given video transmission under the Markovian and the Poissonian primary
interruptions.
