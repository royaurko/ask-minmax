The dynamical response of Coulomb-interacting particles in nano-clusters are
analyzed at different temperatures characterizing their solid- and liquid-like
behavior. Depending on the trap-symmetry, both the spatial and temporal
correlations undergo slow, stretched exponential relaxations at long times,
arising from spatially correlated motion in string-like paths. Our results
indicate that the distinction between the `solid' and `liquid' is soft: While
particles in a `solid' flow producing dynamic heterogeneities, motion in
`liquid' yields unusually long tail in the distribution of
particle-displacements. A phenomenological model captures much of the
subtleties of our numerical simulations.
