A Yang-Mills type two matrix model with mass terms is studied by use of a
matrix renormalization group approach proposed by Brezin and Zinn-Justin. The
renormalization group method indicates that the model exhibits a critical
behavior similar to that of two dimensional Euclidean gravity. A massless limit
and the generation of quadratic terms along the renormalization group flow are
discussed.
