We analyze a collaboration network based on the Marvel Universe comic books.
First, we consider the system as a binary network, where two characters are
connected if they appear in the same publication. The analysis of degree
correlations reveals that, in contrast to most real social networks, the Marvel
Universe presents a disassortative mixing on the degree. Then, we use a weight
measure to study the system as a weighted network. This allows us to find and
characterize well defined communities. Through the analysis of the community
structure and the clustering as a function of the degree we show that the
network presents a hierarchical structure. Finally, we comment on possible
mechanisms responsible for the particular motifs observed.
