Steady forcing at the wall of a channel flow is studied via DNS to assess its
ability of yielding reductions of turbulent friction drag. The wall forcing
consists of a stationary distribution of spanwise velocity that alternates in
the streamwise direction. The idea behind the forcing builds upon the existing
technique of the spanwise wall oscillation, and exploits the convective nature
of the flow to achieve an unsteady interaction with turbulence.
  The analysis takes advantage of the equivalent laminar flow, that is solved
analytically to show that the energetic cost of the forcing is unaffected by
turbulence. In a turbulent flow, the alternate forcing is found to behave
similarly to the oscillating wall; in particular an optimal wavelength is found
that yields a maximal reduction of turbulent drag. The energetic performance is
significantly improved, with more than 50% of maximum friction saving at large
intensities of the forcing, and a net energetic saving of 23% for smaller
intensities.
  Such a steady, wall-based forcing may pave the way to passively interacting
with the turbulent flow to achieve drag reduction through a suitable
distribution of roughness, designed to excite a selected streamwise wavelength.
