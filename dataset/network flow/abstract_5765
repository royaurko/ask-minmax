We review recent results on the topological properties of two spatial
scale-free networks, the inherent structure and Apollonian networks. The
similarities between these two types of network suggest an explanation for the
scale-free character of the inherent structure networks. Namely, that the
energy landscape can be viewed as a fractal packing of basins of attraction.
