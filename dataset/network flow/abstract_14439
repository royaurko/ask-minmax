Two-fluid flowing equilibrium configurations of a helicity-driven spherical
torus (HD-ST) are numerically determined by using the combination of the finite
difference and the boundary element methods. It is found from the numerical
results that electron fluids near the central conductor are tied to an external
toroidal field and ion fluids are not. The magnetic configurations change from
the high-$q$ HD-ST ($q$>1) with paramagnetic toroidal field and low-$\beta$
(volume average $\beta$ value, ($<\beta>\approx$ 2 %) through the
helicity-driven spheromak and RFP to the ultra low-$q$ HD-ST (0<q<1) with
diagmagnetic toroidal field and high-$\beta$ ($\beta\approx 18\%) as the
external toroidal field at the inner edge region decreases and reverses the
sign. The two-fluid effecs are more significant in this equilibrium transition
when the ion diagmagnetic drift is dominant in the flowing two-fluid.
