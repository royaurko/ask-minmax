3D Braginskii turbulence simulations show that the energy flux in the
core/edge transition region of a tokamak is strongly modulated - locally and on
average - by radially propagating, nearly coherent sinusoidal or solitary zonal
flows. The flows are geodesic acoustic modes (GAM), which are primarily driven
by the Stringer-Winsor term. The flow amplitude together with the average
anomalous transport sensitively depend on the GAM frequency and on the magnetic
curvature acting on the flows, which could be influenced in a real tokamak,
e.g., by shaping the plasma cross section. The local modulation of the
turbulence by the flows and the excitation of the flows are due to wave-kinetic
effects, which have been studied for the first time in a turbulence simulation.
