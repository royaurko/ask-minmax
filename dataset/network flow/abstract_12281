We introduce a framework for network analysis based on random walks on
directed acyclic graphs where the probability of passing through a given node
is the key ingredient. We illustrate its use in evaluating the mutual influence
of nodes and discovering seminal papers in a citation network. We further
introduce a new similarity metric and test it in a simple personalized
recommendation process. This metric's performance is comparable to that of
classical similarity metrics, thus further supporting the validity of our
framework.
