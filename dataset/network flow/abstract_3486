This paper addresses the problem of reliable transmission of data through a
sensor network. We focus on networks rapidly deployed in harsh environments.
For these networks, important design requirements are fast data transmission
and rapid network setup, as well as minimized energy consumption for increased
network lifetime. We propose a novel broadcasting solution that accounts for
the interference impact and the congestion level of the channel, in order to
improve robustness, energy consumption and delay performance, compared to a
benchmark routing protocol, the GRAB algorithm. Three solutions are proposed:
P-GRAB, a probabilistic routing algorithm for interference mitigation, U-GRAB,
a utility-based algorithm that adjusts to real-time congestion and UP-GRAB, a
combination of P-GRAB and U-GRAB. It is shown that P-GRAB provides the best
performance for geometry-aware networks while the U-GRAB approach is the best
option for unreliable and unstable networks.
