We calculate numerically the renormalization group (RG) flow of lattice QCD
in two-coupling space, $(\beta_{1\times 1},\beta_{1\times 2})$. This is the
first explicit calculation of the RG flow of SU(3) gauge theory. From the RG
flow,a renormalized trajectory (RT) is revealed. Its behavior is consistent
with the strong coupling expansion near the high-temperature fixed point.
Actions with $(\beta_{1\times 1},\beta_{1\times 2})$ are studied; the lattice
spacing is evaluated by measuring the string tension from the heavy quark
potential. Recovery of the rotational symmetry is studied as a function of the
ratio $\beta_{1\times 2} / \beta_{1\times 1}$.
