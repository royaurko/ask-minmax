Estimating of the overhead costs of building construction projects is an
important task in the management of these projects. The quality of construction
management depends heavily on their accurate cost estimation. Construction
costs prediction is a very difficult and sophisticated task especially when
using manual calculation methods. This paper uses Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) approach to develop a parametric cost-estimating model for site overhead
cost in Egypt. Fifty-two actual real-life cases of building projects
constructed in Egypt during the seven year period 2002-2009 were used as
training materials. The neural network architecture is presented for the
estimation of the site overhead costs as a percentage from the total project
price.
