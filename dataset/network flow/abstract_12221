This work proposes a new architecture, called Global Authentication Scheme
for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (GASMAN), for fully distributed and self-organized
authentication. In this paper apart from describing all the GASMAN components,
special emphasis is placed on proving that it fulfils every requirement of a
secure distributed authentication scheme, including limited physical protection
of broadcast medium, frequent route changes caused by mobility, lack of
structured hierarchy, etc. Furthermore, an extensive analysis through
simulation experiments in different scenarios is described and discussed.
