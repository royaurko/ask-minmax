We prove that minimal area-preserving flows locally given by a smooth
Hamiltonian on a closed surface of any genus are typically (in the
measure-theoretical sense) not mixing. The result is obtained by considering
special flows over interval exchange transformations under roof functions with
symmetric logarithmic singularities and proving absence of mixing for a full
measure set of interval exchange transformations.
