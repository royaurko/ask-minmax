We address the question of constructing explicitly quasi-uniform codes from
groups. We determine the size of the codebook, the alphabet and the minimum
distance as a function of the corresponding group, both for abelian and some
nonabelian groups. Potentials applications comprise the design of almost affine
codes and non-linear network codes.
