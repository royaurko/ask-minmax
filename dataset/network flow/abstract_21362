We demonstrate the possibility to efficiently split the near-field heat flux
exchanged between graphene nano-disks by tuning their doping. This result paves
the way for the developement of an active control of propagation directions for
heat fluxes exchanged in near-field throughout integrated nanostructures
networks.
