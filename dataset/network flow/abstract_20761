P2P IPTV applications arise on the Internet and will be massively used in the
future. It is expected that P2P IPTV will contribute to increase the overall
Internet traffic. In this context, it is important to measure the impact of P2P
IPTV on the networks and to characterize this traffic. Dur- ing the 2006 FIFA
World Cup, we performed an extensive measurement campaign. We measured network
traffic generated by broadcasting soc- cer games by the most popular P2P IPTV
applications, namely PPLive, PPStream, SOPCast and TVAnts. From the collected
data, we charac- terized the P2P IPTV traffic structure at different time
scales by using wavelet based transform method. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work, which presents a complete multiscale analysis of the
P2P IPTV traffic. Our results show that the scaling properties of the TCP
traffic present periodic behavior whereas the UDP traffic is stationary and
lead to long- range depedency characteristics. For all the applications, the
download traffic has different characteristics than the upload traffic. The
signaling traffic has a significant impact on the download traffic but it has
negligible impact on the upload. Both sides of the traffic and its granularity
has to be taken into account to design accurate P2P IPTV traffic models.
