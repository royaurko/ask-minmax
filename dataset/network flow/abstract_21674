We study SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature in the framework of
the functional renormalization group. We concentrate on the effective potential
for the Polyakov loop which serves as an order parameter for confinement. In
this first status report, we focus on the behaviour of the effective
Polyakov-loop potential at high temperatures. In addition to the standard
perturbative result, our findings provide information about the ``RG improved''
backreactions of Polyakov-loop fluctuations on the potential. We demonstrate
that these fluctuations establish the convexity of the effective potential.
