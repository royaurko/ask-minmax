Recently, it has been shown that the max flow capacity can be achieved in a
multicast network using network coding. In this paper, we propose and analyze a
more realistic model for wireless random networks. We prove that the capacity
of network coding for this model is concentrated around the expected value of
its minimum cut. Furthermore, we establish upper and lower bounds for wireless
nodes using Chernoff bound. Our experiments show that our theoretical
predictions are well matched by simulation results.
