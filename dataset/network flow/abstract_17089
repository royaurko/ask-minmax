The ability of information processing in biologically motivated Boolean
networks is of interest in recent information theoretic research. One measure
to quantify this ability is the well known mutual information. Using Fourier
analysis we show that canalizing functions maximize the mutual information
between an input variable and the outcome of the function. We proof our result
for Boolean functions with uniform distributed as well as product distributed
input variables.
