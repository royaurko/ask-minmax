The levelling of short-wave irregularities on a thin film of fluid is
primarily due to the action of surface tension. Surface tension gradients are
often created by a number of different factor including evaporation, thermal
gradients or deposition of surfactants. Lubrication theory, which ignores
inertia terms in favour of viscous terms, produces a system of two nonlinear
pde's for the unsteady flow of a thin viscous Newtonian fluid
containing an insoluble surfactant. A complex model, which systematically
includes all relevant effects to these pde's, is developed using
centre manifold techniques. The benefits of using these techniques to develop
accurate models are in their application. Subtle variations in parameters or
assumptions are able to be catered for by including or deleting the relevant
terms rather than having to redevelop these models.
