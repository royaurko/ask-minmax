We consider the problem of controlling marginally stable linear systems using
bounded control inputs for networked control settings in which the
communication channel between the remote controller and the system is
unreliable. We assume that the states are perfectly observed, but the control
inputs are transmitted over a noisy communication channel. Under mild
hypotheses on the noise introduced by the control communication channel and
large enough control contributority, we construct a control policy that renders the
state of the closed-loop system mean-square bounded.
