Ad hoc networks are the special networks formed for specific applications.
Operating in ad-hoc mode allows all wireless devices within range of each other
to discover and communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion without involving central
access points. Many routing protocols like AODV, DSR etc have been proposed for
these networks to find an end to end path between the nodes. These routing
protocols are prone to attacks by the malicious nodes. There is a need to
detect and prevent these attacks in a timely manner before destruction of
network services.
