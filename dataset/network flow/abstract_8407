Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is one of the most challenging research area in the
field of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, in this research we propose a flexible,
simple, and scalable design for revocation list distribution in VANET, which
will reduce channel overhead and eliminate the use of CRL. Also it will
increase the security of the network and helps in identifying the adversary
vehicles.
