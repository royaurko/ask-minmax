The neural network approach is applied to search for the Z'-boson within the
LEP2 data set for e+ e- -> e+ e- scattering process. In the course of the
analysis, the data set is reduced by 20 percent. The axial-vector and vector
couplings of the Z' are estimated at 95 percent CL within a two-parameter fit.
The mass is determined to be 0.53-1.05 TeV. Comparisons with other results are
given.
