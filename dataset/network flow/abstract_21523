The properties of dense granular systems are analyzed from a hydrodynamical
point of view, based on conservation laws for the particle number density and
linear momentum. We discuss averaging problems associated with the nature of
such systems and the peculiarities of the sources of noise. We perform a
quantitative study by combining analytical methods and numerical results
obtained by ensemble-averaging of data on creep during compaction and molecular
dynamics simulations of convective flow. We show that numerical integration of
the hydrodynamic equations gives the expected evolution for the time-dependent
fields.
