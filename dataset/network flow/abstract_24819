We perform a multifractal analysis of the evolution of London's street
network from 1786 to 2010. First, we show that a single fractal dimension,
commonly associated with the morphological description of cities, does not su
ce to capture the dynamics of the system. Instead, for a proper
characterization of such a dynamics, the multifractal spectrum needs to be
considered. Our analysis reveals that London evolves from an inhomogeneous
fractal structure, that can be described in terms of a multifractal, to a
homogeneous one, that converges to monofractality. We argue that London's
multifractal to monofracal evolution might be a special outcome of the
constraint imposed on its growth by a green belt. Through a series of
simulations, we show that multifractal objects, constructed through di usion
limited aggregation, evolve towards monofractality if their growth is
constrained by a non-permeable boundary.
