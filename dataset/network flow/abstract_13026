In this paper we examine the supersymmetric Lee-Yang model in the presence of
boundaries. We determine the reflection factors for the Neveu-Schwarz type
boundary conditions from the reduction of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon model
and check them by using Boundary Truncated Conformal Space Approach in the
massless case. We explore the boundary renormalisation groups flows using
boundary TBA and TCSA.
