We investigate the population dynamics in generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors
models with an arbitrary number of species $N$. We show, for the first time,
that spiral patterns with $N$-arms may develop both for odd and even $N$, in
particular in models where a bidirectional predation interaction of equal
strength between all species is modified to include one N-cyclic predator-prey
rule. While the former case gives rise to an interface network with Y-type
junctions obeying the scaling law $L \propto t^{1/2}$, where $L$ is the
characteristic length of the network and $t$ is the time, the later can lead to
a population network with $N$-armed spiral patterns, having a roughly constant
characteristic length scale. We explicitly demonstrate the connection between
interface junctions and spiral patterns in these models and compute the
corresponding scaling laws. This work significantly extends the results of
previous studies of population dynamics and could have profound implications
for the understanding of biological complexity in systems with a large number
of species.
