We present a method for the calculation of the gravitational back reaction
cutoff on the smallest scales of cosmic string networks taking into account
that not all modes on strings interact with all other modes. This results in a
small scale structure cutoff that is sensitive to the initial spectrum of
perturbations present on strings. From a simple model, we compute the cutoffs
in radiation- and matter-dominated universes.
