The jet-counterjet system of the closest radio-loud active galaxy Centaurus A
(Cen A) can be studied with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) on
unprecedented small linear scales of ~0.018pc. These high-resolution
observations provide essential information on jet emission and propagation
within the inner parsec of an AGN jet. We present the results of a kinematic
study performed within the framework of the Southern-hemisphere AGN monitoring
program TANAMI. Over 3.5years, the evolution of the central-parsec jet
structure of Cen A was monitored with VLBI. These observations reveal complex
jet dynamics which are well explained by a spine-sheath structure supported by
the downstream acceleration occurring where the jet becomes optically thin.
Both moving and stationary jet features are tracked. A persistent local minimum
in surface brightness suggests the presence of an obstacle interrupting the jet
flow, which can be explained by the interaction of the jet with a star at a
distance of ~0.4pc from the central black hole. We briefly discuss possible
implications of such an interaction regarding the expected neutrino and
high-energy emission and the effect on a putative planet.
