When is it safe to approximate a complicated random Boolean network (RBN) as
a simplified, easier to model RBN? When can static measures of network
structure be reliably used to infer the network's dynamics? This simple
experiment tests the ability of disjoint modular RBNs to approximate the
dynamics of progressively more interconnected RBNs, while characterizing the
performance of both static and dynamic measures of modularity as both break
down. We find that, at least in the small networks investigated, the Newman
2004 [1] measure of static modularity performs as well as a more complex
dynamic measure of modularity, and that the progressively increasing failure of
one tracks that of the other. The dynamic measure is based on the Hamming
distance of attractor schemata in rewired networks from those in perfectly
modular networks. This result holds for a range of p-values.
