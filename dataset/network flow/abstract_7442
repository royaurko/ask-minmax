Based on a detailed microscopic test scenario motivated by recent empirical
studies of single-vehicle data, several cellular automaton models for traffic
flow are compared. We find three levels of agreement with the empirical data:
1) models that do not reproduce even qualitatively the most important empirical
observations,
  2) models that are on a macroscopic level in reasonable agreement with the
empirics, and 3) models that reproduce the empirical data on a microscopic
level as well.
  Our results are not only relevant for applications, but also shed new light
on the relevant interactions in traffic flow.
