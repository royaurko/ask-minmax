In a one-dimensional model for a turbulent aerosol (inertial particles
suspended in a random flow) we compute the distributions of particle-velocity
gradients and the rate of caustic formation at finite but small Kubo numbers
Ku, for arbitrary Stokes numbers St. Our results are consistent with those
obtained earlier in the limit of small Ku and and large St, such that Ku^2 St
remains constant. We show how finite-time correlations and non-ergodic effects
influence the inertial-particle dynamics at finite but small Kubo numbers.
