We describe some of the recent progress in our understanding of the dynamics
of strongly correlated gluons at high parton densities. Computations in the
Color Glass Condensate effective field theory provide a good description of
inclusive and semi-inclusive final states in DIS, p+p and p+A collisions at
small x. In nucleus-nucleus collisions, they provide an ab initio description
of entropy generation, decoherence, isotropization and the onset of
hydrodynamic flow. The successful description of a wide range of phenomena from
RHIC to LHC is outlined and possibilities for more stringent tests noted.
