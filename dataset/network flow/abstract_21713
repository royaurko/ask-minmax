We consider unitary Virasoro minimal models on the disk with Cardy boundary
conditions and discuss deformations by certain relevant boundary operators,
analogous to tachyon condensation in string theory. Concentrating on the least
relevant boundary field, we can perform a perturbative analysis of
renormalization group fixed points. We find that the systems always flow
towards stable fixed points which admit no further (non-trivial) relevant
perturbations. The new conformal boundary conditions are in general given by
superpositions of 'pure' Cardy boundary conditions.
