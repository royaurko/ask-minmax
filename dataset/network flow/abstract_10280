J/psi suppression induced by color screening of its constituent quarks was
proposed 26 years ago as a signature of the formation of a quark gluon plasma
in heavy-ion collisions. Recent results from ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions exhibit
a smaller suppression with respect to previous measurements at the SPS and
RHIC. The study of azimuthal anisotropy in particle production gives
information on the collective hydrodynamic expansion at the early stage of the
fireball, where the matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions is
expected to be in a deconfined state. In particular, J/psi elliptic flow v2 is
important to test the degree of thermalization of heavy quarks. Together with
the production yields, the elliptic flow is a powerful observable to address
the question of suppression and regeneration of J/psi in QGP. We present the
first inclusive J/psi elliptic flow measurement performed with the muon
spectrometer of ALICE, in Pb-Pb collisions, at forward rapidity. Integrated and
pT-differential v2 results are presented and a comparison with recent STAR
results and with a parton transport model is also performed.
