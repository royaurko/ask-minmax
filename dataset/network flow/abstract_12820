We have imaged the inner square arcminute of the well known lensing and
cooling flow cluster A2390 (z = 0.23) down to a sensitivity of 65 and 130
microJy at 6.75 and 15 micronmetre, respectively. We report the first evidence
of an active star-forming region in a cooling flow (at those wavelengths) and
strong emission in the mid-IR from lensed galaxies located at z=0.9.
