Anticipating forthcoming observations with the Chandra X-ray telescope, we
describe the continuation of interstellar cooling flows deep into the cores of
elliptical galaxies. Interstellar gas within about r = 50 parsecs from the
massive black hole is heated to T > 1 keV and should be visible unless thermal
heating is diluted by non-thermal pressure. Since our flows are subsonic near
the massive black holes, distributed cooling continues within 300 pc from the
center. Dark, low mass stars formed in this region may be responsible for some
of the mass attributed to central black holes.
