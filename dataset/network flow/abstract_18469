Today's dynamic and iterative development environment brings significant
challenges for software project management. In distributed project settings,
"management by walking around" is no longer an option and project managers may
miss out on key project insights. The TESNA (TEchnical Social Network Analysis)
method and tool aims to provide project managers both a method and a tool for
gaining insights and taking corrective action. TESNA achieves this by analysing
a project's evolving social and technical network structures using data from
multiple sources, including CVS, email and chat repositories. Using pattern
theory, TESNA helps to identify areas where the current state of the project's
social and technical networks conflicts with what patterns suggest. We refer to
such a conflict as a Socio-Technical Structure Clash (STSC). In this paper we
report on our experience of using TESNA to identify STSCs in a corporate
environment through the mining of software repositories. We find multiple
instances of three STSCs (Conway's Law, Code Ownership and Project
Coordination) in many of the on-going development projects, thereby validating
the method and tool that we have developed.
