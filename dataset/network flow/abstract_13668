The holographic renormalization group flows associated with marginally
relevant operators are analyzed. The associated perturbative and
non-perturbative beta-functions are calculated and the consistent scalar
potentials are identified. The presence of a Zamolodchikov metric in the
multiscalar case is shown to affect beta-functions starting at two loops.
