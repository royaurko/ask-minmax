A well-known conjecture of Caratheodory states that the number of umbilic
points on a closed convex surface in ${\mathbb E}^3$ must be greater than one.
In this paper we prove this for $C^{3+\alpha}$-smooth surfaces.
  The Conjecture is first reformulated in terms of complex points on a
Lagrangian surface in $TS^2$, viewed as the space of oriented geodesics in
${\mathbb E}^3$. Here complex and Lagrangian refer to the canonical neutral
Kaehler structure on $TS^2$. We then prove that the existence of a closed
convex surface with only one umbilic point implies the existence of a totally
real Lagrangian hemisphere in $TS^2$, to which it is not possible to attach the
edge of a holomorphic disc.
  The main step in the proof is to establish the existence of a holomorphic
disc with edge contained on any given totally real Lagrangian hemisphere. To
construct the holomorphic disc we utilize mean curvature flow with respect to
the neutral metric. Long-time existence of this flow is proven by a priori
estimates and we show that the flowing disc is asymptotically holomorphic.
Existence of a holomorphic disc is then deduced from Schauder estimates.
