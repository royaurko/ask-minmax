Dynamic Position Location and Tracking (PL&T) is proposed deploying the
integrated approach of zone finding and triangulation using two friendly nodes
equipped with Steered Directional Antenna (DA) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks
(MANET). This approach allows the system to use only two references instead of
a typical 3 references for a straight triangulation. Moreover, the performance
of the proposed algorithm with references using directional antennas shows
significant improvement over triangulation using references with
Omnidirectional antennas as the beam power is concentrated. However, dynamic
switching of reference nodes is frequently required as the target moves outside
the predicted zone. This paper presents a better tracking accuracy in using
proposed dynamic PL&T as compared to other PL&T techniques. The multipath
fading is also addressed with the use of KV transform coding technique which
uses forward error correction and sample interleaving achieves greater than 90%
tracking accuracy with BERs of 10-6 or better.
