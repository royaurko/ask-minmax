Wireless mesh networks have seen a real progress due of their implementation
at a low cost. They present one of Next Generation Networks technologies and
can serve as home, companies and universities networks. In this paper, we
propose and discuss a new multi-objective model for nodes deployment
optimization in Multi-Radio Multi-Channel Wireless Mesh Networks. We exploit
the trade-off between network cost and the overall network performance. This
optimization problem is solved simultaneously by using a meta-heuristic method
that returns a non-dominated set of near optimal solutions. A comparative study
was driven to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model.
