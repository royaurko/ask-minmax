Mismatching problem between the source and target noisy corpora severely
hinder the practical use of the machine-learning-based voice activity detection
(VAD). In this paper, we try to address this problem in the transfer learning
prospective. Transfer learning tries to find a common learning machine or a
common feature subspace that is shared by both the source corpus and the target
corpus. The denoising deep neural network is used as the learning machine.
Three transfer techniques, which aim to learn common feature representations,
are used for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the transfer learning schemes on the mismatch problem.
