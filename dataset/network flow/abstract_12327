The Barab\'asi-Bianconi (BB) fitness model can be solved by a mapping between
the original network growth model to an idealized bosonic gas. The well-known
transition to Bose-Einstein condensation in the latter then corresponds to the
emergence of "super-hubs" in the network model. Motivated by the preservation
of the scale-free property, thermodynamic stability and self-duality, we
generalize the original extensive mapping of the BB fitness model by using the
nonextensive Kaniadakis k-distribution. Through numerical simulation and
mean-field calculations we show that deviations from extensivity do not
compromise qualitative features of the phase transition. Analysis of the
critical temperature yields a monotonically decreasing dependence on the
nonextensive parameter k.
