In this work we have used computer models of social-like networks to show by
extensive numerical simulations that cooperation in evolutionary games can
emerge and be stable on this class of networks. The amounts of cooperation
reached are at least as much as in scale-free networks but here the population
model is more realistic. Cooperation is robust with respect to different
strategy update rules, population dynamics, and payoff computation. Only when
straight average payoff is used or there is high strategy or network noise does
cooperation decrease in all games and disappear in the Prisoner's Dilemma.
