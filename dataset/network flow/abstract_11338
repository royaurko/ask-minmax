For wireless networks with multiple sources, an omnidirectional relay scheme
is developed, where each node can simultaneously relay different messages in
different directions. This is accomplished by the decode-and-forward relay
strategy, with each relay binning the multiple messages to be transmitted, in
the same spirit of network coding. Specially for the all-source all-cast
problem, where each node is an independent source to be transmitted to all the
other nodes, this scheme completely eliminates interference in the whole
network, and the signal transmitted by any node can be used by any other node.
For networks with some kind of symmetry, assuming no beamforming is to be
performed, this omnidirectional relay scheme is capable of achieving the
maximum achievable rate.
