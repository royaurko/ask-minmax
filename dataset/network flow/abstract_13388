This paper considers multiprocessor task scheduling in a multistage hybrid
flow-shop environment. The problem even in its simplest form is NP-hard in the
strong sense. The great deal of interest for this problem, besides its
theoretical complexity, is animated by needs of various manufacturing and
computing systems. We propose a new approach based on limited discrepancy
search to solve the problem. Our method is tested with reference to a proposed
lower bound as well as the best-known solutions in literature. Computational
results show that the developed approach is efficient in particular for
large-size problems.
