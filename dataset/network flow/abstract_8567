With the explosive growth in communication and network technologies, there is
a great demand of IPv6 addressing scheme. However, the modern operating systems
has option for this and with the development of IPv6 which removes the
limitations imposed by IPv4 and provides the large number of address space. In
this paper, contributors have considered the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing
Protocol and presented a scenario for its performance evaluation in IPv6
networks and obtained results are highly considerable for the short distance of
communication and don't represent any problem of performance degradation while
sending or receiving the data.
