We study the radial flow of retarded Green's function of energy-momentum
tensor and $R$-current of dual gauge theory in presence of generic higher
derivative terms in bulk Lagrangian. These are first order non-linear Riccati
equations. We solve these flow equations analytically and obtain second order
transport coefficients of boundary plasma. This way of computing transport
coefficients has an advantage over usual Kubo approach. The non-linear equation
turns out to be a linear first order equation when we study the Green's
function perturbatively in momentum. We consider several examples including
$Weyl^4$ term and generic four derivative terms in bulk. We also study the flow
equations for $R$-charged black holes and obtain exact expressions for second
order transport coefficients for dual plasma in presence of arbitrary chemical
potentials. Finally we obtain higher derivative corrections to second order
transport coefficients of boundary theory dual to five dimensional gauge
supergravity.
