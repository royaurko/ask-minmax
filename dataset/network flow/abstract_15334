Maximum a Posteriori assignment (MAP) is the problem of finding the most
probable instantiation of a set of variables given the partial evidence on the
other variables in a Bayesian network. MAP has been shown to be a NP-hard
problem [22], even for constrained networks, such as polytrees [18]. Hence,
previous approaches often fail to yield any results for MAP problems in large
complex Bayesian networks. To address this problem, we propose AnnealedMAP
algorithm, a simulated annealing-based MAP algorithm. The AnnealedMAP algorithm
simulates a non-homogeneous Markov chain whose invariant function is a
probability density that concentrates itself on the modes of the target
density. We tested this algorithm on several real Bayesian networks. The
results show that, while maintaining good quality of the MAP solutions, the
AnnealedMAP algorithm is also able to solve many problems that are beyond the
reach of previous approaches.
