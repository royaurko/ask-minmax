Within the framework of a multi-phase transport model, harmonic flows $v_n$
(n = 2, 3 and 4) are investigated for Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =
200 GeV and Pb + Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The
event-by-event geometry fluctuations significantly contribute to harmonic
flows. Triangular flow ($v_3$) originates from initial triangularity
($\epsilon_3$) and is developed by partonic interactions. The conversion
efficiency ($v_n/\epsilon_n$) decreases with harmonic order and increases with
partonic interaction cross section. A mass ordering in the low $p_T$ region and
number of constitute quark scaling in the middle $p_T$ region seem to work
roughly for $n$-th harmonic flows at both energies. All features of harmonic
flows show similar qualitative behaviors at RHIC and LHC energies, which
implies that the formed partonic matters are similar at the two energies.
