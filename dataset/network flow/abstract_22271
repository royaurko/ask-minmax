The elementary processes taking place in the formation of charged particles
and their flow in the ionization chamber are considered. On the basic of
particles and charges balance a differential equation describing the
distribution of current densities in the ionization chamber volume is obtained.
As a result of the differential equation solution an analytical form of the
current-voltage characteristic of a parallel-plane ionization chamber is
obtained.
