We study the dynamics of epidemic spreading processes aimed at spontaneous
dissemination of information updates in populations with complex connectivity
patterns. The influence of the topological structure of the network in these
processes is studied by analyzing the behavior of several global parameters
such as reliability, efficiency and load. Large scale numerical simulations of
update spreading processes show that while networks with homogeneous
connectivity patterns permit a higher reliability, scale-free topologies allow
for a better efficiency.
