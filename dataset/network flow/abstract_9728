We analyze the controllability of a two-layer network, where driver nodes can
be chosen only from one layer. Each layer contains a scale-free network with
directed links. The dynamics of nodes depends on the incoming links from other
nodes (reputation dynamics). We find that the controllable part of the network
is larger when choosing peripherial nodes to connect the two layers. The
control is as efficient for peripherial nodes as driver nodes as it is for more
central nodes. If we assume a cost to utilize nodes which is proportional to
their degree, utilizing peripherial nodes to connect the two layers or to act
as driver nodes is not only the most cost-efficient solution, it is also the
one that gives us the best performance in controlling the two-layer network.
