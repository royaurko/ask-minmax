Our aim here is to plead for the significance of cultural considerations of
overlapping inter-attitudinal patterns right next to well established
structural considerations of interorganizational networks based on overlapping
membership patterns. In particular, we examine how the analytical sociological
methodological incorporation of cultural attributes or attitudes might enhance
our understanding of structural community categorizations in
interorganizational networks. For this purpose, we analyze data of the
International Peace Protest Survey (IPPS) on the world-wide peace protests of
February, 15, 2003, in order to manifest the added value offered by the
consideration of the culture-structure duality in participation studies.
