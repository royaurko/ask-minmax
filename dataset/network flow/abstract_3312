We consider the K\"ahler Ricci flow on a smooth minimal model of general
type, we show that if the Ricci curvature is uniformly bounded below along the
K\"ahler-Ricci flow, then the diameter is uniformly bounded. As a corollary we
show that under the Ricci curvature lower bound assumption, the
Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the flow is homeomorphic to the canonical model.
Moreover, we can give a purely analytic proof of a recent result of
Tosatti-Zhang (\cite{TZ}) that if the canonical line bundle $K_X$ is big and
nef, but not ample, then the flow is of Type IIb.
