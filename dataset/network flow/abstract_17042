A recently proposed method of constructing seismic networks from 'record
breaking events' from the earthquake catalog of California (Phy. Rev. E, 77
6,066104, 2008) was successfull in establishing causal features to seismicity
and arrive at estimates for rupture length and its scaling with magnitude. The
results of our implementation of this procedure on the earthquake catalog of
Japan establishes the robustness of the procedure. Additionally, we find that
the temporal distributions are able to detect heterogeneties in the seismicity
of the region.
