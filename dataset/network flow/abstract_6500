We consider the problem of multicasting information from a source to a set of
receivers over a network where intermediate network nodes perform randomized
network coding operations on the source packets. We propose a channel model for
the non-coherent network coding introduced by Koetter and Kschischang in [6],
that captures the essence of such a network operation, and calculate the
capacity as a function of network parameters. We prove that use of subspace
coding is optimal, and show that, in some cases, the capacity-achieving
distribution uses subspaces of several dimensions, where the employed
dimensions depend on the packet length. This model and the results also allow
us to give guidelines on when subspace coding is beneficial for the proposed
model and by how much, in comparison to a coding vector approach, from a
capacity viewpoint. We extend our results to the case of multiple source
multicast that creates a virtual multiple access channel.
