We consider the holographic duality for a generic bulk theory of scalars
coupled to gravity. By studying the fluctuations around Poincare invariant
backgrounds with non-vanishing scalars, with the scalar and metric boundary
conditions considered as being independent, we obtain all one- and two-point
functions in the dual renormalization group flows of the boundary field theory.
Operator and vev flows are explicitly distinguished by means of the physical
condensates. The method is applied to the GPPZ and Coulomb branch flows, and
field theoretical expectations are confirmed.
