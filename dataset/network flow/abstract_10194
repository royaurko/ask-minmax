High-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at the LHC may exhibit collective
phenomena such as elliptic flow. We study this issue using DIPSY, a brand-new
Monte Carlo event generator which features almost-NLO BFKL dynamics and
describes the transverse shape of the proton including all fluctuations. We
predict the eccentricity of the collision as a function of the multiplicity and
estimate the magnitude of elliptic flow. We suggest that flow can be signaled
by a sign change in the four-particle azimuthal correlation.
