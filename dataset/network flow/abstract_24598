We theoretically study the transport properties of self-propelled particles
on complex structures, such as motor proteins on filament networks. A general
master equation formalism is developed to investigate the persistent motion of
individual random walkers, which enables us to identify the contributions of
key parameters: the motor processivity, and the anisotropy and heterogeneity of
the underlying network. We prove the existence of different dynamical regimes
of anomalous motion, and that the crossover times between these regimes as well
as the asymptotic diffusion coefficient can be increased by several orders of
magnitude within biologically relevant control parameter ranges. In terms of
motion in continuous space, the interplay between stepping strategy and
persistency of the walker is established as a source of anomalous diffusion at
short and intermediate time scales.
