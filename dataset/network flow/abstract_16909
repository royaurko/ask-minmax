We propose the first deterministic algorithm that tolerates up to $f$
byzantine faults in $3f+1$-sized networks and performs in the asynchronous
CORDA model. Our solution matches the previously established lower bound for
the semi-synchronous ATOM model on the number of tolerated Byzantine robots.
Our algorithm works under bounded scheduling assumptions for oblivious robots
moving in a uni-dimensional space.
