We discuss several parametrizations of the space of circular planar
electrical networks. For any circular planar network we associate a canonical
minimal network with the same response matrix, called a "standard" network. The
conductances of edges in a standard network can be computed as a biratio of
Pfaffians constructed from the response matrix. The conductances serve as
coordinates that are compatible with the cell structure of circular planar
networks in the sense that one conductance degenerates to 0 or infinity when
moving from a cell to a boundary cell.
  We also show how to test if a network is well-connected by checking that
$\binom{n}{2}$ minors of the response matrix are positive; Colin de Verdi\`ere
had previously shown that it was sufficient to check the positivity of
exponentially many minors. For standard networks with m edges, positivity of
the conductances can be tested by checking the positivity of m+1 Pfaffians.
