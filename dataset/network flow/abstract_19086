In wireless networks, where each node transmits independently of other nodes
in the network (the ALOHA protocol), the expected delay experienced by a packet
until it is successfully received at any other node is known to be infinite for
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) model with node locations
distributed according to a Poisson point process. Consequently, the information
velocity, defined as the limit of the ratio of the distance to the destination
and the time taken for a packet to successfully reach the destination over
multiple hops, is zero, as the distance tends to infinity. A nearest neighbor
distance based power control policy is proposed to show that the expected delay
required for a packet to be successfully received at the nearest neighbor can
be made finite. Moreover, the information velocity is also shown to be non-zero
with the proposed power control policy. The condition under which these results
hold does not depend on the intensity of the underlying Poisson point process.
