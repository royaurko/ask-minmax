Prior attempts to construct the gravity dual of boost-invariant flow of N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theory plasma suffered from apparent curvature
singularities in the late time expansion. This Letter shows how these problems
can be resolved by a different choice of expansion parameter. The calculations
presented correctly reproduce the plasma energy-momentum tensor within the
framework of second order viscous hydrodynamics.
