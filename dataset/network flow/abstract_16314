Recently Vishik anti-fast dynamo theorem, has been tested against
non-stretching flux tubes [Phys Plasmas 15 (2008)]. In this paper, another
anti-dynamo theorem, called Cowling's theorem, which states that axisymmetric
magnetic fields cannot support dynamo action, is carefully tested against thick
tubular and curved Riemannian untwisted flows, as well as thin flux tubes in
diffusive and diffusionless media. In the non-diffusive media the Cowling's
theorem is not violated in thin Riemann-flat untwisted flux tubes, where the
Frenet curvature is negative. Nevertheless the diffusion action in the thin
flux tube leads to a a dynamo action driven by poloidal flows as shown by Love
and Gubbins (Geophysical Res.) in the context of geodynamos. Actually it is
shown that a slow dynamo action is obtained. In this case the Frenet and
Riemann curvature still vanishes. In the case of magnetic filaments in
diffusive media dynamo action is obtained when the Frenet scalar curvature is
negative. Since the Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of the
Frenet curvature of the magnetic flux tube axis, this result can be analogous
to a recent result obtained by Chicone, Latushkin and Smith, which states that
geodesic curvature in compact Riemannian manifolds can drive dynamo action in
the manifold. It is also shown that in absence of diffusion, magnetic energy
does not grow but magnetic toroidal magnetic field can be generated by the
poloidal field, what is called a plasma dynamo.
