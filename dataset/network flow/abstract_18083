In this work we compare social clusters with spin clusters and compare
different properties. We also try to compare phase changes in market and labor
stratification with phase changes of spin clusters. Then we compare the
requisites for redrawing the boundaries of social clusters with respect to
energy minimization and efficiency. We finally do a simulation experiment and
show that by choosing suitable link matrices for agents and attributes of the
same and of different agents it is possible to have at the same time behavior
similar to chaos or punctuated equilibrium in some attributes or fairly regular
oscillations of preferences for other attributes, using greatest utility or
efficiency as a criterion for change in conflicting social networks with
different agents having different preferences with respect to the attributes in
the agent himself or with similar attributes in other agents.
