The network of networks(NON) research is focused on studying the properties
of n interdependent networks which is ubiquitous in the real world. Identifying
the influential nodes in the network of networks is theoretical and practical
significance. However, it is hard to describe the structure property of the NON
based on traditional methods. In this paper, a new method is proposed to
identify the influential nodes in the network of networks base on the evidence
theory. The proposed method can fuse different kinds of relationship between
the network components to constructed a comprehensive similarity network. The
nodes which have a big value of similarity are the influential nodes in the
NON. The experiment results illustrate that the proposed method is reasonable
and significant
