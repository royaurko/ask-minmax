We investigate individual packet delay in a model of data networks with
table-free, partial table and full table routing. We present analytical
estimation for the average packet delay in a network with small partial routing
table. Dependence of the delay on the size of the network and on the size of
the partial routing table is examined numerically. Consequences for network
scalability are discussed.
