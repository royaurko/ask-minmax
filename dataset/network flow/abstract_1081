We present a methodology to extract the backbone of complex networks based on
the weight and direction of links, as well as on nontopological properties of
nodes. We show how the methodology can be applied in general to networks in
which mass or energy is flowing along the links. In particular, the procedure
enables us to address important questions in economics, namely, how control and
wealth are structured and concentrated across national markets. We report on
the first cross-country investigation of ownership networks, focusing on the
stock markets of 48 countries around the world. On the one hand, our analysis
confirms results expected on the basis of the literature on corporate control,
namely, that in Anglo-Saxon countries control tends to be dispersed among
numerous shareholders. On the other hand, it also reveals that in the same
countries, control is found to be highly concentrated at the global level,
namely, lying in the hands of very few important shareholders. Interestingly,
the exact opposite is observed for European countries. These results have
previously not been reported as they are not observable without the kind of
network analysis developed here.
