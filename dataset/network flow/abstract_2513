This is the Handbook of Network Analysis, the companion article to the KONECT
(Koblenz Network Collection) project. This project is intended to collect
network datasets, analyse them systematically, and provide both datasets and
the underlying network analysis code to researchers. This article outlines the
project, gives all definitions used within the project, reviews all network
statistics used, reviews all network plots used, and gives a brief overview of
the API used by KONECT.
