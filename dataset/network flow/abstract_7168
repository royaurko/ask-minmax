Systems composed of distinct complex networks are present in many real-world
environments, from society to ecological systems. In the present paper, we
propose a network model obtained as a consequence of interactions between two
species (e.g. predator and prey). Fields are produced and sensed by the
individuals, defining spatio-temporal patterns which are strongly affected by
the attraction intensity between individuals from the same species. The
dynamical evolution of the system, including the change of individuals between
different clusters, is investigated by building two complex networks having the
individuals as nodes. In the first network, the edge weight is given by the
Euclidean distance between every two individuals and, in the case of the second
network, by the amount of time two individuals stay close one another. A third
network is obtained from the two previous networks whose nodes correspond to
the spatially congruent groups. The system evolves to an organized state where
Gaussian and scale-free-like strength distributions emerge, respectively, in
the predator and prey networks. Such a different connectivity is mainly a
consequence of preys elimination. Some configurations favor the survival of
preys or higher efficiency of predator activity.
