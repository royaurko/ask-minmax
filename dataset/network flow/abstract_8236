We find that a wide class of developing and decaying networks has scaling
properties similar to those that were recently observed by Barab\'{a}si and
Albert in the particular case of growing networks. The networks considered here
evolve according to the following rules: (i) Each instant a new site is added,
the probability of its connection to old sites is proportional to their
connectivities. (ii) In addition, (a) new links between some old sites appear
with probability proportional to the product of their connectivities or (b)
some links between old sites are removed with equal probability.
