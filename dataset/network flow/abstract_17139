A network of locally interacting agents can be thought of as performing a
distributed computation. But not all computations can be faithfully
distributed. This paper investigates which global, linear transformations can
be computed using local rules, i.e., rules which rely solely on information
from adjacent nodes in a network. The main result states that a linear
transformation is computable in finite time using local rules if and only if
the transformation has positive determinant. An optimal control problem is
solved for finding the local interaction rules, and simulations are performed
to elucidate how optimal solutions can be obtained.
