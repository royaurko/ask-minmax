Network codes designed specifically for distributed storage systems have the
potential to provide dramatically higher storage efficiency for the same
availability. One main challenge in the design of such codes is the exact
repair problem: if a node storing encoded information fails, in order to
maintain the same level of reliability we need to create encoded information at
a new node. One of the main open problems in this emerging area has been the
design of simple coding schemes that allow exact and low cost repair of failed
nodes and have high data rates. In particular, all prior known explicit
constructions have data rates bounded by 1/2.
  In this paper we introduce the first family of distributed storage codes that
have simple look-up repair and can achieve arbitrarily high rates. Our
constructions are very simple to implement and perform exact repair by simple
XORing of packets. We experimentally evaluate the proposed codes in a realistic
cloud storage simulator and show significant benefits in both performance and
reliability compared to replication and standard Reed-Solomon codes.
