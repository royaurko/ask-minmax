Clear signs of excess dileptons above the known sources were found at the SPS
since long. However, a real clarification of these observations was only
recently achieved by NA60, measuring dimuons with unprecedented precision in
158A GeV, In-In collisions. The excess mass spectrum in the region M<1 GeV is
consistent with a dominant contribution from pi+pi- -> rho -> mu+mu-
annihilation. The associated rho spectral function shows a strong broadening,
but essentially no shift in mass. In the region M>1 GeV, the excess is found to
be prompt, not due to enhanced charm production. The inverse slope parameter
Teff associated with the transverse momentum spectra rises with mass up to the
rho, followed by a sudden decline above. While the initial rise, coupled to a
hierarchy in hadron freeze-out, points to radial flow of a hadronic decay
source, the decline above signals a transition to a low-flow source, presumably
of partonic origin. The mass spectra show at low transverse momenta the steep
rise towards low masses characteristic for Planck-like radiation. The
polarization of the excess referred to the Collins Soper frame is found to be
isotropic. All observations are consistent with the interpretation of the
excess as thermal radiation.
