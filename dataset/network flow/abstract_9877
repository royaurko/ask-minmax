This paper describes the measurement of elliptic flow for charged particles
in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV using the PHOBOS detector at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The measured azimuthal anisotropy is
presented over a wide range of pseudorapidity for three broad collision
centrality classes for the first time at this energy. Two distinct methods of
extracting the flow signal were used in order to reduce systematic
uncertainties. The elliptic flow falls sharply with increasing eta at 200 GeV
for all the centralities studied, as observed for minimum-bias collisions at
sqrt(sNN)=130 GeV.
