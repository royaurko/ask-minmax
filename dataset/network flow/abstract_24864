Wireless communication is a basis of the vision of connected and automated
vehicles (CAVs). Given the heterogeneity of both wireless communication
technologies and CAV applications, one question that is critical to technology
road-mapping and policy making is which communication technology is more
suitable for a specific CAV application. Focusing on the technical aspect of
this question, we present a multi-scale spatiotemporal perspective of wireless
communication technologies as well as canonical CAV applications in active
safety, fuel economy and emission control, vehicle automation, and vehicular
infotainment. Our analysis shows that CAV applications in the regime of small
spatiotemporal scale communication requirements are best supported by V2V
communications, applications in the regime of large spatiotemporal scale
communication requirements are better supported by cellular communications, and
applications in the regime of small spatial scale but medium-to-large temporal
scale can be supported by both V2V and cellular communications and provide the
opportunity of leveraging heterogeneous communication resources.
