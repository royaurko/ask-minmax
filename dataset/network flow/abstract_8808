We prove under suitable hypotheses that convergence of integral varifolds
implies convergence of associated mod 2 flat chains and subsequential
convergence of associated integer-multiplicity rectifiable currents. The
convergence results imply restrictions on the kinds of singularities that can
occur in mean curvature flow.
