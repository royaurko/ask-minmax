In the first half of the paper we construct a Morse-type theory on certain
spaces of braid diagrams. We define a topological invariant of closed positive
braids which is correlated with the existence of invariant sets of parabolic
flows defined on discretized braid spaces. Parabolic flows, a type of
one-dimensional lattice dynamics, evolve singular braid diagrams in such a way
as to decrease their topological complexity; algebraic lengths decrease
monotonically. This topological invariant is derived from a Morse-Conley
homotopy index and provides a gloablization of `lap number' techniques used in
scalar parabolic PDEs.
  In the second half of the paper we apply this technology to second order
Lagrangians via a discrete formulation of the variational problem. This
culminates in a very general forcing theorem for the existence of infinitely
many braid classes of closed orbits.
