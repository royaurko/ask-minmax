We investigate the dynamics of an homogenous distribution of galaxies moving
under the cosmological expansion through Euler-Poisson equations system. The
solutions are interpreted with the aim of understanding the cosmic velocity
fields in the Local Super Cluster, and in particular the presence of a bulk
flow. Among several solutions, we shows a planar kinematics with constant
(eternal) and rotational distortion, the velocity field is not potential.
