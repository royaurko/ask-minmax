Two-ray ground reflection model has been widely used as the propagation model
to investigate the performance of an ad hoc network. But two-ray model is too
simple to represent a real world network. A more realistic model namely
shadowing propagation model has been used in this investigation. Under
shadowing propagation model, a mobile node may receive a packet at a signal
level that is below a required threshold level. This low signal level affects
the routing protocol as well as the medium access control protocol of a
network. An analytical model has been presented in this paper to investigate
the shadowing effects on the network performance. The analytical model has been
verified via simulation results. Simulation results show that the performance
of a network becomes very poor if shadowing propagation model is used in
compare to the simple two-ray model. Two solutions have also been proposed in
this paper to overcome the effects of shadowing. One solution is a physical
layer solution and the other one is a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer
solution. Simulation results show that these two solutions reduce the shadowing
effect and improve network performance.
