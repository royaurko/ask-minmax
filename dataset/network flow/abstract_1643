We consider the problem of finding the global optimum of a real-valued
complex polynomial on a compact set defined by real-valued complex polynomial
inequalities. It reduces to solving a sequence of complex semidefinite
programming relaxations that grow tighter and tighter thanks to D'Angelo's and
Putinar's Positivstellenstatz discovered in 2008. In other words, the Lasserre
hierarchy may be transposed to complex numbers. We propose a method for
exploiting sparsity and apply the complex hierarchy to problems with several
thousand complex variables. These problems consist of computing optimal power
flows in the European high-voltage transmission network.
