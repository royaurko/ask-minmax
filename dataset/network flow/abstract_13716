In nuclear collisions at the LHC large number of hard partons are created in
initial partonic interactions, so that it is reasonable to suppose that they do
not thermalise immediately but deposit their energy and momentum later into the
evolving hot quark-gluon fluid. We show that this mechanism leads to
contribution to flow anisotropies at all orders which are non-negligible and
should be taken into account in realistic simulations.
