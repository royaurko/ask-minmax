We study how to spread $k$ tokens of information to every node on an $n$-node
dynamic network, the edges of which are changing at each round. This basic {\em
gossip problem} can be completed in $O(n + k)$ rounds in any static network,
and determining its complexity in dynamic networks is central to understanding
the algorithmic limits and capabilities of various dynamic network models. Our
focus is on token-forwarding algorithms, which do not manipulate tokens in any
way other than storing, copying and forwarding them.
  We first consider the {\em strongly adaptive} adversary model where in each
round, each node first chooses a token to broadcast to all its neighbors
(without knowing who they are), and then an adversary chooses an arbitrary
connected communication network for that round with the knowledge of the tokens
chosen by each node. We show that $\Omega(nk/\log n + n)$ rounds are needed for
any randomized (centralized or distributed) token-forwarding algorithm to
disseminate the $k$ tokens, thus resolving an open problem raised
in~\cite{kuhn+lo:dynamic}. The bound applies to a wide class of initial token
distributions, including those in which each token is held by exactly one node
and {\em well-mixed} ones in which each node has each token independently with
a constant probability.
  We also show several upper bounds in varying models.
