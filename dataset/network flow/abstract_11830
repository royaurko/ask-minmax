We propose a two-layer mobile sink and static sensor network (MSSSN)
architecture for large scale wireless sensor networks. The top layer is a
mobile ad hoc network of resource-rich sink nodes while the bottom layer is a
network of static resource-constrained sensor nodes. The MSSSN architecture can
be implemented at a lower cost with the currently available IEEE 802.11 devices
that only use a single halfduplex transceiver. Each sink node is assigned a
particular region to monitor and collect data. A sink node moves to the
vicinity of the sensor nodes (within a few hops) to collect data. The collected
data is exchanged with peer mobile sinks. Thus, the MSSSN architecture provides
scalability, extends sensor lifetime by letting them operate with limited
transmission range and provides connectivity between isolated regions of sensor
nodes. In order to provide fault tolerance, more than one mobile sink could be
collecting data from a given region or a mobile sink could collect data from
more than one region. In the later half of the paper, we discuss several open
research issues that need to be addressed while implementing the MSSSN
architecture.
