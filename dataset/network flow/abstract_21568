The magneto-thermal conductivity kappa is calculated for the vortex state of
UPd_2Al_3 by assuming horizontal gap nodes. The Green's function method we
employed takes into account the effects of supercurrent flow and Andreev
scattering on the quasiparticles due to Abrikosov's vortex lattice order
parameter. The calculated angular dependence of kappa_{yy} for field rotation
theta_0 in the ac-plane depends strongly on field strength H, impurity
scattering, anisotropy of the Fermi velocity, and temperature. For finite
temperatures and the clean unitary scattering limit we get qualitative
agreement with recent experiments for all four proposed gap functions having
horizontal line nodes at ck_z = 0, pi/4, and pi/2.
