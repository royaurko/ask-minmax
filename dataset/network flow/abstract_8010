In this paper we compare a classical finite-difference and a high order
finite- volume scheme for barotropic ocean flows. We compare the schemes with
respect to their accuracy, stability, and study various outflow and inflow
boundary conditions. We apply the schemes to the problem of eddy formation in
shelf slope jets along the Ormen Lange section of the Norwegian shelf. Our
results strongly confirm the development of mesoscale eddies caused by
instability of the flows.
