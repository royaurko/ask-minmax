Suppression of the transient energy growth in subcritical plane Poiseuille
flow via feedback control is addressed. It is assumed that the time derivative
of any of the velocity components can be imposed at the walls as control input,
and that full-state information is available. We show that it is impossible to
design a linear state-feedback controller that leads to a closed-loop flow
system without transient energy growth.
  In a subsequent step, full-state feedback controllers -- directly targeting
the transient growth mechanism -- are designed, using a procedure based on a
Linear Matrix Inequalities approach. The performance of such controllers is
analyzed first in the linear case, where comparison to previously proposed
linear-quadratic optimal controllers is made; further, transition thresholds
are evaluated via Direct Numerical Simulations of the controlled
three-dimensional Poiseuille flow against different initial conditions of
physical interest, employing different velocity components as wall actuation.
The present controllers are effective in increasing the transition thresholds
in closed loop, with varying degree of performance depending on the initial
condition and the actuation component employed.
