Considering a wireless sensor network whose nodes are distributed randomly
over a given area, a probability model for the network lifetime is provided.
Using this model and assuming that packet generation follows a Poisson
distribution, an analytical expression for the complementary cumulative density
function (ccdf) of the lifetime is obtained. Using this ccdf, one can
accurately find the probability that the network achieves a given lifetime. It
is also shown that when the number of sensors, $N$, is large, with an error
exponentially decaying with $N$, one can predict whether or not a certain
lifetime can be achieved. The results of this work are obtained for both
multi-hop and single-hop wireless sensor networks and are verified with
computer simulation. The approaches of this paper are shown to be applicable to
other packet generation models and the effect of the area shape is also
investigated.
