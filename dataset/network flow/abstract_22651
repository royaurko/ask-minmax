We consider newtonian dynamics of $N$ charged particles on the circle with
nearest neigbour interaction with Coulomb repulsive potential $r^{-1}$ . Also
there is an external accelerating force which is nonzero only on a small part
of the circle. We construct homogeneous solutions where the velocities of all
particles are approximately equal and their density is approximately uniform.
This gives a qualitative mathematical model for some features of the direct
electric current (DC), in agreement with a suggestion by R. Feynman.
