We present a numerical study on the dynamics of imbibition fronts in porous
media using a pipe network model. This model quantitatively reproduces the
anomalous scaling behavior found in imbibition experiments [Phys. Rev. E {\bf
52}, 5166 (1995)]. Using simple scaling arguments, we derive a new identity
among the scaling exponents in agreement with the experimental results.
