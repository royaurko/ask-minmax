Recent development of network structure analysis shows that it plays an
important role in characterizing complex system of many branches of sciences.
Different from previous network centrality measures, this paper proposes the
notion of topological centrality (TC) reflecting the topological positions of
nodes and edges in general networks, and proposes an approach to calculating
the topological centrality. The proposed topological centrality is then used to
discover communities and build the backbone network. Experiments and
applications on research network show the significance of the proposed
approach.
