The fast development of the Self-Organizing Network (SON) technology in
mobile networks renders the problem of coordinating SON functionalities
operating simultaneously critical. SON functionalities can be viewed as control
loops that may need to be coordinated to guarantee conflict free operation, to
enforce stability of the network and to achieve performance gain. This paper
proposes a distributed solution for coordinating SON functionalities. It uses
Rosen's concave games framework in conjunction with convex optimization. The
SON functionalities are modeled as linear Ordinary Differential Equation
(ODE)s. The stability of the system is first evaluated using a basic control
theory approach. The coordination solution consists in finding a linear map
(called coordination matrix) that stabilizes the system of SON functionalities.
It is proven that the solution remains valid in a noisy environment using
Stochastic Approximation. A practical example involving three different SON
functionalities deployed in Base Stations (BSs) of a Long Term Evolution (LTE)
network demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed method.
