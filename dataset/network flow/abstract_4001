We consider the radial structure of radiatively inefficient hydrodynamic
accretion flows around black holes. We show that low-viscosity flows consist of
two zones: an outer convection-dominated zone and an inner advection-dominated
zone. The transition between these two zones occurs at ~50 Schwarzschild radii.
