This letter confirms the existence of heat transfer enhancement (HTE) and
reduction (HTR) in turbulent natural convection with polymer additives. HTE and
HTR were numerically predicted by Benzi et al.(PRL, 104, 024502, 2010) in
homogenous turbulent convection, but experiments by Ahlers & Nikolaenko(PRL,
104, 034503, 2010) in turbulent natural convection observed HTR only. Using
direct numerical simulation of natural convection, the present study reconciles
earlier numerical and experimental work on the basis of the dominant role of
polymer length in the polymer dynamics in extensional flows.
