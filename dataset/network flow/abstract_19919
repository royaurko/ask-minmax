In this paper, the results of an international collaborative test case
relative to the production of a Direct Numerical Simulation and Lagrangian
Particle Tracking database for turbulent particle dispersion in channel flow at
low Reynolds number are presented. The objective of this test case is to
establish a homogeneous source of data relevant to the general problem of
particle dispersion in wall-bounded turbulence. Different numerical approaches
and computational codes have been used to simulate the particle-laden flow and
calculations have been carried on long enough to achieve a statistically-steady
condition for particle distribution. In such stationary regime, a comprehensive
database including both post-processed statistics and raw data for the fluid
and for the particles has been obtained. The complete datasets can be
downloaded from the web at http://cfd.cineca.it/cfd/repository/. In this paper,
the most relevant velocity statistics (for both phases) and particle
distribution statistics are discussed and benchmarked by direct comparison
between the different numerical predictions.
