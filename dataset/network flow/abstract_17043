It is shown how to construct a clique graph in which properties of cliques of
a fixed order in a given graph are represented by vertices in a weighted graph.
Various definitions and motivations for these weights are given. The detection
of communities or clusters is used to illustrate how a clique graph may be
exploited. In particular a benchmark network is shown where clique graphs find
the overlapping communities accurately while vertex partition methods fail.
