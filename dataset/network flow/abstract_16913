We present a generic threshold model for the co-evolution of the structure of
a network and the state of its nodes. We focus on regular directed networks and
derive equations for the evolution of the system toward its absorbing state. It
is shown that the system displays a transition from a connected phase to a
fragmented phase that depends on its initial configuration. Computer
simulations are performed and confirm the theoretical predictions.
