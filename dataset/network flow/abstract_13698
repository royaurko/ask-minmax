A numerical and systematic parameter study of three-dimensional vesicle
electrohydrodynamics is presented to investigate the effects of different fluid
and membrane properties. The dynamics of vesicles in the presence of DC
electric fields is considered, both in the presence and absence of linear shear
flow. For suspended vesicles it is shown that the conductivity ratio and
viscosity ratio between the interior and exterior fluids, as well as the
vesicle membrane capacitance, substantially affect the minimum electric field
strength required to induce a full Prolate-Oblate-Prolate transition.In
addition, there exists a critical electric field strength above which a vesicle
will no longer tumble when exposed to linear shear flow.
