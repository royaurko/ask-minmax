Disruption from service caused by DDoS attacks is an immense threat to
Internet today. These attacks can disrupt the availability of Internet services
completely, by eating either computational or communication resources through
sheer volume of packets sent from distributed locations in a coordinated manner
or graceful degradation of network performance by sending attack traffic at low
rate. In this paper, we describe a novel framework that deals with the
detection of variety of DDoS attacks by monitoring propagation of abrupt
traffic changes inside ISP Domain and then characterizes flows that carry
attack traffic. Two statistical metrics namely, Volume and Flow are used as
parameters to detect DDoS attacks. Effectiveness of an anomaly based detection
and characterization system highly depends on accuracy of threshold value
settings. Inaccurate threshold values cause a large number of false positives
and negatives. Therefore, in our scheme, Six-Sigma and varying tolerance factor
methods are used to identify threshold values accurately and dynamically for
various statistical metrics. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used
as simulation testbed to validate effectiveness of proposed approach. Different
attack scenarios are implemented by varying total number of zombie machines and
at different attack strengths. The comparison with volume-based approach
clearly indicates the supremacy of our proposed system.
