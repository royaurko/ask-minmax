By using antitrace map method, we investigate the light transmission for a
generalized Fibonacci multilayers. Analytical results are obtained for
transmission coefficients in some special cases. We find that the transmission
coefficients possess two-cycle property or six-cycle property. The cycle
properties of the trace and antitrace are also obtained.
