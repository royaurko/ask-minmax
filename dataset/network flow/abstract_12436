We consider large-scale sensor networks with n nodes, out of which k are in
possession, (e.g., have sensed or collected in some other way) k information
packets. In the scenarios in which network nodes are vulnerable because of, for
example, limited energy or a hostile environment, it is desirable to
disseminate the acquired information throughout the network so that each of the
n nodes stores one (possibly coded) packet and the original k source packets
can be recovered later in a computationally simple way from any (1 + \epsilon)k
nodes for some small \epsilon > 0.
  We developed two distributed algorithms for solving this problem based on
simple random walks and Fountain codes. Unlike all previously developed
schemes, our solution is truly distributed, that is, nodes do not know n, k or
connectivity in the network, except in their own neighborhoods, and they do not
maintain any routing tables. In the first algorithm, all the sensors have the
knowledge of n and k. In the second algorithm, each sensor estimates these
parameters through the random walk dissemination. We present analysis of the
communication/transmission and encoding/decoding complexity of these two
algorithms, and provide extensive simulation results as well
