Experimental investigations of plastic flow have demonstrated temporal
intermittency as deformation proceeds in a series of intermittent bursts with
scale-free size distribution. In the present investigation, a corresponding
spatial intermittency is demonstrated for plastic flow of KCl single crystals.
Deformation bursts lead to large surface steps with a height distribution that
is consistent with the distribution of strain increments in deformation of
micro-columns, and the energy distribution of acoustic emission bursts observed
in deformation of macroscopic single crystal samples of a wide class of
materials.
