Assuming that observers located inside the Universe measure a time flow which
is different from the time appearing in the Friedmann-Lemaitre equation, and
determining this time flow such that the Universe always appears flat to these
observers, we derive a simple cosmological model which allows to explain the
velocity dispersions of galaxies in galaxy clusters without introducing dark
matter. It also solves the horizon problem without recourse to inflation.
Moreover, it explains the present acceleration of the expansion without any
resort to dark energy and provides a good fit to the observations of distant
supernovae. Depending on the present value of the matter-energy density, we
calculate an age of the Universe between 15.4 and 16.5 billion years,
significantly larger than the 13.7 billion years of the standard Lambda-CDM
model. Our model has a slower expansion rate in the early epochs, thus leaving
more time for the formation of structures such as stars and galaxies.
