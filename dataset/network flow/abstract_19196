The structure of return spillovers is examined by constructing Granger
causality networks using daily closing prices of 40 stock markets from 2nd
January 2006 to 31st December 2013. The data is properly aligned to take into
account non-synchronous trading effects. By conducting a rolling window spatial
probit analysis on the set of edges of Granger causality networks, we confirm
the significance of temporal proximity and preferential attachment on edge
creation. We extend the analysis by incorporating market specific factors, such
as market capitalization, turnover and volatility.
