Modular structure is ubiquitous among complex networks. We note that most
such systems are subject to multiple structural and functional constraints,
e.g., minimizing the average path length and the total number of links, while
maximizing robustness against perturbations in node activity. We show that the
optimal networks satisfying these three constraints are characterized by the
existence of multiple subnetworks (modules) sparsely connected to each other.
In addition, these modules have distinct hubs, resulting in an overall
heterogeneous degree distribution.
