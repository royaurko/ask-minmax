Deep neural networks trained on large-scale dataset can learn transferable
features that promote learning multiple tasks for inductive transfer and
labeling mitigation. As deep features eventually transition from general to
specific along the network, a fundamental problem is how to exploit the
relationship structure across different tasks while accounting for the feature
transferability in the task-specific layers. In this work, we propose a novel
Deep Relationship Network (DRN) architecture for multi-task learning by
discovering correlated tasks based on multiple task-specific layers of a deep
convolutional neural network. DRN models the task relationship by imposing
matrix normal priors over the network parameters of all task-specific layers,
including higher feature layers and classifier layer that are not transferable
safely. By jointly learning the transferable features and task relationships,
DRN is able to alleviate the dilemma of negative-transfer in the feature layers
and under-transfer in the classifier layer. Empirical evidence shows that DRN
yields state-of-the-art classification results on standard multi-domain object
recognition datasets.
