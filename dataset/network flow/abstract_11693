We are proposing a tool able to gather information on social networks from
narrative texts. Its name is CHAPLIN, CHAracters and PLaces Interaction
Network, implemented in VB.NET. Characters and places of the narrative works
are extracted in a list of raw words. Aided by the interface, the user selects
names out of them. After this choice, the tool allows the user to enter some
parameters, and, according to them, creates a network where the nodes are the
characters and places, and the edges their interactions. Edges are labelled by
performances. The output is a GV file, written in the DOT graph scripting
language, which is rendered by means of the free open source software Graphviz.
