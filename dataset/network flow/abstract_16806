It is shown that optimal network plans can be obtained, naturally, as a limit
of easier problems of point allocations. These problems are obtained by
minimizing the mass transportation on the set of atomic measures of prescribed
number of atoms. Each of these problems can be solved by minimizing a function
of a finite, prescribed number of variables.
