We examine whether the breakdown in elliptic flow quark number scaling
observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energy scan is related
to the turning off of deconfinement by testing the hypothesis that
hydrodynamics and parton coalescence always apply, but are obscured, at lower
energies, by variations in the widths of quark and anti-quark rapidity
distribution. We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling
in elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the
absence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a
coalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the
greater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of
partons from the highly flowing midrapidity region. Intriguingly, purely
hadronic dynamics has a similar dependence of baryon-anti-baryons $v_2$ as
purely partonic dynamics, again because antibaryons tend to come from regions
where the deviation of the system from hydrodynamic behavior is at its
smallest. The opposite trend observed in experiment is therefore an indication
that we might be misunderstanding the origin of $v_2$. We finish by discussing
possible explanations of this, and suggest experimental measurements capable of
clarifying the situation.
