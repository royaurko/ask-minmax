In this paper we investigate the dependency of characteristic distance on
energy dissipation model. Both the many-to-one and any-to-any communication
paradigm have been presented for performance analysis. Characteristic distance
has been derived for three different cases. This study will be useful for
designing an energy-efficient wireless network where nodes are
energy-constrained.
