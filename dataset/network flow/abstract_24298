Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) is the IEEE TaskGroupi solution for
the security loop holes present in the already widely deployed 802.11 hardware.
It is a set of algorithms that wrap WEP to give the best possible solution
given design constraints such as paucity of the CPU cycles, hardwiring of the
WEP encryption algorithm and software upgrade dependent. Thus, TKIP is
significantly more difficult and challenging to implement and optimise than
WEP. The objective of this research is to examine the cost and benefit of TKIP
security mechanisms and optimise its implementation to reduce security overhead
for better performance. We propose a modified TKIP (MoTKIP) with improved
packet encapsulation and decapsulation procedure that reduces computation and
packet overhead in classic TKIP substantially and optimises total wireless
network throughput rates.
