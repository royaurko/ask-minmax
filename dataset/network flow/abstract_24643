With the rapid development in wide area networks and low cost, powerful
computational resources, grid computing has gained its popularity. With the
advent of grid computing, space limitations of conventional distributed systems
can be overcome and underutilized computing resources at different locations
around the world can be put to distributed jobs. Workload and resource
management is the main key grid services at the service level of grid
infrastructures, out of which load balancing in the main concern for grid
developers. It has been found that load is the major problem which server
faces, especially when the number of users increases. A lot of research is
being done in the area of load management. This paper presents the various
mechanisms of load balancing in grid computing so that the readers will get an
idea of which algorithm would be suitable in different situations. Keywords:
wide area network, distributed computing, load balancing.
