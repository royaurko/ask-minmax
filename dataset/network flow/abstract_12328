In this paper, we perform a business analysis of our hybrid decision
algorithm for the selection of the access in a multi-operator networks
environment. We investigate the ability of the operator to express his strategy
and influence the access selection for his client. In this purpose, we study
two important coefficients of the previously proposed cost function, Wu and
Wop, and show that the value of these coefficients is not arbitrary. Simulation
results show that the value of the ratio Wu/Wop enables a selection decision
respecting operator's strategy and it affects the achieved global profit for
all cooperating operators.
