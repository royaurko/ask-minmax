We present the basic equations for stationary, incompressible resistive MHD
flows in two dimensions. This leads to a system of differential equations for
two flux functions, one elliptic partial differential equation
(Grad-Shafranov-like) for the magnetic flux function and one for the stream
function of the flow. In these equations two potentials appear: one potential
is a generalized pressure. The second potential couples the magnetic and the
flow shear components of the system. With the restriction to flux or at least
line conserving flows one has to solve a modified Ohm's law. For the two
dimensional case these are two coupled differential equations, which represent
the borderline between the resistive but flux conserving (or line conserving)
case, and that of reconnective solutions. We discuss some simplified solutions
of these equations.
