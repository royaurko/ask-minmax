Celebrity games, a new model of network creation games is introduced. The
specific features of this model are that players have different celebrity
weights and that a critical distance is taken into consideration. The aim of
any player is to be close (at distance less than critical) to the others,
mainly to those with high celebrity weights. The cost of each player depends on
the cost of establishing direct links to other players and on the sum of the
weights of those players at a distance greater than the critical distance. We
show that celebrity games always have pure Nash equilibria and we characterize
the family of subgames having connected Nash equilibria, the so called star
celebrity games. Exact bounds for the PoA of non star celebrity games and
bounds of $O(n/\beta + \beta)$ and $\Omega(n/\beta^2)$ for star celebrity games
are provided.
  The upper bound on the PoA can be tightened when restricted to particular
classes of Nash equilibria graphs. We show that the upper bound is $O(n/\beta)$
in the case of 2-edge-connected graphs and 2 in the case of trees.
