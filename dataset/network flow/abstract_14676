The existence of the velocity potential is a direct consequence from the
derivation of the continuity equation from the Schroedinger equation. This
implies that the Cole-Hopf transformation is applicable to the Navier-Stokes
equation for an incompressible flow and allows reducing the Navier-Stokes
equation to the Einstein-Kolmogorov equation, in which the reaction term
depends on the pressure. The solution to the resulting equation, and to the
Navier-Stokes equation as well, can then be written in terms of the Green's
function of the heat equation and is given in the form of an integral mapping.
Such a form of the solution makes bifurcation period doubling possible, i.e.
solutions to transition and turbulent flow regimes in spite of the existence of
the velocity potential.
