The fragility (the abnormally strong temperature dependence of the viscosity)
of highly viscous liquids is shown to have two sources. The first is the
temperature dependence of the barriers between inherent states considered
earlier. The second is the recently discovered asymmetry between the actual
inherent state and its neighbors. One needs both terms for a quantitative
description.
