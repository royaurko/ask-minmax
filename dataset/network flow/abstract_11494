Recently, network coding technique has emerged as a promising approach that
supports reliable transmission over wireless loss channels. In existing
protocols where users have no interest in considering the encoded packets they
had in coding or decoding operations, this rule is expensive and inefficient.
This paper studies the impact of encoded packets in the reliable unicast
network coding via some theoretical analysis. Using our approach, receivers do
not only store the encoded packets they overheard, but also report these
information to their neighbors, such that users enable to take account of
encoded packets in their coding decisions as well as decoding operations.
Moreover, we propose a redistribution algorithm to maximize the coding
opportunities, which achieves better retransmission efficiency. Finally,
theoretical analysis and simulation results for a wheel network illustrate the
improvement in retransmissions efficiency due to the encoded packets.
