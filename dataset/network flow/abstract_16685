The objective of this paper is to propose models enabling to study the
behaviour of Ethernet switch for Networked Control Systems. Two scheduler
policies are analyzed: the static priority and the WRR (Weighted Round Robin).
The modelling work is based on Coloured Petri Nets. A temporal validation step
based on the simulation of these modelling, shows that the obtained results are
near to the expected behaviour of these scheduler policies.
