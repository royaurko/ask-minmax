We propose a 2-temperature radial dynamical model of plasma flow near Sgr A*
and fit the bremsstrahlung emission to extensive quiescent X-Ray Chandra data.
The model extends from several arcseconds to black hole (BH) gravitational
radius, describing the outer accretion flow together with the infalling region.
The model incorporates electron heat conduction, relativistic heat capacity of
particles and feeding by stellar winds. Stellar winds from each star are
considered separately as sources of mass, momentum and energy. Self-consistent
search for the stagnation and sonic points is performed. Most of gas is found
to outflow from the region. The accretion rate is limited to below 1% of Bondi
rate due to the effect of thermal conduction enhanced by entropy production in
a turbulent flow. The X-Ray brightness profile proves too steep near the BH,
thus a synchrotron self-Compton point source is inferred with luminosity
L=3x10^32erg/s. We fit the sub-mm emission from the inner flow, thus aiming at
a single model of Sgr A* accretion suitable at any radius.
