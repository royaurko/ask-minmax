We investigate how nonlinearity and topological disorder affect the energy
relaxation of local kicks in coarse-grained network models of proteins. We find
that nonlinearity promotes long-range, coherent transfer of substantial energy
to specific, functional sites, while depressing transfer to generic locations.
Remarkably, transfer can be mediated by the self-localization of discrete
breathers at distant locations from the kick, acting as efficient
energy-accumulating centers.
