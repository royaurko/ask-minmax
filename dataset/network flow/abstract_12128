We advocate the use of qualitative models in the analysis of large biological
systems. We show how qualitative models are linked to theoretical differential
models and practical graphical models of biological networks. A new technique
for analyzing qualitative models is introduced, which is based on an efficient
representation of qualitative systems. As shown through several applications,
this representation is a relevant tool for the understanding and testing of
large and complex biological networks.
