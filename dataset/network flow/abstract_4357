Wireless Internet in the in-vehicle environment is an evolving reality that
reflects the gradual maturity of wireless technologies. Its complexity is
reflected in the diversity of wireless technologies and dynamically changing
network environments. The ability to adapt to the dynamics of such environments
and to survive transient failures due to network handoffs are fundamentally
important in failure-prone vehicular environments. In this paper we identify
several new issues arising from network heterogeneity in vehicular environments
and concentrate on designing and implementing a network-aware prototype system
that supports HTTP session continuity in the presence of network volatility,
with the emphasis on the following specifically tailored features: (1)
automatic and transparent HTTP failure recovery, (2) network awareness and
adaptation, (3) application-layer preemptive network handoff. Experimental
results gathered from real application environments based on CDMA {\it 1xRTT}
and IEEE 802 networks are presented and analyzed.
