The well-known Edwards-Wilkinson equation with a flow term added exhibits a
smoothing fixed point in addition to the normal EW fixed point. Based on this,
we present a model of sandpiles involving a coupling between fixed and mobile
grains, which then shows the smoothing behaviour that would be expected to
obtain after avalanche propagation.
