We analyze the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in an Ising-like system on
a small-world network. The system, which is subject to the combined action of
noise and an external modulation, can be interpreted as a stylized model of
opinion formation by imitation under the effects of a ``fashion wave''. Both
the amplitude threshold for the detection of the external modulation and the
width of the stochastic-resonance peak show considerable variation as the
randomness of the underlying small-world network is changed.
