The thermodynamics and dynamics of supercooled liquids correlate with their
elasticity. In particular for covalent networks, the jump of specific heat is
small and the liquid is {\it strong} near the threshold valence where the
network acquires rigidity. By contrast, the jump of specific heat and the
fragility are large away from this threshold valence. In a previous work [Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 110, 6307 (2013)], we could explain these behaviors by
introducing a model of supercooled liquids in which local rearrangements
interact via elasticity. However, in that model the disorder characterizing
elasticity was frozen, whereas it is itself a dynamic variable in supercooled
liquids. Here we study numerically and theoretically adaptive elastic network
models where polydisperse springs can move on a lattice, thus allowing for the
geometry of the elastic network to fluctuate and evolve with temperature. We
show numerically that our previous results on the relationship between
structure and thermodynamics hold in these models. We introduce an
approximation where redundant constraints (highly coordinated regions where the
frustration is large) are treated as an ideal gas, leading to analytical
predictions that are accurate in the range of parameters relevant for real
materials. Overall, these results lead to a description of supercooled liquids,
in which the distance to the rigidity transition controls the number of
directions in phase space that cost energy and the specific heat.
