Social trust prediction addresses the significant problem of exploring
interactions among users in social networks. Naturally, this problem can be
formulated in the matrix completion framework, with each entry indicating the
trustness or distrustness. However, there are two challenges for the social
trust problem: 1) the observed data are with sign (1-bit) measurements; 2) they
are typically sampled non-uniformly. Most of the previous matrix completion
methods do not well handle the two issues. Motivated by the recent progress of
max-norm, we propose to solve the problem with a 1-bit max-norm constrained
formulation. Since max-norm is not easy to optimize, we utilize a reformulation
of max-norm which facilitates an efficient projected gradient decent algorithm.
We demonstrate the superiority of our formulation on two benchmark datasets.
