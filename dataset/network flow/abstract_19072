Although the Poisson point process (PPP) has been widely used to model base
station (BS) locations in cellular networks, it is an idealized model that
neglects the spatial correlation among BSs. The present paper proposes the use
of determinantal point process (DPP) to take into account these correlations;
in particular the repulsiveness among macro base station locations. DPPs are
demonstrated to be analytically tractable by leveraging several unique
computational properties. Specifically, we show that the empty space function,
the nearest neighbor function, the mean interference and the
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) distribution have explicit analytical
representations and can be numerically evaluated for cellular networks with DPP
configured BSs. In addition, the modeling accuracy of DPPs is investigated by
fitting three DPP models to real BS location data sets from two major U.S.
cities. Using hypothesis testing for various performance metrics of interest,
we show that these fitted DPPs are significantly more accurate than popular
choices such as the PPP and the perturbed hexagonal grid model.
