Elliptic flow is an interesting probe of the dynamical evolution of the dense
system formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The elliptic flow dependences on transverse
momentum, centrality, and pseudorapidity were measured using data collected by
the PHOBOS detector, which offers a unique opportunity to study the azimuthal
anisotropies of charged particles over a wide range of pseudorapidity. These
measurements are presented, together with an overview of the analysis methods
and a discussion of the results.
