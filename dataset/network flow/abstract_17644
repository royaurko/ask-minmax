Fluctuations of the alpha-effect which break equatorial symmetry of the flow
in the kinematic Parker's dynamo are considered. We show, that even small (a
few percents) fluctuation can leed to the substantial assymmetry of the
magnetic field in the hemispheres as well as the propagation of the dynamo wave
through the equator plane. We also consider how change of the dynamo number can
be used to explain different regimes of magnetic field generation in geodynamo.
