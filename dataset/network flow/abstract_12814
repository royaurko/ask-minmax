This study investigates the influence of lattice structure in evolutionary
games. The snowdrift games is considered in networks with high clustering
coefficients, that use four different strategy-updating. Analytical conjectures
using pair approximation were compared with the numerical results. Results
indicate that general statements asserting that the lattice structure enhances
cooperation are misleading.
