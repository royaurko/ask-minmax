In this paper, we study video streaming over wireless networks with network
coding capabilities. We build upon recent work, which demonstrated that network
coding can increase throughput over a broadcast medium, by mixing packets from
different flows into a single packet, thus increasing the information content
per transmission. Our key insight is that, when the transmitted flows are video
streams, network codes should be selected so as to maximize not only the
network throughput but also the video quality. We propose video-aware
opportunistic network coding schemes that take into account both (i) the
decodability of network codes by several receivers and (ii) the importance and
deadlines of video packets. Simulation results show that our schemes
significantly improve both video quality and throughput.
