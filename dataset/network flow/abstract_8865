We consider a system of partial differential equations describing the steady
flow of a compressible heat conducting Newtonian fluid in a three-dimensional
channel with inflow and outflow part. We show the existence of a strong
solution provided the data are close to a constant, but nontrivial flow with
sufficiently large dissipation in the energy equation.
