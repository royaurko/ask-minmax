We study certain symplectic quotients of n-fold products of complex
projective m-space by the unitary group acting diagonally. After studying
nonemptiness and smoothness these quotients we construct the action-angle
variables, defined on an open dense subset of an integrable Hamiltonian system.
The semiclassical quantization of this system reproduces formulas from the
representation theory of the unitary group.
