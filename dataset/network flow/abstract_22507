We show that the billiard in a regular polygon is weak mixing in almost every
invariant surface, except in the trivial cases which give rise to lattices in
the plane (triangle, square and hexagon). More generally, we study the problem
of prevalence of weak mixing for the directional flow in an arbitrary
non-arithmetic Veech surface, and show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set
of non-weak mixing directions is not full. We also provide a necessary
condition, verified for instance by the Veech surface corresponding to the
billiard in the pentagon, for the set of non-weak mixing directions to have
positive Hausdorff dimension.
