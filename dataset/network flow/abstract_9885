Differential elliptic flow (v_2) for phi mesons and (anti)deuterons (d^bar)d
is measured for Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. The v_2 for phi
mesons follows the trend of lighter pi^+/- and K^+/- mesons, suggesting that
ordinary hadrons interacting with standard hadronic cross sections are not the
primary driver for elliptic flow development. The v_2 values for (d^bar)d
suggest that elliptic flow is additive for composite particles. This further
validation of the universal scaling of v_2 per constituent quark for baryons
and mesons suggests that partonic collectivity dominates the transverse
expansion dynamics.
