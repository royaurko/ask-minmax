Traffic simulations are made more realistic by giving individual drivers
intentions, i.e. an idea of where they want to go. One possible implementation
of this idea is to give each driver an exact pre-computed path, that is, a
sequence of roads this driver wants to follow. This paper shows, in a realistic
road network, how repeated simulations can be used so that drivers can explore
different paths, and how macroscopic quantities such as locations of jams or
network throughput change as a result of this.
