Netsukuku is a P2P network system designed to handle a large number of nodes
with minimal CPU and memory resources. It can be easily used to build a
worldwide distributed, anonymous and not controlled network, separated from the
Internet, without the support of any servers, ISPs or contributority controls. In
this document, we give a generic and non technical description of the Netsukuku
network, emphasizing its main ideas and features.
