We find obstructions to the existence of Einstein metrics of non-negative
sectional curvature on a smooth closed simply connected manifold of any
dimension. The results are achieved by combining the classical Morse theory of
the loop space with a new upper bound for the topological entropy of the
geodesic flow in terms of the curvature tensor.
