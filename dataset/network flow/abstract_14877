The boundary layer flow over a smooth forward-facing stepped plate is studied
with particular emphasis on the delay of the transition to turbulence. The
interaction between the Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves and the base flow over
a single/two forward facing smooth steps is conducted by linear analysis
indicating the amplitude of the T-S waves are attenuated in the boundary layer
over a single smooth plate. Furthermore, we show that two smooth forward facing
steps give rise to a further reduction of the amplitude of the T-S waves. A
direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed for the two smooth forward steps
correlating favourably with the linear analysis and showing that for the
investigated parameters, the K-type transition is inhibited whereas the
turbulence onset of the H-type transition is postponed albeit not suppressed.
Transition is indeed delayed and drag reduced for both these transition
scenarios suggesting smooth forward facing steps could be leveraged as a
passive flow control strategy to delay natural transition.
