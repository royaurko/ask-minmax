We have studied the relaxation and transport properties of a ferrofluid in an
elongational flow. These properties are influenced by the bistable nature of
the potential energy. Bistability comes from the irrotational character of the
flow together with the symmetry of the dipoles. Additionally, the presence of a
constant magnetic field destroys the symmetry of the potential energy
magnetizing the system. We have shown that at a moderate temperature, compared
to the height of the energy barrier, the viscosity decreases with respect to
the value it would have if the potential were stable. This phenomenon is known
as the 'negative viscosity' effect. Thermal motion induces jumps of the
magnetic moment between the two stable states of the system leading to the
aforementioned lowered dissipation effect.
