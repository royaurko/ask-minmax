An overview is given of the study of final state interactions in hadronically
decaying W pairs produced in e^+e^--collisions as it is performed by the four
LEP experiments. Bose-Einstein correlations are investigated by comparing like-
with unlike-signed pairs of pions and/or using the mixed event analysis
technique. Colour reconnection is examined with a method that compares the
particle flow distributions in inter-jet regions.
