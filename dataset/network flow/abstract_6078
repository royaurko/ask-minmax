We explore the synchronization behavior in interdependent systems, where the
one-dimensional (1D) network (the intranetwork coupling strength $J_{\rm I}$)
is ferromagnetically intercoupled (the strength $J$) to the Watts-Strogatz (WS)
small-world network (the intranetwork coupling strength $J_{\rm II}$). In the
absence of the internetwork coupling ($J = 0$), the former network is well
known not to exhibit the synchronized phase at any finite coupling strength,
whereas the latter displays the mean-field transition. Through an analytic
approach based on the mean-field approximation, it is found that for the weakly
coupled 1D network ($J_{\rm I} \ll 1$) the increase of $J$ suppresses
synchrony, because the nonsynchronized 1D network becomes a heavier burden for
the synchronization process of the WS network. As the coupling in the 1D
network becomes stronger, it is revealed by the renormalization group (RG)
argument that the synchronization is enhanced as $J_{\rm I}$ is increased,
implying that the more enhanced partial synchronization in the 1D network makes
the burden lighter. Extensive numerical simulations confirm these expected
behaviors, while exhibiting a reentrant behavior in the intermediate range of
$J_{\rm I}$. The nonmonotonic change of the critical value of $J_{\rm II}$ is
also compared with the result from the numerical RG calculation.
