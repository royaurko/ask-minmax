A general thermodynamic treatment of dissipative relativistic fluids is
introduced, where the temperature four vector is not parallel to the velocity
field of the fluid. Generic stability and kinetic equilibrium points out a
particular thermodynamics, where the temperature vector is parallel to the
enthalpy flow vector and the choice of the flow fixes the constitutive
functions for viscous stress and heat. The linear stability of the homogeneous
equilibrium is proved in a mixed particle-energy flow-frame.
