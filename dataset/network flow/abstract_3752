The transverse momentum technique is used to analyse charged-particle
exclusive data in central C-Ne and C-Cu interactions at energy of 3.7 GeV per
nucleon. Clear evidence of in-plane and out-of-plane (squeeze-out) flow effects
for protons and pi^{-} mesons have been obtained. In C-Ne interactions in-plane
flow of pi^{-} mesons is in the same direction as for the protons, while in
C-Cu collisions pions show antuflow behaviour. From the transverse momentum and
azimuthal distributions of protons and pi^{-} mesons with respect to the
reaction plane, the flow (the measure of the amount of collective transverse
momentum transfer in the reaction plane) and the parameter a_{2} (the measure
of the anisotropic emission strength) have been extracted. The flow effects
increase with the mass of the particle and the mass number of target A_{T}. The
comparison of our in-plane flow results with flow data for various
projectile/target configurations was made using the scaled flow F_{S}=F/(A_{P}
^{1/3}+A_{T}^{1/3}). F_{S} demonstrates a common scaling behaviour for flow
values from different systems. The Quark Gluon String Model (QGSM) was used for
the comparison with the experimental data. The QGSM yields a signature of
in-plane and out-of-plane flow effects in C-ne and C-Cu collisions for protons.
