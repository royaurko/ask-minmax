Myopia in human and animals is caused by the axial elongation of the eye and
is closely linked to the thinning of the sclera which supports the eye tissue.
This thinning has been correlated with the overproduction of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP-2), an enzyme that degrades the collagen structure of
the sclera. In this short paper, we propose a descriptive model of a regulatory
network with hysteresis, which seems necessary for creating oscillatory
behavior in the hybrid model between MMP-2, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. Numerical
results provide insight on the type of equilibria present in the system.
