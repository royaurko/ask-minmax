We prove that every geometric Lorenz attractor has superpolynomial decay of
correlations with respect to the unique SRB measure. Moreover, we prove the
Central Limit Theorem and Almost Sure Invariance Principle for the time-1 map
of the flow of geometric Lorenz attractors. In particular, our results apply to
the classical Lorenz attractor.
