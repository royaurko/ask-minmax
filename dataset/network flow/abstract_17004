This document describes a GPS-based tracking model for position and velocity
states on and off of a road network and it enables parallel, online learning of
state-dependent parameters, such as GPS error, acceleration error, and road
transition probabilities. More specifically, the conditionally linear tracking
model of Ulmke and Koch (2006) is adapted to the Particle Learning framework of
H. F. Lopes, et. al. (2011), which provides a foundation for further
hierarchical Bayesian extensions. The filter is shown to perform well on a real
city road network while sufficiently estimating on and off road transition
probabilities. The model in this paper is also backed by an open-source Java
project.
