We prove a correlation type inequality for spin systems with quenched
symmetric random interactions. This gives monotonicity of the pressure with
respect to the strength of the interaction for a class of spin glass models.
Consequences include existence of the thermodynamic limit for the pressure and
bounds on the surface pressure. We also describe other conjectured inequalities
for such systems.
