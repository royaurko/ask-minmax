The ability to measure, predict, and compute tsunami flow velocities is of
importance in risk assessment and hazard mitigation. Substantial damage can be
done by high velocity flows, particularly in harbors and bays, even when the
wave height is small. Moreover, advancing the study of sediment transport and
tsunami deposits depends on the accurate interpretation and modeling of tsunami
flow velocities and accelerations. Until recently, few direct measurements of
tsunami velocities existed to compare with model results. During the 11 March
2011 Tohoku Tsunami 328 current meters were in place around the Hawaiian
Islands, USA, that captured time series of water velocity in 18 locations, in
both harbors and deep channels, at a series of depths. We compare several of
these velocity records against numerical simulations performed using the
GeoClaw numerical tsunami model, based on solving the depth-averaged shallow
water equations with adaptive mesh refinement, to confirm that this model can
accurately predict velocities at nearshore locations. Model results demonstrate
tsunami current velocity is more spatially variable than wave form or height
and therefore may be a more sensitive variable for model validation.
