We consider a network of event-based systems that use a shared wireless
medium to communicate with their respective controllers. These systems use a
contention resolution mechanism to arbitrate access to the shared network. We
identify sufficient conditions for Lyapunov mean square stability of each
control system in the network, and design event-based policies that guarantee
it. Our stability analysis is based on a Markov model that removes the
network-induced correlation between the states of the control systems in the
network. Analyzing the stability of this Markov model remains a challenge, as
the event-triggering policy renders the estimation error non-Gaussian. Hence,
we identify an auxiliary system that furnishes an upper bound for the variance
of the system states. Using the stability analysis, we design policies, such as
the constant-probability policy, for adapting the event-triggering thresholds
to the delay in accessing the network. Realistic wireless networked control
examples illustrate the applicability of the presented approach.
