We present a study on the spectra and elliptic flow v2 for heavy flavor
(charm and bottom) decayed electrons provided the relative contributions of
charm and bottom hadrons from the PYTHIA calculations. We made a simultaneous
fit to both measured non-photonic electron spectra and v2 distributions. The
results suggest that the bottom contribution is not dominant for electron pt<5
GeV/c in the 200 GeV Au+Au collisions.
