The randomly pinned planar flux line array is supposed to show a phase
transition to a vortex glass phase at low temperatures. This transition has
been examined by using a mapping onto a 2D XY-model with random an\-iso\-tropy
but without vortices and applying a renormalization group treatment to the
replicated Hamiltonian based on the mapping to a Coulomb gas of vector charges.
This renormalization group approach is extended by deriving renormalization
group flow equations which take into account the possibility of a one-step
replica symmetry breaking. It is shown that the renormalization group flow is
unstable with respect to replica asymmetric perturbations and new fixed points
with a broken replica symmetry are obtained. Approaching these fixed points the
system can optimize its free energy contributions from fluctuations on large
length scales; an optimal block size parameter $m$ can be found. Correlation
functions for the case of a broken replica symmetry can be calculated. We
obtain both correlations diverging as $\ln{r}$ and $\ln^2{r}$ depending on the
choice of $m$.
