Using an apparatus that allows superfluid liquid 4He to be in contact with
hcp solid \4he at pressures greater than the bulk melting pressure of the
solid, we have performed experiments that show evidence for 4He mass flux
through the solid and the likely presence of superfluid inside the solid. We
present results that show that a thermomechanical equilibrium in quantitative
agreement with the fountain effect exists between two liquid reservoirs
connected to each other through two superfluid-filled Vycor rods in series with
a chamber filled with solid 4He. We use the thermomechanical effect to induce
flow through the solid and measure the flow rate. On cooling, mass flux appears
near T = 600 mK and rises smoothly as the temperature is lowered. Near T = 75
mK a sharp drop in the flux is present. The flux increases as the temperature
is reduced below 75 mK. We comment on possible causes of this flux minimum.
