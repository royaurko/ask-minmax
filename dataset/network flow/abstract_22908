The bending of bilayer plates is a mechanism which allows for large
deformations via small externally induced lattice mismatches of the underlying
materials. Its mathematical modeling, discussed herein, consists of a nonlinear
fourth order problem with a pointwise isometry constraint. A discretization
based on Kirchhoff quadrilaterals is devised and its $\Gamma$-convergence is
proved. An iterative method that decreases the energy is proposed and its
convergence to stationary configurations is investigated. Its performance, as
well as reduced model capabilities, are explored via several insightful
numerical experiments involving large (geometrically nonlinear) deformations.
