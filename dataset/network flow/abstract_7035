Alfvenic waves are thought to play an important role in coronal heating and
solar wind acceleration. Here we investigate the dissipation of such waves due
to phase mixing at the presence of shear flow and field in the stratified
atmosphere of solar spicules. The initial flow is assumed to be directed along
spicule axis and to vary linearly in the x direction and the equilibrium
magnetic field is taken 2-dimensional and divergence-free. It is determined
that the shear flow and field can fasten the damping of standing Alfven waves.
In spite of propagating Alfven waves, standing Alfven waves in Solar spicules
dissipate in a few periods. As height increases, the perturbed velocity
amplitude does increase in contrast to the behavior of perturbed magnetic
field. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the stratification due to
gravity, shear flow and field are the facts that should be considered in MHD
models in spicules.
