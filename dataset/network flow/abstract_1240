Most popular, modern network simulators, such as ns, are targeted towards
simulating low-level protocol details. These existing simulators are not
intended for simulating large distributed applications with many hosts and many
concurrent connections over long periods of simulated time. We introduce a new
simulator, Narses, targeted towards large distributed applications. The goal of
Narses is to simulate and validate large applications efficiently using network
models of varying levels of detail. We introduce several simplifying
assumptions that allow our simulator to scale to the needs of large distributed
applications while maintaining a reasonable degree of accuracy. Initial results
show up to a 45 times speedup while consuming 28% of the memory used by ns.
Narses maintains a reasonable degree of accuracy -- within 8% on average.
