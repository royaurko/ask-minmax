Two-dimensional driven dissipative flows are generally integrable via a
conservation law that is singular at equilibria. Nonintegrable dynamical
systems are confined to n*3 dimensions. Even driven-dissipative deterministic
dynamical systems that are critical, chaotic or complex have n-1 local
time-independent conservation laws that can be used to simplify the geometric
picture of the flow over as many consecutive time intervals as one likes. Those
conserevation laws generally have either branch cuts, phase singularities, or
both. The consequence of the existence of singular conservation laws for
experimental data analysis, and also for the search for scale-invariant
critical states via uncontrolled approximations in deterministic dynamical
systems, is discussed. Finally, the expectation of ubiquity of scaling laws and
universality classes in dynamics is contrasted with the possibility that the
most interesting dynamics in nature may be nonscaling, nonuniversal, and to
some degree computationally complex.
