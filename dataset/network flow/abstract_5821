We discuss a model accounting for the creation and development of transport
networks based on the Cameo principle which refers to the idea of distribution
of resources, including land, water, minerals, fuel and wealth. We also give an
outlook of the use of random walks as an effective tool for the investigation
of network structures and its functional segmentation. In particular, we have
studied the complex transport network of Venetian canals by means of random
walks.
