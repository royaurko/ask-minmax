We consider a conductance based neural network inspired by the generalized
Integrate and Fire model introduced by Rudolph and Destexhe. We show the
existence and uniqueness of a unique Gibbs distribution characterizing spike
train statistics. The corresponding Gibbs potential is explicitly computed.
These results hold in presence of a time-dependent stimulus and apply therefore
to non-stationary dynamics.
