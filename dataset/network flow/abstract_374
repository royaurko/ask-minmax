Data center networks need to provide low latency, especially at the tail, as
demanded by many interactive applications. To improve tail latency, existing
approaches require modifications to switch hardware and/or end-host operating
systems, making them difficult to be deployed. We present the design,
implementation, and evaluation of RepNet, an application layer transport that
can be deployed today. RepNet exploits the fact that only a few paths among
many are congested at any moment in the network, and applies simple flow
replication to mice flows to opportunistically use the less congested path.
RepNet has two designs for flow replication: (1) RepSYN, which only replicates
SYN packets and uses the first connection that finishes TCP handshaking for
data transmission, and (2) RepFlow which replicates the entire mice flow. We
implement RepNet on {\tt node.js}, one of the most commonly used platforms for
networked interactive applications. {\tt node}'s single threaded event-loop and
non-blocking I/O make flow replication highly efficient. Performance evaluation
on a real network testbed and in Mininet reveals that RepNet is able to reduce
the tail latency of mice flows, as well as application completion times, by
more than 50\%.
