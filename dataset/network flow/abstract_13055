We check that there exists a model structure on the category of flows whose
weak equivalences are the S-homotopy equivalences. As an application, we prove
that the generalized T-homotopy equivalences preserve the branching and merging
homology theories of a flow. The method of proof is completely different from
the one of the third part of this series of papers.
