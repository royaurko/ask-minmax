The kinematics of galaxies with 10 megaparsecs (10 Mpc) of the Milky Way is
investigated using published distances and radial velocities. With respect to
the average Hubble flow (isotropic or simple anisotropic), there is NO
systematic relation between peculiar velocity dispersion and absolute magnitude
over a range of 10 magnitudes; neither is there any apparent variation with
galaxy type or between field and cluster members. There are several possible
explanations for the lack of variation, though all have difficulties: either
there is no relationship between light and mass on these scales, or the
peculiar velocities are not produced by gravitational interaction, or the
background dynamical picture is wrong in some systematic way. The extremely
cold local flow of 40-60 km/s dispersion reported by some contributors is shown to
be an artifact of sparse data, a velocity dispersion of over 100 km/s being
closer to the actual value. Galaxies with a high (positive) radial velocity
have been selected against in studies of this volume, biasing numerical
results.
