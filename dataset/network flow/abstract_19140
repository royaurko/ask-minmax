In this lecture note, we introduce the basic concepts of game theory (GT), a
branch of mathematics traditionally studied and applied in the areas of
economics, political science, and biology, which has emerged in the last
fifteen years as an effective framework for communications, networking, and
signal processing (SP). The real catalyzer has been the blooming of all issues
related to distributed networks, in which the nodes can be modeled as players
in a game competing for system resources. Some relevant notions of GT are
introduced by elaborating on a simple application in the context of wireless
communications, notably the power control in an interference channel (IC) with
two transmitters and two receivers.
