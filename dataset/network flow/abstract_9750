The potential of optimum selection of modulation and forward error correction
(FEC) overhead (OH) in future transparent nonlinear optical mesh networks is
studied from an information theory perspective. Different network topologies
are studied as well as both ideal soft-decision (SD) and hard-decision (HD) FEC
based on demap-and-decode (bit-wise) receivers. When compared to the de-facto
QPSK with 7% OH, our results show large gains in network throughput. When
compared to SD-FEC, HD-FEC is shown to cause network throughput losses of 12%,
15%, and 20% for a country, continental, and global network topology,
respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that most of the theoretically possible
gains can be achieved by using one modulation format and only two OHs. This is
in contrast to the infinite number of OHs required in the ideal case. The
obtained optimal OHs are between 5% and 80%, which highlights the potential
advantage of using FEC with high OHs.
