In epistemic community, people are said to be selected on their knowledge
contribution to the project (articles, codes, etc.) However, the socialization
process is an important factor for inclusion, sustainability as a contributor,
and promotion. Finally, what does matter to be promoted? being a good
contributor? being a good animator? knowing the boss? We explore this question
looking at the process of election for administrator in the English Wikipedia
community. We modeled the candidates according to their revisions and/or social
attributes. These attributes are used to construct a predictive model of
promotion success, based on the candidates's past behavior, computed thanks to
a random forest algorithm.
  Our model combining knowledge contribution variables and social networking
variables successfully explain 78% of the results which is better than the
former models. It also helps to refine the criterion for election. If the
number of knowledge contributions is the most important element, social
interactions come close second to explain the election. But being connected
with the future peers (the admins) can make the difference between success and
failure, making this epistemic community a very social community too.
