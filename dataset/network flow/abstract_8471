We study the application of Tuplix Calculus in modular financial budget
design. We formalize organizational structure using financial transfer
networks. We consider the notion of flux of money over a network, and a way to
enforce the matching of influx and outflux for parts of a network. We exploit
so-called signed attribute notation to make internal streams visible through
encapsulations. Finally, we propose a Tuplix Calculus construct for the
definition of data functions.
