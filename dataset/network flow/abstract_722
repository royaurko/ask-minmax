Fractional transport of particles on a comb structure in the presence of an
inhomogeneous convection flow is studied. The large scale asymptotics is
considered. It is shown that a contaminant spreads superdiffusively in the
direction opposite to the convection flow. Conditions for the realization of
this new effect is discussed in detail.
