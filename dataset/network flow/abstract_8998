Many systems can be described in terms of networks of discrete elements and
their various relationships to one another. A semantic network, or
multi-relational network, is a directed labeled graph consisting of a
heterogeneous set of entities connected by a heterogeneous set of
relationships. Semantic networks serve as a promising general-purpose modeling
substrate for complex systems. Various standardized formats and tools are now
available to support practical, large-scale semantic network models. First, the
Resource Description Framework (RDF) offers a standardized semantic network
data model that can be further formalized by ontology modeling languages such
as RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the recent
introduction of highly performant triple-stores (i.e. semantic network
databases) allows semantic network models on the order of $10^9$ edges to be
efficiently stored and manipulated. RDF and its related technologies are
currently used extensively in the domains of computer science, digital library
science, and the biological sciences. This article will provide an introduction
to RDF/RDFS/OWL and an examination of its suitability to model discrete element
complex systems.
