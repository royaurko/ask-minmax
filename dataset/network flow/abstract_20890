A multicast game is a network design game modelling how selfish
non-cooperative agents build and maintain one-to-many network communication.
There is a special source node and a collection of agents located at
corresponding terminals. Each agent is interested in selecting a route from the
special source to its terminal minimizing the cost. The mutual influence of the
agents is determined by a cost sharing mechanism, which evenly splits the cost
of an edge among all the agents using it for routing. In this paper we provide
several algorithmic and complexity results on finding a Nash equilibrium
minimizing the value of Rosenthal potential. Let n be the number of agents and
G be the communication network. We show that
  - For a given strategy profile s and integer k>=1, there is a local search
algorithm which in time n^{O(k)}|G|^{O(1)} finds a better strategy profile, if
there is any, in a k-exchange neighbourhood of s. In other words, the algorithm
decides if Rosenthal potential can be decreased by changing strategies of at
most k agents;
  - The running time of our local search algorithm is essentially tight: unless
FPT= W[1], for any function f(k), searching of the k-neighbourhood cannot be
done in time f(k)|G|^{O(1)}.
  The key ingredient of our algorithmic result is a subroutine that finds an
equilibrium with minimum potential in 3^n|G|^{O(1)} time. In other words,
finding an equilibrium with minimum potential is fixed-parameter tractable when
parameterized by the number of agents.
