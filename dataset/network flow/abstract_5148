A formalism that simultaneously searches for the monopolar and dipolar
peculiar velocities is presented. The formalism is applied to (1) the Mark III
catalogue, (2) Lauer and Postman's Abell cluster catalogue, and (3) Riess et
al.'s Type Ia supernova sample. The emphasis is drawn to the monopolar peculiar
velocities, i.e., peculiar Hubble flows, within these samples. The samples show
inconsistent peculiar Hubble flows within a depth of $\sim 60h^{-1}$ Mpc.
Beyond a depth of $\sim 80h^{-1}$ Mpc, the Hubble flows of all samples converge
to the global Hubble flow to better than 10% at the $2\sigma$ level. The
results are compared with theoretical predictions. They at face value disfavor
models predicting smaller peculiar velocities such as the tilted Cold Dark
Matter model. Limitations of the catalogues are discussed, so are ways to
improve the catalogues so that an accurate map of Hubble flows in our local
universe can be drawn and be compared with theoretical predictions.
