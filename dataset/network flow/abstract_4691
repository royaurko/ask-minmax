The dynamics of polymers in a random smooth flow is investigated in the
framework of the Hookean dumbbell model. The analytical expression of the
time-dependent probability density function of polymer elongation is derived
explicitly for a Gaussian, rapidly changing flow. When polymers are in the
coiled state the pdf reaches a stationary state characterized by power-law
tails both for small and large arguments compared to the equilibrium length.
The characteristic relaxation time is computed as a function of the Weissenberg
number. In the stretched state the pdf is unstationary and exhibits
multiscaling. Numerical simulations for the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow
confirm the relevance of theoretical results obtained for the delta-correlated
model.
