We propose a simple adaptive-network model describing recent swarming
experiments. Exploiting an analogy with human decision making, we capture the
dynamics of the model by a low-dimensional system of equations permitting
analytical investigation. We find that the model reproduces several
characteristic features of swarms, including spontaneous symmetry breaking,
noise- and density-driven order-disorder transitions that can be of first or
second order, and intermittency. Reproducing these experimental observations
using a non-spatial model suggests that spatial geometry may have a lesser
impact on collective motion than previously thought.
