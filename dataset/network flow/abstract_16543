We use a binary search tree and the simplex algorithm to measure the fraction
of patterns that can be stored by an Ising perceptron. The algorithm is much
faster than exhaustive search and allows us to obtain accurate statistics up to
a system size of N=42. The results show that the finite size scaling ansatz
Nadler and Fink suggest in [1] cannot be applied to estimate accurately the
storage capacity from small systems.
