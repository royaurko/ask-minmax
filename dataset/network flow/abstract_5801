We study a model of a multi-species ecosystem described by
Lotka-Volterra-like equations. Interactions among species form a network whose
evolution is determined by the dynamics of the model. Numerical simulations
show power-law distribution of intervals between extinctions, but only for
ecosystems with sufficient variability of species and with networks of
connectivity above certain threshold that is very close to the percolation
threshold of the network. Effect of slow environmental changes on extinction
dynamics, degree distribution of the network of interspecies interactions, and
some emergent properties of our model are also examined.
