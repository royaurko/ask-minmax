We analyze the properties of a 19 dimensional Galerkin approximation to a
parallel shear flow. The laminar flow with a sinusoidal shape is stable for all
Reynolds numbers Re. For sufficiently large Re additional stationary flows
occur; they are all unstable. The lifetimes of finite amplitude perturbations
show a fractal dependence on amplitude and Reynolds number. These findings are
in accord with observations on plane Couette flow and suggest a universality of
this transition szenario in shear flows.
