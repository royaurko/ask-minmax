Delivery of multicast video services over fourth generation (4G) networks
such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) is gaining momentum. In this
paper, we address the issue of efficiently multicasting layered video services
by defining a novel resource allocation framework that aims to maximize the
service coverage whilst keeping the radio resource footprint low. A key point
in the proposed system mode is that the reliability of multicast video services
is ensured by means of an Unequal Error Protection implementation of the
Network Coding (UEP-NC) scheme. In addition, both the communication parameters
and the UEP-NC scheme are jointly optimized by the proposed resource allocation
framework. Numerical results show that the proposed allocation framework can
significantly increase the service coverage when compared to a conventional
Multi-rate Transmission (MrT) strategy.
