Conventional methods for the simulation of diffusive systems are quite slow
when applied to strongly inhomogeneous systems. We present a new hierarchical
approach based on dynamic renormalization-group ideas and on the Walsh
transform (or Haar wavelet) of signal-processing theory. The method is very
efficient for simulation of petroleum reservoirs or other strongly
inhomogeneous diffusive or pressure-driven flow systems. In a test case, the
hierarchical method is found to achieve 1.5% accuracy roughly 25 times faster
than conventional finite difference methods.
