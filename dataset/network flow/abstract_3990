Deep representations, in particular ones implemented by convolutional neural
networks, have led to good progress on many learning problems. However, the
learned representations are hard to analyze and interpret, even when they are
extracted from visual data. We propose a new approach to study deep image
representations by inverting them with an up-convolutional neural network.
Application of this method to a deep network trained on ImageNet provides
numerous insights into the properties of the feature representation. Most
strikingly, the colors and the rough contours of an input image can be
reconstructed from activations in higher network layers and even from the
predicted class probabilities.
