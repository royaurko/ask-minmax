In this paper, we analyze the physical properties of dark mottles in the
chromospheric network using two dimensional spectroscopic observations in
H-alpha obtained with the Gottingen Fabry-Perot Spectrometer in the Vacuum
Tower Telescope at the Observatory del Teide, Tenerife. Cloud modeling was
applied to measure the mottles' optical thickness, source function, Doppler
width, and line of sight velocity. Using these measurements, the number density
of hydrogen atoms in levels 1 and 2, total particle density, electron density,
temperature, gas pressure, and mass density parameters were determined with the
method of Tsiropoula & Schmieder (1997). We also analyzed the temporal
behaviour of a mottle using cloud parameters. Our result shows that it is
dominated by 3 minute signals in source function, and 5 minutes or more in
velocity.
