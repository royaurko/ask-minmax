Detecting new information and events in a dynamic network by probing
individual nodes has many practical applications: discovering new webpages,
analyzing influence properties in network, and detecting failure propagation in
electronic circuits or infections in public drinkable water systems. In
practice, it is infeasible for anyone but the owner of the network (if
existent) to monitor all nodes at all times. In this work we study the
constrained setting when the observer can only probe a small set of nodes at
each time step to check whether new pieces of information (items) have reached
those nodes.
  We formally define the problem through an infinite time generating process
that places new items in subsets of nodes according to an unknown probability
distribution. Items have an exponentially decaying novelty, modeling their
decreasing value. The observer uses a probing schedule (i.e., a probability
distribution over the set of nodes) to choose, at each time step, a small set
of nodes to check for new items. The goal is to compute a schedule that
minimizes the average novelty of undetected items. We present an algorithm,
WIGGINS, to compute the optimal schedule through convex optimization, and then
show how it can be adapted when the parameters of the problem must be learned
or change over time. We also present a scalable variant of WIGGINS for the
MapReduce framework. The results of our experimental evaluation on real social
networks demonstrate the practicality of our approach.
