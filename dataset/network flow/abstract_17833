While current studies on complex networks focus on systems that change
relatively slowly in time, the structure of the most visited regions of the Web
is altered at the timescale from hours to days. Here we investigate the
dynamics of visitation of a major news portal, representing the prototype for
such a rapidly evolving network. The nodes of the network can be classified
into stable nodes, that form the time independent skeleton of the portal, and
news documents. The visitation of the two node classes are markedly different,
the skeleton acquiring visits at a constant rate, while a news document's
visitation peaking after a few hours. We find that the visitation pattern of a
news document decays as a power law, in contrast with the exponential
prediction provided by simple models of site visitation. This is rooted in the
inhomogeneous nature of the browsing pattern characterizing individual users:
the time interval between consecutive visits by the same user to the site
follows a power law distribution, in contrast with the exponential expected for
Poisson processes. We show that the exponent characterizing the individual
user's browsing patterns determines the power-law decay in a document's
visitation. Finally, our results document the fleeting quality of news and
events: while fifteen minutes of fame is still an exaggeration in the online
media, we find that access to most news items significantly decays after 36
hours of posting.
