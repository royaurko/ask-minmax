Holographic renormalization group flows can be interpreted in terms of
effective field theory. Based on such an interpretation, a formula for the
running scaling dimensions of gauge-invariant operators along such flows is
proposed. The formula is checked for some simple examples from the AdS/CFT
correspondence, but can be applied also in non-AdS/non-CFT cases.
