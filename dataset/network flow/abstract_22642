The framework of anisotropic hydrodynamics is used in 3+1 dimensions to
analyze behavior of matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
The model predictions for the hadronic transverse-momentum spectra, directed
and elliptic flows, and the HBT radii are presented. We show that the effects
of the initial anisotropy of pressure may be compensated by appropriate
adjustment of the initial energy density. In this way, the final hadronic
observables become insensitive to the early stage dynamics and the early
thermalization puzzle may be circumvented.
