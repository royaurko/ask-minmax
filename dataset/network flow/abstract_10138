In a tokamak pedestal, radial scale lengths can become comparable to the ion
orbit width, invalidating conventional neoclassical calculations of flow and
bootstrap current. In this work we illustrate a non-local approach that allows
strong radial density variation while maintaining small departures from a
Maxwellian distribution. Non-local effects alter the magnitude and poloidal
variation of the flow and current. The approach is implemented in a new global
delta-f continuum code using the full linearized Fokker-Planck collision
operator. Arbitrary collisionality and aspect ratio are allowed as long as the
poloidal magnetic field is small compared to the total magnetic field. Strong
radial electric fields, sufficient to electrostatically confine the ions, are
also included. These effects may be important to consider in any comparison
between experimental pedestal flow measurements and theory.
