We investigate the application of mesoscopic response functions (MRFs) to
characterise a large set of networks of fungi and slime moulds grown under a
wide variety of different experimental treatments, including inter-species
competition and attack by fungivores. We construct "structural networks" by
estimating cord conductances (which yield edge weights) from the experimental
data, and we construct "functional networks" by calculating edge weights based
on how much nutrient traffic is predicted to occur on each edge. Both types of
networks have the same topology, and we compute MRFs for both families of
networks to illustrate two different ways of constructing taxonomies to group
the biological networks into related clusters. Although both network taxonomies
generate intuitively sensible groupings of networks across species, treatments,
and laboratories, we find that clustering using the functional-network measure
appears to give more parsimonious groups. We argue that MRFs provide a useful
quantitative measures of network behaviour that can help to summarise an
expanding set of increasingly complex experimental biological networks and to
present the information in an accessible form.
