This is comment to preprint arXiv:1409.7459 by Y. Tada, Wenxing Nie and M.
Oshikawa "Orbital angular momentum and spectral flow in two dimensional chiral
superfluids", where the effect of spectral flow along the edge states on the
magnitude of the orbital angular momentum is discussed. The general conclusion
of the preprint on the essential reduction of the angular momentum for the
higher values of chirality, $|\nu|>1$, is confirmed. However, we show that if
parity is violated, the reduction of the angular momentum takes place also for
the $p$-wave superfluids with $|\nu|=1$.
