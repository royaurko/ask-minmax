The non-linear way the anomalous dimension parameter has been introduced in
the historic first version of the exact renormalization group equation is
compared to current practice. A simple expression for the exactly marginal
redundant operator proceeds from this non-linearity, whereas in the linear
case, first order differential equations must be solved to get it. The role of
this operator in the construction of the flow equation is highlighted.
