The growing importance of microfluidic and nanofluidic devices to the study
of biological processes has highlighted the need to better understand how
confinement affects the behavior of polymers in flow. In this paper we explore
one aspect of this question by calculating the steady-state extension of a long
polymer chain in a narrow capillary tube in the presence of simple shear. The
calculation is carried out within the framework of the Rouse-Zimm approach to
chain dynamics, using a variant of a nonlinear elastic model to enforce finite
extensibility. Under the assumption that the sole effect of the confining
surface is to modify the pre-averaged hydrodynamic interaction, we find that
the calculated fractional chain extension x is considerably smaller than its
value in the bulk. Furthermore, the variation of x with a dimensionless shear
rate (the Weissenberg number, Wi) is in good qualitative agreement with data
from experiments on the flow-induced stretching of lambda- phage DNA near a
non-adsorbing glass surface.
