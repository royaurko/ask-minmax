We present a family of scale-free network model consisting of cliques, which
is established by a simple recursive algorithm. We investigate the networks
both analytically and numerically. The obtained analytical solutions show that
the networks follow a power-law degree distribution, with degree exponent
continuously tuned between 2 and 3. The exact expression of clustering
coefficient is also provided for the networks. Furthermore, the investigation
of the average path length reveals that the networks possess small-world
feature. Interestingly, we find that a special case of our model can be mapped
into the Yule process.
