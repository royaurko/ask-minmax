Yehuda Vardi introduced the term network tomography and was the first to
propose and study how statistical inverse methods could be adapted to attack
important network problems (Vardi, 1996). More recently, in one of his final
papers, Vardi proposed notions of metrics on networks to define and measure
distances between a network's links, its paths, and also between different
networks (Vardi, 2004). In this paper, we apply Vardi's general approach for
network metrics to a real data network by using data obtained from special data
network tools and testing procedures presented here. We illustrate how the
metrics help explicate interesting features of the traffic characteristics on
the network. We also adapt the metrics in order to condition on traffic passing
through a portion of the network, such as a router or pair of routers, and show
further how this approach helps to discover and explain interesting network
characteristics.
