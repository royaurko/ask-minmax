We present new parallel sorting networks for $17$ to $20$ inputs. For $17,
19,$ and $20$ inputs these new networks are faster (i.e., they require less
computation steps) than the previously known best networks. Therefore, we
improve upon the known upper bounds for minimal depth sorting networks on $17,
19,$ and $20$ channels. Furthermore, we show that our sorting network for $17$
inputs is optimal in the sense that no sorting network using less layers
exists. This solves the main open problem of [D. Bundala & J. Za\'vodn\'y.
