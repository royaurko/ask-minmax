We use scaling results to identify the crossover to mean-field behavior of
equilibrium statistical mechanics models on a variant of the small world
network. The results are generalizable to a wide-range of equilibrium systems.
Anomalous scaling is found in the width of the mean-field region, as well as in
the mean-field amplitudes. Finally, we consider non-equilibrium processes.
