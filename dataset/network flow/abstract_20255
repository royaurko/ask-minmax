In this paper, the contributors first establish the global well-posedness of
strong solutions of the simplified Ericksen-Leslie model for nonhomogeneous
incompressible nematic liquid crystal flows in two dimensions if the initial
data satisfies some smallness condition. It is worth pointing out that the
initial density is allowed to contain vacuum states and the initial velocity
can be arbitrarily large. We also present a Serrin's type criterion, depending
only on $\nabla d$, for the breakdown of local strong solutions. As a
byproduct, the global strong solutions with large initial data are obtained,
provided the macroscopic molecular orientation of the liquid crystal materials
satisfies a natural geometric angle condition (cf. [19])
