We investigate the efficiency of power generation by thermo-chemical engines.
For strong coupling between the particle and heat flows and in the presence of
a left-right symmetry in the system, we demonstrate that the efficiency at
maximum power displays universality up to quadratic order in the deviation from
equilibrium. A maser model is presented to illustrate our argument.
