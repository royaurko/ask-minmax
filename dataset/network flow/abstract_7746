Soft bodies flowing in a channel often exhibit parachute-like shapes usually
attributed to an increase of hydrodynamic constraint (viscous stress and/or
confinement). We show that the presence of a fluid membrane leads to the
reverse phenomenon and build a phase diagram of shapes --- which are classified
as bullet, croissant and parachute --- in channels of varying aspect ratio.
Unexpectedly, shapes are relatively wider in the narrowest direction of the
channel. We highlight the role of flow patterns on the membrane in this
response to the asymmetry of stress distribution.
