An analytic approach is presented to developing exact expressions for the
two-point resistance between arbitrary nodes on certain non-regular resistor
networks. This generalises previous approaches, which only deliver results for
networks of more regular geometry. The new approach exploits the second minor
of the Laplacian matrix associated with the given network to obtain the
resistance in terms its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The method is illustrated
by application to the resistor network on the globe lattice, for which the
resistance between two arbitrary nodes is obtained in the form of single
summation.
