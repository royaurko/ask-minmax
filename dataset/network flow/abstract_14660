Using high-resolution direct numerical simulations, the height and Reynolds
number dependence of higher-order statistics of the energy dissipation rate and
local enstrophy are examined in incompressible, fully-developed turbulent
channel flow. The statistics are studied over a range of wall distances,
spanning the viscous sublayer to the channel flow centerline, for friction
Reynolds numbers $Re_\tau = 180$ and $Re_\tau = 381$. The high resolution of
the simulations allows dissipation and enstrophy moments up to fourth order to
be calculated. These moments show a dependence on wall distance, and Reynolds
number effects are observed at the edge of the logarithmic layer. Conditional
analyses based on locations of intense rotation are also carried out in order
to determine the contribution of vortical structures to the dissipation and
enstrophy moments. Our analysis shows that, for the simulation at the larger
Reynolds number, small-scale fluctuations of both dissipation and enstrophy
become relatively constant for $z^+ \gtrsim 100$.
