We study channelization and slope destabilization driven by subsurface
(groundwater) flow in a laboratory experiment. The pressure of the water
entering the sandpile from below as well as the slope of the sandpile are
varied. We present quantitative understanding of the three modes of sediment
mobilization in this experiment: surface erosion, fluidization, and slumping.
The onset of erosion is controlled not only by shear stresses caused by
surfical flows, but also hydrodynamic stresses deriving from subsurface flows.
These additional forces require modification of the critical Shields criterion.
Whereas surface flows alone can mobilize surface grains only when the water
flux exceeds a threshold, subsurface flows cause this threshold to vanish at
slopes steeper than a critical angle substantially smaller than the maximum
angle of stability. Slopes above this critical angle are unstable to
channelization by any amount of fluid reaching the surface.
