Mobility causes network structures to change. In PSNs where underlying
network structure is changing rapidly, we are interested in studying how
information dissemination can be enhanced in a sparse disconnected network
where nodes lack the global knowledge about the network. We use beamforming to
study the enhancement in the information dissemination process. In order to
identify potential beamformers and nodes to which beams should be directed we
use the concept of stability. We first predict the stability of a node in the
dynamic network using truncated levy walk nature of jump lengths of human
mobility and then use this measure to identify beamforming nodes and the nodes
to which the beams are directed. We also develop our algorithm such that it
does not require any global knowledge about the network and works in a
distributed manner. We also show the effect of various parameters such as
number of sources, number of packets, mobility parameters, antenna parameters,
type of stability used and density of the network on information dissemination
in the network. We validate our findings with three validation model, no
beamforming, beamforming using different stability measure and when no
stability measure is associated but same number of node beamform and the
selection of the beamforming nodes is random. Our simulation results show that
information dissemination can be enhanced using our algorithm over other
models.
