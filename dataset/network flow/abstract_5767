We study the problem of controlling a general complex network towards an
assigned synchronous evolution, by means of a pinning control strategy. We
define the pinning-controllability of the network in terms of the spectral
properties of an extended network topology. The roles of the control and
coupling gains as well as of the number of pinned nodes are also discussed.
