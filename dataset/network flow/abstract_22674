Dynamics of a superfluid flow past an obstacle are investigated by solving
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically. For an appropriate velocity and size
of the obstacle, quantized vortices are periodically generated in the wake,
which form a Benard-von Karman vortex street. It is found that vibration of an
obstacle modulates the vortex street breaking a symmetry.
