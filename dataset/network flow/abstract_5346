We analyze the ordering dynamics of the voter model in different classes of
complex networks. We observe that whether the voter dynamics orders the system
depends on the effective dimensionality of the interaction networks. We also
find that when there is no ordering in the system, the average survival time of
metastable states in finite networks decreases with network disorder and degree
heterogeneity. The existence of hubs in the network modifies the linear system
size scaling law of the survival time. The size of an ordered domain is
sensitive to the network disorder and the average connectivity, decreasing with
both; however it seems not to depend on network size and degree heterogeneity.
