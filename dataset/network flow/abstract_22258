We have previously predicted multiplicities and transverse momentum spectra
of hadrons for the most central LHC Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.5$ TeV
using initial state for hydrodynamic evolution from pQCD + final state
saturation model. By considering binary collision and wounded nucleon profiles
we extend these studies to non-central collisions, and predict the $p_{T}$
dependence of minimum bias $v_{2}$ for pions at the LHC. For protons we also
show how the $p_{T}$ dependence of $v_2$ changes from RHIC to the LHC.
