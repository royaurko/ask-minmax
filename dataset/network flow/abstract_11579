We present a biophysical approach for the coupling of neural network activity
as resulting from proper dipole currents of cortical pyramidal neurons to the
electric field in extracellular fluid. Starting from a reduced threecompartment
model of a single pyramidal neuron, we derive an observation model for
dendritic dipole currents in extracellular space and thereby for the dendritic
field potential that contributes to the local field potential of a neural
population. This work aligns and satisfies the widespread dipole assumption
that is motivated by the "open-field" configuration of the dendritic field
potential around cortical pyramidal cells. Our reduced three-compartment scheme
allows to derive networks of leaky integrate-and-fire models, which facilitates
comparison with existing neural network and observation models. In particular,
by means of numerical simulations we compare our approach with an ad hoc model
by Mazzoni et al. [Mazzoni, A., S. Panzeri, N. K. Logothetis, and N. Brunel
(2008). Encoding of naturalistic stimuli by local field potential spectra in
networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. PLoS Computational Biology 4
(12), e1000239], and conclude that our biophysically motivated approach yields
substantial improvement.
