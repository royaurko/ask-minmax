This paper examines the existence of the self-intersection local time for a
superprocess over a stochastic flow in dimensions $d\leq3$, which through
constructive methods, results in a Tanaka-like representation. The superprocess
over a stochastic flow is a superprocess with dependent spatial motion, and
thus Dynkin's proof of existence, which requires multiplicity of the
log-Laplace functional, no longer applies. Skoulakis and Adler's method of
calculating moments is extended to higher moments, from which existence
follows.
