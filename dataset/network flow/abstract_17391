In this paper we produce a lower bound for the number of periodic orbits of
certain Hamiltonian vector fields near Bott-nondegenerate symplectic critical
submanifolds. This result is then related to the problem of finding closed
orbits of the motion of a charged low energy particle on a Riemannian manifold
under the influence of a magnetic field
