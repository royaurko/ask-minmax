We show that universality in chaotic elements can be lifted to that in
complex systems. We construct a globally coupled Flow lattice (GCFL), an analog
of a globally coupled Map lattice (GCML). We find that Duffing GCFL shows the
same behavior with GCML; population ratio between synchronizing clusters acts
as a bifurcation parameter. Lorenz GCFL exhibits interesting two quasi-clusters
in an opposite phase motion. Each of them looks like Will o' the wisp; they
dance around in opposite phase.
