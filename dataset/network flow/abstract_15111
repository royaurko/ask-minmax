In this paper, we study the setting of carrier-sensing range in 802.11
networks under the (cumulative) physical interference model. Specifically, we
identify a carrier-sensing range that will prevent collisions in 802.11
networks due to carrier-sensing failure under the physical interference model.
We find that the carrier-sensing range required under the physical interference
model must be larger than that required under the protocol (pairwise)
interference model by a multiplicative factor. For example, if the SINR
requirement is 10dB and the path-loss exponent is 4, the factor is 1.4.
Furthermore, given a fixed pathloss exponent of 4, the factor increases as the
SINR requirement increases. However, the limit of the factor is 1.84 as the
SINR requirement goes to infinity.
