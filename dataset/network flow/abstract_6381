The shear strength and stick-slip behavior of a rough rock joint are analyzed
using the complex network approach. We develop a network approach on
correlation patterns of void spaces of an evolvable rough fracture (crack type
II). Correlation among networks properties with the hydro -mechanical
attributes (obtained from experimental tests) of fracture before and after slip
is the direct result of the revealed non-contacts networks. Joint distribution
of locally and globally filtered correlation gives a close relation to the
contact zones attachment-detachment sequences through the evolution of shear
strength of the rock joint. Especially spread of node's degree rate to spread
of clustering coefficient rate yielded possible stick and slip sequences during
the displacements. Our method can be developed to investigate the complexity of
stick-slip behavior of faults as well as energy /stress localization on
crumpled shells/sheets in which ridge networks are controlling the energy
distribution.
