We discuss recently published data indicating that the nearby galaxy group
NGC 1023 includes an inner virialized quasi-stationary component and an outer
component comprising a flow of dwarf galaxies falling toward the center of the
system. The inner component is similar to the Local Group of galaxies, but the
Local Group is surrounded by a receding set of dwarf galaxies forming the very
local Hubble flow, rather than a system of approaching dwarfs. This clear
difference in the structures of these two systems, which are very similar in
other respects, may be associated with the dark energy in which they are both
imbedded. Self-gravity dominates in the Local Group, while the anti-gravity
produced by the cosmic dark-energy background dominates in the surrounding
Hubble flow. In contrast, self-gravity likewise dominates throughout the NGC
1023 Group, both in its central component and in the surrounding Santi-Hubble
flow. The NGC 1023 group as a whole is apparently in an ongoing state of
formation and virialization. We may expect that there exists a receding flow
similar to the local Hubble flow at distances of 1.4-3 Mpc from the center of
the group, where anti-gravity should become stronger than the gravity of the
system.
