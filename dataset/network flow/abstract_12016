The phase transition in the XY model on one-dimensional small-world networks
is investigated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. It is found that
long-range order is present at finite temperatures, even for very small values
of the rewiring probability, suggesting a finite-temperature transition for any
nonzero rewiring probability. Nature of the phase transition is discussed in
comparison with the globally-coupled XY model.
