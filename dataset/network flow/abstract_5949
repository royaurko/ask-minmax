This paper uses the reliability polynomial, introduced by Moore and Shannon
in 1956, to analyze the effect of network structure on diffusive dynamics such
as the spread of infectious disease. We exhibit a representation for the
reliability polynomial in terms of what we call {\em structural motifs} that is
well suited for reasoning about the effect of a network's structural properties
on diffusion across the network. We illustrate by deriving several general
results relating graph structure to dynamical phenomena.
