In ALOHA-type packetized network, the transmission times of packets follow a
stochastic process. In this paper, we advocate a deterministic approach for
channel multiple-access. Each user is statically assigned a periodic protocol
signal, which takes value either zero or one, and transmit packets whenever the
value of the protocol signal is equal to one. On top of this multiple-access
protocol, efficient channel coding and network coding schemes are devised. We
illustrate the idea by constructing a transmission scheme for the tandem
collision network, for both slot-synchronous and slot-asynchronous systems.
This cross-layer approach is able to achieve the capacity region when the
network is bi-directional.
