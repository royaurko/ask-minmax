Key establishment between any pair of nodes is an essential requirement for
providing secure services in wireless sensor networks. Blom's scheme is a
prominent key management scheme but its shortcomings include large computation
overhead and memory cost. We propose a new scheme in this paper that modifies
Blom's scheme in a manner that reduces memory and computation costs. This paper
also provides the value for secure parameter t such that the network is
resilient.
