In this paper we introduce a novel Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) scheme for
cooperative wireless networks. Our scheme adopts network coding techniques in
order to enhance the total bandwidth of the network by minimizing the total
number of transmissions. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated
by means of computer simulations and compared to other cooperative schemes,
while an analytical solution is provided to validate the results.
