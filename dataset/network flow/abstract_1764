We present a minimal model for spatiotemporal oscillation and rheochaos in
shear-thickening complex fluids at zero Reynolds number. In the model, a
tendency towards inhomogeneous flows in the form of shear bands combines with a
slow structural dynamics, modelled by delayed stress relaxation. Using
Fourier-space numerics, we study the nonequilibrium `phase diagram' of the
fluid as a function of a steady mean (spatially averaged) stress, and of the
relaxation time for structural relaxation. We find several distinct regions of
periodic behavior (oscillating bands, travelling bands, and more complex
oscillations) and also regions of spatiotemporal rheochaos. A low-dimensional
truncation of the model retains the important physical features of the full
model (including rheochaos) despite the suppression of sharply defined
interfaces between shear bands. Our model maps onto the FitzHugh-Nagumo model
for neural network dynamics, with an unusual form of long-range coupling.
