Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an emerging technology now-a-days and has a
wide range of applications such as battlefield surveillance, traffic
surveillance, forest fire detection, flood detection etc. But wireless sensor
networks are susceptible to a variety of potential attacks which obstructs the
normal operation of the network. The security of a wireless sensor network is
compromised because of the random deployment of sensor nodes in open
environment, memory limitations, power limitations and unattended nature. This
paper focuses on various attacks that manifest in the network and provides a
tabular representation of the attacks, their effects and severity. The paper
depicts a comparison of attacks basis packet loss and packet corruption. Also,
the paper discusses the known defence mechanisms and countermeasures against
the attacks.
