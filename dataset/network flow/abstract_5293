This contribution to the focus issue covers anisotropic flow in hybrid
approaches. The historical development of hybrid approaches and their impact on
the interpretation of flow measurements is reviewed. The major ingredients of a
hybrid approach and the transition criteria between transport and hydrodynamics
are discussed. The results for anisotropic flow in (event-by-event) hybrid
approaches are presented. Some hybrid approaches rely on hadronic transport for
the late stages for the reaction (so called afterburner) and others employ
transport approaches for the early non equilibrium evolution. In addition,
there are 'full' hybrid calculations where a fluid evolution is dynamically
embedded in a transport simulation. After demonstrating the success of hybrid
approaches at high RHIC and LHC energies, existing hybrid caluclations for
collective flow observables at lower beam energies are discussed and remaining
challenges outlined.
