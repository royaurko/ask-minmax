Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold with a parallel 1-form $\Omega$. We
prove two theorems about the curve shortening flow in $M$. One is that the
{\csf} $\ct$ in $M$ exists for all $t$ in $[0, \infty)$, if it satisfies
$\Omega(T)\geq 0$ on the initial curve $\co$. Here $T$ is the unit tangent
vector on $\co$. The other one is about the convergence. It says that in a
closed {\Rm} $\tilde{M}$, assume the curve shortening flow $\ct$ exists for all
$t\in[0,\infty)$ and its length converges to a positive limit, then $
\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow\infty}max_{\ct}|\nabla^{m}A|^{2}=0$ for all
$m=0,1,...$. Here $A$ denotes the second fundamental form of $\ct$ in
$\tilde{M}$.
