The problem of finding network codes for general connections is inherently
difficult. Resource minimization for general connections with network coding is
further complicated. The existing solutions mainly rely on very restricted
classes of network codes, and are almost all centralized. In this paper, we
introduce linear network mixing coefficients for code constructions of general
connections that generalize random linear network coding (RLNC) for multicast
connections. For such code constructions, we pose the problem of cost
minimization for the subgraph involved in the coding solution and relate this
minimization to a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) which we show can be
simplified to have a moderate number of constraints. While CSPs are NP-complete
in general, we present a probabilistic distributed algorithm with almost sure
convergence in finite time by applying Communication Free Learning (CFL). Our
approach allows fairly general coding across flows, guarantees no greater cost
than routing, and shows a possible distributed implementation.
