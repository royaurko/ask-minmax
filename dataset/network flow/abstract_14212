New CO observations at the center of cooling flow in Perseus cluster
\cite{salome06} show a clear correlation of the molecular gas with the
previously detected H-$\alpha$ filaments \cite{conselice01}. In this poster, we
present high resolution multi-phase simulations of the Perseus Cluster, taking
into account the AGN feedback in form of hot buoyant bubbles. These simulations
show that significant amount of gas can cool far from the center. The AGN
feedback provides some heating, but also trigger the hot gas compression, that
favours cooling (positive feedback), even at high radius ($R>30 \rm{kpc}$). The
cooled gas flows into the cluster core forming the observed filaments.
