In principle, the rules of links formation of a network model can be
considered as a kind of link prediction algorithm. By revisiting the
preferential attachment mechanism for generating a scale-free network, here we
propose a class of preferential attachment indices which are different from the
previous one. Traditionally, the preferential attachment index is defined by
the product of the related nodes degrees, while the new indices will define the
similarity score of a pair of nodes by either the maximum in the two nodes
degrees or the summarization of their degrees. Extensive experiments are
carried out on fourteen real-world networks. Compared with the traditional
preferential attachment index, the new ones, especially the
degree-summarization similarity index, can provide more accurate prediction on
most of the networks. Due to the improved prediction accuracy and low
computational complexity, these proposed preferential attachment indices may be
of help to provide an instruction for mining unknown links in incomplete
networks.
