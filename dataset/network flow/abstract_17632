We construct discrete time Markov chains that preserve the class of Schur
processes on partitions and signatures.
  One application is a simple exact sampling algorithm for
q^{volume}-distributed skew plane partitions with an arbitrary back wall.
Another application is a construction of Markov chains on infinite
Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes that represent deterministic flows on the space of
extreme characters of the infinite-dimensional unitary group.
