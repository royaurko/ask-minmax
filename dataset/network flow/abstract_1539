We propose a Multi-Layer Network based on the Bayesian framework of the
Factor Graphs in Reduced Normal Form (FGrn) applied to a two-dimensional
lattice. The Latent Variable Model (LVM) is the basic building block of a
quadtree hierarchy built on top of a bottom layer of random variables that
represent pixels of an image, a feature map, or more generally a collection of
spatially distributed discrete variables. The multi-layer architecture
implements a hierarchical data representation that, via belief propagation, can
be used for learning and inference. Typical uses are pattern completion,
correction and classification. The FGrn paradigm provides great flexibility and
modularity and appears as a promising candidate for building deep networks: the
system can be easily extended by introducing new and different (in cardinality
and in type) variables. Prior knowledge, or supervised information, can be
introduced at different scales. The FGrn paradigm provides a handy way for
building all kinds of architectures by interconnecting only three types of
units: Single Input Single Output (SISO) blocks, Sources and Replicators. The
network is designed like a circuit diagram and the belief messages flow
bidirectionally in the whole system. The learning algorithms operate only
locally within each block. The framework is demonstrated in this paper in a
three-layer structure applied to images extracted from a standard data set.
