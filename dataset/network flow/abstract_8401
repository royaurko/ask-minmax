In this paper we build upon the recent observation that the 802.11 rate
region is log-convex and, for the first time, characterise max-min fair rate
allocations for a large class of 802.11 wireless mesh networks. By exploiting
features of the 802.11e/n MAC, in particular TXOP packet bursting, we are able
to use this characterisation to establish a straightforward, practically
implementable approach for achieving max-min throughput fairness. We
demonstrate that this approach can be readily extended to encompass time-based
fairness in multi-rate 802.11 mesh networks.
