The force networks of different granular ensembles are defined and their
topological properties studied using the tools of complex networks. In
particular, for each set of grains compressed in a square box, it is introduced
a force threshold that determines which contacts conform the network. Hence,
the topological characteristics of the network are analyzed as a function of
this parameter. The characterization of the structural features thus obtained,
may be useful in the understanding of the macroscopic physical behavior
exhibited by this class of media.
