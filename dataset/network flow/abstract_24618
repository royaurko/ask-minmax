We consider the problem of two point resistance on an $m times n$ cobweb
network with a 2r boundary which has never been solved before. Past efforts
prior to 2014 researchers just only solved the cases with free boundary or null
resistor boundary. This paper gives the general formulae of the resistance
between any two nodes in both finite and infinite cases using a method of
direct summation pioneered by Tan [Z.Z.Tan, et al, J. Phys. A 46, 195202
(2013)], which is simpler and can be easier to use in practice. This method
contrasts the Greens function technique and the Laplacian matrix approach,
which is difficult to apply to the geometry of a cobweb with a 2r boundary. We
deduced several interesting results according to our general formula. In the
end we compare and illuminate our formulae with two examples. Our analysis
gives the result directly as a single summation, and the result is mainly
composed of the characteristic roots.
