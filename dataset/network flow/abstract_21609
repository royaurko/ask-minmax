The renormalization group method has been adapted to the analysis of the
long-time behavior of non-linear partial differential equation and has
demonstrated its power in the study of critical phenomena of gravitational
collapse. In the present work we apply the renormalization group to the
Einstein equation in cosmology and carry out detailed analysis of
renormalization group flow in the vicinity of the scale invariant fixed point
in the spherically symmetric and inhomogeneous dust filled universe model.
