With the arrival of cloud technology, game accessibility and ubiquity have a
bright future; Games can be hosted in a centralize server and accessed through
the Internet by a thin client on a wide variety of devices with modest
capabilities: cloud gaming. However, current cloud gaming systems have very
strong requirements in terms of network resources, thus reducing the
accessibility and ubiquity of cloud games, because devices with little
bandwidth and people located in area with limited and unstable network
connectivity, cannot take advantage of these cloud services. In this paper we
present an adaptation technique inspired by the level of detail (LoD) approach
in 3D graphics. It delivers multiple platform accessibility and network
adaptability, while improving user's quality of experience (QoE) by reducing
the impact of poor and unstable network parameters (delay, packet loss, jitter)
on game interactivity. We validate our approach using a prototype game in a
controlled environment and characterize the user QoE in a pilot experiment. The
results show that the proposed framework provides a significant QoE
enhancement.
