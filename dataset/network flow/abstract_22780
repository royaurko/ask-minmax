In this paper we analyze the classical electromagnetic radiation of an
accelerating point charge moving on a straight line trajectory. Depending on
the duration of accelerations, rapidity distributions of photons emerge,
resembling the ones obtained in the framework of hydrodynamical models by
Landau or Bjorken. Detectable differences between our approach and spectra
obtained from hydrodynamical models occur at high transverse momenta and are
due to interference.
