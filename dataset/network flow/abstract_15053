We investigate the evolution of a superconducting string network with
arbitrary, constant string current in the friction dominated regime. In the
absence of an external magnetic field the network always reaches a scaling
solution. However, for string current stronger than a critical value, it is
different than the usual, horizon-scaling of the non-superconducting string
case. In this case the friction domination era never ends. Whilst the
superconducting string network can be much denser than usually assumed, it can
never dominate the universe energy density. It can, however, influence the
cosmic microwave background radiation and the formation of large scale
structure. When embedded in a primordial magnetic field of sufficient strength,
the network never reaches scaling and, thus, eventually dominates the universe
evolution.
