Our goal is to electronically regulate electrochemical cells. For this, we
introduced a third element, called the gate, which was placed between the
cathode and the anode electrodes of the cell. Voltage applied to this element
controlled the local potential of the electrolyte, thus impacting the flow of
ions within the cell. The flow of ions was monitored by the electronic current
in the external cell's circuit. We provide simulations and experimental data as
proof to the validity of this concept. This is but the first step towards a
demonstration of a two-dimensional, bi-carrier ion transistors.
