We demonstrate that the first arrival time in dispersive processes in
self-affine fractures are governed by the same length scale characterizing the
fractures as that which controls their permeability. In one-dimensional channel
flow this length scale is the aperture of the bottle neck, i.e., the region
having the smallest aperture. In two dimensions, the concept of a bottle neck
is generalized to that of a minimal path normal to the flow. The length scale
is then the average aperture along this path. There is a linear relationship
between the first arrival time and this length scale, even when there is strong
overlap between the fracture surfaces creating areas with zero permeability. We
express the first arrival time directly in terms of the permeability.
