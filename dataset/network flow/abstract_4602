The topological structure of complex networks has fascinated researchers for
several decades, and today we have a fairly good understanding of the types and
reoccurring characteristics of many different complex networks. However,
surprisingly little is known today about models to compare complex graphs, and
quantitatively measure their similarity and dynamics.
  In the past a variety of node centralities, i.e., functions which assign
values to nodes to represent their importance in the graph. Based on such
centralities we propose a natural similarity measure for complex networks: the
centrality distance $d_C$, the difference between two graphs with respect to a
given node centrality $C$. Centrality distances can take the specific roles of
the different nodes in the network into account, and have many interesting
applications.
  As a case study, we investigate the evolution of networks with respect to
centrality distances and their approximations based on closeness, betweenness,
pagerank, clustering and degree centrality. In particular we study the dynamic
behavior of six real-world social and physical networks and show that
centrality distances can be used to effectively distinguish between randomly
generated and actual evolutionary paths of dynamic complex networks.
