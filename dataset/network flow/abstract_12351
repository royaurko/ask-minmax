OPNET Modeler is used to simulate the architecture and to calculate the
performance criteria (i.e. throughput, delay and data dropped) that slightly
concerned in network estimation. It is concluded that our models shorten the
time quite a bit for obtaining the performance measures of an end-to-end delay
as well as throughput can be used as an effective tool for this purpose.
