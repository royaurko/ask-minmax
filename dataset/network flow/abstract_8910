We study solutions of the mean curvature flow which are defined for all
negative curvature times, usually called ancient solutions. We give various
conditions ensuring that a closed convex ancient solution is a shrinking
sphere. Examples of such conditions are: a uniform pinching condition on the
curvatures, a suitable growth bound on the diameter or a reverse isoperimetric
inequality. We also study the behaviour of uniformly k-convex solutions, and
consider generalizations to ancient solutions immersed in a sphere.
