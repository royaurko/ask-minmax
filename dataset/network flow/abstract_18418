Emergency services are vital services that Next Generation Networks (NGNs)
have to provide. As the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is in the heart of NGNs,
3GPP has carried the burden of specifying a standardized IMS-based emergency
services framework. Unfortunately, like any other IP-based standards, the
IMS-based emergency service framework is prone to Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attacks. We propose in this work, a simple but efficient solution that
can prevent certain types of such attacks by creating firewall pinholes that
regular clients will surely be able to pass in contrast to the attackers
clients. Our solution was implemented, tested in an appropriate testbed, and
its efficiency was proven.
