In these lectures I discuss long-scale properties of fluctuating polymerized
membranes in the presence of network anisotropy and random heterogeneities.
Amazingly, even infinitesimal amount of these seemingly innocuous but
physically important ingredients in the membrane's internal structure leads to
a wealth of striking qualitatively new phenomena. Anisotropy leads to a
``tubule'' phase that is intermediate in its properties and location on the
phase diagram between previously discussed ``crumpled'' and ``flat'' phases. At
low temperature, network heterogeneity generates conformationally glassy
phases, with membrane normals exhibiting glass order analogous to spin-glasses.
The common thread to these distinct membrane phases is that they exhibit
universal anomalous elasticity, (singularly length-scale dependent elastic
moduli, universal Poisson ratio, etc.), driven by thermal fluctuations and/or
disorder and controlled by a nontrivial low-temperature fixed point.
