We study the self-organized ordering of nanostructures produced by ion-beam
sputtering (IBS) of targets amorphizing under irradiation. By introducing a
model akin to models of pattern formation in aeolian sand dunes, we extend
consistently the current continuum theory of erosion by IBS. We obtain new
non-linear effects responsible for the in-plane ordering of the structures,
whose strength correlates with the degree of ordering found in experiments. Our
results highlight the importance of redeposition and surface viscous flow to
this nanopattern formation process.
