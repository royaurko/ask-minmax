We explore the harmonic-Ricci flow---that is, Ricci flow coupled with
harmonic map flow---both as it arises naturally in certain principal bundle
constructions related to Ricci flow and as a geometric flow in its own right.
We demonstrate that one natural geometric context for the flow is a special
case of the locally $\mathbb{R}^N$-invariant Ricci flow of Lott, and provide
examples of gradient solitons for the flow. We prove a version of Hamilton's
compactness theorem for the flow, and then generalize it to the category of
\'{e}tale Riemannian groupoids. Finally, we provide a detailed example of
solutions to the flow on the Lie group $\Nil^3$.
