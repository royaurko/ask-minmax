Broadcast is a fundamental operation in networks, especially in wireless
Mobile Ad Hoc NETworks (MANET). For example, some form of broadcasting is used
by all on-demand MANET routing protocols, when there is uncertainty as to the
location of the destination node, or for service discovery. Being such a basic
operation of the networking protocols, the importance of efficient broadcasting
has long been recognized by the networking community. Numerous papers proposed
increasingly more efficient implementation of broadcasting, while other studies
presented bounds on broadcast performance. In this work, we present a new
approach to efficient broadcast in networks with dynamic topologies, such as
MANET, and we introduce a new broadcasting algorithm for such networking
environments. We evaluate our algorithm, showing that its performance comes
remarkably close to the corresponding theoretical performance bounds, even in
the presence of packet loss due to, for example, MAC-layer collisions.
Furthermore, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other
recently proposed schemes, including in various mobility settings.
