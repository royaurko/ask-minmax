In this paper we show that the small world and weak ties phenomena can
spontaneously emerge in a social network of interacting agents. This dynamics
is simulated in the framework of a simplified model of opinion diffusion in an
evolving social network where agents are made to interact, possibly update
their beliefs and modify the social relationships according to the opinion
exchange.
