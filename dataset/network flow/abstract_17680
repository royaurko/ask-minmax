We consider a nonlinear third order dispersive equation which models the
motion of a vortex filament immersed in an incompressible and inviscid fluid
occupying the three dimensional half space. We prove the unique solvability of
initial-boundary value problems as an attempt to analyze the motion of a
tornado.
