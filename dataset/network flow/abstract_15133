The goal of an Intrusion Detection is inadequate to detect errors and unusual
activity on a network or on the hosts belonging to a local network by
monitoring network activity. Algorithms for building detection models are
broadly classified into two categories, Misuse Detection and Anomaly Detection.
The proposed approach should be taken into account, as the security system
violations caused by both incompliance with the security policy and attacks on
the system resulting in the need to describe models. However, it is based on
unified mathematical formalism which is provided for subsequent merger of the
models. The above formalism in this paper presents a state machine describing
the behavior of a system subject. The set of intrusion description models is
used by the evaluation module and determines the likelihood of undesired
actions the system is capable of detecting. The number of attacks which are not
described by models determining the completeness of detection by the IDS linked
to the ability of detecting security violations.
