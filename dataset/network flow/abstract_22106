We study the asymptotic properties of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in the
case of a compact Riemannian surface of nonpositive sectional curvature. We
show that the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of a semiclassical measure for the
geodesic flow is bounded from below by half of the Ruelle upper bound. We
follow the same main strategy as in the Anosov case (arXiv:0809.0230). We focus
on the main differences and refer the reader to (arXiv:0809.0230) for the
details of analogous lemmas.
