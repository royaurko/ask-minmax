In this paper, we consider a dual-hop Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)
relay wireless network, in which a source-destination pair both equipped with
multiple antennas communicates through a large number of half-duplex
amplify-and-forward (AF) relay terminals. Two novel linear beamforming schemes
based on the matched filter (MF) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding
techniques are proposed for the MIMO relay system. We focus on the linear
process at the relay nodes and design the new relay beamformers by utilizing
the channel state information (CSI) of both backward channel and forward
channel. The proposed beamforming designs are based on the QR decomposition
(QRD) filter at the destination node which performs successive interference
cancellation (SIC) to achieve the maximum spatial multiplexing gain. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed beamformers that fulfil both the
intranode array gain and distributed array gain outperform other relaying
schemes under different system parameters in terms of the ergodic capacity.
