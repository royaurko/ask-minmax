The problem of randomly forced Burgers turbulence ("Burgulence") is
considered in terms of the toy Gaussian Larkin model of directed polymers. In
terms of the replica technique the explicit expressions for the two-time
four-point free energy distribution function is obtained which makes possible
to derive the exact result for the two-time velocity distribution function in
the corresponding Burgulence problem.
