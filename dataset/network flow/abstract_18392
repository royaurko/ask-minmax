Films composed of nanotube networks have their conductivities regulated by
the junction resistances formed between tubes. Conductivity values are enhanced
by lower junction resistances but should reach a maximum that is limited by the
network morphology. By considering ideal ballistic-like contacts between
nanotubes we use the Kubo formalism to calculate the upper bound for the
conductivity of such films and show how it depends on the nanotube
concentration as well as on their aspect ratio. Highest measured conductivities
reported so far are approaching this limiting value, suggesting that further
progress lies with nanowires other than nanotubes.
