This article provides a unifying Bayesian network view on various approaches
for acoustic model adaptation, missing feature, and uncertainty decoding that
are well-known in the literature of robust automatic speech recognition. The
representatives of these classes can often be deduced from a Bayesian network
that extends the conventional hidden Markov models used in speech recognition.
These extensions, in turn, can in many cases be motivated from an underlying
observation model that relates clean and distorted feature vectors. By
converting the observation models into a Bayesian network representation, we
formulate the corresponding compensation rules leading to a unified view on
known derivations as well as to new formulations for certain approaches. The
generic Bayesian perspective provided in this contribution thus highlights
structural differences and similarities between the analyzed approaches.
