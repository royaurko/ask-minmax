The aim of this technical report is to give a short overview of known
techniques for network tomography (introduced in the paper of Vardi (1996)),
extended by a Bayesian approach originating Tebaldi and West (1998). Since the
studies of A.K. Erlang (1878-1929) on telephone networks in the last
millennium, lots of needs are seen in todays applications of networks and
network tomography, so for instance networks are a critical component of the
information structure supporting finance, commerce and even civil and national
defence. An attack on a network can be performed as an intrusion in the network
or as sending a lot of fault information and disturbing the network flow. Such
attacks can be detected by modelling the traffic flows in a network, by
counting the source destination packets and even by measuring counts over time
and by drawing a comparison with this 'time series' for instance.
