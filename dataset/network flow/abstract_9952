Large elliptic flow at RHIC seems to indicate that ideal hydrodynamics
provides a good description of Au-Au collisions, at least at the maximum RHIC
energy. The medium formed has been interpreted as a nearly perfect
(low-viscosity) liquid, and connections have been made to gravitation through
string theory. Recently, claimed observations of large flow fluctuations
comparable to participant eccentricity fluctuations seem to confirm the ideal
hydro scenario. However, determination of the azimuth quadrupole with 2D
angular autocorrelations, which accurately distinguish ``flow'' (quadrupole)
from ``nonflow'' (minijets), contradicts conventional interpretations.
Centrality trends may depend only on the initial parton geometry, and methods
used to isolate flow fluctuations are sensitive instead mainly to minijet
correlations. The results presented in this paper suggest that the azimuth
quadrupole may be a manifestation of gluonic multipole radiation.
