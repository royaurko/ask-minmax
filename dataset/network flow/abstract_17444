By performing sound scattering measurements with a detector array consisting
of 62 elements in a flow between two counter-rotating disks we obtain the
energy and vorticity power spectra directly in both spatial and temporal
domains. Fast accumulated statistics and large signal-to-noise ratio allow to
get high quality data rather effectively and to test scaling laws in details.
