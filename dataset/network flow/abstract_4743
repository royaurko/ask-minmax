The flow of granular material through an orifice is studied experimentally as
a function of force $F$ pushing the flow. It is found that the flow rate
increases linearly with $F$ -- a new, unexpected result that is in contrast to
the usual view that $F$, completely screened by an arch formed around the
orifice, has no way of altering the rate. Employing energy balance, we show
that this behavior results mainly from dissipation in the granular material.
