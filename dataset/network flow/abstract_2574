This paper contains the details of a distributed trust-aware recommendation
system. Trust-base recommenders have received a lot of attention recently. The
main aim of trust-based recommendation is to deal the problems in traditional
Collaborative Filtering recommenders. These problems include cold start users,
vulnerability to attacks, etc.. Our proposed method is a distributed approach
and can be easily deployed on social networks or real life networks such as
sensor networks or peer to peer networks.
