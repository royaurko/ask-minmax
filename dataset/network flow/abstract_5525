Even though channel assignment has been studied for years, the performance of
most IEEE 802.11-based multi-hop wireless networks such as wireless sensor
network (WSN), wireless mesh network (WMN), mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is
limited by channel interference. Properly assigning orthogonal channels to
wireless links can improve the throughput of multi-hop networks. To solve the
dynamic channel assignment problem, a routing-based channel assignment
algorithm called R-CA is proposed. R-CA can allocate channels for wireless
nodes when needed and free channels after data transmission. Thus more channel
resource can be explored by wireless nodes. Simulation results show that R-CA
can effectively enhance the network throughput and packet delivery rate.
