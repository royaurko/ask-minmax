In this paper we have studied downlink packet scheduling algorithms proposed
for LTE cellular networks. The study emphasize on three most promising
scheduling algorithms such as: FLS, EXP rule and LOG rule. The performance of
these three algorithms is conducted over video traffic in a vehicular
environment using LTE-Sim simulator. The simulation was setup with varying
number of users from 10 - 60 in fixed bounded regions of 1 km radius. The main
goal this study is to provide results that will help in the design process of
packet scheduler for LTE cellular networks, aiming to get better overall
performance users. Simulation results show that, the FLS scheme outperforms in
terms of average system throughput, average packet delay, PLR; and with a
satisfactory level of fairness index.
