The deployment of business critical applications and information
infrastructures are moving to the cloud. This means they are hosted in large
scale data centers with other business applications and infrastructures with
less (or none) mission critical constraints. This mixed and complex environment
makes very challenging the process of monitoring critical applications and
handling (detecting and recovering) possible failures of servers' data center
that could affect responsiveness and/or reliability of mission critical
applications. Monitoring mechanisms used in data center are usually intrusive
in the sense that they need to install agents on each single server. This has
considerable drawbacks: huge usage of human resources to install and patch the
system and interference with the critical application because agents share
application resources. In order to detect (and possibly predict) failures in
data centers the paper does a first attempt in showing the correlation between
network traffic and servers' power consumption. This is an important step in
deriving non-intrusive monitoring systems, as both network traffic and power
consumption can be captured without installing any software at the servers.
This will improve in its turn the overall resiliency of the data center and its
self-managing capacity.
