The logarithmic asymptotics for the growth of the number of periodic orbits,
such that the norm of the corresponding renormalization matrix does not exceed
a given constant, is computed for the Teichmueller flow on Veech's moduli space
of zippered rectangles. The rate is equal to the entropy of the flow with
respect to the absolutely continuous invariant measure.
