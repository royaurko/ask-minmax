In a series of papers, Nakajima uses quiver varieties to give a geometric
construction of representations of Kac-Moody algebras and other related
algebras. The generators of the algebras are constructed using the Hecke
correspondence as a correspondence variety. The main result of this paper is a
different construction of the Hecke correspondence using gradient flow lines
for the norm-square of a moment map. We also prove a similar result for handsaw
quvers and give gradient flow constructions of Nakajima's Lagrangian subvariety
and Kashiwara's operators on crystal bases.
