Threats on the stability of a financial system may severely affect the
functioning of the entire economy, and thus considerable emphasis is placed on
the analyzing the cause and effect of such threats. The financial crisis in the
current and past decade has shown that one important cause of instability in
global markets is the so-called financial contagion, namely the spreading of
instabilities or failures of individual components of the network to other,
perhaps healthier, components. This leads to a natural question of whether the
regulatory contributorities could have predicted and perhaps mitigated the current
economic crisis by effective computations of some stability measure of the
banking networks. Motivated by such observations, we consider the problem of
defining and evaluating stabilities of both homogeneous and heterogeneous
banking networks against propagation of synchronous idiosyncratic shocks given
to a subset of banks. We formalize the homogeneous banking network model of
Nier et al. and its corresponding heterogeneous version, formalize the
synchronous shock propagation procedures, define two appropriate stability
measures and investigate the computational complexities of evaluating these
measures for various network topologies and parameters of interest. Our results
and proofs also shed some light on the properties of topologies and parameters
of the network that may lead to higher or lower stabilities.
