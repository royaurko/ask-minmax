The Networks Mobility (NEMO) Protocol is a way of managing the mobility of an
entire network, and mobile internet protocol is the basic solution for Networks
Mobility. A hierarchical route optimization system for mobile network is
proposed to solve management of hierarchical route optimization problems. In
present paper, we study Hierarchical Route Optimization Scheme using Tree
Information Option (HROSTIO). The concept of optimization finding the extreme
of a function that maps candidate solution to scalar values of quality, is an
extremely general and useful idea. For solving this problem, we use a few
salient adaptations and we also extend HROSTIO perform routing between the
mobile networks.
