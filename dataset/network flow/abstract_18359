This paper studies the performance of partial-Rake (PRake) receivers in
impulse-radio ultrawideband wireless networks when an energy-efficient power
control scheme is adopted. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the
multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By using noncooperative
game-theoretic models and large system analysis, explicit expressions are
derived in terms of network parameters to measure the effects of self- and
multiple-access interference at a receiving access point. Performance of the
PRake is compared in terms of achieved utilities and loss to that of the
all-Rake receiver.
