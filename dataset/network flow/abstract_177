Cooperation in merging is introduced by adding interactions between pairs of
vehicles in opposite lanes. Simulations with an improved version of the
modified optimal velocity model are done for two lanes merging into a single
lane. For ~30 seconds prior to reaching the merge region, vehicles in both
lanes adjust their headways to create safe distances in front of and behind the
merging vehicle. Cooperation prevents the transition from free flow to
synchronous flow that occurs for normal merging, provided the merge region is
sufficiently large and the total incoming flow does not exceed the maximum
possible single-lane flow. No long-range vehicle-to-vehicle communication is
required for the type of cooperation considered.
