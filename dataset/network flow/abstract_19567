A wave equation for a time-dependent perturbation about the steady
shallow-water solution emulates the metric an acoustic white hole, even upon
the incorporation of nonlinearity in the lowest order. A standing wave in the
sub-critical region of the flow is stabilised by viscosity, and the resulting
time scale for the amplitude decay helps in providing a scaling argument for
the formation of the hydraulic jump. A standing wave in the super-critical
region, on the other hand, displays an unstable character, which, although
somewhat mitigated by viscosity, needs nonlinear effects to be saturated. A
travelling wave moving upstream from the sub-critical region, destabilises the
flow in the vicinity of the jump, for which experimental support has been
given.
