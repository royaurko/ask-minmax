The distributed control systems are more and more used in many industrial
applications. These systems are often referred as "Networked control systems".
The goal of this paper is to show the network influence on feedback control
systems. Two networks are considered: Switched Ethernet network and CAN
fieldbus. The first one represents the non deterministic network and second one
represents the deterministic one. Several scenarii are studied to analyse the
stability of system according to different network parameters (packets losses,
congestion and frame priority). The Truetime simulator is used in this work.
