Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cylindrical container can take on many
different spatial forms. Motivated by the results of Hof, Lucas and Mullin
[Phys. Fluids 11, 2815 (1999)], who observed coexistence of several stable
states at a single set of parameter values, we have carried out simulations at
the same Prandtl number, that of water, and radius-to-height aspect ratio of
two. We have used two kinds of thermal boundary conditions: perfectly
insulating sidewalls and perfectly conducting sidewalls. In both cases we
obtain a wide variety of coexisting steady and time-dependent flows.
