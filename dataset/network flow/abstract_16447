In order to accommodate an increasing demand for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with
desirable characteristics one has to understand the origin of helicity of their
structures. Here, through in situ microscopy we demonstrate that the nucleation
of a carbon nanotube is initiated by the formation of the carbon cap.
Nucleation begins with the formation of a graphene embryo that is bound between
opposite step-edges on the nickel catalyst surface. The embryo grows larger as
the step-edges migrate along the surface, leading to the formation of a curved
carbon cap when the steps flow across the edges of adjacent facets. Further
motion of the steps away from the catalyst tip with attached rims of the carbon
cap generates the wall of the nanotube. Density Functional Theory calculations
bring further insight into the process, showing that step flow occurs by
surface self diffusion of the nickel atoms via a step-edge
attachment-detachment mechanism. Since the fact that cap forms first in the
sequence of stages involved in nanotube growth, we suggest that it originates
the helicity of the nanotube. Therefore, the angular distribution of catalyst
facets could be exploited as a new parameter for controlling the curvature of
the cap and, presumably, the helicity of the nanotube.
