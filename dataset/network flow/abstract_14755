We study the dynamical interaction of the G2 cloud with the accretion flow
around Sgr A* by means of three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations. We show
the effects of the rotating accretion flow on the evolution of G2 by projecting
the cloud density onto the plane of the sky, and extracting position-velocity
diagrams. We study a number of possible orientations of the cloud orbit with
respect to the disk. We find that once the center of mass of the cloud has
crossed the pericenter, the differences between models becomes significant.
Models with the cloud counter-rotating with respect to the disk are expected to
reach higher blue-shifted line of sight velocities. The spatial extent of the
emission depends strongly on the cloud-to-disk inclination angle. Future
imaging and spectroscopy of G2 emission will shed light both on the structure
of the Sgr A* disk and on the properties of the cloud.
