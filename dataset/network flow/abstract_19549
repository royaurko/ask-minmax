We consider a magnetic s=1/2 impurity in the antiferromagnetic spin chain as
a function of two coupling parameters: the symmetric coupling of the impurity
to two sites in the chain $J_1$ and the coupling between the two sites $J_2$.
By using field theory arguments and numerical calculations we can identify all
possible fixed points and classify the renormalization flow between them, which
leads to a non-trivial phase diagram. Depending on the detailed choice of the
two (frustrating) coupling strengths, the stable phases correspond either to a
decoupled spin with Curie law behavior or to a non-Fermi liquid fixed point
with a logarithmically diverging impurity susceptibility as in the two channel
Kondo effect. Our results resolve a controversy about the renormalization flow.
