Modern networks are large, highly complex and dynamic. Add to that the
mobility of the agents comprising many of these networks. It is difficult or
even impossible for such systems to be managed centrally in an efficient
manner. It is imperative for such systems to attain a degree of
self-management. Self-healing i.e. the capability of a system in a good state
to recover to another good state in face of an attack, is desirable for such
systems. In this paper, we discuss the self-healing model for dynamic
reconfigurable systems. In this model, an omniscient adversary inserts or
deletes nodes from a network and the algorithm responds by adding a limited
number of edges in order to maintain invariants of the network. We look at some
of the results in this model and argue for their applicability and further
extensions of the results and the model. We also look at some of the techniques
we have used in our earlier work, in particular, we look at the idea of
maintaining virtual graphs mapped over the existing network and assert that
this may be a useful technique to use in many problem domains.
