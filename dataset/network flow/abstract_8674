We study the evolution of heterogeneous networks of oscillators subject to a
state-dependent interconnection rule. We find that heterogeneity in the node
dynamics is key in organizing the architecture of the functional emerging
networks. We demonstrate that increasing heterogeneity among the nodes in
state-dependent networks of phase oscillators causes a differentiation in the
activation probabilities of the links. This, in turn, yields the formation of
hubs associated to nodes with larger distances from the average frequency of
the ensemble. Our generic local evolutionary strategy can be used to solve a
wide range of synchronization and control problems.
