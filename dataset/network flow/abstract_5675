We introduce the concept of communicability angle between a pair of nodes in
a graph. We provide strong analytical and empirical evidence that the average
communicability angle for a given network accounts for its spatial efficiency
on the basis of the communications among the nodes in a network. We determine
characteristics of the spatial efficiency of more than a hundred real-world
complex networks that represent complex systems arising in a diverse set of
scenarios. In particular, we find that the communicability angle correlates
very well with the experimentally measured value of the relative packing
efficiency of proteins that are represented as residue networks. We finally
show how we can modulate the spatial efficiency of a network by tuning the
weights of the edges of the networks. This allows us to predict effects of
external stresses on the spatial efficiency of a network as well as to design
strategies to improve important parameters in real-world complex systems.
