We have investigated the build up of anisotropic flows within a parton
cascade approach at fixed shear viscosity to entropy density \eta/s to study
the generation of collective flows in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.
We present a study of the impact of a temperature dependent \eta/s(T) on the
generation of the elliptic flow at both RHIC and LHC. Finally we show that the
transport approach, thanks to its wide validity range, is able to describe
naturally the rise - fall and saturation of the v_2(p_T) observed at LHC.
