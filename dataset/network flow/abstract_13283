The paper describes a mathematical model on the physical principles of the
Pitot device for acquiring flows speed. The relation between speed and static
pressures is derived from simple integration of the fluid dynamics equations
for an inviscid flow. In this way, the treatment is general and is not based on
the Bernoulli theorem on energy conservation, as usually done in scientific and
technical literature. The application to Formula 1 cars is discussed.
