We present a neural network based approach to the determination of
photometric redshift. The method was tested on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Early Data Release (SDSS-EDR) reaching an accuracy comparable and, in some
cases, better than SED template fitting techniques. Different neural networks
architecture have been tested and the combination of a Multi Layer Perceptron
with 1 hidden layer (22 neurons) operated in a Bayesian framework, with a Self
Organizing Map used to estimate the accuracy of the results, turned out to be
the most effective. In the best experiment, the implemented network reached an
accuracy of 0.020 (interquartile error) in the range 0<zphot<0.3, and of 0.022
in the range 0<zphot<0.5.
