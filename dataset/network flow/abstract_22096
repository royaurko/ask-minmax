We suggest baryon-baryon correlations as an experimentally accessible
signature for a first-order phase transition between a baryon-rich phase, like
quarkyonic, and a baryon-suppressed hadronic phase in the QCD phase diagram. We
examine the consequences of baryon-rich bubble formation in an expanding medium
and show how the two-particle correlations vary in the transverse and
longitudinal direction depending on the strength of the radial flow, the bubble
temperature, and the time when the baryons are emitted.
