Graph partitioning, a well studied problem of parallel computing has many
applications in diversified fields such as distributed computing, social
network analysis, data mining and many other domains. In this paper, we
introduce FGPGA, an efficient genetic approach for producing feasible graph
partitions. Our method takes into account the heterogeneity and capacity
constraints of the partitions to ensure balanced partitioning. Such approach
has various applications in mobile cloud computing that include feasible
deployment of software applications on the more resourceful infrastructure in
the cloud instead of mobile hand set. Our proposed approach is light weight and
hence suitable for use in cloud architecture. We ensure feasibility of the
partitions generated by not allowing over-sized partitions to be generated
during the initialization and search. Our proposed method tested on standard
benchmark datasets significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
terms of quality of partitions and feasibility of the solutions.
