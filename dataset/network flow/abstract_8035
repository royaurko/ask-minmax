In this article it is given a new elementary proof of the well known fact
that self-shrinking and self-expanding solutions to the curve shortening flow
are planar. It is also deduced a description of the curves of Abresch and
Langer in terms of solutions to a simple ODE. A short introduction with
motivations for the flow was included to make it accessible for readers with
little knowledge in differential geometry.
