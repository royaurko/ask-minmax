We study analytically and numerically a bistable reaction-diffusion equation
on an arbitrary finite network. We prove that stable fixed points
(multi-fronts) exist for any configuration as long as the diffusion is small.
We also study fold bifurcations leading to depinning and give a simple
depinning criterion. These results are confirmed by using continuation
techniques from bifurcation theory and by solving the time dependent problem
near the treshold. A qualitative comparison principle is proved and verified
for time dependent solutions, and for some related models.
