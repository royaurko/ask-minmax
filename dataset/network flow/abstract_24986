  The space complexity of the maximum flow problem is investigated. It is shown that the problem is log space complete for deterministic polynomial time. Thus the maximum flow problem probably has no algorithm which needs only O(log k n ) storage space for any constant k . Another consequence is that there is probably no fast parallel algorithm for the maximum flow problem.
