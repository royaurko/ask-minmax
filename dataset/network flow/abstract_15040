Management of communication by on-line routing in new FPGAs with a large
amount of logic resources and partial reconfigurability is a new challenging
problem. A Network-on-Chip
 (NoC) typically uses packet routing mechanism, which has often unsafe data
transfers, and network interface overhead. In this paper, circuit routing for
such dynamic NoCs is investigated, and a practical 1-dimensional network with
an efficient routing algorithm is proposed and implemented. Also, this concept
has been extended to the 2-dimensional case. The implementation results show
the low area overhead and high performance of this network.
