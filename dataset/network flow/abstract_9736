In a patent technology network map, almost all pairs of technology classes
are connected, whereas most of the connections are extremely weak. This
observation suggests the need and also the possibility to filter the network
map by removing the negligible and noisy links. But link removal may reduce the
power of the network for predicting the cross-field patent portfolio
diversification of inventors and inventing organizations. This paper proposes a
metric for such predictive power of a patent network, and a method that allows
one to objectively choose a best tradeoff between predictive power and the
removal of weak links. We show the results that identify filtered networks
below the optimal tradeoff, and also remove a degree of arbitrariness compared
with other filtering treatments from the literature. On that basis, we further
demonstrate the use of filtered technology maps to visualize and analyze the
main paths of patent portfolio diversification of a prolific inventor (Leonard
Forbes) and a technology company (Google Inc.).
