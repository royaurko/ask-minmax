In this paper, a new cooperation structure for spectrum sensing in cognitive
radio networks is proposed which outperforms existing commonly-used ones in
terms of energy efficiency. The energy efficiency is achieved in the proposed
design by introducing random energy-saving interruptions in the cooperation
process between the sensing nodes and the fusion center, along with a
compensation process at the fusion center. The proposed system behavior is
thoroughly analyzed and its associated likelihood-ratio test (LRT) is provided.
In addition, the optimization of the proposed system performance is formulated
based on deflection criterion and in the form of a convex-over-convex
fractional program, taking into account as a tradeoff, the energy consumption
at the local sensing and reporting phases of this cooperation jointly with the
overall detection performance. Then, the global optimization procedure of the
problem is discussed and an effective low-complexity suboptimal approach is
developed through converting the optimization into a convex semidefinite
programming (SDP) problem which can be solved in polynomial time. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed architecture and its associated SDP are
demonstrated by a set of illustrative numerical results.
