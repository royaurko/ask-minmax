We analyze the statistics of water droplet avalanches in a continuously
driven system.  Distributions are obtained for avalanche size, lifetime,
and time between successive avalanches, along with power spectra and return
maps.  For low flow rates and different water viscosities, we observe a
power-law scaling in the size and lifetime distributions of water droplet
avalanches, indicating that a state with no characteristic time and length
scales was reached.  Higher flow rates resulted in an exponential behavior
with characteristic scales.
