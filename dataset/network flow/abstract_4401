In this work we study diffusion in networks with community structure. We
first replicate and extend work on networks with non-overlapping community
structure. We then study diffusion on network models that have overlapping
community structure. We study contagions in the standard SIR model, and complex
contagions thought to be better models of some social diffusion processes.
Finally, we investigate diffusion on empirical networks with known overlapping
community structure, by analysing the structure of such networks, and by
simulating contagion on them. We find that simple and complex contagions can
spread fast in networks with overlapping community structure. We also find that
short paths exist through overlapping community structure on empirical
networks.
