It has been suggested that the final stages of accretion in present--day
giant elliptical galaxies occur in an advection-dominated mode. The poor
radiative efficiency of this accretion solution accounts for the fact that
massive black holes, which are believed to reside in the centres of these
galaxies, do not have the luminosities expected if accretion from the hot
interstellar medium occurs at the Bondi rate. We discuss the
advection-dominated solution for the nucleus of M60 (NGC 4649) and show that
accretion at the Bondi rate is consistent with the core flux from radio to
X-ray. This solution allows for a black hole mass of ~ 10^9 solar masses as
required by independent arguments. The successful application of this model to
both M60, and previously to the well known nucleus of M87, suggests that
accretion of hot gas in an elliptical galaxy creates the ideal circumstances
for advection-dominated accretion flows to operate.
