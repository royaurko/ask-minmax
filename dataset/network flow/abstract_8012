In this paper, we prove short time existence and uniqueness of smooth
evolution by mean curvature in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ starting from any
$n$-dimensional $(\varepsilon,R)$-Reifenberg flat set with $\varepsilon$
sufficiently small. More precisely, we show that the level set flow in such a
situation is non-fattening and smooth. These sets have a weak metric notion of
tangent planes at every small scale, but the tangents are allowed to tilt as
the scales vary. As this class is wide enough to include some fractal sets,
this provides the first example (when $n>1$) of unique smoothing by mean
curvature flow of sets with Hausdorff dimension $> n$.
