We define regularity scales to study the behavior of the Calabi flow. Based
on estimates of the regularity scales, we obtain convergence theorems of the
Calabi flow on extremal Kahler surfaces, under the assumption of global
existence of the Calabi flow solutions. Our results partially confirm
Donaldson's conjectural picture for the Calabi flow in complex dimension 2.
Similar results hold in high dimension with an extra assumption that the scalar
curvature is uniformly bounded.
