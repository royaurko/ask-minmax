As the demand of, requesting the Internet without any disturbance by the
mobile users of any network is increasing the IETF started working on Network
Mobility (NEMO). Maintaining the session of all the nodes in mobile network
with its home network and external nodes can be provided by the basic Network
Mobility support protocol. It provides mobility at IP level to complete
networks, allowing a Mobile Network to change its point of attachment to the
Internet, while maintaining the ongoing sessions of the nodes of the network.
The Mobile Router (MR) manages the mobility even though the nodes don't know
the status of mobility. This article discusses few basic concepts and
limitations of NEMO protocol and proposes two ways to optimize the NEMO routing
technique for registered and unregistered Correspondent Nodes (CN) of the
Mobile Network Node (MNN).
