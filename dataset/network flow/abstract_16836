In this work we start walking the path to a new perspective for viewing
cyberwarfare scenarios, by introducing conceptual tools (a formal model) to
evaluate the costs of an attack, to describe the theater of operations,
targets, missions, actions, plans and assets involved in cyberwarfare attacks.
We also describe two applications of this model: autonomous planning leading to
automated penetration tests, and attack simulations, allowing a system
administrator to evaluate the vulnerabilities of his network.
