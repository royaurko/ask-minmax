The degree distributions of many real world networks follow power-laws whose
exponents tend to fall between two and three. Within the framework of the
Barabasi-Albert model (BA model), we explain this empirical observation by a
simple fact. To that end we propose a modified BA model with one parameter that
serves as a regulatory factor for the growth rate of added links in scale-free
networks. The regulatory factor has something to do with the obvious fact that
one link has two nodes. The modified model also allows to connect nodes by
newly added links that do not necessarily emanate from new nodes. Another
related model using the master equation is also given, from which the same
power-law degree distribution can be derived.
