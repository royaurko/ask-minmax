Intriguing analogies were found between a model of plastic deformation in
crystals and turbulence in fluids. A study of this model provides remarkable
explanations of known experiments and predicts fractal dislocation pattern
formation. Further, the challenges encountered resemble those in turbulence,
which is exemplified in a comparison with the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.
