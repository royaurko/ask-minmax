We develop a model in two dimensions to characterise the growth rate of a
tracer gradient mixed by a statistically homogeneous flow with rapid temporal
variations. % % The model is based on the orientation dynamics of the
passive-tracer gradient with respect to the straining (compressive) direction
of the flow, and involves reducing the dynamics to a set of stochastic
differential equations. The statistical properties of the system emerge from
solving the associated Fokker--Planck equation. In a certain limiting case, and
within the model framework, there is a rigorous proof that the tracer gradient
aligns with the compressive direction. This limit involves decorrelated flows
whose mean vorticity is zero. % % % Using numerical simulations, we assess the
extent to which our model applies to real mixing protocols, and map the
stochastic parameters on to flow parameters.
