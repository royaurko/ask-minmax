Dynamics of information flow in adaptively interacting stochastic processes
is studied. We give an extended form of game dynamics for Markovian processes
and study its behavior to observe information flow through the system. Examples
of the adaptive dynamics for two stochastic processes interacting through
matching pennies game interaction are exhibited along with underlying causal
structure.
