We model smart grids as complex interdependent networks, and study targeted
attacks on smart grids for the first time. A smart grid consists of two
networks: the power network and the communication network, interconnected by
edges. Occurrence of failures (attacks) in one network triggers failures in the
other network, and propagates in cascades across the networks. Such cascading
failures can result in disintegration of either (or both) of the networks.
Earlier works considered only random failures. In practical situations, an
attacker is more likely to compromise nodes selectively.
  We study cascading failures in smart grids, where an attacker selectively
compromises the nodes with probabilities proportional to their degrees; high
degree nodes are compromised with higher probability. We mathematically analyze
the sizes of the giant components of the networks under targeted attacks, and
compare the results with the corresponding sizes under random attacks. We show
that networks disintegrate faster for targeted attacks compared to random
attacks. A targeted attack on a small fraction of high degree nodes
disintegrates one or both of the networks, whereas both the networks contain
giant components for random attack on the same fraction of nodes.
