We study the spectral flowed sectors of the H3 WZW model in the context of
the holographic duality between type IIB string theory in AdS(3)x S^3 x T^4
with NSNS flux and the symmetric product orbifold of T^4. We construct
explicitly the physical vertex operators in the flowed sectors that belong to
short representations of the superalgebra, thus completing the bulk-to-boundary
dictionary for 1/2 BPS states. We perform a partial calculation of the string
three-point functions of these operators. A complete calculation would require
the three-point couplings of non-extremal flowed operators in the H3 WZW model,
which are at present unavailable. In the unflowed sector, perfect agreement has
recently been found between the bulk and boundary three-point functions of 1/2
BPS operators. Assuming that this agreement persists in the flowed sectors, we
determine certain unknown three-point couplings in the H3 WZW model in terms of
three-point couplings of affine descendants in the SU(2) WZW model.
