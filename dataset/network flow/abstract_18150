Because a delay tolerant network (DTN) can often be partitioned, the problem
of routing is very challenging. However, routing benefits considerably if one
can take advantage of knowledge concerning node mobility. This paper addresses
this problem with a generic algorithm based on the use of a high-dimensional
Euclidean space, that we call MobySpace, constructed upon nodes' mobility
patterns. We provide here an analysis and the large scale evaluation of this
routing scheme in the context of ambient networking by replaying real mobility
traces. The specific MobySpace evaluated is based on the frequency of visit of
nodes for each possible location. We show that the MobySpace can achieve good
performance compared to that of the other algorithms we implemented, especially
when we perform routing on the nodes that have a high connection time. We
determine that the degree of homogeneity of mobility patterns of nodes has a
high impact on routing. And finally, we study the ability of nodes to learn
their own mobility patterns.
