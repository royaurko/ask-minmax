Quality of service (QoS) for a network is characterized in terms of various
parameters specifying packet delay and loss tolerance requirements for the
application. The unpredictable nature of the wireless channel demands for
application of certain mechanisms to meet the QoS requirements. Traditionally,
medium access control (MAC) and network layers perform these tasks. However,
these mechanisms do not take (fading) channel conditions into account. In this
paper, we investigate the problem using cross layer techniques where
information flow and joint optimization of higher and physical layer is
permitted. We propose a scheduling scheme to optimize the energy consumption of
a multiuser multi-access system such that QoS constraints in terms of packet
loss are fulfilled while the system is able to maximize the advantages emerging
from multiuser diversity. Specifically, this work focuses on modeling and
analyzing the effects of packet buffering capabilities of the transmitter on
the system energy for a packet loss tolerant application. We discuss low
complexity schemes which show comparable performance to the proposed scheme.
The numerical evaluation reveals useful insights about the coupling effects of
different QoS parameters on the system energy consumption and validates our
analytical results.
