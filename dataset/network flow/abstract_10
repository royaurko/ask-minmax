We consider a dissipative flow network that obeys the standard linear nodal
flow conservation, and where flows on edges are driven by potential difference
between adjacent nodes. We show that in the case when the flow is a
monotonically increasing function of the potential difference, solution of the
network flow equations is unique and can be equivalently recast as the solution
of a strictly convex optimization problem. We also analyze the maximum
throughput problem on such networks seeking to maximize the amount of flow that
can be delivered to the loads while satisfying bounds on the node potentials.
When the dissipation function is differentiable we develop a representation of
the maximum throughput problem in the form of a twice differentiable biconvex
optimization problem exploiting the variational representation of the network
flow equations. In the process we prove a special case of a certain
monotonicity property of dissipative flow networks. When the dissipation
function follows a power law with exponent greater than one, we suggest a mixed
integer convex relaxation of the maximum throughput problem. Finally, we
illustrate application of these general results to balanced, i.e. steady,
natural gas networks also validating the theory results through simulations on
a test case.
