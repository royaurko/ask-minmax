Recently, we have proposed a {\em Euler-Lagrange transformation} for cellular
automata(CA) by developing new transformation formulas. Applying this method to
the Burgers CA(BCA), we have succeeded in obtaining the Lagrange representation
of the BCA. In this paper, we apply this method to multi-value generalized
Burgers CA(GBCA) which include the Fukui-Ishibashi model and the quick-start
model associated with traffic flow. As a result, we have succeeded in
clarifying the Euler-Lagrange correspondence of these models. It turns out,
moreover that the GBCA can naturally be considered as a simple model of a
multi-lane traffic flow.
