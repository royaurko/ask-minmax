The problem of hydraulic fracture for the PKN model is considered within the
framework presented recently by Linkov (2011). The modified formulation is
further enhanced by employing an improved regularized boundary condition near
the crack tip. This increases solution accuracy especially for singular
leak-off regimes. A new dependent variable having clear physical sense is
introduced. A comprehensive analysis of numerical algorithms based on various
dependent variables is provided. Comparison with know numerical results has
been given.
