In this paper, we prove that if the initial submanifold $M_0$ of dimension
$n(\ge6)$ satisfies an optimal pinching condition, then the mean curvature flow
of arbitrary codimension in hyperbolic spaces converges to a round point in
finite time. In particular, we obtain the optimal differentiable sphere theorem
for submanifolds in hyperbolic spaces. It should be emphasized that our
pinching condition implies that the Ricci curvature of the initial submanifold
is positive, but does not imply positivity of the sectional curvature of $M_0$.
