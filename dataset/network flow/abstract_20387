PyFR is an open-source high-order accurate computational fluid dynamics
solver for mixed unstructured grids that can target a range of hardware
platforms from a single codebase. In this paper we demonstrate the ability of
PyFR to perform high-order accurate unsteady simulations of flow on mixed
unstructured grids using heterogeneous multi-node hardware. Specifically, after
benchmarking single-node performance for various platforms, PyFR v0.2.2 is used
to undertake simulations of unsteady flow over a circular cylinder at Reynolds
number 3 900 using a mixed unstructured grid of prismatic and tetrahedral
elements on a desktop workstation containing an Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 CPU, an
NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU, and an AMD FirePro W9100 GPU. Both the performance and
accuracy of PyFR are assessed. PyFR v0.2.2 is freely available under a 3-Clause
New Style BSD license (see www.pyfr.org).
