The Cahn-Hilliard equation describes phase separation in binary liquids. Here
we study this equation with spatially-varying sources and stirring, or
advection. We specialize to symmetric mixtures and time-independent sources and
discuss stirring strategies that homogenize the binary fluid. By measuring
fluctuations of the composition away from its mean value, we quantify the
amount of homogenization achievable. We find upper and lower bounds on our
measure of homogenization using only the Cahn-Hilliard equation and the
incompressibility of the advecting flow. We compare these theoretical bounds
with numerical simulations for two model flows: the constant flow, and the
random-phase sine flow. Using the sine flow as an example, we show how our
bounds on composition fluctuations provide a measure of the effectiveness of a
given stirring protocol in homogenizing a phase-separating binary fluid.
