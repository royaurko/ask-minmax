Deep convolutional neural networks have led to breakthrough results in
practical feature extraction applications. The mathematical analysis of these
networks was pioneered by Mallat, 2012. Specifically, Mallat considered
so-called scattering networks based on identical semi-discrete wavelet frames
in each network layer, and proved translation-invariance as well as deformation
stability of the resulting feature extractor. The purpose of this paper is to
develop Mallat's theory further by allowing for different and, most
importantly, general semi-discrete frames (such as, e.g., Gabor frames,
wavelets, curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets) in distinct network layers. This
allows to extract wider classes of features than point singularities resolved
by the wavelet transform. Our generalized feature extractor is proven to be
translation-invariant, and we develop deformation stability results for a
larger class of deformations than those considered by Mallat. For Mallat's
wavelet-based feature extractor, we get rid of a number of technical
conditions. The mathematical engine behind our results is continuous frame
theory, which allows us to completely detach the invariance and deformation
stability proofs from the particular algebraic structure of the underlying
frames.
