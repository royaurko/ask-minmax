Wireless ad hoc networks are seldom characterized by one single performance
metric, yet the current literature lacks a flexible framework to assist in
characterizing the design tradeoffs in such networks. In this work, we address
this problem by proposing a new modeling framework for routing in ad hoc
networks, which used in conjunction with metaheuristic multiobjective search
algorithms, will result in a better understanding of network behavior and
performance when multiple criteria are relevant. Our approach is to take a
holistic view of the network that captures the cross-interactions among
interference management techniques implemented at various layers of the
protocol stack. The resulting framework is a complex multiobjective
optimization problem that can be efficiently solved through existing
multiobjective search techniques. In this contribution, we present the Pareto
optimal sets for an example sensor network when delay, robustness and energy
are considered. The aim of this paper is to present the framework and hence for
conciseness purposes, the multiobjective optimization search is not developed
herein.
