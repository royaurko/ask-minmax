Present work proposes a theoretical statistical model of the downlink power
consumption in cellular CDMA networks. The proposed model employs a simple but
popular propagation model, which breaks down path losses into a distance
dependent and a log-normal shadowing loss term. Based on the aforementioned
path loss formalism, closed-form expressions for the first and the second
moment of power consumption are obtained taking into account conditions placed
by cell selection and handoff algorithms. Numerical results for various radio
propagation environments and cell selection as well as handoff schemes are
provided and discussed.
