We investigate diffusion in supersonic, turbulent, compressible flows.
Supersonic turbulence can be characterized as network of interacting shocks. We
consider flows with different rms Mach numbers and where energy necessary to
maintain dynamical equilibrium is inserted at different spatial scales. We find
that turbulent transport exhibits super-diffusive behavior due to induced bulk
motions. In a comoving reference frame, however, diffusion behaves normal and
can be described by mixing length theory extended into the supersonic regime.
