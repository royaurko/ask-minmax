We present Chandra HETG spectra of seven cataclysmic variables. We find that
they divide unambiguously into two distinct types. Spectra of the first type
are remarkably well fit by a simple cooling flow model, which assumes only
steady-state isobaric radiative cooling. The maximum temperature and the
normalization, which provides a highly precise measurement of the accretion
rate, are the only free parameters of this model. Spectra of the second type
are grossly inconsistent with a cooling flow model. They instead exhibit a hard
continuum, and show strong H-like and He-like ion emission but little Fe
L-shell emission, which is consistent with expectations for line emission from
a photoionized plasma. Using a simple photoionization model, we argue that the
observed line emission for these sources can be driven entirely by the hard
continuum. The physical significance of these two distinct types of X-ray
spectra is also explored.
