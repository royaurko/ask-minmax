There is considerable interest in developing techniques for predicting human
behavior, for instance to enable emerging contentious situations to be forecast
or the nature of ongoing but hidden activities to be inferred. A promising
approach to this problem is to identify and collect appropriate empirical data
and then apply machine learning methods to these data to generate the
predictions. This paper shows the performance of such learning algorithms often
can be improved substantially by leveraging sociological models in their
development and implementation. In particular, we demonstrate that
sociologically-grounded learning algorithms outperform gold-standard methods in
three important and challenging tasks: 1.) inferring the (unobserved) nature of
relationships in adversarial social networks, 2.) predicting whether nascent
social diffusion events will go viral, and 3.) anticipating and defending
future actions of opponents in adversarial settings. Significantly, the new
algorithms perform well even when there is limited data available for their
training and execution.
