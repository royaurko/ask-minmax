We present a detailed analysis of single-vehicle data which sheds some light
on the microscopic interaction of the vehicles. Besides the analysis of free
flow and synchronized traffic the data sets especially provide information
about wide jams which persist for a long time. The data have been collected at
a location far away from ramps and in the absence of speed limits which allows
a comparison with idealized traffic simulations. We also resolve some open
questions concerning the time-headway distribution.
