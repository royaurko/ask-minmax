In this paper, we present a system that employs a wearable acoustic sensor
and a deep convolutional neural network for detecting coughs. We evaluate the
performance of our system on 14 healthy volunteers and compare it to that of
other cough detection systems that have been reported in the literature.
Experimental results show that our system achieves a classification sensitivity
of 95.1% and a specificity of 99.5%.
