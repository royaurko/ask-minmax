A new method is used to measure the stress and elastic constants of purely
entropic phantom networks, in which a fraction $p$ of neighbors are tethered by
inextensible bonds. We find that close to the percolation threshold $p_c$ the
shear modulus behaves as $(p-p_c)^f$, where the exponent $f\approx 1.35$ in two
dimensions, and $f\approx 1.95$ in three dimensions, close to the corresponding
values of the conductivity exponent in random resistor networks. The components
of the stiffness tensor (elastic constants) of the spanning cluster follow a
power law $\sim(p-p_c)^g$, with an exponent $g\approx 2.0$ and 2.6 in two and
three dimensions, respectively.
