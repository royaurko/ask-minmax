Formation and evolution of the elliptic flow pattern in Pb+Pb collisions at
sqrt{s}=5.5 ATeV and in Au+Au collisions at sqrt{s}=200 AGeV are analyzed for
different hadron species within the framework of HYDJET++ Monte-Carlo model.
The model contains both hydrodynamic state and jets, thus allowing for a study
of the interplay between the soft and hard processes. It is found that jets are
terminating the rise of the elliptic flow with increasing transverse momentum.
Since jets are more influential at LHC compared to RHIC, the elliptic flow at
LHC should be weaker than that at RHIC. The influence of resonance decays on
particle elliptic flow is investigated also. These final state interactions
enhance the low-p_T part of the v_2 of pions and light baryons, and work
towards the fulfilment of idealized constituent quark scaling.
