We simulate vortices in superconductors interacting with two-dimensional
arrays of triangular traps. We find that, upon application of an ac drive, a
net dc flow can occur which shows current reversals with increasing ac drive
amplitude for certain vortex densities, in agreement with recent experiments
and theoretical predictions. We identify the vortex dynamics responsible for
the different rectification regimes. We also predict the occurrence of a novel
transverse rectification effect in which a dc flow appears that is transverse
to the direction of the applied ac drive.
