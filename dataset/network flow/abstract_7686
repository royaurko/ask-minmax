Nonlinear acoustics of wind instruments conducts to study unidimensional
fluid flows. From physically relevant approximations that are modelized with
the thin layer Navier Stokes equations, we propose a coupled model where
perfect fluid flow is described by the Euler equations of gas dynamics and
viscous and thermal boundary layer is modelized by a linear equation. We
describe numerical discretization, validate the associated software by
comparison with analytical solutions and consider musical application of
strongly nonlinear waves in the trombone.
