The engineered control of cellular function through the design of synthetic
genetic networks is becoming plausible. Here we show how a naturally occurring
network can be used as a parts list for artificial network design, and how
model formulation leads to computational and analytical approaches relevant to
nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics.
