A game-theoretic analysis is used to study the effects of receiver choice and
transmit power on the energy efficiency of multi-hop networks in which the
nodes communicate using Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access
(DS-CDMA). A Nash equilibrium of the game in which the network nodes can choose
their receivers as well as their transmit powers to maximize the total number
of bits they transmit per unit of energy spent (including both transmit and
operating energy) is derived. The energy efficiencies resulting from the use of
different linear multiuser receivers in this context are compared for the
non-cooperative game. Significant gains in energy efficiency are observed when
multiuser receivers, particularly the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE)
receiver, are used instead of conventional matched filter receivers.
