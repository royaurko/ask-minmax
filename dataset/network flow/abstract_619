This work investigates the maximum broadcast throughput and its achievability
in multi-hop wireless networks with half-duplex node constraint. We allow the
use of physical-layer network coding (PNC). Although the use of PNC for unicast
has been extensively studied, there has been little prior work on PNC for
broadcast. Our specific results are as follows: 1) For single-source broadcast,
the theoretical throughput upper bound is n/(n+1), where n is the "min
vertex-cut" size of the network. 2) In general, the throughput upper bound is
not always achievable. 3) For grid and many other networks, the throughput
upper bound n/(n+1) is achievable. Our work can be considered as an attempt to
understand the relationship between max-flow and min-cut in half-duplex
broadcast networks with cycles (there has been prior work on networks with
cycles, but not half-duplex broadcast networks).
