We analyse a preferential urn model with randomness using the replica method.
The preferential urn model is a stochastic model based on the concept "the rich
get richer." The replica analysis clarifies that the preferential urn model
with randomness shows a fat-tailed occupation distribution. The analytical
treatments and results would be useful for various research fields such as
complex networks, stochastic models, and econophysics.
