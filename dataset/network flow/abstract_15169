We model recruitment in adaptive social networks in the presence of birth and
death processes. Recruitment is characterized by nodes changing their status to
that of the recruiting class as a result of contact with recruiting nodes. Only
a susceptible subset of nodes can be recruited. The recruiting individuals may
adapt their connections in order to improve recruitment capabilities, thus
changing the network structure adaptively. We derive a mean field theory to
predict the dependence of the growth threshold of the recruiting class on the
adaptation parameter. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of adaptation on
the recruitment level, as well as on network topology. The theoretical
predictions are compared with direct simulations of the full system. We
identify two parameter regimes with qualitatively different bifurcation
diagrams depending on whether nodes become susceptible frequently (multiple
times in their lifetime) or rarely (much less than once per lifetime).
