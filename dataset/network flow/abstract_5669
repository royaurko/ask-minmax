After the Achlioptas process (AP), which yields the so-called explosive
percolation, was introduced, the number of papers on percolation phenomena has
been literally exploding. Most of the existing studies, however, have focused
only on the nature of phase transitions, not paying proper attention to the
structural properties of the resulting networks, which compose the main theme
of the present paper. We compare the resulting network structure of the AP with
random networks and find, through observations of the distributions of the
shortest-path length and the betweenness centrality in the giant cluster, that
the AP makes the network less clustered and more fragile. Such structural
characteristics are more directly seen by using snapshots of the network
structures and are explained by the fact that the AP suppresses the formation
of large clusters more strongly than the random process does. These structural
differences between the two processes are shown to be less noticeable in
growing networks than in static ones.
