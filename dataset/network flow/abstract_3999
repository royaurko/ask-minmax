We summarize the discovery of oxygen absorption and warm (10^5-10^6 K) gas in
cooling flows. Special attention is given to new results for M87 for which we
find the strongest evidence to date for ionized oxygen absorption in these
systems. We briefly discuss implications for observations of cooling flows with
Chandra and XMM.
