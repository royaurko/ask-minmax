This paper discusses the interplay of symmetries and stability in the
analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems and networks. Specifically,
it combines standard results on symmetries and equivariance with recent
convergence analysis tools based on nonlinear contraction theory and virtual
dynamical systems. This synergy between structural properties (symmetries) and
convergence properties (contraction) is illustrated in the contexts of network
motifs arising e.g. in genetic networks, of invariance to environmental
symmetries, and of imposing different patterns of synchrony in a network.
