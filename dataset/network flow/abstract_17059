We consider a relay network with two relays and a feedback link from the
receiver to the sender. To obtain the achievability result, we use
compress-and-forward and random binning techniques combined with deterministic
binning and restricted decoding. Moreover, we use joint decoding technique to
decode the relays' compressed information to achieve a higher rate in the
receiver.
