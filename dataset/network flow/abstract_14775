A significant fraction of the changes in momentum distributions induced by
dissipative phenomena in the description of the fluid fireball created in
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions actually take place when the fluid turns
into individual particles. We study these corrections in the limit of a low
freeze-out temperature of the flowing medium, and we show that they mostly
affect particles with a higher velocity than the fluid. For these, we derive
relations between different flow harmonics, from which the functional form of
the dissipative corrections could ultimately be reconstructed from experimental
data.
