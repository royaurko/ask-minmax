In this paper we present a formal description of PROSA, a P2P resource
management system heavily inspired by social networks. Social networks have
been deeply studied in the last two decades in order to understand how
communities of people arise and grow. It is a widely known result that networks
of social relationships usually evolves to small-worlds, i.e. networks where
nodes are strongly connected to neighbours and separated from all other nodes
by a small amount of hops. This work shows that algorithms implemented into
PROSA allow to obtain an efficient small-world P2P network.
