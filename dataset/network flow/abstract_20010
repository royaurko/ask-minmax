We study the jamming transition of two-dimensional point-to-point traffic
through cooperative mechanisms using computer simulation. We propose two
decentralized cooperative mechanisms which are incorporated into the
point-to-point traffic models: stepping aside (CM-SA) and choosing alternative
routes (CM-CAR). Incorporating CM-SA is to prevent a type of ping-pong jumps
from happening when two objects standing face-to-face want to move in opposite
directions. Incorporating CM-CAR is to handle the conflict when more than one
object competes for the same point in parallel update. We investigate and
compare four models mainly from fundamental diagrams, jam patterns and the
distribution of cooperation probability. It is found that although it decreases
the average velocity a little, the CM-SA increases the critical density and the
average flow. Despite increasing the average velocity, the CM-CAR decreases the
average flow by creating substantially vacant areas inside jam clusters. We
investigate the jam patterns of four models carefully and explain this result
qualitatively. In addition, we discuss the advantage and applicability of
decentralized cooperation modeling.
