In this article we give an in depth overview of the recent advances in the
field of equilibrium networks. After outlining this topic, we provide a novel
way of defining equilibrium graph (network) ensembles. We illustrate this
concept on the classical random graph model and then survey a large variety of
recently studied network models. Next, we analyze the structural properties of
the graphs in these ensembles in terms of both local and global
characteristics, such as degrees, degree-degree correlations, component sizes,
and spectral properties. We conclude with topological phase transitions and
show examples for both continuous and discontinuous transitions.
