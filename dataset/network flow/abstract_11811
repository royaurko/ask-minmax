The friendship paradox is a sociological phenomenon stating that most people
have fewer friends than their friends do. The generalized friendship paradox
refers to the same observation for attributes other than degree, and it has
been observed in Twitter and scientific collaboration networks. This paper
takes an analytical approach to model this phenomenon. We consider a
preferential attachment-like network growth mechanism governed by both node
degrees and `qualities'. We introduce measures to quantify paradoxes, and
contrast the results obtained in our model to those obtained for an
uncorrelated network, where the degrees and qualities of adjacent nodes are
uncorrelated. We shed light on the effect of the distribution of node qualities
on the friendship paradox. We consider both the mean and the median to measure
paradoxes, and compare the results obtained by using these two statistics.
