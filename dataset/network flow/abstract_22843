Inspired by numerical studies of the aggregation equation, we study the
effect of regularization on nonlocal interaction energies. We consider energies
defined via a repulsive-attractive interaction kernel in power-law form,
regularized by convolution with a mollifier. We prove that, with respect to the
2-Wasserstein metric, the regularized energies gamma-converge to the
unregularized energy and minimizers converge to minimizers. We then apply our
results to prove gamma-convergence of the gradient flows, when restricted to
the space of measures with bounded density.
