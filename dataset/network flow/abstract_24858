In this paper, a novel method for sensor node localization under mixed
line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight (LOS/NLOS) conditions based on second order
cone programming (SOCP) is presented. SOCP methods have, hitherto, not been
utilized in the node localization under mixed LOS/NLOS conditions. Unlike
semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation, SOCP is computationally efficient
for resource constrained ad-hoc sensor network. The proposed method can work
seamlessly in mixed LOS/NLOS conditions. The robustness of the method is due to
the fair utilization of all measurements obtained under LOS and NLOS
conditions. The computational complexity of this method is quadratic in the
number of nearest neighbours of the unknown node. Extensive simulations and
real field deployments are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed
method. The experimental results of the proposed method is reasonably better
when compared to similar methods in literature.
