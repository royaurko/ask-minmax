Perfect porcupines are specially-configured networks of gravitational wave
detectors, in the limit that the individual detectors and the distances between
them are short relative to the gravitational wavelengths of interest. They have
beautiful properties which make them ideal gravitational wave telescopes. I
present the most important cases explicitly. For a network of one-arm detectors
(like "AGIS" \cite{Dimopoulos_et_al}), the minimal perfect porcupine has 6
detectors, oriented along the 6 diameters of a regular icosahedron. For a
network of two-arm detectors (like the equal-arm Michelson interferometers
LIGO/VIRGO) the minimal perfect porcupine is a certain 5 detector
configuration.
