We extract the frequency content of a noisy signal by use of Discrete Fourier
Transform. Our analysis overcomes the limitations imposed by incommensurate
lattices. After computing the deterministic component, we show the relevance of
the method in removing spurious autocorrelations from the signal residuals.
Results are presented for a temperature time series.
