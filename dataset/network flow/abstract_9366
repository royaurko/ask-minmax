In this paper we demonstrate that the Canine Pose Estimation (CPE) system can
provide a reliable estimate for some poses and when coupled with effective
wireless transmission over a mesh network. Pose estimates are time sensitive,
thus it is important that pose data arrives at its destination quickly.
Propagation delay and packet delivery ratio measuring algorithms were developed
and used to appraise Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) performance as a means of
carriage for this time-critical data. The experiments were conducted in the
rooms of a building where the radio characteristics closely resembled those of
a partially collapsed building-a typical US&R environment. This paper presents
the results of the experiments, which demonstrate that it is possible to
receive the canine pose estimation data in realtime although accuracy of the
results depend on the network size and the deployment environment.
