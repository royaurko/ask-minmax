This paper examines users who are common to two popular online social
networks, Instagram and Ask.fm, that are often used for cyberbullying. An
analysis of the negativity and positivity of word usage in posts by common
users of these two social networks is performed. These results are normalized
in comparison to a sample of typical users in both networks. We also examine
the posting activity of common user profiles and consider its correlation with
negativity. Within the Ask.fm social network, which allows anonymous posts, the
relationship between anonymity and negativity is further explored.
