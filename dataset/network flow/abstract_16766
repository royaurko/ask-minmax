On-chip networks have been proposed as the interconnect fabric for future
systems-on-chip and multi-processors on chip. Power is one of the main
constraints of these systems and interconnect consumes a significant portion of
the power budget. In this paper, we propose four leakage-aware interconnect
schemes. Our schemes achieve 10.13%~63.57% active leakage savings and
12.35%~95.96% standby leakage savings across schemes while the delay penalty
ranges from 0% to 4.69%.
