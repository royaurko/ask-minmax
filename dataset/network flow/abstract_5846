In this paper, the main aim is to exhibit swarm intelligence power in cloud
based scenario. Heterogeneous environment has been configured at server-side
network of the whole cloud network. In the proposed system, different types of
servers are being used to manage useful assorted atmosphere. Swarm intelligence
has been adopted for enhancing the performance of overall system network.
Specific location at server-side of the network is going to be selected by the
swarm intelligence concept for accessing desired elements. Flexibility,
robustness and self-organization, which are to be considered at the time of
designing the system environment, are the main features of swarm intelligence.
