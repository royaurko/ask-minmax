The capabilities of the mechanical resonator-based nanosensors in detecting
ultra-small mass or force shifts have driven a continuing exploration of the
palette of nanomaterials for such application purpose. Based on large-scale
molecular dynamics simulations, we have assessed the applicability of a new
class of carbon nanomaterials for the nanoresonator usage, i.e., the single
wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) network. It is found that the SWNT networks inherit
the excellent mechanical properties from the constituent SWNTs, possessing a
high natural frequency. However, although a high quality factor is suggested
from the simulation results, it is hard to obtain an unambiguous Q-factor due
to the existence of vibration modes in addition to the dominant mode. The
nonlinearities resulting from these extra vibration modes are found to exist
uniformly under various testing conditions including different initial
actuations and temperatures. Further testing shows that these modes can be
effectively suppressed through the introduction of axial strain, leading to an
extremely high quality factor in the order of 109 estimated from the SWNT
network with 2% tensile strain. Additional studies indicate that the carbon
rings connecting the SWNTs can also be used to alter the vibrational properties
of the resulting network. This study suggests that the SWNT network can be a
good candidate for the applications as nanoresonators.
