We give O(log^2 n)-approximation algorithm based on the cut-matching
framework of [10, 13, 14] for computing the sparsest cut on directed graphs.
Our algorithm uses only O(log^2 n) single commodity max-flow computations and
thus breaks the multicommodity-flow barrier for computing the sparsest cut on
directed graphs
