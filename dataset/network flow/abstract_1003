High efficiency video coding is the current trend setting standard for coding
and transmission of video content. This standard has brought in many
improvements over its predecessor H264 standard. In this paper, performance
evaluation of transmitting HEVC content over the simulated network environment
for disaster and calamity stricken area has been under taken. In the simulation
the transmitted video sequences are subjected to various error models in NS3
simulator. The effects of speed and number of hosts on the jitter and delay
characteristics of the underlying network while transmitting flows of HEVC
based content has been evaluated. The extent and effect of network errors on
the quality of HEVC bit stream in terms PSNR has also been tested. The results
show that HEVC performs better for up to 0.001 percent network error, for up to
30 simultaneously transmitting nodes and for nodes travelling at speeds up to
100m/s.
