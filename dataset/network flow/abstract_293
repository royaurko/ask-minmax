Since 1950, information flows have been in the centre of scientific research.
Up until internet penetration in the late 90s, these studies were based over
traditional offline social networks. Several observations in offline
information flows studies, such as two-step flow of communication and the
importance of weak ties, were verified in several online studies, showing that
the diffused information flows from one Online Social Network (OSN) to several
others. Within that flow, information is shared to and reproduced by the users
of each network. Furthermore, the original content is enhanced or weakened
according to its topic, the dynamic and exposure of each OSNs. In such a
concept, each OSN is considered a layer of information flows that interacts
with each other. In this paper, we examine such flows in several social
networks, as well as their diffusion and lifespan across multiple OSNs, in
terms of user-generated content. Our results verify the perception of content
and information connection in various OSNs.
