We give an extensive treatment of the Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) Einstein
flow from the point of view of the Bel-Robinson energies. The article, in
particular, stresses on estimates showing how the Bel-Robinson energies and the
volume of the evolving states control intrinsically the flow along evolution.
The treatment is for flows over compact three-manifolds of arbitrary
topological type, although the form of the estimates may vary depending on the
Yamabe invariant of the manifold. We end up showing well posedness of the CMC
Einstein flow with H^{3} x H^{2} regularity, and proving a criteria for a flow
to be a long-time flow on manifolds with non-positive Yamabe invariant in terms
only of the first order Bel-Robinson energy.
