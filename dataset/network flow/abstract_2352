The world in which we are living is a huge network of networks and should be
described by interdependent networks. The interdependence between networks
significantly affects the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation on them.
Meanwhile, due to the diversity and complexity of social and biological
systems, players on different networks may not interact with each other by the
same way, which should be described by multiple models in evolutionary game
theory, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and Snowdrift Game. We therefore study
the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation on two interdependent networks playing
different games respectively. We clearly evidence that, with the increment of
network interdependence, the evolution of cooperation is dramatically promoted
on the network playing Prisoner's Dilemma. The cooperation level of the network
playing Snowdrift Game reduces correspondingly, although it is almost
invisible. In particular, there exists an optimal intermediate region of
network interdependence maximizing the growth rate of the evolution of
cooperation on the network playing Prisoner's Dilemma. Remarkably, players
contacting with other network have advantage in the evolution of cooperation
than the others on the same network.
