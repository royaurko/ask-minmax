We present a new direct simulation Monte-Carlo method for solving the
relativistic Boltzmann equation. We solve numerically the 2-dimensional
Boltzmann equation using this new algorithm. We find that elliptic flow from
this transport calculation smoothly converges towards the value from ideal
hydrodynamics as the number of collisions per particle increases, as expected
on general theoretical grounds, but in contrast with previous transport
calculations.
