The non-linear stress-strain relation for crosslinked polymer networks is
studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Previously we demonstrated the
importance of trapped entanglements in determining the elastic and relaxational
properties of networks. Here we present new results for the stress versus
strain for both dry and swollen networks. Models which limit the fluctuations
of the network strands like the tube model are shown to describe the stress for
both elongation and compression. For swollen networks, the total modulus is
found to decrease like (V_0/V)^{2/3} and goes to the phantom model result only
for short strand networks.
