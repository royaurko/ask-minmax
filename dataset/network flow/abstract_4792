A new concept of {\em an evolution system of measures for stochastic flows}
is considered. It corresponds to the notion of an invariant measure for random
dynamical systems (or cocycles). The existence of evolution systems of measures
for asymptotically compact stochastic flows is obtained. For a white noise
stochastic flow, there exists a one to one correspondence between evolution
systems of measures for a stochastic flow \emph{and} evolution systems of
measures for the associated Markov transition semigroup. As an application, an
alternative approach for evolution systems of measures of 2D stochastic
Navier-Stokes equations with a time-periodic forcing term is presented.
