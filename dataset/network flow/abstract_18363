This article presents a model of general-purpose computing on a semantic
network substrate. The concepts presented are applicable to any semantic
network representation. However, due to the standards and technological
infrastructure devoted to the Semantic Web effort, this article is presented
from this point of view. In the proposed model of computing, the application
programming interface, the run-time program, and the state of the computing
virtual machine are all represented in the Resource Description Framework
(RDF). The implementation of the concepts presented provides a practical
computing paradigm that leverages the highly-distributed and standardized
representational-layer of the Semantic Web.
