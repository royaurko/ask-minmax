In the next generation network (NGN) environment specific consideration is on
bandwidth minimization, because this reduces the cost of network. In response
to the growing market demand for multimedia traffic transmission, NGN concept
has been produced. The next generation network provides multimedia services
over high speed networks, which supports DVD quality video on demand. Although
it has numerous advantages, more exploration of the large-scale deployment
video on demand is still needed. The focus of the research presented in this
paper is a class based admission control by the complete partitioning of the
video on demand server. In this paper we present analytically and by simulation
how the blockage probability of the server significantly affects the on demand
video request and the service. We also present how the blockage probability
affects the performance of the video on demand server.
