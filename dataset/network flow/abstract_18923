Single-cell studies often show significant phenotypic variability due to the
stochastic nature of intra-cellular biochemical reactions. When the numbers of
molecules, e.g., transcription factors and regulatory enzymes, are in low
abundance, fluctuations in biochemical activities become significant and such
"noise" can propagate through regulatory cascades in terms of biochemical
reaction networks. Here we develop an intuitive, yet fully quantitative method
for analyzing how noise affects cellular phenotypes based on identifying a
system's nonlinearities and noise propagations. We observe that such noise can
simultaneously enhance sensitivities in one behavioral region while reducing
sensitivities in another. Employing this novel phenomenon we designed three
biochemical signal processing modules: (a) A gene regulatory network that acts
as a concentration detector with both enhanced amplitude and sensitivity. (b) A
non-cooperative positive feedback system, with a graded dose-response in the
deterministic case, that serves as a bistable switch due to noise-induced
bimodality. (c) A noise-induced linear amplifier for gene regulation that
requires no feedback. The methods developed in the present work allow one to
understand and engineer nonlinear biochemical signal processors based on
fluctuation-induced phenotypes.
