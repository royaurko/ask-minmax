In this paper we present a study of the cosmic flow from the point of view of
how clusterings at different dynamical regimes in an expanding universe evolve
according to a `coarse-grained' partitioning of their ranked energy
distribution. By analysing a Lambda-CDM cosmological simulation from the Virgo
Project, we find that cosmic flows evolve in an orderly sense, when tracked
from their coarse-grained energy cells, even when nonlinearities are already
developed. We show that it is possible to characterize scaling laws for the
Pairwise Velocity Distribution in terms of the energy cells, generally valid at
the linear and nonlinear clustering regimes.
