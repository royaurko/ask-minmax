We examine highly super-Eddington black-hole models for SS 433, based on
two-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations coupled with radiation transport.
The super-Eddington accretion flow with a small viscosity parameter,
  $\alpha = 10^{-3}$, results in a geometrically and optically thick disk with
a large opening angle of $\sim 60^{\circ}$ to the equatorial plane and a very
rarefied, hot, and optically thin high-velocity jets region around the disk.
  The thick accretion flow consists of two different zones: an inner
advection-dominated zone and an outer convection-dominated zone. The
high-velocity region around the disk is divided into two characteristic
regions, a very rarefied funnel region along the rotational axis and a
moderately rarefied high-velocity region outside of the disk. The temperatures
of $\sim 10^7$ K and the densities of $\sim 10^{-7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ in the upper
disk vary sharply to $\sim 10^8$ K and $10^{-8}$ g cm$^{-3}$, respectively,
across the disk boundary between the disk and the high-velocity region. The
X-ray emission of iron lines would be generated only in a confined region
between the funnel wall and the photospheric disk boundary, where flows are
accelerated to relativistic velocities of $\sim$ 0.2 $c$ due to the dominant
radiation-pressure force. The results are discussed regarding the collimation
angle of the jets, the large mass-outflow rate obserevd in SS 433, and the
ADAFs and the CDAFs models.
