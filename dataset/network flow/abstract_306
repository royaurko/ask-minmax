This Letter presents a unified approach for the fundamental relationship
between structure and function in flow networks by solving analytically the
voltages in a resistor network, transforming the network structure to an
effective all-to-all topology, and then measuring the resultant flows.
Moreover, it defines a way to study the structural resilience of the graph and
to detect possible communities.
