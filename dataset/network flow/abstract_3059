We propose the construction of an unobservable communications network using
social networks. The communication endpoints are vertices on a social network.
Probabilistically unobservable communication channels are built by leveraging
image steganography and the social image sharing behavior of users. All
communication takes place along the edges of a social network overlay
connecting friends. We show that such a network can provide decent bandwidth
even with a far from optimal routing mechanism such as restricted flooding. We
show that such a network is indeed usable by constructing a botnet on top of
it, called Stegobot. It is designed to spread via social malware attacks and
steal information from its victims. Unlike conventional botnets, Stegobot
traffic does not introduce new communication endpoints between bots. We
analyzed a real-world dataset of image sharing between members of an online
social network. Analysis of Stegobot's network throughput indicates that
stealthy as it is, it is also functionally powerful -- capable of channeling
fair quantities of sensitive data from its victims to the botmaster at tens of
megabytes every month.
