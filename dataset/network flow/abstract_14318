The presence of several clone solutions in the simultaneous measurement of
($\theta_{13},\delta$) has been widely discussed in literature. In this letter
we write the analytical formulae of the clones location in the
($\theta_{13},\delta$) plane as a function of the physical input pair
($\bar\theta_{13},\bar\delta$). We show how the clones move with changing
$\bar\theta_{13}$. The "clone flow" can be significantly different if computed
(naively) from the oscillation probabilities or (exactly) from the
probabilities integrated over the neutrino flux and cross-section.
  Using our complete computation we compare the clone flow of a set of possible
future neutrino experiments: the CERN SuperBeam, BetaBeam and Neutrino Factory
proposals. We show that the combination of these specific BetaBeam and
SuperBeam does not help in solving the degeneracies. On the contrary, the
combination of one of them with the Neutrino Factory Golden and Silver channel
can be used, from a theoretical point of view, to solve completely the
eightfold degeneracy.
