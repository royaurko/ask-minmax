The Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architec- ture and the Time-Triggered
Ethernet (TTEthernet) network have emerged as the key components of a typical
architecture model for recent civil aircrafts. We propose a real-time
constraint-based calculus targeted at the analysis of such concepts of avionic
embedded systems. We show our framework at work on the modelisation of both the
(IMA) architecture and the TTEthernet network, illustrating their behavior by
the well-known Flight Management System (FMS).
