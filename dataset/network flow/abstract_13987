We study spectral properties of GX 339-4 during its 2010-11 outburst with Two
Component Advective Flow (TCAF) model after its inclusion in XSPEC as a table
model. We compare results fitted by TCAF model with combined disk black body
and power-law model. For a spectral fit, we use 2.5-25 keV spectral data of the
PCA instrument onboard RXTE satellite. From our fit, accretion flow parameters
such as Keplerian (disk) rate, sub-Keplerian (halo) rate, location and strength
of shock are extracted. We quantify how the disk and the halo rates vary during
the entire outburst. We study how the halo to disk accretion rate ratio (ARR),
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), shock locations and its strength vary when
the system passes through hard, hard-intermediate, soft-intermediate, and soft
states. We find pieces of evidence of monotonically increasing and decreasing
nature of QPO frequencies depending on the variation of ARR during rising and
declining phases. Interestingly, on days of transition from hard state to
hard-intermediate spectral state (during the rising phase) or vice-versa
(during decline phase), ARR is observed to be locally maximum. Non-constancy of
ARR while obtaining reasonable fits points to the presence of two independent
components in the flow.
