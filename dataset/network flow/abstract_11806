Networks of biochemical reactions, like cellular metabolic networks, are kept
in non-equilibrium steady states by the exchange fluxes connecting them to the
environment. In most cases, feasible flux configurations can be derived from
minimal mass-balance assumptions upon prescribing in- and out-take fluxes. Here
we consider the problem of inferring intracellular flux patterns from
extracellular metabolite levels. Resorting to a thermodynamic out of
equilibrium variational principle to describe the network at steady state, we
show that the switch from fermentative to oxidative phenotypes in cells can be
characterized in terms of the glucose, lactate, oxygen and carbon dioxide
concentrations. Results obtained for an exactly solvable toy model are fully
recovered for a large scale reconstruction of human catabolism. Finally we
argue that, in spite of the many approximations involved in the theory,
available data for several human cell types are well described by the predicted
phenotypic map of the problem.
