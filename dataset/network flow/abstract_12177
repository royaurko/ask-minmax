Reversibility, weak reversibility and deficiency, detailed and complex
balancing are generally not "encoded" in the kinetic differential equations but
they are realization properties that may imply local or even global asymptotic
stability of the underlying reaction kinetic system when further conditions are
also fulfilled. In this paper, efficient numerical procedures are given for
finding complex balanced or detailed balanced realizations of mass action type
chemical reaction networks or kinetic dynamical systems in the framework of
linear programming. The procedures are illustrated on numerical examples.
