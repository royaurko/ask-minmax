Functional renormalization group equations are analytically continued from
imaginary Matsubara frequencies to the real frequency axis. On the example of a
scalar field with O(N) symmetry we discuss the analytic structure of the
flowing action and show how it is possible to derive and solve flow equations
for real-time properties such as propagator residues and particle decay widths.
The formalism conserves space-time symmetries such as Lorentz or Galilei
invariance and allows for improved, self-consistent approximations in terms of
derivative expansions in Minkowski space.
