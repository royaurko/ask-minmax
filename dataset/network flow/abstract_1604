A parallel splitting method is proposed for solving systems of coupled
monotone inclusions in Hilbert spaces. Convergence is established for a wide
class of coupling schemes. Unlike classical alternating algorithms, which are
limited to two variables and linear coupling, our parallel method can handle an
arbitrary number of variables as well as nonlinear coupling schemes. The
breadth and flexibility of the proposed framework is illustrated through
applications in the areas of evolution inclusions, dynamical games, signal
recovery, image decomposition, best approximation, network flows, and
variational problems in Sobolev spaces.
