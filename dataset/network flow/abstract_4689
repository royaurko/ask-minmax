We consider an advection of a passive scalar by a flow which is a
superposition of random waves. We find that such a flow can lead to an
exponential growth of the passive scalar fluctuations. We calculate the growth
rate at the fourth order in wave amplitudes and find it non-zero when either
both solenoidal and potential components are present in the flow or there are
potential waves with the same frequencies but different wavenumbers.
