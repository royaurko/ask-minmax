We outline a model to study the evolution of cooperation in a population of
agents playing the prisoner's dilemma in signed networks. We highlight that if
only dyadic interactions are taken into account, cooperation never evolves.
However, when triadic considerations are introduced, a window of opportunity
for emergence of cooperation as a stable behaviour emerges.
