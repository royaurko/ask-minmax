We examine two basic assumptions of kinetic theory-- binary collisions and
molecular chaos-- using numerical simulations of sheared granular materials. We
investigate a wide range of densities and restitution coefficients and
demonstrate that kinetic theory breaks down at large density and small
restitution coefficients. In the regimes where kinetic theory fails, there is
an associated emergence of clusters of spatially correlated grains.
