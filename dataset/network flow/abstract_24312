A Neural Network, in general, is not considered to be a good solver of
mathematical and binary arithmetic problems. However, networks have been
developed for such problems as the XOR circuit. This paper presents a technique
for the implementation of the Half-adder circuit using the CoActive Neuro-Fuzzy
Inference System (CANFIS) Model and attempts to solve the problem using the
NeuroSolutions 5 Simulator. The paper gives the experimental results along with
the interpretations and possible applications of the technique.
