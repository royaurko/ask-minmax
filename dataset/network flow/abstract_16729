A new statistical based model approach to characterize a user's behavior in
an Internet access link is presented. The real patterns of Internet traffic in
a heterogeneous Campus Network are studied. We find three clearly different
patterns of individual user's behavior, study their common features and group
particular users behaving alike in three clusters. This allows us to build a
probabilistic mixture model, that can explain the expected global behavior for
the three different types of users. We discuss the implications of this
emergent phenomenology in the field of multi-agent complex systems.
