We consider open multi-class queueing networks with general arrival
processes, general processing time sequences and Bernoulli routing. The network
is assumed to be operating under an arbitrary work-conserving scheduling policy
that makes the system stable. An example is a generalized Jackson network with
load less than unity and any work conserving policy. We find a simple diffusion
limit for the inter-queue flows with an explicit computable expression for the
covariance matrix. Specifically, we present a simple computable expression for
the asymptotic variance of arrivals (or departures) of each of the individual
queues and each of the flows in the network.
