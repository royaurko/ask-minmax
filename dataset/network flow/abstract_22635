We extend the definition of the pentagram map from 2D to higher dimensions
and describe its integrability properties for both closed and twisted polygons
by presenting its Lax form. The corresponding continuous limit of the pentagram
map in dimension $d$ is shown to be the $(2,d+1)$-flow of the KdV hierarchy,
generalizing the Boussinesq equation in 2D.
