The size of cities is known to play a fundamental role in social and economic
life. Yet, its relation to the structure of the underlying network of human
interactions has not been investigated empirically in detail. In this paper, we
map society-wide communication networks to the urban areas of two European
countries. We show that both the total number of contacts and the total
communication activity grow superlinearly with city population size, according
to well-defined scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase
that affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability that
an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains largely
unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and scale-invariant
acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as cities get bigger,
which is numerically confirmed by applying epidemiological models to the
studied networks. Our findings should provide a microscopic basis towards
understanding the superlinear increase of different socioeconomic quantities
with city size, that applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for
instance, the creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain
contagious diseases.
