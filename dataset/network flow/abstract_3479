We provide a simple proof that graphs in a general class of self-similar
networks have zero percolation threshold. The considered self-similar networks
include random scale-free graphs with given expected node degrees and zero
clustering, scale-free graphs with finite clustering and metric structure,
growing scale-free networks, and many real networks. The proof and the
derivation of the giant component size do not require the assumption that
networks are treelike. Our results rely only on the observation that
self-similar networks possess a hierarchy of nested subgraphs whose average
degree grows with their depth in the hierarchy. We conjecture that this
property is pivotal for percolation in networks.
