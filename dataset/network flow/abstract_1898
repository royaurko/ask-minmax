A growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of filaments in
interstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. In this
paper, we present new Herschel PACS and SPIRE observations of the B59 and Stem
regions in the Pipe Nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network of
filaments. The asymmetric column density profiles observed for several
filaments, along with the bow-like edge of B59, indicates that the Pipe Nebula
is being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from the
nearby Sco OB2 association. We suggest that this compressive flow has
contributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. In
B59, the only region of the entire Pipe complex showing star formation
activity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial column
density of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.
Although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsible
for shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in B59. While the
question of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remains
open in B59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism for
the initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex
