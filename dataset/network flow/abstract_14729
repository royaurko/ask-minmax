We study the possibility of consistent extension of MDI full-disc
helioseismic campaigns with the growing data set of HMI observations. To do so,
we down-sample and filter the HMI Dopplegrams so that the resulting spatial
power spectrum is similar to the spatial power spectrum of MDI full-disc
Dopplergrams. The set of co-spatial and co-temporal datacube pairs from both
instruments containing no missing and no bad frames were processed using the
same codes and inverted independently for all three components of the plasma
flow in the near surface layers. The results from the two instruments are
highly correlated, however systematically larger (by ~20%) flow magnitudes are
derived from HMI. We comment that this may be an effect of the different
formation depth of the Doppler signal
