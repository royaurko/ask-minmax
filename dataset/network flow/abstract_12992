This work investigates the TRACON flow management around a major airport.
Aircraft flows are analyzed through a study of TRACON trajectories records.
Rerouting and queuing processes are highlighted and airport characteristics are
shown as function of the number of planes in the TRACON. Then, a simple
input-output TRACON queuing and landing model is proposed. This model is
calibrated and validated using available TRACON data. It reproduces the same
phenomenon as the real system. This model is used to show the impact of
limiting the number of aircrafts in the TRACON. A limited number of aircraft
does not increase delays but reduces the controller's workload and increases
safety.
