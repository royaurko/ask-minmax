The influence of turbulent effects on a fluid flow through a (pseudo) porous
media is studied by numerically solving the set of Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes equations with the $\kappa$-$\epsilon$ model for turbulence. The
spatial domains are two-dimensional rectangular grids with different {\it
porosities} obtained by the random placing of rigid obstacles. The objective of
the simulations is to access the behavior of the generalized friction factor
with varying Reynolds number. A good agreement with the Forchheimer's equation
is observed. The flow distribution at both low and high Reynolds conditions is
also analyzed.
