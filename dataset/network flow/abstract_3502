Power law degree distribution was shown in many complex networks. However, in
most real systems, deviation from power-law behavior is observed in social and
economical networks and emergence of giant hubs is obvious in real network
structures far from the tail of power law. We propose a model based on the
information transparency (transparency means how much the information is
obvious to others). This model can explain power structure in societies with
non-transparency in information delivery. The emergence of ultra powerful nodes
is explained as a direct result of censorship. Based on these assumptions, we
define four distinct transparency regions: perfect non-transparent, low
transparent, perfect transparent and exaggerated regions. We observe the
emergence of some ultra powerful (very high degree) nodes in low transparent
networks, in accordance with the economical and social systems. We show that
the low transparent networks are more vulnerable to attacks and the
controllability of low transparent networks is harder than the others. Also,
the ultra powerful nodes in the low transparent networks have a smaller mean
length and higher clustering coefficients than the other regions.
