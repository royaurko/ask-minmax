In this document, we compare three existing simulation platforms (OPNET
Modeler, Network Simulator 2, Georgia Tech Sensor Network Simulator). Our
comparative study focuses on ease of use, scalability, ease of implementing
power consumption model and physical layer modeling accuracy, mainly.
Conclusions of this study are presented, and will help us decide which
simulating environment to use for evaluating power-aware self-organizing sensor
networks protocols.
