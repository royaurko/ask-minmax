We investigate the statistical properties of single phase slip events
observed in vortex nucleation experiments in He-4 by the groups in Berkeley and
Paris. From the cumulative distribution function of the events we calculate the
slip rate as a function of flow velocity. The critical velocity is defined as
the mean velocity and its statistical width as the standard deviation. From the
slip rate and from the observed linear temperature dependence of the critical
velocity we obtain the energy barrier for vortex nucleation which is a
quadratic function of the flow velocity. A comparison with the statistical
properties of the laminar to turbulent transition in the flow around an
oscillating sphere shows strikingly different behaviour.
