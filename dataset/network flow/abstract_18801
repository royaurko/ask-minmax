The process of sorting marble plates according to their surface texture is an
important task in the automated marble plate production. Nowadays some
inspection systems in marble industry that automate the classification tasks
are too expensive and are compatible only with specific technological equipment
in the plant. In this paper a new approach to the design of an Automated Marble
Plate Classification System (AMPCS),based on different neural network input
training sets is proposed, aiming at high classification accuracy using simple
processing and application of only standard devices. It is based on training a
classification MLP neural network with three different input training sets:
extracted texture histograms, Discrete Cosine and Wavelet Transform over the
histograms. The algorithm is implemented in a PLC for real-time operation. The
performance of the system is assessed with each one of the input training sets.
The experimental test results regarding classification accuracy and quick
operation are represented and discussed.
