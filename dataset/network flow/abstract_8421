Small networks of chaotic units which are coupled by their time-delayed
variables, are investigated. In spite of the time delay, the units can
synchronize isochronally, i.e. without time shift. Moreover, networks can not
only synchronize completely, but can also split into different synchronized
sublattices. These synchronization patterns are stable attractors of the
network dynamics. Different networks with their associated behaviors and
synchronization patterns are presented. In particular, we investigate
sublattice synchronization, symmetry breaking, spreading chaotic motifs,
synchronization by restoring symmetry and cooperative pairwise synchronization
of a bipartite tree.
