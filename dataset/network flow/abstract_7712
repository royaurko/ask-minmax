Recent results of the anisotropic flow measurements by the ALICE
Collaboration at the LHC are reviewed. Directed, elliptic, triangular, and
quadrangular flow are presented differentially vs. transverse momentum,
pseudo-rapidity, and the collision centrality for charged and identified
particles. Experimental probes of local parity violation using the charge
dependent azimuthal correlations with respect to the reaction plane are also
discussed.
