A confined colloidal glass, under the imposition of a uniform shear stress,
is investigated using numerical simulations. Both at macro- and microscales,
the consequent dynamics during the onset of flow is studied. When the imposed
stress is gradually decreased, the time scale for the onset of steady flow
diverges, associated with long-lived spatial heterogeneities. Near this
yield-stress regime, persistent creep in the form of shear-banded structures is
observed.
