The results on J/psi pT spectra in 200 GeV p+p and Au+Au collisions at STAR
with pT in the range of 3-10 GeV/c are presented. Nuclear modification factor
of high-pT J/psi is found to be consistent with no suppression in peripheral
Au+Au collisions and significantly smaller than unity in central Au+Au
collisions. The J/psi elliptic flow is measured to be consistent with no flow
at pT < 10 GeV/c in 20-60% Au+Au collisions.
