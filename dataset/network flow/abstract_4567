Ubiquitous computing allows to make data and services within the reach of
users anytime and anywhere. This makes ubiquitous networks vulnerable to
attacks coming from either inside or outside the network. To ensure and enhance
networks security, several solutions have been implemented. These solutions are
inefficient and or incomplete. Solving these challenges in security with new
requirement of Ubicomp, could provide a potential future for such systems
towards better mobility and higher confidence level of end user services. We
investigate the possibility to detect network intrusions, based on security
nodes abilities. Specifically, we show how authentication can help build user
profiles in each network node. Authentication is based on permissions and
restrictions to access to information and services on ubiquitous network. As a
result, our idea realizes a protection of nodes and assures security of
network.
