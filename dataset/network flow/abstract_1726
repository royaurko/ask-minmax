We study the rheological behavior of concentrated granular suspensions of
simple spherical particles. Under controlled stress, the system exhibits an
S-shaped flow curve (stress vs. shear rate) with a negative slope in between
the low-viscosity Newtonian regime and the shear thickened regime. Under
controlled shear rate, a discontinuous transition between the two states is
observed. Stress visualization experiments with a novel fluorescent probe
suggest that friction is at the origin of shear thickening. Stress
visualization shows that the stress in the system remains homogeneous (no shear
banding) if a stress is imposed that is intermediate between the high and
low-stress branches. The S-shaped shear thickening is then due to the
discontinuous formation of a frictional force network between particles upon
increasing the stress.
