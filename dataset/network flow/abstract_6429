A sensor network can be described as a collection of sensor nodes which
co-ordinate with each other to perform some specific function. These sensor
nodes are mainly in large numbers and are densely deployed either inside the
phenomenon or very close to it. They can be used for various application areas
(e.g. health, military, home). Failures are inevitable in wireless sensor
networks due to inhospitable environment and unattended deployment. Therefore,
it is necessary that network failures are detected in advance and appropriate
measures are taken to sustain network operation. We previously proposed a
cellular approach for fault detection and recovery. In this paper we extend the
cellular approach and propose a new fault management mechanism to deal with
fault detection and recovery. We propose a hierarchical structure to properly
distribute fault management tasks among sensor nodes by introducing more
'self-managing' functions. The proposed failure detection and recovery
algorithm has been compared with some existing related work and proven to be
more energy efficient.
