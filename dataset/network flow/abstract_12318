Autonomous threshold element circuit networks are used to investigate the
structure of neural networks. With these circuits, as the transition functions
are threshold functions, it is necessary to consider the existence of sequences
of state configurations that cannot be transitioned. In this study, we focus on
all logical functions of four or fewer variables, and we discuss the periodic
sequences and transient series that transition from all sequences of state
configurations. Furthermore, by using the sequences of state configurations in
the Garden of Eden, we show that it is easy to obtain functions that determine
the operation of circuit networks.
