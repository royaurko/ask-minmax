We investigate the effect of incomplete information on the growth process of
scale-free networks - a situation that occurs frequently e.g. in real existing
citation networks. Two models are proposed and solved analytically for the
scaling behavior of the connectivity distribution. These models show a varying
scaling exponent with respect to the model parameters but no break-down of
scaling thus introducing the first models of scale-free networks in an
environment of incomplete information. We compare to results from computer
simulations which show a very good agreement.
