We present Monte Carlo simulations of the formation and structure of
polysilane, hybrid polysilane/polysilyne and polysilyne networks. The
simulation technique allows for the investigation of large networks, containing
up to 1000 silicon atoms. Our results show that ring formation is an important
factor for all three types of materials. For polysilyne networks, a random
structure is found incorporating cyclic substructures, linear chains and
branching points.
