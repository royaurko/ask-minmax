The determination and classification of fixed points of large Boolean
networks is addressed in terms of constraint satisfaction problem. We develop a
general simplification scheme that, removing all those variables and functions
belonging to trivial logical cascades, returns the computational core of the
network. The onset of an easy-to-complex regulatory phase is introduced as a
function of the parameters of the model, identifying both theoretically and
algorithmically the relevant regulatory variables.
