Dynamics of clumps within a magnetized advection dominated accretion flow is
investigated by solving the collisionless Boltzmann equation and considering
the drag force due to the relative velocity between the clumps and the gas.
Toroidal component of the magnetic field is assumed to be dominant. Dynamical
properties of the hot gaseous component such as the radial and the rotational
velocities are affected by the magnetic effects, and so, drag force varies
depending on the strength of magnetic field and the velocity dispersion of the
clumps is then modified significantly. We show that when magnetic pressure is
less than the gas pressure, the root of the averaged radial velocity square of
the clumps decreases at the inner parts of the hot flow and increases slightly
at its outer edge.
