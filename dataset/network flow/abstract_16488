Babcock-Leighton type solar dynamo models with single-celled meridional
circulation are successful in reproducing many solar cycle features. Recent
observations and theoretical models of meridional circulation do not indicate a
single-celled flow pattern. We examine the role of complex multi-cellular
circulation patterns in a Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo in advection- and
diffusion-dominated regimes. We show from simulations that presence of a weak,
second, high-latitude reverse cell speeds up the cycle and slightly enhances
the poleward branch in butterfly diagram, whereas the presence of a second cell
in depth reverses the tilt of butterfly wing to an anti-solar type. A butterfly
diagram constructed from middle of convection zone yields a solar-like pattern,
but this may be difficult to realize in the Sun because of magnetic buoyancy
effects. Each of the above cases behaves similarly in higher and lower magnetic
diffusivity regimes. However, our dynamo with a meridional circulation
containing four cells in latitude behaves distinctly differently in the two
regimes, producing solar-like butterfly diagrams with fast cycles in the higher
diffusivity regime, and complex branches in butterfly diagrams in the lower
diffusivity regime. We also find that dynamo solutions for a four-celled
pattern, two in radius and two in latitude, prefer to quickly relax to
quadrupolar parity if the bottom flow-speed is strong enough, of similar order
of magnitude as the surface flow-speed.
