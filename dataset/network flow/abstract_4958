We review basic properties of advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and
their applications to astrophysical systems ranging from Galactic binary
systems to galactic nuclei. A new classification scheme for low-luminosity,
X-ray bright galactic nuclei is highlighted. Some outstanding unresolved issues
are discussed.
