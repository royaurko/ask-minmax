This papers considers the problem of maximizing the load that can be served
by a power network. We use the commonly accepted Linear DC power network model
and consider wo configuration options: switching lines and using FACTS devices.
We present the first comprehensive complexity study of this optimization
problem. Our results show hat the problem is NP-complete and that there is no
fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. For switching, these results extend
to planar networks with a aximum-node degree of 3. Additionally, we demonstrate
that the optimization problems are still NP-hard if we restrict the network
structure to cacti with a maximum degree of 3.
