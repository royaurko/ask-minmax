The paper presents an analysis of performance features of the HICCUPS (HIdden
Communication system for CorrUPted networkS) including the efficiency and the
cost of the system in WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks). The analysis relies
on the original CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Avoidance) 802.11 Markov chain-based model.
