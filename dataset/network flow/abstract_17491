A probabilistic cellular automaton for cargo transport is presented that
generalizes the totally asymmetric exclusion process with a defect from
continuous time to parallel dynamics. It appears as an underlying principle in
cellular automata for traffic flow with non-local jumps for the kinetic
constraint to drive as fast as possible. The exactly solvable model shows a
discontinuous phase transition between two regions with different cargo
velocities.
