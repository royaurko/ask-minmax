This paper presents a distributed algorithm to simultaneously compute the
diameter, radius and node eccentricity in all nodes of a synchronous network.
Such topological information may be useful as input to configure other
algorithms. Previous approaches have been modular, progressing in sequential
phases using building blocks such as BFS tree construction, thus incurring
longer executions than strictly required. We present an algorithm that, by
timely propagation of available estimations, achieves a faster convergence to
the correct values. We show local criteria for detecting convergence in each
node. The algorithm avoids the creation of BFS trees and simply manipulates
sets of node ids and hop counts. For the worst scenario of variable start
times, each node i with eccentricity ecc(i) can compute: the node eccentricity
in diam(G)+ecc(i)+2 rounds; the diameter in 2*diam(G)+ecc(i)+2 rounds; and the
radius in diam(G)+ecc(i)+2*radius(G) rounds.
