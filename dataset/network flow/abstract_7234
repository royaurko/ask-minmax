Complex networks, comprised of individual elements that interact with each
other through reaction channels, are ubiquitous across many scientific and
engineering disciplines. Examples include biochemical, pharmacokinetic,
epidemiological, ecological, social, neural, and multi-agent networks. A common
approach to modeling such networks is by a master equation that governs the
dynamic evolution of the joint probability mass function of the underling
population process and naturally leads to Markovian dynamics for such process.
Due however to the nonlinear nature of most reactions, the computation and
analysis of the resulting stochastic population dynamics is a difficult task.
This review article provides a coherent and comprehensive coverage of recently
developed approaches and methods to tackle this problem. After reviewing a
general framework for modeling Markovian reaction networks and giving specific
examples, the contributors present numerical and computational techniques capable of
evaluating or approximating the solution of the master equation, discuss a
recently developed approach for studying the stationary behavior of Markovian
reaction networks using a potential energy landscape perspective, and provide
an introduction to the emerging theory of thermodynamic analysis of such
networks. Three representative problems of opinion formation, transcription
regulation, and neural network dynamics are used as illustrative examples.
