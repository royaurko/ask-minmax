In recent years, there has been growing interest in dynamic and centralized
traffic engineering, where decisions about forwarding paths are taken from a
network-wide perspective, based on the dynamic state of the network. Frequent
path reconfiguration can significantly improve the network performance, but
should be handled with care, so as to minimize disruptions that may occur
during network updates. We introduce Time4, an approach that uses accurate time
to coordinate network updates. We characterize a set of update scenarios called
flow swaps, where Time4 is the optimal update approach, yielding less packet
loss than existing update approaches. We introduce the lossless flow allocation
problem, and formally show that in environments with frequent path allocation,
scenarios that require simultaneous changes at multiple network devices are
inevitable. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a
Time4-enabled OpenFlow prototype. Our prototype will soon be publicly available
as open source. Our work includes an extension to the OpenFlow protocol that
has been adopted by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), and is now included
in OpenFlow 1.5. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant
advantages of Time4 compared to other network update approaches.
