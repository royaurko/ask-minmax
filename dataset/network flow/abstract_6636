The current electrical grid is perhaps the greatest engineering achievement
of the 20th century. However, it is increasingly outdated and overburdened,
leading to costly blackouts and burnouts. For this and various other
reasons,transformation efforts are underway to make the current electrical grid
smarter. A reliable, universal and secure communication infrastructure is
mandatory for the implementation and deployment of the future smart grid. A
special interest is given to the design of efficient and robust network
architecture capable of managing operation and control of the next generation
power grid. For this purpose new wired and wireless technologies are emerging
in addition to the formerly applied to help upgrade the current power grid. In
this paper we will give an overview of smart grid reference model, and a
comprehensive survey of the available networks for the smart grid and a
critical review of the progress of wired and wireless communication
technologies for smart grid communication infrastructure. And we propose end to
end communication architecture for Home Area Networks (HANs), Neighborhood Area
Networks (NANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs) for smart grid applications. We
believe that this work will provide appreciated insights for the novices who
would like to follow related research in the SG domain.
