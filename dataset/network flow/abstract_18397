Rate based transport protocol determines the rate of data transmission
between the sender and receiver and then sends the data according to that rate.
To notify the rate to the sender, the receiver sends ACKplusRate packet based
on epoch timer expiry. In this paper, through detailed arguments and simulation
it is shown that the transmission of ACKplusRate packet based on epoch timer
expiry consumes more energy in network with low mobility. To overcome this
problem, a new technique called Dynamic Rate Feedback (DRF) is proposed. DRF
sends ACKplusRate whenever there is a change in rate of (plus or minus) 25
percent than the previous rate. Based on ns2 simulation DRF is compared with a
reliable transport protocol for ad hoc network (ATP)
