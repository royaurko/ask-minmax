In this paper we consider the equations of the unsteady viscous,
incompressible, and heat conducting magnetohydrodynamic flows in a bounded
three-dimensional domain with Lipschitz boundary. By an approximation scheme
and a weak convergence method, the existence of a weak solution to the
three-dimensional density dependent generalized incompressible
magnetohydrodynamic equations with large data is obtained.
