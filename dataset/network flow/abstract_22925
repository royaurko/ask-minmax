Separation kernel, a fundamental software of safety and security critical
systems, provides to its hosted software applications high-assurance
partitioning and information flow control properties. The application of
separation kernel in critical domain demands the correctness of the kernel by
formal verification. To our knowledge, there does not exist a survey paper on
this topic. This paper give an overview to the topic of formal specification
and verification of the separation kernel. We overview the concept of
separation kernel and formal verification, survey the state of the art on the
topic after the year 2000, and summarize these works by comparing them and
discussing some issues.
