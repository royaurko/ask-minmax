In this paper, we consider a functional decode and forward (FDF) multi-way
relay network (MWRN) where a common user facilitates each user in the network
to obtain messages from all other users. We propose a novel user pairing
scheme, which is based on the principle of selecting a common user with the
best average channel gain. This allows the user with the best channel
conditions to contribute to the overall system performance. Assuming lattice
code based transmissions, we derive upper bounds on the average common rate and
the average sum rate with the proposed pairing scheme. Considering M-ary
quadrature amplitude modulation with square constellation as a special case of
lattice code transmission, we derive asymptotic average symbol error rate (SER)
of the MWRN. We show that in terms of the achievable rates, the proposed
pairing scheme outperforms the existing pairing schemes under a wide range of
channel scenarios. The proposed pairing scheme also has lower average SER
compared to existing schemes. We show that overall, the MWRN performance with
the proposed pairing scheme is more robust, compared to existing pairing
schemes, especially under worst case channel conditions when majority of users
have poor average channel gains.
