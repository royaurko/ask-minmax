We present a model for the accretion flow around the supermassive black hole
in the LINER nucleus of NGC 1097 which fits the optical to X-ray spectral
energy distribution (SED). The X-ray segment of the SED is based on
observations with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which are reported here for
the first time. The inner part of the flow is modeled as a radiatively
inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the outer part as a standard thin disk.
The value of the transition radius (~225 Schwarzschild radii) between the RIAF
and outer thin disk was obtained from our previous fitting of the double-peaked
Balmer emission line profile, which originates in the thin disk. The black hole
mass was inferred from measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in the
host galaxy. When these parameters are used in the accretion flow model, the
SED can be successfully reproduced, which shows that the line profile model and
the accretion flow model are consistent with each other. A small remaining
excess in the near-UV is accounted by the contribution of an obscured starburst
located within 9 pc from the nucleus, as we reported in an earlier paper. The
radio flux is consistent with synchrotron emission of a relativistic jet
modeled by means of the internal shock scenario. In an appendix we also analyze
the Chandra X-ray observations of the ~1 kpc circumnuclear star-forming ring
and of an ultraluminous compact X-ray source located outside the ring.
