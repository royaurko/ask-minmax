We study the dynamics of the voter and Moran processes running on top of
complex network substrates where each edge has a weight depending on the degree
of the nodes it connects. For each elementary dynamical step the first node is
chosen at random and the second is selected with probability proportional to
the weight of the connecting edge. We present a heterogeneous mean-field
approach allowing to identify conservation laws and to calculate exit
probabilities along with consensus times. In the specific case when the weight
is given by the product of nodes' degree raised to a power theta, we derive a
rich phase-diagram, with the consensus time exhibiting various scaling laws
depending on theta and on the exponent of the degree distribution gamma.
Numerical simulations give very good agreement for small values of |theta|. An
additional analytical treatment (heterogeneous pair approximation) improves the
agreement with numerics, but the theoretical understanding of the behavior in
the limit of large |theta| remains an open challenge.
