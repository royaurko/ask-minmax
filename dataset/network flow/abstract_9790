Superfluid flow around an oscillating microsphere is investigated at
temperatures down to 25 mK. Stable laminar flow below a critical velocity and
turbulence at large drives are found to be separated below 0.5 K by an
intermediate range of driving forces where the flow is unstable, intermittently
switching between laminar and turbulent phases. We have recorded time series of
this switching phenomenon and have made a statistical analysis of the switching
probability. The mean lifetime of the turbulent phases grows with increasing
drive and becomes infinite at a critical value. Stability of the laminar phases
above the critical velocity is limited by natural background radioactivity or
cosmic rays.
