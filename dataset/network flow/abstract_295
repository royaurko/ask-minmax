We represent transport between different regions of a fluid domain by flow
networks, constructed from the discrete representation of the Perron-Frobenius
or transfer operator associated to the fluid advection dynamics. The procedure
is useful to analyze fluid dynamics in geophysical contexts, as illustrated by
the construction of a flow network associated to the surface circulation in the
Mediterranean sea. We use network-theory tools to analyze the flow network and
gain insights into transport processes. In particular we quantitatively relate
dispersion and mixing characteristics, classically quantified by Lyapunov
exponents, to the degree of the network nodes. A family of network entropies is
defined from the network adjacency matrix, and related to the statistics of
stretching in the fluid, in particular to the Lyapunov exponent field. Finally
we use a network community detection algorithm, Infomap, to partition the
Mediterranean network into coherent regions, i.e. areas internally well mixed,
but with little fluid interchange between them.
