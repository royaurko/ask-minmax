We study the two-player safe game of Competitive Diffusion, a game-theoretic
model for the diffusion of technologies or influence through a social network.
In game theory, safe strategies are mixed strategies with a minimal expected
gain against unknown strategies of the opponents. Safe strategies for
competitive diffusion lead to maximum spread of influence in the presence of
uncertainty about the other players. We study the safe game on two specific
classes of trees, spiders and complete trees, and give tight bounds on the
minimal expected gain. We then use these results to give an algorithm which
suggests a safe strategy for a player on any tree. We test this algorithm on
randomly generated trees, and show that it finds strategies that are close to
optimal.
