In this paper we present new developments in the expressiveness and in the
theory of a Calculus for Sensor Networks (CSN). We combine a network layer of
sensor devices with a local object model to describe sensor devices with state.
The resulting calculus is quite small and yet very expressive. We also present
a type system and a type invariance result for the calculus. These results
provide the fundamental framework for the development of programming languages
and run-time environments.
