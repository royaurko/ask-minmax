We discuss the utilization of INTEGRAL as a gamma-ray burst detector in the
interplanetary network. IBIS will have an inherent GRB detection and
localization capability. However, the SPI anticoincidence shield will also be a
sensitive burst detector which, in conjunction with other spacecraft, will make
it possible to localize three to four times more bursts than IBIS alone. This
capability will be quite unique in the years 2001-2003 when INTEGRAL is
operating.
