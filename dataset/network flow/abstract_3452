Optical WDM mesh networks are able to transport huge amount of information.
The use of such technology however poses the problem of protection against
failures such as fibre cuts. One of the principal methods for link protection
used in optical WDM networks is pre-configured protection cycle (p-cycle). The
major problem of this method of protection resides in finding the optimal set
of p-cycles which protect the network for a given distribution of working
capacity. Existing heuristics generate a large set of p-cycle candidates which
are entirely independent of the network state, and from then the good sub-set
of p-cycles which will protect the network is selected. In this paper, we
propose a new algorithm of generation of p-cycles based on the incremental
aggregation of the shortest cycles. Our generation of p-cycles depends on the
state of the network. This enables us to choose an efficient set of p-cycles
which will protect the network. The set of p-cycles that we generate is the
final set which will protect the network, in other words our heuristic does not
go through the additional step of p-cycle selection
