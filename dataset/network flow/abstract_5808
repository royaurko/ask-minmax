Ising models with pairwise interactions are the least structured, or
maximum-entropy, probability distributions that exactly reproduce measured
pairwise correlations between spins. Here we use this equivalence to construct
Ising models that describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of 40
neurons in the retina, and show that pairwise interactions account for observed
higher-order correlations. By first finding a representative ensemble for
observed networks we can create synthetic networks of 120 neurons, and find
that with increasing size the networks operate closer to a critical point and
start exhibiting collective behaviors reminiscent of spin glasses.
