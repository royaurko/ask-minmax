We present a numerical and analytical study of the thermal fragmentation of a
turbulent flow of interstellar hydrogen. We first present the different
dynamical processes and the large range of spatial (and temporal) scales that
need to be adequately represented in numerical simulations. Next, we present
bidimensionnal simulations of turbulent converging flows which induce the
dynamical condensation of the warm neutral phase into the cold phase. We then
analyse the cold structures and the fraction of unstable gas in each
simulation, paying particular attention to the influence of the degree of
turbulence. When the flow is very turbulent a large fraction of the gas remains
in the thermally unstable domain. This unstable gas forms a filamentary
network. We show that the fraction of thermally unstable gas is strongly
correlated with the level of turbulence of the flow. We then develop a
semi-analytical model to explain the origin of this unstable gas. This simple
model is able to reproduce quantitatively the fraction of unstable gas observed
in the simulations and its correlation with turbulence. Finally, we stress the
fact that even when the flow is very turbulent and in spite of the fact that a
large fraction of the gas is maintained dynamically in the thermally unstable
domain, the classical picture of a 2-phase medium with stiff thermal fronts and
local pressure equilibrium turns out to be still relevant in the vicinity of
the cold structures.
