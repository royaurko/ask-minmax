The current trend in optical networks is to open the entire wholesale market
to competition. As a result, we will see, instead of a single big market
player, optical transport networks competing with each other to attract
customer demand. This paper presents a wavelength broker who acts on behalf of
enterprises, web host companies, financial firm etc. to buy certain number of
wavelengths from such market. We present the system model, the interaction
protocol and provide analysis of the competition. The simulation results of a
business scenario are also recorded in the paper
