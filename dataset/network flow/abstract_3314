We prove long time existence and convergence results for the pluriclosed
flow, which imply geometric and topological classification theorems for
generalized K\"ahler structures. Our approach centers on the reduction of
pluriclosed flow to a degenerate parabolic equation for a $(1,0)$-form,
introduced in \cite{ST2}. We observe a number of differential inequalities
satisfied by this system which lead to a priori $L^{\infty}$ estimates for the
metric along the flow. Moreover we observe an unexpected connection to
"Born-Infeld geometry" which leads to a sharp differential inequality which can
be used to derive an Evans-Krylov type estimate for the degenerate parabolic
system of equations. To show convergence of the flow we generalize Yau's
oscillation estimate to the setting of generalized K\"ahler geometry.
