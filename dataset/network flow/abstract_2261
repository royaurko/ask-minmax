Random linear network coding is a feasible encoding tool for network coding,
specially for the non-coherent network, and its performance is important in
theory and application. In this letter, we study the performance of random
linear network coding for the well-known butterfly network by analyzing the
failure probabilities. We determine the failure probabilities of random linear
network coding for the well-known butterfly network and the butterfly network
with channel failure probability p.
