This paper contains a generalization of the convex ideal case of the
Thurston-Andreev theorem when the genus is greater than 1. The heart of the
paper concerns taking formal angle data on a surface and ``conformally
flowing'' this formal angle data to uniquely associated uniform angle data.
This flow turns out to be the gradient of an objective function related in a
rather magical way to hyperbolic volume.
