We investigate the instability of a smooth Rayleigh-Taylor steady-state
solution to compressible viscous flows without heat conductivity in the
presence of a uniform gravitational field in a bounded domain
$\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^3$ with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$. We show
that the steady-state is linearly unstable by constructing a suitable energy
functional and exploiting arguments of the modified variational method. Then,
based on the constructed linearly unstable solutions and a local well-posedness
result of classical solutions to the original nonlinear problem, we further
reconstruct the initial data of linearly unstable solutions to be the one of
the original nonlinear problem and establish an appropriate energy estimate of
Gronwall-type. With the help of the established energy estimate, we show that
the steady-state is nonlinearly unstable in the sense of Hadamard by a careful
bootstrap argument. As a byproduct of our analysis, we find that the
compressibility has no stabilizing effect in the linearized problem for
compressible viscous flows without heat conductivity.
