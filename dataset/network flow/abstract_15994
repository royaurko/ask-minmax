This paper considers wide-band spectrum sensing and optimization for
cognitive radio (CR) networks with noise variance uncertainty. It is assumed
that the considered wide-band contains one or more white sub-bands. Under this
assumption, we consider throughput maximization of the CR network while
appropriately protecting the primary network. We address this problem as
follows. First, we propose novel ratio based test statistics for detecting the
edges of each sub-band. Second, we employ simple energy comparison approach to
choose one reference white sub-band. Third, we propose novel generalized energy
detector (GED) for examining each of the remaining sub-bands by exploiting the
noise information of the reference white sub-band. Finally, we optimize the
sensing time ($T_o$) to maximize the CR network throughput using the detection
and false alarm probabilities of the GED. The proposed GED does not suffer from
signal to noise ratio (SNR) wall and outperforms the existing signal detectors.
Moreover, the relationship between the proposed GED and conventional energy
detector (CED) is quantified analytically. We show that the optimal $T_o$
depends on the noise variance information. In particular, with $10$TV bands,
SNR=$-20$dB and $2$s frame duration, we found that the optimal $T_o$ is
$28.5$ms ($50.6$ms) with perfect (imperfect) noise variance scenario.
