A physically consistent approach is considered for defining an external
magnetic field as needed in computational fluid dynamics problems involving
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The approach results in simple analytical formulae
that can be used in numerical studies where an inhomogeneous magnetic field
influences a liquid metal flow. The resulting magnetic field is divergence and
curl-free, and contains two components and parameters to vary. As an
illustration, the following examples are considered: peakwise, stepwise,
shelfwise inhomogeneous magnetic fields, and the field induced by a solenoid.
Finally, the impact of the streamwise magnetic field component is shown
qualitatively to be significant for rapidly changing fields.
