Model order reduction (MOR) techniques play a crucial role in the
computer-aided design of modern integrated circuits, where they are used to
reduce the size of parasitic networks. Unfortunately, the efficient reduction
of passive networks with many ports is still an open problem. Existing
techniques do not scale well with the number of ports, and lead to dense
reduced models that burden subsequent simulations. In this paper, we propose
TurboMOR, a novel MOR technique for the efficient reduction of passive RC
networks. TurboMOR is based on moment-matching, achieved through efficient
congruence transformations based on Householder reflections. A novel feature of
TurboMOR is the block-diagonal structure of the reduced models, that makes them
more efficient than the dense models produced by existing techniques. Moreover,
the model structure allows for an insightful interpretation of the reduction
process in terms of system theory. Numerical results show that TurboMOR scales
more favourably than existing techniques in terms of reduction time, simulation
time and memory consumption.
