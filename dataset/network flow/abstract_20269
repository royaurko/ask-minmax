In the last decades, the experimental study of dynamo action has made great
progress. However, after the dynamo experiments in Karlsruhe and Riga, the
von-Karman-Sodium (VKS) dynamo is only the third facility that has been able to
demonstrate fluid flow driven self-generation of magnetic fields in a
laboratory experiment. Further progress in the experimental examination of
dynamo action is expected from the planned precession driven dynamo experiment
that will be designed in the framework of the liquid sodium facility DRESDYN
(DREsden Sodium facility for DYNamo and thermohydraulic studies).
  In this paper, we briefly present numerical models of the VKS dynamo that
demonstrate the close relation between the axisymmetric field observed in that
experiment and the soft iron material used for the flow driving impellers. We
further show recent results of preparatory water experiments and design studies
related to the precession dynamo and delineate the scientific prospects for the
final set-up.
