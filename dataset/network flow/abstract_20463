The thermal boundary resistance of Si/Ge interfaces as been determined using
approach-to-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Assuming a reciprocal
linear dependence of the thermal boundary resistance, a length-independent bulk
thermal boundary resistance could be extracted from the calculation resulting
in a value of 3.76x10$^{-9}$ m$^2$ K/W for a sharp Si/Ge interface and thermal
transport from Si to Ge. Introducing an interface with finite thickness of 0.5
nm consisting of a SiGe alloy, the bulk thermal resistance slightly decreases
compared to the sharp Si/Ge interface. Further growth of the boundary leads to
an increase in the bulk thermal boundary resistance. When the heat flow is
inverted (Ge to Si), the thermal boundary resistance is found to be higher.
From the differences in the thermal boundary resistance for different heat flow
direction, the rectification factor of the Si/Ge has been determined and is
found to significantly decrease when the sharp interface is moderated by
introduction of a SiGe alloy in the boundary layer.
