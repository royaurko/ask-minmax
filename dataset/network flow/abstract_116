We studied the effect of the perturbation of the meridional flow in the
activity belts detected by local helioseismology on the development and
strength of the surface magnetic field at the polar caps. We carried out
simulations of synthetic solar cycles with a flux transport model, which
follows the cyclic evolution of the surface field determined by flux emergence
and advective transport by near-surface flows. In each hemisphere, an
axisymmetric band of latitudinal flows converging towards the central latitude
of the activity belt was superposed onto the background poleward meridional
flow. The overall effect of the flow perturbation is to reduce the latitude
separation of the magnetic polarities of a bipolar magnetic region and thus
diminish its contribution to the polar field. As a result, the polar field
maximum reached around cycle activity minimum is weakened by the presence of
the meridional flow perturbation. For a flow perturbation consistent with
helioseismic observations, the polar field is reduced by about 18% compared to
the case without inflows. If the amplitude of the flow perturbation depends on
the cycle strength, its effect on the polar field provides a nonlinearity that
could contribute to limiting the amplitude of a Babcock-Leighton type dynamo.
