Median clustering is of great value for partitioning relational data. In this
paper, a new prototype-based clustering method, called Median Evidential
C-Means (MECM), which is an extension of median c-means and median fuzzy
c-means on the theoretical framework of belief functions is proposed. The
median variant relaxes the restriction of a metric space embedding for the
objects but constrains the prototypes to be in the original data set. Due to
these properties, MECM could be applied to graph clustering problems. A
community detection scheme for social networks based on MECM is investigated
and the obtained credal partitions of graphs, which are more refined than crisp
and fuzzy ones, enable us to have a better understanding of the graph
structures. An initial prototype-selection scheme based on evidential
semi-centrality is presented to avoid local premature convergence and an
evidential modularity function is defined to choose the optimal number of
communities. Finally, experiments in synthetic and real data sets illustrate
the performance of MECM and show its difference to other methods.
