With the increase in the bandwidth & the transmission speed over the
internet, transmission of multimedia objects like video, audio, images has
become an easier work. In this paper we provide an approach that can be useful
for transmission of video objects over the internet without much fuzz. The
approach provides a ontology based framework that is used to establish an
automatic deployment of video transmission system. Further the video is
compressed using the structural flow mechanism that uses the wavelet principle
for compression of video frames. Finally the video transmission algorithm known
as RRDBFSF algorithm is provided that makes use of the concept of restrictive
flooding to avoid redundancy thereby increasing the efficiency.
