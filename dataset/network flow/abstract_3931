Understanding the mutual interdependence between the behavior of dynamical
processes on networks and the underlying topologies promises new insight for a
large class of empirical networks. We present a generic approach to investigate
this relationship which is applicable to a wide class of dynamics, namely to
evolve networks using a performance measure based on the whole spectrum of the
dynamics' time evolution operator. As an example, we consider the graph
Laplacian describing diffusion processes, and we evolve the network structure
such that a given sub-diffusive behavior emerges.
