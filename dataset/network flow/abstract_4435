We present the result of a dual modeling of opinion network. The model
complements the agent-based opinion models by attaching to the social agent
(voters) network a political opinion (party) network having its own intrinsic
mechanisms of evolution. These two sub-networks form a global network which can
be either isolated from or dependent on the external influence. Basically, the
evolution of the agent network includes link adding and deleting, the opinion
changes influenced by social validation, the political climate, the
attractivity of the parties and the interaction between them. The opinion
network is initially composed of numerous nodes representing opinions or
parties which are located on a one dimensional axis according to their
political positions. The mechanism of evolution includes union, splitting,
change of position and of attractivity, taken into account the pairwise node
interaction decaying with node distance in power law. The global evolution ends
in a stable distribution of the social agents over a quasi-stable and
fluctuating stationary number of remaining parties. Empirical study on the
lifetime distribution of numerous parties and vote results is carried out to
verify numerical results.
