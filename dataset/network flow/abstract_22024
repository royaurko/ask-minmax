In this work the junction conditions between the exterior
Reissner-Nordstrom-Vaidya space-time with the interior quasi-spherical Szekeres
space-time have been studied for analyzing gravitational collapse in the
presence of a magneto-hydrodynamic fluid undergoing dissipation in the form of
heat flow. We have discussed about the apparent horizon and have evaluated the
time difference between the formation of apparent horizon and central
singularity.
