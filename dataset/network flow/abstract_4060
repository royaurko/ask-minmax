In this paper, we define a reduced distance function based at a point at the
singular time $T<\infty$ of a Ricci flow. We also show the monotonicity of the
corresponding reduced volume based at time T, with equality iff the Ricci flow
is a gradient shrinking soliton. Our curvature bound assumption is more general
than the type I condition.
