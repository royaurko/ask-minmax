Building higher-dimensional copulas is generally recognized as a difficult
problem. Regular-vines using bivariate copulas provide a flexible class of
high-dimensional dependency models. In large dimensions, the drawback of the
model is the exponentially increasing complexity. Recognizing some of the
conditional independences is a possibility for reducing the number of levels of
the pair-copula decomposition, and hence to simplify its construction Aas et al
(2009). The idea of using conditional independences was already performed under
elliptical copula assumptions Hanea, Kurowicka and Cooke (2006), Kurowicka and
Cooke (2002) and in the case of DAGs in a recent work Bauer, Czado and Klein
(2011). We provide a method which uses some of the conditional independences
encoded by the Markov network underlying the variables. We give a theorem which
under some graph conditions makes possible to derive pair-copula decomposition
of the probability density function associated to a Markov network. As the
underlying Markov network is usually unknown, we first have to discover it from
the sample data. Using our results published in Szantai and Kovacs (2008) and
Kovacs and Szantai (2010a) we will show how to derive a multidimensional copula
model exploiting the information on conditional independences hidden in the
sample data.
