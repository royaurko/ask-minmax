A recent theory by Bertini, De Sole, Gabrielli, Jona-Lasinio and Landim
predicts a temporal asymmetry in the fluctuation-relaxation paths of certain
observables of nonequilibrium systems in local thermodynamic equilibrium. We
find temporal asymmetries in the fluctuation-relaxation paths of a form of
local heat flow, in the nonequilibrium FPU-$\zb$ model of Lepri, Livi and
Politi.
