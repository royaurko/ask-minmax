security and QoS are the two most precious objectives for network systems to
be attained. Unfortunately, they are in conflict, while QoS tries to minimize
processing delay, strong security protection requires more processing time and
cause packet delay. This article is a step towards resolving this conflict by
extending the firewall session table to accelerate NAT, QoS classification, and
routing processing time while providing the same level of security protection.
