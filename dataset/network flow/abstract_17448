We obtain the exact solution for the Burgers equation with a time dependent
forcing, which depends linearly on the spatial coordinate. For the case of a
stochastic time dependence an exact expression for the joint probability
distribution for the velocity fields at multiple spatial points is obtained. A
connection with stretched vortices in hydrodynamic flows is discussed.
