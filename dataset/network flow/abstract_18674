Many of modern location-based services are often based on an area or place as
opposed to an accurate determination of the precise location. Geo-fencing
approach is based on the observation that users move from one place to another
and then stay at that place for a while. These places can be, for example,
commercial properties, homes, office centers and so on. As per geo-fencing
approach they could be described (defined) as some geographic areas bounded by
polygons. It assumes users simply move from fence to fence and stay inside
fences for a while. In this article we replace geo-based boundaries with
network proximity rules. This new approach let us effectively deploy location
based services indoor and provide a significant energy saving for mobile
devices comparing with the traditional methods.
