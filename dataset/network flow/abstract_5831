Small-worlds represent efficient communication networks that obey two
distinguishing characteristics: a high clustering coefficient together with a
small characteristic path length. This paper focuses on an interesting paradox,
that removing links in a network can increase the overall clustering
coefficient. Reckful Roaming, as introduced in this paper, is a 2-localized
algorithm that takes advantage of this paradox in order to selectively remove
superfluous links, this way optimizing the clustering coefficient while still
retaining a sufficiently small characteristic path length.
