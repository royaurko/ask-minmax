Gossip algorithms for aggregation have recently received significant
attention for sensor network applications because of their simplicity and
robustness in noisy and uncertain environments. However, gossip algorithms can
waste significant energy by essentially passing around redundant information
multiple times. For realistic sensor network model topologies like grids and
random geometric graphs, the inefficiency of gossip schemes is caused by slow
mixing times of random walks on those graphs. We propose and analyze an
alternative gossiping scheme that exploits geographic information. By utilizing
a simple resampling method, we can demonstrate substantial gains over
previously proposed gossip protocols. In particular, for random geometric
graphs, our algorithm computes the true average to accuracy $1/n^a$ using
$O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ radio transmissions, which reduces the energy
consumption by a $\sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ factor over standard gossip
algorithms.
