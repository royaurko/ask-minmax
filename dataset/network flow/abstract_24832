We present YOLO, a unified pipeline for object detection. Prior work on
object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame
object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes
and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding
boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation.
Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized
end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is also
extremely fast; YOLO processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second,
hundreds to thousands of times faster than existing detection systems. Our
system uses global image context to detect and localize objects, making it less
prone to background errors than top detection systems like R-CNN. By itself,
YOLO detects objects at unprecedented speeds with moderate accuracy. When
combined with state-of-the-art detectors, YOLO boosts performance by 2-3%
points mAP.
