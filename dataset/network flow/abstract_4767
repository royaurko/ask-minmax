In this paper we study the geometry of first time singularities of the mean
curvature flow. By the curvature pinching estimate of Huisken and Sinestrari,
we prove that a mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space
$\R^{n+1}$ with positive mean curvature is $\kappa$-noncollapsing, and a
blow-up sequence converges locally smoothly along a subsequence to a smooth,
convex blow-up solution. As a consequence we obtain a local Harnack inequality
for the mean convex flow.
