Consider a manifold $M$ endowed locally with a pair of complementary
distributions $\Delta^H \oplus \Delta^V=TM$ and let $\text{Diff}(\Delta^H, M)$
and $\text{Diff}(\Delta^V, M)$ be the corresponding Lie subgroups generated by
vector fields in the corresponding distributions. We decompose a stochastic
flow with jumps, up to a stopping time, as $\varphi_t = \xi_t \circ \psi_t$,
where $\xi_t \in \text{Diff}(\Delta^H, M)$ and $\psi_t \in
\text{Diff}(\Delta^V, M)$. Our main result provides Stratonovich stochastic
differential equations with jumps for each of these two components in the
corresponding infinite dimensional Lie groups. We present an extension of the
It\^o-Ventzel-Kunita formula for stochastic flows with jumps generated by
classical Marcus equation (as in Kurtz, Pardoux and Protter, Annales de
L'I.H.P. section B, 1995, among others). The results here correspond to an
extension of Catuogno, da Silva and Ruffino, Stoch. Dyn. 2013, where this
decomposition was studied for the continuous case.
