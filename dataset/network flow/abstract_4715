We present a quasi-two dimensional model of flowing soap films that bears
striking similarity to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The variation
in soap film thickness that is commonly used for flow visualization in
experiments is analogous to density variations in the Navier-Stokes equations.
When the soap film flow velocity is comparable to the Marangoni elastic wave
velocity we recover the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and the soap film
behaves like a two-dimensional isothermal viscous gas.
