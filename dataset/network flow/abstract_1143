This paper proposes a method to embed the AC power flow problem with voltage
magnitude constraints in the complex plane. Modeling the action of network
controllers that regulate the magnitude of voltage phasors is a challenging
task in the complex plane as it has to preserve the framework of holomorphicity
for obtention of these complex variables with fixed magnitude. Hence this paper
presents a significant step in the development of the idea of Holomorphic
Embedding Load Flow Method (HELM), introduced in 2012, that exploits the theory
of analytic continuation, especially the monodromy theorem for resolving issues
that have plagued conventional numerical methods for decades. This paper also
illustrates the indispensable role of Pad\'e approximants for analytic
continuation of complex functions, expressed as power series, beyond the
boundary of convergence of the series. Later the paper demonstrates the
superiority of the proposed method over the well-established Newton-Raphson as
well as the recently developed semidefinite and moment relaxation of power flow
problems.
