The purpose of this paper is to apply characteristics of residual stress that
causes cantilever beams to bend for manufacturing a micro-structured gas flow
sensor. This study uses a silicon wafer deposited silicon nitride layers,
reassembled the gas flow sensor with four cantilever beams that perpendicular
to each other and manufactured piezoresistive structure on each
micro-cantilever by MEMS technologies, respectively. When the cantilever beams
are formed after etching the silicon wafer, it bends up a little due to the
released residual stress induced in the previous fabrication process. As air
flows through the sensor upstream and downstream beam deformation was made,
thus the airflow direction can be determined through comparing the resistance
variation between different cantilever beams. The flow rate can also be
measured by calculating the total resistance variations on the four
cantilevers.
