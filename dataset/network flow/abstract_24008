The gravitational wave detectors currently in operation perform the analysis
of their scientific data jointly. Concerning the search for bursting sources,
coherent data analysis methods have been shown to be more efficient. In the
coherent approach, the data collected by the detectors are time-shifted and
linearly combined so that the signatures received by each detector add up
constructively (thus improving the resulting signal-to-noise ratio). This
operation has to be performed over a sky grid (which determines the sky
locations to be searched). A limitation of those pipelines is their large
computing cost. One of the available degrees of freedom to reduce the cost is
the choice of the sky grid. Ideally, the sky sampling scheme should adapt the
angular resolution associated with the considered gravitational wave detector
network. As the geometry of detector network is not regular (the detectors are
not equally spaced and oriented), the angular resolution varies largely
depending on the sky location. We propose here a procedure which designs sky
grids that permit a complete sky coverage with a minimum number of vertices and
thus adapt the local resolution.
