In a wireless sensor network Quality of Information (QoI), Energy Efficiency,
Redundant data avoidance, congestion control are the important metrics that
affect the performance of wireless sensor network. As many approaches were
proposed to increase the performance of a wireless sensor network among them
clustering is one of the efficient approaches in sensor network. Many
clustering algorithms concentrate mainly on power Optimization like FSCH,
LEACH, and EELBCRP. There is necessity of the above metrics in wireless sensor
network where nodes are densely deployed in a given network area. As the nodes
are deployed densely there is maximum possibility of nodes appear in the
sensing region of other nodes. So there exists an option that nodes have to
send the information that is already reached the base station by its own
cluster members or by members of other clusters. This mechanism will affect the
QoI, Energy factor and congestion control of the wireless sensor networks. Even
though clustering uses TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) for avoiding
congestion control for intra clustering data transmission, but it may fail in
some critical situation. This paper proposed a energy efficient clustering
which avoid data redundancy in a dense sensor network until the network becomes
sparse and hence uses the TDMA efficiently during high density of the nodes.
