Tensile creep tests, tensile relaxation tests and a tensile test with a
constant rate of strain are performed on injection-molded isotactic
polypropylene at room temperature in the vicinity of the yield point. A
constitutive model is derived for the time-dependent behavior of
semi-crystalline polymers. A polymer is treated as an equivalent network of
chains bridged by permanent junctions. The network is modelled as an ensemble
of passive meso-regions (with affine nodes) and active meso-domains (where
junctions slip with respect to their positions in the bulk medium with various
rates). The distribution of activation energies for sliding in active
meso-regions is described by a random energy model. Adjustable parameters in
the stress--strain relations are found by fitting experimental data. It is
demonstrated that the concentration of active meso-domains monotonically grows
with strain, whereas the average potential energy for sliding of junctions and
the standard deviation of activation energies suffer substantial drops at the
yield point. With reference to the concept of dual population of crystalline
lamellae, these changes in material parameters are attributed to transition
from breakage of subsidiary (thin) lamellae in the sub-yield region to
fragmentation of primary (thick) lamellae in the post-yield region of
deformation.
