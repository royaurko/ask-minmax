The formation of three-dimensional prismatic cracks in the drying process of
starch-water mixtures is investigated numerically. We assume that the mixture
is an elastic porous medium which possesses a stress field and a water content
field. The evolution of both fields are represented by a spring network and a
phenomenological model with the water potential, respectively. We find that the
water content distribution has a propagating front which is not explained by a
simple diffusion process. The prismatic structure of cracks driven by the water
content field is observed. The depth dependence and the coarsening process of
the columnar structure are also studied. The particle diameter dependence of
the scale of the columns and the effect of the crack networks on the dynamics
of the water content field are also discussed.
