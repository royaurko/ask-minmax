We present a simple neural network model which combines a locally-connected
feedforward structure, as is traditionally used to model inter-neuron
connectivity, with a layer of undifferentiated connections which model the
diffuse projections from the human limbic system to the cortex. This new layer
makes it possible to model global effects such as salience, at the same time as
the local network processes task-specific or local information. This simple
combination network displays interactions between salience and regular
processing which correspond to known effects in the developing brain, such as
enhanced learning as a result of heightened affect.
  The cortex biases neuronal responses to affect both learning and memory,
through the use of diffuse projections from the limbic system to the cortex.
Standard ANNs do not model this non-local flow of information represented by
the ascending systems, which are a significant feature of the structure of the
brain, and although they do allow associational learning with multiple-trial,
they simply don't provide the capacity for one-time learning.
  In this research we model this effect using an artificial neural network
(ANN), creating a salience-affected neural network (SANN). We adapt an ANN to
embody the capacity to respond to an input salience signal and to produce a
reverse salience signal during testing.
  This research demonstrates that input combinations similar to the inputs in
the training data sets will produce similar reverse salience signals during
testing. Furthermore, this research has uncovered a novel method for training
ANNs with a single training iteration.
