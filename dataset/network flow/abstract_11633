In this paper, we analyze the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of wireless
sensor networks. A wireless sensor node with a single transmitter antenna and
multiple receiver antennas is considered here. We consider M (M greater or
equal ro 1) receiver antennas to mitigate channel fading effects. BER
performance is analyzed in the presence of a co-channel interference source.
Wireless channel is assumed to follow independently Nakagami fading for the
wireless sensor network and Rayleigh fading for the interference signal. Based
on the derived analytical expressions, the effects of different fading channel
and co-channel interference parameters on the BER performance of wireless
sensor networks are assessed.
