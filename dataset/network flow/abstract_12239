The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for interference networks, such as
the interference channel, the X channel, the Z interference channel and the Z
channel, is analyzed. In particular, we investigate the impact of
rate-splitting and channel knowledge at the transmitters. We also use the DMT
of the Z channel and the Z interference channel to distill insights into the
"loud neighbor" problem for femto-cell networks.
