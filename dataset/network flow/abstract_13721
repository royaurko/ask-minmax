We prove that for a broad class of exact symplectic manifolds including
${\mathbb R}^{2m}$ the Hamiltonian flow on a regular compact energy level of an
autonomous Hamiltonian cannot be uniquely ergodic. This is a consequence of the
Weinstein conjecture and an observation that a Hamiltonian structure with
non-vanishing self-linking number must have contact type. We apply these
results to show that certain types of exact twisted geodesic flows cannot be
uniquely ergodic.
