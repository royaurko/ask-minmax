In this paper, a simple network management architecture for supporting both
QoS requirements and organization network management policies is purposed. By
grouping the traffic flows according to the QoS requirements or certain network
management policies, the network resources are effectively controlled. The
purposed architecture is easy to deploy; the gateway is the only equipment that
needs installation, leaving the rest of the system untouched. The architecture
has not significantly degraded the overall system utilization when applying it
to the outgoing bound of the gateway. The architecture can also be implemented
on the wireless LAN at the access point because the architecture is designed in
such the way that it is independent to both the lower and upper protocol
layers.
