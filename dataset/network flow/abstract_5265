The landslide flow, introduced in [5], is a smoother analog of the earthquake
flow on Teichm\"uller space which shares some of its key properties. We show
here that further properties of earthquakes apply to landslides. The landslide
flow is the Hamiltonian flow of a convex function. The smooth grafting map
$sgr$ taking values in Teichm\"uller space, which is to landslides as grafting
is to earthquakes, is proper and surjective with respect to either of its
variables. The smooth grafting map $SGr$ taking values in the space of complex
projective structures is symplectic (up to a multiplicative constant). The
composition of two landslides has a fixed point on Teichm\"uller space. As a
consequence we obtain new results on constant Gauss curvature surfaces in
3-dimensional hyperbolic or AdS manifolds. We also show that the landslide flow
has a satisfactory extension to the boundary of Teichm\"uller space.
