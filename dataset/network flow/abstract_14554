The main aim in the current survey is to suggest models of the development of
structures, such as vortices and spirals, in accretion white dwarf's binaries.
Numerical methods and simulations are applied on the bases of hydrodynamic
analytical considerations. It is suggested in the theoretical model the
perturbation's parameters of the accretion flow, which are caused by the
influences of the tidal wave over the flux of accretion matter around the
secondary star. The results of numerical code application on the disturbed flow
reveal an appearing of structure with spiral shape due to the tidal interaction
in the close binaries. Our further simulations give the solution, which
expresses the formation of vortical configurations in the accretion disc's
zone. The evolution of vortices in areas of the flow's interaction is explored
using single vortex and composite vortex models. Gas in the disc matter is
considered to be compressible and non-ideal. The longevity of all these
structures is different and each depends on the time period of the rotation,
density and velocity of the accretion matter.
