Here, we study noisy transitional flows in imperfect millimeter-scale
channels. For probing the flows, we use microcantilever sensors embedded in the
channel walls. We perform experiments in two nominally identical channels. The
different set of imperfections in the two channels result in two random flows
in which high-order moments of near-wall fluctuations differ by orders of
magnitude. Surprisingly however, the lowest order statistics in both cases
appear qualitatively similar and can be described by a proposed noisy Landau
equation for a slow mode. The noise, regardless of its origin, regularizes the
Landau singularity of the relaxation time and makes transitions driven by
different noise sources appear similar.
