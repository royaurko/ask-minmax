Evaluation of link prediction methods is a hard task in very large complex
networks because of the inhibitive computational cost. By setting a lower bound
of the number of common neighbors (CN), we propose a new framework to
efficiently and precisely evaluate the performances of CN-based similarity
indices in link prediction for very large heterogeneous networks. Specifically,
we propose a fast algorithm based on the parallel computing scheme to obtain
all the node pairs with CN values larger than the lower bound. Furthermore, we
propose a new measurement, called self-predictability, to quantify the
performance of the CN-based similarity indices in link prediction, which on the
other side can indicate the link predictability of a network.
