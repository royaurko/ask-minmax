The Jones-Witten invariants can be generalized for non-singular smooth vector
fields with invariant probability measure on 3-manifolds, giving rise to new
invariants of dynamical systems [22]. After a short survey of cohomological
field theory for Yang-Mills fields, Donaldson-Witten invariants are generalized
to four-dimensional manifolds with non-singular smooth flows generated by
homologically non-trivial p-vector fields. These invariants have the
information of the flows and they are interpreted as the intersection number of
these flow orbits and constitute invariants of smooth four-manifolds admitting
global flows. We study the case of Kahler manifolds by using the Witten's
consideration of the strong coupling dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theories. The whole construction is performed by implementing the notion of
higher dimensional asymptotic cycles a la Schwartzman [18]. In the process
Seiberg-Witten invariants are also described within this context. Finally, we
give an interpretation of our asymptotic observables of 4-manifolds in the
context of string theory with flows.
