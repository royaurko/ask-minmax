Studying the (long-term) behavior of the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on mildly
singular varieties, one is naturally lead to study weak solutions of degenerate
parabolic complex Monge-Amp\'ere equations.
  The purpose of this article, the first of a series on this subject, is to
develop a viscosity theory for degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere flows in
domains of $\C^n$.
