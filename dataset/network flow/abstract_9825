The irrotational vortex geometry carachter of torsion loops is displayed by
showing that torsion loops and nonradial flow acoustic metrics are conformally
equivalent in $(1+1)$ dimensions while radial flow acoustic spacetime are
conformally related in $(2+1)$ dimensional spacetime. The analysis of
2-dimensional space allows us to express the fluid density in terms of the
parameters of torsion loop metric. These results lead us to conclude that the
acoustic metric of vortex flows is the gravitational analog of torsion loop
spacetime. Since no vorticity in the fluids is considered we do not make
explicit use of non-Riemannian geometry of vortex acoustics in classical
fluids. Acoustic nonradial flows are shown to exihibit a full analogy with
torsion loop metric.
