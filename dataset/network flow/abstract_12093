We present an electron identification algorithm based on a neural network
approach applied to the ZEUS uranium calorimeter. The study is motivated by the
need to select deep inelastic, neutral current, electron proton interactions
characterized by the presence of a scattered electron in the final state. The
performance of the algorithm is compared to an electron identification method
based on a classical probabilistic approach. By means of a principle component
analysis the improvement in the performance is traced back to the number of
variables used in the neural network approach.
