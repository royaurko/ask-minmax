We prove some estimates for convex ancient solutions (the existence time for
the solution starts from $-\infty$) to the power-of-mean curvature flow, when
the power is strictly greater than 1/2. As an application, we prove that in two
dimension, the blow-down of the entire convex translating solution, namely
$u_{h}=\frac{1}{h}u(h^{\frac{1}{1+\alpha}}x),$ locally uniformly converges to
$\frac{1}{1+\alpha}|x|^{1+\alpha}$ as $h\rightarrow\infty$. Another application
is that for generalized curve shortening flow (convex curve evolving in its
normal direction with speed equal to a power of its curvature), if the convex
compact ancient solution sweeps $\textbf{R}^{2}$, it it has to be a shrinking
circle. Otherwise the solution is defined in a strip region.
