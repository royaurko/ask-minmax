We investigate the use of compressive sampling for networked feedback control
systems. The method proposed serves to compress the control vectors which are
transmitted through rate-limited channels without much deterioration of control
performance. The control vectors are obtained by an L1-L2 optimization, which
can be solved very efficiently by FISTA (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding
Algorithm). Simulation results show that the proposed sparsity-promoting
control scheme gives a better control performance than a conventional
energy-limiting L2-optimal control.
