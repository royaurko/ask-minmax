We investigate the initial value problem for some energy supercritical
semilinear wave equations. We establish local existence in suitable spaces with
continuous flow. We also obtain some ill-posedness/weak ill-posedness results.
The proof uses the finite speed of propagation and a quantitative study of the
associated ODE. It does not require any scaling invariance of the equation.
