The effect of hadronic rescattering on the elliptic flow has been
investigated by the Cooper-Frye hadronization model from hydrodynamic evolution
following by the afterburner hadronic rescattering model for 200 GeV/c Au + Au
at 20-40% centrality. It is found that the hadronic rescattering can suppress
elliptic flow $v_2$ in momentum space especially in lower transverse momentum
region. In addition, the hadronic rescattering effects on transverse momentum
spectra and anisotropy coordinate space of hadrons are studied.
