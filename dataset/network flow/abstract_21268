This paper is concerned with the kinetic model of Othmer-Dunbar-Alt for
bacterial motion. Following a previous work, we apply the dispersion and
Strichartz estimates to prove global existence under several borderline growth
assumptions on the turning kernel. In particular we study the kinetic model
with internal variables taking into account the complex molecular network
inside the cell.
