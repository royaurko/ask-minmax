For the problem of efficiently supplying material to a spatial region from a
single source, we present a simple scaling argument based on branching network
volume minimization that identifies limits to the scaling of sink density. We
discuss implications for two fundamental and unresolved problems in organismal
biology and geomorphology: how basal metabolism scales with body size for
homeotherms and the scaling of drainage basin shape on eroding landscapes.
