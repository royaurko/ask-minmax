Flows over time generalize classical network flows by introducing a notion of
time. Each arc is equipped with a transit time that specifies how long flow
takes to traverse it, while flow rates may vary over time within the given edge
capacities. In this paper, we extend this concept of a dynamic optimization
problem to the more general setting of abstract flows. In this model, the
underlying network is replaced by an abstract system of linearly ordered sets,
called "paths" satisfying a simple switching property: Whenever two paths P and
Q intersect, there must be another path that is contained in the beginning of P
and the end of Q.
  We show that a maximum abstract flow over time can be obtained by solving a
weighted abstract flow problem and constructing a temporally repeated flow from
its solution. In the course of the proof, we also show that the relatively
modest switching property of abstract networks already captures many essential
properties of classical networks.
