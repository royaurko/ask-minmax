The problem of the two-point resistance in various networks has recently
received considerable attention. Here we consider the problem on a fan-resistor
network, which is a segment of the cobweb network. Using a recently developed
approach, we obtain the exact resistance between two arbitrary nodes on such a
network. As a byproduct, the analysis also delivers the solution of the
spanning tree problem on the fan network.
