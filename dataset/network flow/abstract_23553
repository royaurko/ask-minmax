We study the distribution of resistance fluctuations of conducting thin films
with different levels of internal disorder. The film is modeled as a resistor
network in a steady state determined by the competition between two biased
processes, breaking and recovery of the elementary resistors. The fluctuations
of the film resistance are calculated by Monte Carlo simulations which are
performed under different bias conditions, from the linear regime up to the
threshold for electrical breakdown. Depending on the value of the external
current, on the level of disorder and on the size of the system, the
distribution of the resistance fluctuations can exhibit significant deviations
from Gaussianity. As a general trend, a size dependent, non universal
distribution is found for systems with low and intermediate disorder. However,
for strongly disordered systems, close to the critical point of the
conductor-insulator transition, the non-Gaussianity persists when the size is
increased and the distribution of resistance fluctuations is well described by
the universal Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton distribution.
