The contact properties between metal and graphene were examined. The
electrical measurement on a multiprobe device with different contact areas
revealed that the current flow preferentially entered graphene at the edge of
the contact metal. The analysis using the cross-bridge Kelvin structure (CBK)
suggested that a transition from the edge conduction to area conduction
occurred for a contact length shorter than the transfer length of ~1 micron.
The contact resistivity for Ni was measured as ~5*10-6 Ohmcm2 using the CBK. A
simple calculation suggests that a contact resistivity less than 10-9 Ohmcm2 is
required for miniaturized graphene field effect transistors.
