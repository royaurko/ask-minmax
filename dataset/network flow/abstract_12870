The dynamics of a spheroidal vesicle, bounded by an inextensible membrane, is
analyzed in function of the enclosed fluid viscosity, and of the membrane
mechanical properties. The two situations in which a bending rigidity and a
shear elasticity are the potential energy source in the membrane have been
compared, and the stability properties of quasi-spherical vesicle shapes
discussed. The transition from tank-treading to flipping motion in an external
shear flow, has been studied in function of the vesicle internal viscosity and
of the strength of the shear quadratic component. The transverse lift strength
has been calculated in both cases of a tank-treading and of a flipping motion
regime.
