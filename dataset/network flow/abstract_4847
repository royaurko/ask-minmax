Boundary flow in the $c=1$ 2d CFT of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of a free
boson on a circle is considered. Adding a bulk marginal operator to the $c=1$
orbifold branch induces a boundary flow. We show that this flow is consistent
for any bulk marginal operator and known initial given boundary condition. The
supersymmetric $c=3/2$ case is also mentioned. The supersymmetric $c=3/2$ case
is also mentioned. For the circle branch of the moduli space this has been
shown in arXiv:hep-th/0609034v2. The ground state multiplicity ($g_b$) is
calculated and it is shown that it does indeed decrease.
