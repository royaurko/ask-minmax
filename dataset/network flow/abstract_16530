The behavioral specification of an object-oriented grammar model is
considered. The model is based on full lexicalization, head-orientation via
valency constraints and dependency relations, inheritance as a means for
non-redundant lexicon specification, and concurrency of computation. The
computation model relies upon the actor paradigm, with concurrency entering
through asynchronous message passing between actors. In particular, we here
elaborate on principles of how the global behavior of a lexically distributed
grammar and its corresponding parser can be specified in terms of event type
networks and event networks, resp.
