File-sharing networks are distributed systems used to disseminate files among
nodes of a communication network. The general simple principle of these systems
is that once a node has retrieved a file, it may become a server for this file.
In this paper, the capacity of these networks is analyzed with a stochastic
model when there is a constant flow of incoming requests for a given file. It
is shown that the problem can be solved by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of
a class of interacting branching processes. Several results of independent
interest concerning these branching processes are derived and then used to
study the file-sharing systems.
