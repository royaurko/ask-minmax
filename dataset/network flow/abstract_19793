We study theoretically the effects of heating on the magnetic flux moving in
superconductors with a periodic array of pinning sites (PAPS). The
voltage-current characteristic (VI-curve) of superconductors with a PAPS
includes a region with negative differential resistivity (NDR) of S-type (i.e.,
S-shaped VI-curve), while the heating of the superconductor by moving flux
lines produces NDR of N-type (i.e., with an N-shaped VI-curve). We analyze the
instability of the uniform flux flow corresponding to different parts of the
VI-curve with NDR. Especially, we focus on the appearance of the filamentary
instability that corresponds to an S-type NDR, which is extremely unusual for
superconductors. We argue that the simultaneous existence of NDR of both N- and
S-type gives rise to the appearance of self-organized two-dimensional dynamical
structures in the flux flow mode. We study the effect of the pinning site
positional disorder on the NDR and show that moderate disorder does not change
the predicted results, while strong disorder completely suppresses the S-type
NDR.
