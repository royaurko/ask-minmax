Nondissipative force acting on a vortex in Fermi superfluids and
superconductors is calculated from the spectral flow of fermion zero modes in
the vortex core. The spectral flow effect casts a new light on the problem of
mutual friction in superfluids. We demonstrate that, for vortices in an
isotropic system, the reactive mutual friction parameter D'(T) is negative in
the collisionless regime and it is positive in the hydrodynamic regime. This
agrees with 3He-B measurements [1] ( T.D.C. Bevan, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 74,
750 (1995)), which thus give the experimental verification of the spectral flow
effect in the vortex dynamics. General expression for all 3 nondissipative
forces (Magnus, Iordanskii and spectral flow) is presented in the whole
temperature range.
