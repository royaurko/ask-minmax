Using a relativistic transport (ART) model, we study the stopping power, the
formation of superdense hadronic matter as well as the strength of transverse
and radial flow in central Au+Au collisions at beam momentum from 2 to 12 GeV/c
per nucleon. We find that complete stopping is achieved in the whole beam
momentum range. In particular, the proton rapidity distribution scaled by the
beam rapidity is independent of the beam momentum, and this is in agreement
with the experimental findings. Also, a large volume of superdense hadronic
matter with a local energy density exceeding that expected for the transition
of a hadronic matter to the quark-gluon plasma is formed in collisions at beam
momenta greater than 8 GeV/c per nucleon. Furthermore, it is found that the
transverse flow in these collisions is sensitive to the nuclear equation of
state and decreases with increasing beam momentum. On the other hand, the
radial flow is insensitive to the equation of state, and its strength increases
with beam momentum.
