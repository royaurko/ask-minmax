Heavy-ion experiments have recently revealed that azimuthal momentum
anisotropy -- elliptic flow -- of direct photons from a QCD medium is a few
times larger than hydrodynamic predictions. I present a possible explanation
for the enhancement based on late quark chemical equilibration. The color glass
theory indicates that the medium is initially gluon-rich. Thermal photons are
then mainly produced after quarks are produced, at which point large flow
anisotropy is developed. The numerical estimations indicate that slow chemical
equilibration visibly enhances the elliptic flow of thermal photons.
