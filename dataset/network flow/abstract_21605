We attempt to solve the Einstein equations for string dust and null flowing
radiation for the general axially symmetric metric, which we believe is being
done for the first time. We obtain the string-dust and radiating
generalizations of the Kerr and the NUT solutions. There also occurs an
interesting case of radiating string-dust which arises from string-dust
generalization of Vaidya's solution of a radiating star.
