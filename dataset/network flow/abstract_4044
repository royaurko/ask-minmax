Cross correlations between normal and downstream velocity fluctuations in a
turbulent shear flow are shown to carry information about the non-normal
amplification process. The creation of spanwise modulated streaks by downstream
vortices implies an asymmetry in temporal correlation functions. We verify this
in numerical simulations in shear flows with $Re_\lambda\approx 100$.
