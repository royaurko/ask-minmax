Recent advances in wireless power transfer (WPT) technology provide a
cost-effective solution to charge wireless devices remotely without disruption
to the use. In this paper, we propose an efficient wireless charging control
method for exploiting the frequency diversity in multiuser broadband wireless
networks, to reduce energy outage and keep the system operating in an efficient
and sustainable state. In particular, we first analyze the impact of charging
control method to the operating lifetime of a WPT-enabled broadband system.
Based on the analysis, we then propose a multi-criteria charging control policy
that optimizes the transmit power allocation over frequency by jointly
considering the channel state information (CSI) and the battery state
information (BSI) of wireless devices. For practical implementation, the
proposed scheme is realized by a novel limited CSI estimation mechanism
embedded with partial BSI, which significantly reduces the energy cost of CSI
and BSI feedback. Simulation results show that the proposed method could
significantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power
constraint. Reciprocally, it also consumes lower transmit power to achieve
near-perpetual network operation than other single-criterion based charging
control methods.
