Complex networks have been characterised by their specific connectivity
patterns (network motifs), but their building blocks can also be identified and
described by node-motifs---a combination of local network features. One
technique to identify single node-motifs has been presented by Costa et al. (L.
D. F. Costa, F. A. Rodrigues, C. C. Hilgetag, and M. Kaiser, Europhys. Lett.,
87, 1, 2009). Here, we first suggest improvements to the method including how
its parameters can be determined automatically. Such automatic routines make
high-throughput studies of many networks feasible. Second, the new routines are
validated in different network-series. Third, we provide an example of how the
method can be used to analyse network time-series. In conclusion, we provide a
robust method for systematically discovering and classifying characteristic
nodes of a network. In contrast to classical motif analysis, our approach can
identify individual components (here: nodes) that are specific to a network.
Such special nodes, as hubs before, might be found to play critical roles in
real-world networks.
