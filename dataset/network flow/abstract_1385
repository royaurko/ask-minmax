We investigate viscous and non-viscous flow in two-dimensional self-affine
fracture joints through direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes
equations. As a novel hydrodynamic feature of this flow system, we find that
the effective permeability at higher Reynolds number to cubic order, falls into
two regimes as a function of the Hurst exponent $h$ characterizing the fracture
joints. For $h>1/2$, we find a weak dependency whereas for $h<1/2$, the
dependency is strong. A similar behavior is found for the higher order
coefficients. We also study the velocity fluctuations in space of a passive
scalar. These are strongly correlated on smaller length scales, but
decorrelates on larger scales. Moreover, the fluctuations on larger scale are
insensitive to the value of the Reynolds number.
