We address the mechanism of drag reduction by polymers in turbulent wall
bounded flows. On the basis of the equations of fluid mechanics we present a
quantitative derivation of the "maximum drag reduction (MDR) asymptote" which
is the maximum drag reduction attained by polymers. Based on Newtonian
information only we prove the existence of drag reduction, and with one
experimental parameter we reach a quantitative agreement with the experimental
measurements.
