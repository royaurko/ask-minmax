In this short note, we discuss a mechanism for the transport of energy,
momentum and dipole moment via transient neutral carriers in plasma. This gives
a way to rapidly convert bulk hydrodynamic flow energy into thermal energy over
a distance of several mean free paths. In the transition region of the solar
corona we estimate various processes and their potential to introduce the high
energies needed to to reach the 2 x10^6K observed there. It implies that
kinetic methods may be essential for modeling the corona and that there are
more gentle but still robust means than reconnection to relax magnetic fields
in plasmas.
