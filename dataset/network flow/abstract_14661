The universal instability mechanism in an ascending moist air flow is
theoretically proposed and analyzed. Its origin comes to the conflict between
two processes: the increasing of pressure forcing applied to the boundary layer
and the decelerating of the updraft flow due to air heating. It is shown that
the intensification of tropical storm with the redistribution of wind
velocities, pressure and temperature can result from the reorganization of the
dissipative structure which key parameters are the moist air lifting velocity
and the temperature of surrounding atmosphere. This reorganization can lead to
formation of hurricane eye and inner ring of convection. A transition of the
dissipative structure in a new state can occur when the temperature lapse rate
in a zone of air lifting reaches certain critical value. The accordance of
observational data with the proposed theoretical description is shown.
