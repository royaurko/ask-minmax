Asterisk and Open IMS use SIP signal protocol to enable both of them can be
connected. To facilitate both relationships, Enum server- that is able to
translate the numbering address such as PSTN (E.164) to URI address (Uniform
Resource Identifier)- can be used. In this research, we interconnect Open IMS
and Asterisk server Enum server. We then analyze the server performance and PDD
(Post Dial Delay) values resulted by the system. As the result of the
experiment, we found that, for a call from Open IMS user to analog Asterisk
telephone (FXS) with a arrival call each servers is 30 call/sec, the maximum
PDD value is 493.656 ms. Open IMS is able to serve maximum 30 call/s with
computer processor 1.55 GHz, while the Asterisk with computer processor 3.0
GHz, may serve up to 55 call/sec. Enum on server with 1.15 GHz computer
processor have the capability of serving maximum of 8156 queries/sec.
