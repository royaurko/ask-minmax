The paper investigates consensus problem for continuous-time multi-agent
systems with time-varying communication graphs subject to process noises.
Borrowing the ideas from input-to-state stability (ISS) and integral
input-to-state stability (iISS), robust consensus and integral robust consensus
are defined with respect to $L_\infty$ and $L_1$ norms of the disturbance
functions, respectively. Sufficient and/or necessary connectivity conditions
are obtained for the system to reach robust consensus or integral robust
consensus, which answer the question: how much communication capacity is
required for a multi-agent network to converge despite certain amount of
disturbance. The $\epsilon$-convergence time is then obtained for the network
as a special case of the robustness analysis. The results are based on quite
general assumptions on switching graph, weights rule and noise regularity. In
addition, as an illustration of the applicability of the results, distributed
event-triggered coordination is studied.
