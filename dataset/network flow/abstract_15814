We focus on examining and working with an important category of computer
software called Services, which are provided as a part of newer Microsoft
Windows operating systems. A typical Windows user transparently utilizes many
of these services but is frequently unaware of their existence. Since some
services have the potential to create significant problems when they are
executing, it is important for a system administrator to identify which
services are running on the network, the types of processing done by each
service, and any interrelationships among the various services. This
information can then be used to improve the overall integrity of both the
individual computer where a questionable service is running and in aggregate an
entire network of computers.
  NCSA has developed an application called SMART (Services Monitoring And
Reporting Tool) that can be used to identify and display all services currently
running in the network. A commercial program called Hyena remotely monitors the
services on all computers attached to the network and exports this information
to SMART. SMART produces various outputs that the system administrator can
analyze and then determine appropriate actions to take. In particular, SMART
provides a color coordinated user interface to quickly identify and classify
both potentially hazardous services and also unknown services.
