This paper is concerned with the motion of a time dependent hypersurface that
evolves by mean curvature flow with a a volume constraint. Phase field
approximation of this motion leads to the well known nonlocal Allen--Cahn
equation. Here we propose a modified version of this equation, and we show that
it has better volume preserving properties than the classical one, even in the
presence of an additional forcing term.
