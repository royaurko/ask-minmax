We study the effects of bulk viscosity on p_T spectra and elliptic flow in
heavy ion collisions at RHIC. We argue that direct effect of the bulk viscosity
on the evolution of the velocity field is small, but corrections to the
freezeout distributions can be significant. These effects are dominated by
chemical non-equilibration in the hadronic phase. We show that a non-zero bulk
viscosity in the range $\zeta/s \lsim 0.05$ improves the description of spectra
and flow at RHIC.
