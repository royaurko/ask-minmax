In the present work we investigate the effects of spatial constraints on the
efficiency of task execution in systems underlain by geographical complex
networks where the probability of connection decreases with the distance
between the nodes. The investigation considers several configurations of the
parameters defining the network connectivity, and the Barabasi-Albert network
model is also considered for comparisons. The results show that the effect of
connectivity is significant only for shorter tasks, that the locality of
connections implied by the spatial constraints reduces efficency, and that the
addition of edges can improve the efficiency of the execution, although with
increasing locality of the connections the improvement is small.
