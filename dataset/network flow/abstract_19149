This paper considers a scenario of short-range communication, known as
device-to-device (D2D) communication, where D2D users reuse the downlink
resources of a cellular network to transmit directly to their corresponding
receivers. In addition, multiple antennas at the base station (BS) are used in
order to simultaneously support multiple cellular users using multiuser or
massive MIMO. The network model considers a fixed number of cellular users and
that D2D users are distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process
(PPP). Two metrics are studied, namely, average sum rate (ASR) and energy
efficiency (EE). We derive tractable expressions and study the tradeoffs
between the ASR and EE as functions of the number of BS antennas and density of
D2D users for a given coverage area.
