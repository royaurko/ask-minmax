The system of compressible adiabatic flow through porous media is considered
in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ in the present paper. The global existence and uniqueness
of classical solutions are obtained when the initial data is near its
equilibrium. We also show that the pressure of the system converges to its
equilibrium state at the same $L^2$-rate $(1+t)^{-3/4}$ as the Navier-Stokes
equations without heat conductivity, but the velocity of the system decays at
the $L^2$-rate $(1+t)^{-5/4}$, which is faster than the $L^2$-rate
$(1+t)^{-3/4}$ for the Navier-Stokes equations without heat conductivity [3].
