The vector bin packing problem (VBP) is a generalization of bin packing with
multiple constraints. In this problem we are required to pack items,
represented by p-dimensional vectors, into as few bins as possible. The
multiple-choice vector bin packing (MVBP) is a variant of the VBP in which bins
have several types and items have several incarnations. We present an exact
method, based on an arc-flow formulation with graph compression, for solving
MVBP by simply representing all the patterns in a very compact graph. As a
proof of concept we report computational results on a variable-sized bin
packing data set.
