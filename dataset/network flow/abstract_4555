We analyze the game of go from the point of view of complex networks. We
construct three different directed networks of increasing complexity, defining
nodes as local patterns on plaquettes of increasing sizes, and links as actual
successions of these patterns in databases of real games. We discuss the
peculiarities of these networks compared to other types of networks. We explore
the ranking vectors and community structure of the networks and show that this
approach enables to extract groups of moves with common strategic properties.
We also investigate different networks built from games with players of
different levels or from different phases of the game. We discuss how the study
of the community structure of these networks may help to improve the computer
simulations of the game. More generally, we believe such studies may help to
improve the understanding of human decision process.
