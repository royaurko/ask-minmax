We study the geodesic flow of geometrically finite quotients
$\Omega/{\Gamma}$ of Hilbert geometries, in particular its recurrence
properties. We prove that, under a geometrical assumption on the cusps, the
geodesic flow is uniformly hyperbolic. Without this assumption, we provide an
example of a quotient whose geodesic flow has a zero Lyapunov exponent. We make
the link between the dynamics of the geodesic flow and some properties of the
convex set $\Omega$ and the group $\Gamma$. As a consequence, we get various
rigidity results which extend previous results of Benoist and Guichard for
compact quotients. Finally, we study the link between volume entropy and
critical exponent; for example, we show that they coincide provided the
quotient has finite volume.
