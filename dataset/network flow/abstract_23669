A low-cost DAQ card has been developed for school-network cosmic ray detector
projects, providing digitized data from photomultiplier tubes via a standard
serial interface. To facilitate analysis of these data and to provide students
with a starting point for custom readout systems, a model interface has been
developed using the National Instruments LabVIEW(R) system. This user-friendly
interface allows one to initialize the trigger coincidence conditions for
data-taking runs and to monitor incoming or pre-recorded data sets with
updating singles- and coincidence-rate plots and other user-selectable
histograms.
