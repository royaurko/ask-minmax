An unconventional solution for finding the location of event creation is
presented. It is based on two feed-forward neural networks with fixed
architecture, whose parameters are chosen so as to reach a high accuracy. The
interaction point location is a parameter that can be used to select events of
interest from the very high rate of events created at the current experiments
in High Energy Physics. The system suggested here is tested on simulated data
sets of the ZEUS Central Tracking Detector, and is shown to perform better than
conventional algorithms.
