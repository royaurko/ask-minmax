Previous models of international conflict have suffered two shortfalls. They
tended not to embody dynamic changes, focusing rather on static slices of
behavior over time. These models have also been empirically evaluated in ways
that assumed the independence of each country, when in reality they are
searching for the interdependence among all countries. We illustrate a solution
to these two hurdles and evaluate this new, dynamic, network based approach to
the dependencies among the ebb and flow of daily international interactions
using a newly developed, and openly available, database of events among
nations.
