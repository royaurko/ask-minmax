The Internet infrastructure is severely stressed. Rapidly growing overheads
associated with the primary function of the Internet---routing information
packets between any two computers in the world---cause concerns among Internet
experts that the existing Internet routing architecture may not sustain even
another decade. Here we present a method to map the Internet to a hyperbolic
space. Guided with the constructed map, which we release with this paper,
Internet routing exhibits scaling properties close to theoretically best
possible, thus resolving serious scaling limitations that the Internet faces
today. Besides this immediate practical viability, our network mapping method
can provide a different perspective on the community structure in complex
networks.
