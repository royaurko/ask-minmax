In a recent submission to this archive arXiv:cond-mat/0105325, Suslov has
claimed that our recent numerical estimate of the critical exponent of the
Anderson transition $\nu=1.57\pm.02$ is in error and that the available
numerical data are consistent with a value of $\nu=1$. We contest this claim
and demonstrate using Suslov's own scaling procedure that $\nu\ne 1$
