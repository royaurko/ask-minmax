A translation surface S is said to have the finite blocking property if for
every pair (O,A) of points in S there exists a finite number of "blocking"
points B_1,...,B_n such that every geodesic from O to A meets one of the B_i's.
S is said to be purely periodic if the directional flow is periodic in each
direction whose directional flow contains a periodic trajectory (this implies
that S admits a cylinder decomposition in such directions). We will prove that
finite blocking property implies pure periodicity. We will also classify the
surfaces that have the finite blocking property in genus 2: such surfaces are
exactly the torus branched coverings. Moreover, we prove that in every stratum,
such surfaces form a set of null measure. In the Appendix, we prove that
completely periodic translation surfaces form a set of null measure in every
stratum.
