We study the dynamics of the geodesic and horocycle flows of the unit tangent
bundle $(\hat M, T^1\mathcal{F})$ of a compact minimal lamination $(M,\mathcal
F)$ by negatively curved surfaces. We give conditions under which the action of
the affine group generated by the joint action of these flows is minimal, and
examples where this action is not minimal. In the first case, we prove that if
$\mathcal F$ has a leaf which is not simply connected, the horocyle flow is
topologically transitive.
