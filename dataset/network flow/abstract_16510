We report progress in the development of automatic star/galaxy classifier for
processing images generated by large galaxy surveys like APM. Our
classification method is based on neural networks using the Kohonen
Self-Organizing Map approach. Our method is novel, since it does not need
supervised learning, i.e. human factor, in training. The analysis presented
here concentrates on separating point sources (stars) from extended ones. Using
simple numerical experiments we compare our method of image classification to
the more traditional (PSF-fitting) approach of DAOFIND.
