In this paper we study different options for the survivability implementation
in MPLS over Optical Transport Networks in terms of network resource usage and
configuration cost. We investigate two approaches to the survivability
deployment: single layer and multilayer survivability and present various
methods for spare capacity allocation (SCA) to reroute disrupted traffic. The
comparative analysis shows the influence of the traffic granularity on the
survivability cost: for high bandwidth LSPs, close to the optical channel
capacity, the multilayer survivability outperforms the single layer one,
whereas for low bandwidth LSPs the single layer survivability is more
cost-efficient. For the multilayer survivability we demonstrate that by mapping
efficiently the spare capacity of the MPLS layer onto the resources of the
optical layer one can achieve up to 22% savings in the total configuration cost
and up to 37% in the optical layer cost. Further savings (up to 9 %) in the
wavelength use can be obtained with the integrated approach to network
configuration over the sequential one, however, at the increase in the
optimization problem complexity. These results are based on a cost model with
actual technology pricing and were obtained for networks targeted to a
nationwide coverage.
