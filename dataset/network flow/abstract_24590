Scholarship on teams has focused on the relationship between a team's
performance, however defined, and the network structure among team members. For
example, Uzzi and Spiro (2005) find that the creative performance of Broadway
musical teams depends heavily on the internal cohesion of team members and
their past collaborative experience with individuals outside their immediate
teams. In other words, team members' internal cohesion and external ties are
crucial to the team's success. How, then, do they interact to produce positive
performance outcomes? In our work, we separate the proximal causes of tie
formation from the proximal determinants of outcomes to determine the mechanism
behind this interaction. To examine this puzzle, we examine the performance of
national soccer squads over time as a function of changing levels and
configurations of brokerage and closure ties formed by players working for
professional soccer clubs.
