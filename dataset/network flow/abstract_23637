We show that, independently of the boundary conditions, the two phases of the
4-dimensional compact U(1) lattice gauge theory can be characterized by the
presence or absence of an ``infinite'' current network, with an appropriate
definition of ``infinite'' for the various types of boundary conditions imposed
on the finite lattice. The probability for the occurrence of an ``infinite''
network takes values 0 or 1 in the cold and hot phase, respectively. It thus
constitutes a very efficient order parameter, which allows one to determine the
transition region at low computational cost. In addition, for open and fixed
boundary conditions we address the question of the impact of inhomogeneities
and give examples of the reappearance of an energy gap already at moderate
lattice sizes.
