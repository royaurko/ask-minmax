We show that a translation of vector V on the torus has the monotone
shrinking target property if and only if the vector V is of constant type.
Then, using reparametrizations of linear flows, we show that there exist area
preserving real analytic maps of the three torus that are mixing of all orders
and do not enjoy the monotone shrinking target property.
