This paper settles the optimality of sorting networks given in The Art of
Computer Programming vol. 3 more than 40 years ago. The book lists efficient
sorting networks with n <= 16 inputs. In this paper we give general
combinatorial arguments showing that if a sorting network with a given depth
exists then there exists one with a special form. We then construct
propositional formulas whose satisfiability is necessary for the existence of
such a network. Using a SAT solver we conclude that the listed networks have
optimal depth. For n <= 10 inputs where optimality was known previously, our
algorithm is four orders of magnitude faster than those in prior work.
