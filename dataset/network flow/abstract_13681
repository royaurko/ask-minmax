We present the elliptic flow $v_{2}$ of electrons from the semi-leptonic
decays of heavy-flavour hadrons at mid-rapidity for semi-central ($20-40%$
centrality) Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV measured with
the ALICE detector. A positive $v_{2}$ is observed at low $p_\mathrm{T}$ in
semi-central collisions. Comparisons with previous measurements obtained at
lower collision energy at RHIC in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ =
0.2 TeV and with theoretical models are also presented.
