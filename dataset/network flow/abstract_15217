In this paper, we present an effective intrusion response engine combined
with intrusion detection in ad hoc networks. The intrusion response engine is
composed of a secure communication module, a local and a global response
module. Its function is based on an innovative tree-based key agreement
protocol while the intrusion detection engine is based on a class of neural
networks called eSOM. The proposed intrusion response model and the tree-based
protocol, it is based on, are analyzed concerning key secrecy while the
intrusion detection engine is evaluated for MANET under different traffic
conditions and mobility patterns. The results show a high detection rate for
packet dropping attacks.
