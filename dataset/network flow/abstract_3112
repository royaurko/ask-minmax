The overwhelming success of online social networks, the key actors in the
cosmos of the Web 2.0, has reshaped human interactions on a worldwide scale. To
understand the fundamental mechanisms which determine the fate of online social
networks at the system level, we describe the digital world as a complex
ecosystem of interacting networks. In this paper, we discuss the impact of
heterogeneity in network intrinsic fitnesses induced by the competition between
an international network, like Facebook, and local services. To this end, we
construct a 1:1000 scale model of the digital world enclosing the 80 countries
with most Internet users. We show how inter-country social ties induce an
increased intrinsic fitness of the international network. Under certain
conditions this leads to the extinction of local networks whereas under
different conditions local networks can persist and even dominate the
international network completely. These findings provide new insights into the
possibilities to preserve digital diversity.
