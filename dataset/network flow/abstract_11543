Community structure discovery in complex networks is a quite challenging
problem spanning many applications in various disciplines such as biology,
social network and physics. Emerging from various approaches numerous
algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem. Nevertheless little
attention has been devoted to compare their efficiency on realistic simulated
data. To better understand their relative performances, we evaluate
systematically eleven algorithms covering the main approaches. The Normalized
Mutual Information (NMI) measure is used to assess the quality of the
discovered community structure from controlled artificial networks with
realistic topological properties. Results show that along with the network
size, the average proportion of intra-community to inter-community links is the
most influential parameter on performances. Overall, "Infomap" is the leading
algorithm, followed by "Walktrap", "SpinGlass" and "Louvain" which also achieve
good consistency.
