Profound temperature peaks are observed in regions of high velocity shear in
a 2D dusty plasma experiment with laser-driven flow. These are attributed to
viscous heating, which occurs due to collisional scattering in a shear flow.
Using measurements of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and spatial profiles of
flow velocity and temperature, we determine three dimensionless numbers:
Brinkman Br = 0.5, Prandtl Pr = 0.09, and Eckert Ec = 5.7. The large value of
Br indicates significant viscous heating that is consistent with the observed
temperature peaks.
