The two-phase MIMO NC (network coding) scheme can be used to boost the
throughput in a two-way relay channel in which nodes are equipped with multiple
antennas. The obvious strategy is for the relay node to extract the individual
packets from the two end nodes and mix the two packets to form a network-coded
packet. In this paper, we propose a new scheme called MIMO PNC (physical
network coding), in which the relay extracts the summation and difference of
the two end packets and then converts them to the network-coded form. MIMO PNC
is a natural combination of the single-antenna PNC scheme and the linear MIMO
detection scheme. The advantages of MIMO PNC are many. First, it removes the
stringent carrier-phase requirement in single-antenna PNC. Second, it is linear
in complexity with respect to the constellation size and the number of
simultaneous data streams in MIMO. Simulation shows that MIMO PNC outperforms
the straightforward MIMO NC significantly under random Rayleigh fading channel.
Based on our analysis, we further conjecture that MIMO PNC outperforms MIMO NC
under all possible realizations of the channel.
