While there have been important theoretical advances in understanding the
universality classes of interfaces moving in porous media, the developed tools
cannot be directly applied to experiments. Here we introduce a method that can
identify the universality class from snapshots of the interface profile. We
test the method on discrete models whose universality class is well known, and
use it to identify the universality class of interfaces obtained in experiments
on fluid flow in porous media.
