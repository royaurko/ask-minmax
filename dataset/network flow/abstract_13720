In this paper, Optimal Homotopy Perturbation Method (OHPM) is employed to
determine an analytic approximate solutions for nonlinear MHD Jeffery-Hamel
flow and heat transfer problem. The Navier-Stokes equations, taking into
account Maxwell's electromagnetism and heat transfer lead to two nonlinear
ordinary differential equations. The obtained results by means of OHPM show a
very good agreement in comparison with the numerical results and with Homotopy
Perturbation Method (HPM).
