We consider supersymmetric holographic flows that involve background gauge
fields dual to chemical potentials in the boundary field theory. We use a
consistent truncation of gauged N=8 supergravity in five dimensions and we give
a complete analysis of the supersymmetry conditions for a large family of
flows. We examine how the well-known supersymmetric flow between two fixed
points is modified by the presence of the chemical potentials and this yields a
new, completely smooth, solution that interpolates between two global AdS
spaces of different radii and with different values of the chemical potential.
We also examine some black-hole-like singular flows and a new
non-supersymmetric black hole solution. We comment on the interpretation of our
new solutions in terms of giant gravitons and discuss the implications of our
work for finding black-hole solutions in AdS geometries.
