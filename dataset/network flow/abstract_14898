In this work we address the open problem of large Reynolds number limit in
hydrodynamic turbulence. Using the arguments similar to the Kolmogorov--Obukhov
theory, one can show that an infinitesimal random perturbation of viscosity,
under otherwise deterministic flow conditions, leads to an inverse cascade of
stochasticity from the Kolmogorov viscous scale to large scales. This results
in the \textit{stochastic anomaly}: in the limit $\mathrm{Re} \to \infty$ the
turbulent flow is described by a unique time-dependent stochastic solution,
i.e., finite stochastic components of velocity at large scales persist despite
of vanishing random viscous term. This phenomenon imposes fundamental
limitations for finite-time predictions in the developed turbulence, at the
same time suggesting the physical relevance of spontaneous stochastic
solutions. Such solutions can be used to extend the Kolmogorov hypotheses for
statistically non-stationary turbulent flow.
