We define a notion of equivariant non-degeneracy of $G$-maps to introduce the
class of equivariantly non-degenerate flows on smooth compact manifolds with
compact Lie group action. We prove genericity of this class and use this result
to construct an equivariant version of the Fuller index, which detects group
orbits of periodic orbits of the flow, distinguished by their isotropy.
