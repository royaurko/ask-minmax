I investigate the correlation between spatial and flow anisotropy in
determining the elliptic flow and azimuthal dependence of the HBT correlation
radii in non-central nuclear collisions. It is shown that the correlation radii
are in most cases dominantly sensitive to the anisotropy in space. In case of
v2, the correlation depends strongly on particle species. A procedure for
disentangling the spatial and the flow anisotropy is proposed.
