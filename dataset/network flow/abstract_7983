We consider the problem of evolving hypersurfaces by mean curvature flow in
the presence of obstacles, that is domains which the flow is not allowed to
enter. In this paper, we treat the case of complete graphs and explain how the
approach of M. Saez and the second contributor yields a global weak solution to the
original problem for general initial data and onesided obstacles.
