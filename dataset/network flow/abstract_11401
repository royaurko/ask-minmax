To overcome the #P-hardness of computing/updating prices in logarithm market
scoring rule-based (LMSR-based) combinatorial prediction markets, Chen et al.
[5] recently used a simple Bayesian network to represent the prices of
securities in combinatorial predictionmarkets for tournaments, and showed that
two types of popular securities are structure preserving. In this paper, we
significantly extend this idea by employing Bayesian networks in general
combinatorial prediction markets. We reveal a very natural connection between
LMSR-based combinatorial prediction markets and probabilistic belief
aggregation,which leads to a complete characterization of all structure
preserving securities for decomposable network structures. Notably, the main
results by Chen et al. [5] are corollaries of our characterization. We then
prove that in order for a very basic set of securities to be structure
preserving, the graph of the Bayesian network must be decomposable. We also
discuss some approximation techniques for securities that are not structure
preserving.
