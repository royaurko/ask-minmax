We show that the well established Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model for the
dynamics of earthquakes is able to reproduce a new striking property of real
earthquake data. Recently, it has been pointed out by Abe and Suzuki that the
epicenters of earthquakes could be connected in order to generate a graph, with
properties of a scale-free network of the Barabasi-Albert type. However, only
the non conservative version of the Olami-Feder-Christensen model is able to
reproduce this behavior. The conservative version, instead, behaves like a
random graph. Besides indicating the robustness of the model to describe
earthquake dynamics, those findings reinforce that conservative and non
conservative versions of the OFC model are qualitatively different. Also, we
propose a completely new dynamical mechanism that, even without an explicit
rule of preferential attachment, generates a free scale network. The
preferential attachment is in this case a ``by-product'' of the long term
correlations associated with the self-organized critical state. The detailed
study of the properties of this network can reveal new aspects of the dynamics
of the OFC model, contributing to the understanding of self-organized
criticality in non conserving models.
