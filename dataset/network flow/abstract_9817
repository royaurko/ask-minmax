The goal of this thesis is the development and implementation of a
non-perturbative solution method for Wegner's flow equations. We show that a
parameterization of the flowing Hamiltonian in terms of a scalar function
allows the flow equation to be rewritten as a nonlinear partial differential
equation. The implementation is non-perturbative in that the derivation of the
PDE is based on an expansion controlled by the size of the system rather than
the coupling constant. We apply this method to the Lipkin model and obtain very
accurate results for the spectrum, expectation values and eigenstates for all
values of the coupling and in the thermodynamic limit. New aspects of the phase
structure, made apparent by this non-perturbative treatment, are also
investigated. The Dicke model is treated using a two-step diagonalization
procedure which illustrates how an effective Hamiltonian may be constructed and
subsequently solved within this framework.
