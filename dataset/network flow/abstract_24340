We have investigated the time series by the mapping them to the complex
network. We have studied the behavior of the relative number of clusters in
dynamic visibility graphs near the critical value of the angle of view. Time
series of different nature both artificial and experimental were numerically
investigated. In all cases, the dependence of the relative number of clusters
on the proximity to the critical angle of view had a power law behavior. Thus,
it was shown that there is a similarity between the behavior of the relative
number of clusters and the order parameter in the second-order phase transition
theory and percolation theory. Each time series is characterized by its own
value of the critical index - an analog of the critical index in second-order
phase transition theory.
