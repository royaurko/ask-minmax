Traffic shaping is a mechanism used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to
limit subscribers' traffic based on their service contracts. This paper
investigates the current implementation of traffic shaping based on the token
bucket filter (TBF), discusses its advantages and disadvantages, and proposes a
cooperative TBF that can improve subscribers' quality of service (QoS)/quality
of experience (QoE) without compromising business aspects of the service
contract model by proportionally allocating excess bandwidth from inactive
subscribers to active ones based on the long-term bandwidths per their service
contracts.
