We present the results of a photographic and CCD imaging survey for
Herbig-Haro (HH) objects in the L1630 and L1641 giant molecular clouds in
Orion. The new HH flows were initially identified from a deep H-alpha film from
the recently commissioned AAO/UKST H-alpha Survey of the southern sky. Our
scanned H-alpha and broad band R images highlight both the improved resolution
of the H-alpha survey and the excellent contrast of the H-alpha flux with
respect to the broad band R. Comparative IVN survey images allow us to
distinguish between emission and reflection nebulosity. Our CCD H-alpha, [SII],
continuum and I band images confirm the presence of a parsec-scale HH flow
associated with the Ori I-2 cometary globule and several parsec-scale strings
of HH emission centred on the L1641-N infrared cluster. Several smaller
outflows display one-sided jets. Our results indicate that for declinations
south of -6 degrees in L1641, parsec-scale flows appear to be the major force
in the large-scale movement of optical dust and molecular gas.
