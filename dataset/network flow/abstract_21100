Thin films of alkali metals when sandwiched at both surfaces by thin metal
films loose their conductance. The superconducting proximity effect is used to
investigate the change in the alkali film. On the length scale of the film
thickness the electronic properties of the alkali film do not change noticeably
although its conductance is dramatically reduced, corresponding to localized
electrons.
