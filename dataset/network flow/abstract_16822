Directed information theory deals with communication channels with feedback.
When applied to networks, a natural extension based on causal conditioning is
needed. We show here that measures built from directed information theory in
networks can be used to assess Granger causality graphs of stochastic
processes. We show that directed information theory includes measures such as
the transfer entropy, and that it is the adequate information theoretic
framework needed for neuroscience applications, such as connectivity inference
problems.
