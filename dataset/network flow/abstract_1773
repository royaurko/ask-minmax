Scaling data storage is a significant concern in enterprise systems and
Storage Area Networks (SANs) are deployed as a means to scale enterprise
storage. SANs based on Fibre Channel have been used extensively in the last
decade while iSCSI is fast becoming a serious contender due to its reduced
costs and unified infrastructure. This work examines the performance of iSCSI
with multiple TCP connections. Multiple TCP connections are often used to
realize higher bandwidth but there may be no fairness in how bandwidth is
distributed. We propose a mechanism to share congestion information across
multiple flows in ``Fair-TCP'' for improved performance. Our results show that
Fair-TCP significantly improves the performance for I/O intensive workloads.
