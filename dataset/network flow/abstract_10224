Analysis of elliptic flow of protons and antiprotons in Au+Au collisions is
performed in a wide range of incident energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7--62.4 GeV.
Simulations has been done within the three-fluid model employing a purely
hadronic equation of state (EoS) and two versions of the EoS involving
deconfinement transition: an EoS with the first-order phase transition and that
with a smooth crossover transition. It is found that the proton data are
reproduced approximately to the same extent within all of the scenarios,
including the hadronic one, while the deconfinement scenarios look certainly
preferable for the antiproton elliptic flow. The fact that difference between
elliptic flows of protons and antiprotons decreases with the incident energy
rise is a consequence of reducing baryon stopping rather than an onset of
deconfinement.
