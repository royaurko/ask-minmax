The problem of distributed rate maximization in multi-channel ALOHA networks
is considered. First, we study the problem of constrained distributed rate
maximization, where user rates are subject to total transmission probability
constraints. We propose a best-response algorithm, where each user updates its
strategy to increase its rate according to the channel state information and
the current channel utilization. We prove the convergence of the algorithm to a
Nash equilibrium in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks using the
theory of potential games. The performance of the best-response dynamic is
analyzed and compared to a simple transmission scheme, where users transmit
over the channel with the highest collision-free utility. Then, we consider the
case where users are not restricted by transmission probability constraints.
Distributed rate maximization under uncertainty is considered to achieve both
efficiency and fairness among users. We propose a distributed scheme where
users adjust their transmission probability to maximize their rates according
to the current network state, while maintaining the desired load on the
channels. We show that our approach plays an important role in achieving the
Nash bargaining solution among users. Sequential and parallel algorithms are
proposed to achieve the target solution in a distributed manner. The
efficiencies of the algorithms are demonstrated through both theoretical and
simulation results.
