In the above paper the contributor treats the boundary layer flow along a vertical
flat plate, immersed in a Darcy Brinkman Forchheimer porous medium. The
porosity and the permeability of the porous medium are variable across the
boundary layer. In addition a magnetic field with constant strength is applied
normal to the plate. The fluid temperature at the plate is constant and
different from that of the ambient fluid. This temperature difference creates a
buoyancy force and the flow is characterized as mixed convection. The partial
differential equations of the boundary layer flow are transformed into ordinary
differential equations and subsequently are solved with the Runge-Kutta
Fehlberg method. The results are presented in two tables and 11 figures.
