We present a framework to cluster nodes in directed networks according to
their roles by combining Role-Based Similarity (RBS) and Markov Stability, two
techniques based on flows. First we compute the RBS matrix, which contains the
pairwise similarities between nodes according to the scaled number of in- and
out-directed paths of different lengths. The weighted RBS similarity matrix is
then transformed into an undirected similarity network using the Relaxed
Minimum-Spanning Tree (RMST) algorithm, which uses the geometric structure of
the RBS matrix to unblur the network, such that edges between nodes with high,
direct RBS are preserved. Finally, we partition the RMST similarity network
into role-communities of nodes at all scales using Markov Stability to find a
robust set of roles in the network. We showcase our framework through a
biological and a man-made network.
