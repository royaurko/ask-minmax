In this paper, we investigate asymptotic stability of linear time-varying
systems with (sub-) stochastic system matrices. Motivated by distributed
dynamic fusion over networks of mobile agents, we impose some mild regularity
conditions on the elements of time-varying system matrices. We provide
sufficient conditions under which the asymptotic stability of the LTV system
can be guaranteed. By introducing the notion of slices, as non-overlapping
partitions of the sequence of systems matrices, we obtain stability conditions
in terms of the slice lengths and some network parameters. In addition, we
apply the LTV stability results to the distributed leader-follower algorithm,
and show the corresponding convergence and steady-state. An illustrative
example is also included to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
