We study effects of both magnetic field and radiation on unsteady free
convective magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow under the influence of heat and mass
transfer. An implicit finite difference scheme of Crank-Nicolson method is used
to analyze the results. The governing boundary layer equations along with the
initial and boundary conditions are casted into a dimensionless form which
results in a more precise solution. We determine the change in velocity under
the influence of radiation and magnetic field with temperature and
concentration taken into account. A code is constructed (FORTRAN 6.5) to obtain
predictions following from the numerical solution which have been compared with
the existing information in the literature, and a very good agreement is
obtained. The results obtained through this study will be helpful in the
prediction of flow and heat transfer in the presence of magnetic field and
radiation.
