Space-time picture of the anisotropic flow evolution in Au+Au collisions at
BNL RHIC is studied for strange hadrons within the microscopic quark-gluon
string model. The directed flow of both mesons and hyperons demonstrates wiggle
structure with the universal antiflow slope at |y| < 2 for minimum bias events.
This effect increases as the reaction becomes more peripheral. The development
of both components of the anisotropic flow is closely related to particle
freeze-out. Hadrons are emitted continuously, and different hadronic species
are decoupled from the system at different times. These hadrons contribute
differently to the formation and evolution of the elliptic flow, which can be
decomposed onto three components: (i) flow created by hadrons emitted from the
surface at the onset of the collision; (ii) flow produced by jets; (iii)
hydrodynamic flow. Due to these features, the general trend in elliptic flow
formation is that the earlier mesons are frozen, the weaker their elliptic
flow. In contrast, baryons frozen at the end of the system evolution have
stronger v2.
