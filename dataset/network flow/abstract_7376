In many clusters of galaxies there is evidence for cooling flows which
deposit large quantities of cool gas in the central regions. A fraction of this
gas might accumulate as dense cool clouds. The aim of this communication is to
discuss the minimum temperature achievable by clouds in cooling flows of
different cluster of galaxies.
