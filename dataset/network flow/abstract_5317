We have implemented the log-conformation method for two-dimensional
viscoelastic flow in COMSOL, a commercial high-level finite element package.
The code is verified for an Oldroyd-B fluid flowing past a confined cylinder.
We are also able to describe the well-known bistability of the viscoelastic
flow in a cross-slot geometry for a FENE-CR fluid, and we describe the changes
required for performing simulations with the Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT), Giesekus
and FENE-P models. Finally, we calculate the flow of a FENE-CR fluid in a
geometry with three in- and outlets. The implementation is included in the
supplementary material, and we hope that it can inspire new as well as
experienced researchers in the field of differential constitutive equations for
viscoelastic flow.
