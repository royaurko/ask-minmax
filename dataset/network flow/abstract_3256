In this paper we investigate the attractor mechanism in the five dimensional
low energy supergravity theory corresponding to M-theory compactified on a
Calabi-Yau threefold $CY_3$. Using very special geometry, we derive the general
first-order attractor flow equations for BPS and non-BPS solutions in
five-dimensional Gibbons-Hawking spaces. Especially, considering the
supersymmetric solution, we obtain the first-order flow equations for
supersymmetric (multi)black rings. We also solve the flow equations and discuss
some properties of the solutions of flow equations.
