A new mechanism leading to scale-free networks is proposed in this letter. It
is shown that in many cases of interest, the connectivity power-law behavior is
neither related to dynamical properties nor to preferential attachment.
Instead, we show that without increasing the number of vertices in time and
without applying the so called {\it ``rich-get-richer''} condition we obtain
networks whose statistical properties are scale-free. Assigning a quenched
fitness value $x_i$ to every vertex, and drawing links among vertices with a
probability depending on the fitnesses of the two involved sites, gives rise to
what we call a {\it ``good-get-richer''} mechanism, in which sites with larger
fitness are more likely to become hubs (i.e., to be highly connected). This
procedure generates power-law behaviors for various fitness distributions and
attaching rules.
