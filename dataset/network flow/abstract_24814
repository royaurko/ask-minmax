People are facing a flood of data today. Data are being collected at
unprecedented scale in many areas, such as networking, image processing,
virtualization, scientific computation, and algorithms. The huge data nowadays
are called Big Data. Big data is an all encompassing term for any collection of
data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process them using
traditional data processing applications. In this article, the contributors present
a unique way which uses network simulator and tools of image processing to
train students abilities to learn, analyze, manipulate, and apply Big Data.
Thus they develop students handson abilities on Big Data and their critical
thinking abilities. The contributors used novel image based rendering algorithm with
user intervention to generate realistic 3D virtual world. The learning outcomes
are significant.
