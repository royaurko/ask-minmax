We study superfluid dissipation due to phase slips for a BEC flowing through
a repulsive barrier inside a torus. The barrier is adiabatically raised across
the annulus while the condensate flows with a finite quantized angular
momentum. At a critical height, a vortex moves from the inner region and
reaches the barrier to eventually circulate around the annulus. At a higher
critical height, an anti-vortex also enters into the torus from the outer
region. Both vortex and anti-vortex decrease the total angular momentum by
leaving behind a $2\pi$ phase slip. When they collide and annihilate or orbit
along the same loop, the condensate suffers a global $2\pi$ phase slip, and the
total angular momentum decreases by one quantum. In hydrodynamic regime, the
instability sets in when the local superfluid velocity equals the sound speed
inside the barrier region.
