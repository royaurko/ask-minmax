In the world of the Internet, Web Servers such as Apache and Internet
Information Server (IIS) were developed to exchange information among client
computers having different Operation System. They have only the function of
displaying static information such as HTML files and image files into the Web
Browser. However, when the information is updated, the administrator updates it
by manual operation. In some cases, because it is necessary to update several
places about the same information, the work load becomes high than it is assume
and update error and update omission may occur. These problems were solved by
use of a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program such as a bulletin board system
and a Blog system. However, these programs opened to Internet have often no
user authentication mechanism and no access control mechanism. That is, they
have the problem that user can access it freely only by getting the URL and
inputting it to a Web Browser. Therefore, in this paper, we show a method to
add the user authentication and access control mechanism for them. It is called
virtual use method of CGI and is realized in the case of introducing the
Destination Addressing Control System (DACS) Scheme, which is a kind of Policy
Based Network Management Scheme (PBNM). As the result, this kind of the CGI
program can be used in the organization with the above two functions.
