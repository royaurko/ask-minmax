We study some vacua of N=9 three dimensional gauged supergravity. The theory
contains sixteen scalar fields parametrizing the exceptional coset space
${F_{4(-20)}}{SO(9)}$. Various AdS supersymmetric and some non-supersymmetric
vacua are found in both compact and non-compact gaugings with gauge groups
$SO(p)\times SO(9-p)$ for $p=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$, $G_{2(-14)}\times SL(2)$ and
$Sp(1,2)\times SU(2)$. We also study many RG flow solutions, both analytic and
numerical, interpolating between supersymmetric critical points in this theory.
All the flows considered here are driven by a relevant operator of dimension
$\Delta={3}{2}$. This operator breaks conformal symmetry as well as
supersymmetry and drives the CFT in the UV to another CFT in the IR with lower
supersymmetries.
