The observation of jet quenching and associated away--side Mach cone--like
correlations at RHIC provide powerful ``external'' probes of the sQGP produced
in A+A reactions, but it simultaneously raises the question where the jet
energy was deposited. The nearly perfect bulk fluidity observed via elliptic
flow suggests that Mach cone--like correlations may also be due to rapid local
equilibration in the wake of penetrating jets. Multi-particle correlations lend
further support to this possibility. However, a combined study of energy
deposition and fluid response is needed. We solve numerically 3--dimensional
ideal hydrodynamical equations to compute the flow correlation patterns
resulting from a variety of possible energy-momentum deposition models.
Mach--cone correlations are shown to depend critically on the energy and
momentum deposition mechanisms. They only survive for a special limited class
of energy--momentum loss models, which assume significantly less longitudinal
momentum loss than energy loss per unit length. We conclude that the correct
interpretation of away--side jet correlations will require improved
understanding and independent experimental constraints on the jet
energy--momentum loss to fluid couplings.
