We propose to learn the structure of an undirected graphical model by
computing exact posterior probabilities for local structures in a Bayesian
framework. This task would be untractable without any restriction on the
considered graphs. We limit our exploration to the spanning trees and define
priors on tree structures and parameters that allow fast and exact computation
of the posterior probability for an edge to belong to the random tree thanks to
an algebraic result called the Matrix-Tree theorem. We show that the assumption
we have made does not prevent our approach to perform well on synthetic and
flow cytometry data.
