We study the singular effects of vanishingly small surface tension on the
dynamics of finger competition in the Saffman-Taylor problem, using the
asymptotic techniques described in [S. Tanveer, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A
343, 155 (1993)]and [M. Siegel, and S. Tanveer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 419
(1996)] as well as direct numerical computation, following the numerical scheme
of [T. Hou, J. Lowengrub, and M. Shelley,J. Comp. Phys. 114, 312 (1994)]. We
demonstrate the dramatic effects of small surface tension on the late time
evolution of two-finger configurations with respect to exact (non-singular)
zero surface tension solutions. The effect is present even when the relevant
zero surface tension solution has asymptotic behavior consistent with selection
theory.Such singular effects therefore cannot be traced back to steady state
selection theory, and imply a drastic global change in the structure of
phase-space flow. They can be interpreted in the framework of a recently
introduced dynamical solvability scenario according to which surface tension
unfolds the structually unstable flow, restoring the hyperbolicity of
multifinger fixed points.
