We discover the circular Hall Effect in a conducting rod sample. The uniform
current flow in a rod can be viewed as a carrier drift in crossed the radial
Hall electric field and the azimuthal magnetic field caused by the current
itself. Arguing the diamagnetic currents could define the correct boundary
condition at the inner rod surface we find the nonuniform density of
longitudinal current taking into account the finite viscosity of 3D electron
liquid. Unexpectedly, under certain condition the resistivity of the rod sample
vanishes exhibiting the transition to zero-resistance state. At the transition
the magnetic field is shown to be pushed out of the sample bulk. The critical
temperature of the transition is calculated.
