We consider a switched (queuing) network in which there are constraints on
which queues may be served simultaneously; such networks have been used to
effectively model input-queued switches and wireless networks. The scheduling
policy for such a network specifies which queues to serve at any point in time,
based on the current state or past history of the system. In the main result of
this paper, we provide a new class of online scheduling policies that achieve
optimal queue-size scaling for a class of switched networks including
input-queued switches. In particular, it establishes the validity of a
conjecture (documented in Shah, Tsitsiklis and Zhong [Queueing Syst. 68 (2011)
375-384]) about optimal queue-size scaling for input-queued switches.
