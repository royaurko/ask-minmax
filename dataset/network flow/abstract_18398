We investigate optimal resource allocation for delay-limited cooperative
communication in time varying wireless networks. Motivated by real-time
applications that have stringent delay constraints, we develop a dynamic
cooperation strategy that makes optimal use of network resources to achieve a
target outage probability (reliability) for each user subject to average power
constraints. Using the technique of Lyapunov optimization, we first present a
general framework to solve this problem and then derive quasi-closed form
solutions for several cooperative protocols proposed in the literature. Unlike
earlier works, our scheme does not require prior knowledge of the statistical
description of the packet arrival, channel state and node mobility processes
and can be implemented in an online fashion.
