Video transmission over mobile ad-hoc networks is becoming important as these
networks become more widely used in the wireless networks. We propose a
routing-aware multiple description video coding approach to support video
transmission over mobile ad-hoc networks with single and multiple path
transport. We build a model to estimate the packet loss probability of each
packet transmitted over the network based on the standard ad-hoc routing
messages and network parameters without losing the RERR message. We then
calculate the frame loss probability in order to eliminate error without any
loss of data.
