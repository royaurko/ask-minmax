This paper presents new results for the (partial) maximum a posteriori (MAP)
problem in Bayesian networks, which is the problem of querying the most
probable state configuration of some of the network variables given evidence.
First, it is demonstrated that the problem remains hard even in networks with
very simple topology, such as binary polytrees and simple trees (including the
Naive Bayes structure). Such proofs extend previous complexity results for the
problem. Inapproximability results are also derived in the case of trees if the
number of states per variable is not bounded. Although the problem is shown to
be hard and inapproximable even in very simple scenarios, a new exact algorithm
is described that is empirically fast in networks of bounded treewidth and
bounded number of states per variable. The same algorithm is used as basis of a
Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for MAP under such assumptions.
Approximation schemes were generally thought to be impossible for this problem,
but we show otherwise for classes of networks that are important in practice.
The algorithms are extensively tested using some well-known networks as well as
random generated cases to show their effectiveness.
