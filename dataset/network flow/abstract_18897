We present an algorithm for the control of complex networks and other
nonlinear, high-dimensional dynamical systems. The computational approach is
based on the recently-introduced concept of compensatory perturbations --
intentional alterations to the state of a complex system that can drive it to a
desired target state even when there are constraints on the perturbations that
forbid reaching the target state directly. Included here is ready-to-use
software that can be applied to identify eligible control interventions in a
general system described by coupled ordinary differential equations, whose
specific form can be specified by the user. The algorithm is highly scalable,
with the computational cost scaling as the number of dynamical variables to the
power 2.5.
