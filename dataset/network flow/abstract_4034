A stochastic flow of homeomorphisms of the real line previously studied by
Bass and Burdzy is shown to arise in describing a Brownian motion conditional
on knowing its local times on hitting a fixed level. This makes it possible to
connect Ray-Knight type results for the flow with the classical Ray-Knight
theorems for Brownian motion.
