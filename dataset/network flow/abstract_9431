Social networks exhibit scaling-laws for several structural characteristics,
such as the degree distribution, the scaling of the attachment kernel, and the
clustering coefficients as a function of node degree. A detailed understanding
if and how these scaling laws are inter-related is missing so far, let alone
whether they can be understood through a common, dynamical principle. We
propose a simple model for stationary network formation and show that the three
mentioned scaling relations follow as natural consequences of triadic closure.
The validity of the model is tested on multiplex data from a well studied
massive multiplayer online game. We find that the three scaling exponents
observed in the multiplex data for the friendship, communication and trading
networks can simultaneously be explained by the model. These results suggest
that triadic closure could be identified as one of the fundamental dynamical
principles in social multiplex network formation.
