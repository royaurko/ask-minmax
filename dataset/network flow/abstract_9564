The Internet is becoming more and more content-oriented, where one of main
components in content-oriented Internet architectures is network caching.
Despite a surge of extensive use of network cashing in the current and future
Internet architectures, analysis on the performance of general cache networks
are still quite limited due to complex inter-plays among various components and
thus analytical intractability. We study asymptotic delay performance of cache
networks, in particular, focusing on the impact of heterogeneous content
popularities and nodes' geometric `importances' in caching policies. Our
theoretical findings provide useful engineering implications such as when and
how various factors have impact on caching performance, and we provide
extensive simulation results on the real Internet topology.
