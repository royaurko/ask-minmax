In this paper, the performance of high speed optical fiber based network is
analysed by using dispersion compensating module (DCM). The optimal operating
condition of the DCM is obtained by considering dispersion management
configurations for the symmetrical system i.e Pre-compensation &
Post-compensation. The dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) is tested for a
single span, single channel system operating at a speed of 10 Gb/s with a
transmitting wavelength of 1550 nm, over 120 km single mode fibre by using the
compensating fiber for 24 km,30km and 35Km. So far, most of the investigations
for single mode fiber (SMF) transmission at high amplifier spacings in the
order of 90 km to 120 km is focused on conventional Non Return to Zero(NRZ)
format. The simulation results are validated by analysing the Q-factor and Bit
error rate (BER) in the numerical simulator OptSim.
