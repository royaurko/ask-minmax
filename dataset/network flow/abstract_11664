Sophisticated multilayer neural networks have achieved state of the art
results on multiple supervised tasks. However, successful applications of such
multilayer networks to control have so far been limited largely to the
perception portion of the control pipeline. In this paper, we explore the
application of deep and recurrent neural networks to a continuous,
high-dimensional locomotion task, where the network is used to represent a
control policy that maps the state of the system (represented by joint angles)
directly to the torques at each joint. By using a recent reinforcement learning
algorithm called guided policy search, we can successfully train neural network
controllers with thousands of parameters, allowing us to compare a variety of
architectures. We discuss the differences between the locomotion control task
and previous supervised perception tasks, present experimental results
comparing various architectures, and discuss future directions in the
application of techniques from deep learning to the problem of optimal control.
