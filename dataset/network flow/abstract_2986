We report the characteristics of the temporal fluctuations in the local force
delivered to the wall of a 2D hopper by a granular medium flowing through it.
The forces are predominantly impulsive at all flow rates for which the flow
does not permanently jam. The average impulse delivered to the wall is much
larger than the momentum acquired by a single particle under gravity between
collisions, reflecting the fact that momentum is transferred to the walls from
the bulk of the flow by collisions. At values larger than the average impulse,
the probability distribution of impulses is broad and decays exponentially on
the scale of the average impulse, just as it does in static granular media. At
small impulse values, the probability distribution evolves continuously with
flow velocity but does not show a clear signature of the transition from purely
collisional flow to intermittently jamming flows. However, the time interval
between collisions tends to a power law distribution, $P(\tau)\sim
\tau^{-3/2}$, thus showing a clear dynamical signature of the approach to
jamming.
