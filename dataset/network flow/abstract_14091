We study singularities of geodesics flows in two-dimensional generalized
Finsler spaces (pseudo-Finsler spaces). Geodesics are defined as extremals of a
certain auxiliary functional whose non-isotropic extremals coincide with
extremals of the action functional. This allows to consider isotropic lines as
(unparametrized) geodesics.
