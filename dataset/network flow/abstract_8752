The temporal instability of stably stratified flow was investigated by
analyzing the Taylor-Goldstein equation theoretically. According to this
analysis, the stable stratification $N^2\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,
and the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with
the potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.
Globally, $Fr_t^2 \leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than
the total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the
kinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable. On the
other hand, when the potential energy is smaller than the kinetic energy
($Fr_t^2>1$), the flow is stable because no potential energy could transfer to
the kinetic energy. The flow is more stable with the velocity profile
$U'/U'''>0$ than that with $U'/U'''<0$. Besides, the unstable perturbation must
be long-wave scale. Locally, the flow is unstable as the gradient Richardson
number $Ri>1/4$. These results extend the Rayleigh's, Fj{\o}rtoft's, Sun's and
Arnol'd's criteria for the inviscid homogenous fluid, but they contradict the
well-known Miles-Howard theorem. It is argued here that the transform
$F=\phi/(U-c)^n$ is not suitable for temporal stability problem, and that it
will lead to contradictions with the results derived from the Taylor-Goldstein
equation. However, such transform might be useful for the study of the
Orr-Sommerfeld equation in viscous flows.
