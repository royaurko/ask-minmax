As a benchmark exercise for testing software and methods developed in Hycon2
for decentralized and distributed control, we address the problem of designing
the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) layer in power network systems. In
particular, we present three different scenarios and discuss performance levels
that can be reached using Centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC). These
results can be used as a milestone for comparing the performance of alternative
control schemes. Matlab software for simulating the scenarios is also provided
in an accompanying file.
