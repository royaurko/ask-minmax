We present a functional renormalization group flow for many-fermion lattice
models into phases with broken spin-rotational symmetry. The flow is expressed
purely in terms of fermionic vertex functions. The symmetry breaking is seeded
by a small initial anomalous self-energy which grows at the transition scale
and which prevents a runaway-flow at nonzero scales. Focusing on the case of
commensurate antiferromagnetism we discuss how the interaction vertex can be
parametrized efficiently. For reduced models with long-range bare interactions
we show the results of standard mean-field theory are reproduced by the fRG and
how anisotropies in the spin sector change the flows. We then describe a more
efficient decomposition of the interaction vertex that should allow for the
treatment of more general models.
