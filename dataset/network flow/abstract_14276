A lattice Boltzmann (LB) scheme is described which recovers the equations
developed by Qian--Sheng for the hydrodynamics of a nematic liquid crystal with
a tensor order parameter. The standard mesoscopic LB scalar density is
generalised to a tensor quantity and the macroscopic momentum, density and
tensor order parameter are recovered from appropriate moments of this
mesoscopic density. A single lattice Boltzmann equation is used with a
direction dependent BGK collision term, with additional forcing terms to
recover the antisymmetric terms in the stress tensor. A Chapman Enskog analysis
is presented which demonstrates that the Qian--Sheng scheme is recovered,
provided a lattice with sixth order isotropy is used. The method is validated
against analytical results for a number of cases including flow alignment of
the order tensor and the Miesowicz viscosities in the presence of an aligning
magnetic field. The algorithm accurately recovers the predicted changes in the
order parameter in the presence of aligning flow, and magnetic, fields.
