In this paper we present an algorithm to address the predecessor problem of
feed-forward Boolean networks. We propose an probabilistic algorithm, which
solves this problem in linear time with respect to the number of nodes in the
network. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm for random Boolean networks and the
regulatory network of Escherichia coli.
