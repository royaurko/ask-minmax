We study the collective dynamics of a Leaky Integrate and Fire network in
which precise relative phase relationship of spikes among neurons are stored,
as attractors of the dynamics, and selectively replayed at differentctime
scales. Using an STDP-based learning process, we store in the connectivity
several phase-coded spike patterns, and we find that, depending on the
excitability of the network, different working regimes are possible, with
transient or persistent replay activity induced by a brief signal. We introduce
an order parameter to evaluate the similarity between stored and recalled
phase-coded pattern, and measure the storage capacity. Modulation of spiking
thresholds during replay changes the frequency of the collective oscillation or
the number of spikes per cycle, keeping preserved the phases relationship. This
allows a coding scheme in which phase, rate and frequency are dissociable.
Robustness with respect to noise and heterogeneity of neurons parameters is
studied, showing that, since dynamics is a retrieval process, neurons preserve
stablecprecise phase relationship among units, keeping a unique frequency of
oscillation, even in noisy conditions and with heterogeneity of internal
parameters of the units.
