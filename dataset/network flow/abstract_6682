Wireless sensor networks increasingly become viable solutions to many
challenging problems and will successively be deployed in many areas in the
future. However, deploying new technology without security in mind has often
proved to be unreasonably dangerous. We propose a security architecture for
self-organizing mobile wireless sensor networks that prevents many attacks
these networks are exposed to. Furthermore, it limits the security impact of
some attacks that cannot be prevented. We analyse our security architecure and
show that it provides the desired security aspects while still being a
lightweight solution and thus being applicable for self-organizing mobile
wireless sensor networks.
