We consider balanced flows in a natural gas transmission network and discuss
computationally hard problems such as establishing if solution of the
underlying nonlinear gas flow equations exists, if it is unique, and finding
the solution. Particular topologies, e.g. trees, are known to be easy to solve
based on a variational description of the gas flow equations, but these
approaches do not generalize. In this paper, we show that the gas flow problem
can be solved efficiently using the tools of monotone operator theory, provided
that we look for solution within certain monotonicity domains. We characterize
a family of monotonicity domains, described in terms of Linear Matrix
Inequalities (LMI) in the state variables, each containing at most one
solution. We also develop an efficient algorithm to choose a particular
monotonicity domain, for which the LMI based condition simplifies to a bound on
the flows. Performance of the technique is illustrated on exemplary gas
networks.
