We explain the construction of some solutions of the Stokes system with a
given set of singular points, in the sense of Caffarelli, Kohn and Nirenberg.
By means of a partial regularity theorem (proved elsewhere), it turns out that
we are able to show the existence of a suitable weak solution to the
Navier-Stokes equations with a singular set of positive one dimensional
Hausdorff measure.
