We calculate synchrotron radiation in three-dimensional pseudo-Newtonian
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion flows. We
show that the emission is highly variable at optically thin frequencies, with
order of magnitude variability on time-scales as short as the orbital period
near the last stable orbit; this emission is linearly polarized at the 20-50 %
level due to the coherent toroidal magnetic field in the flow. At optically
thick frequencies, both the variability amplitude and polarization fraction
decrease significantly with decreasing photon frequency. We argue that these
results are broadly consistent with the observed properties of Sgr A* at the
Galactic Center, including the rapid infrared flaring.
