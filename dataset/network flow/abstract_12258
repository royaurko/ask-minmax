In this paper, we explore what \emph{network economics} is all about,
focusing on the interesting topics brought about by the Internet. Our intent is
make this a brief survey, useful as an outline for a course on this topic, with
an extended list of references. We try to make it as intuitive and readable as
possible. We also deliberately try to be critical at times, and hope our
interpretation of the topic will lead to interests for further discussions by
those doing research in the same field.
