We consider an initial-boundary value problem for the one-dimensional
equations of compressible isentropic viscous and non-resistive
magnetohydrodynamic flows. The global well-posedness of strong solutions with
general large data is established. Moreover, the vanishing resistivity limit is
justified and the thickness of magnetic boundary layers is analyzed. The proofs
of these results are based on a full use of the so-called "effective viscous
flux", the material derivative and the structure of the equations.
