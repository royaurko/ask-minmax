Nodes of minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) form a virtual backbone in a
wireless adhoc network. In this paper, a modified approach is presented to
determine MCDS of an underlying graph of a Wireless Adhoc network. Simulation
results for a variety of graphs indicate that the approach is efficient in
determining the MCDS as compared to other existing techniques.
