We discuss the possibility of dual local and non-local cascades in a 3D
turbulent Beltrami flow, with inverse energy cascade and direct helicity
cascade, by analogy with 2D turbulence. We discuss the corresponding energy
spectrum in both local and non-local case. Comparison with a high Reynolds
number turbulent von Karman flow is provided and discussed.
