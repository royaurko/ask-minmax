These are the proceedings of the Third Workshop on GRAPH Inspection and
Traversal Engineering (GRAPHITE 2014), which took place on April 5, 2014 in
Grenoble, France, as a satellite event of the 17th European Joint Conferences
on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2014).
  The aim of GRAPHITE is to foster the convergence on research interests from
several communities dealing with graph analysis in all its forms in computer
science, with a particular attention to software development and analysis.
Graphs are used to represent data and processes in many application areas, and
they are subjected to various computational algorithms in order to analyze
them. Just restricting the attention to the analysis of software, graph
analysis algorithms are used, for instance, to verify properties using model
checking techniques that explore the system's state space graph or static
analysis techniques based on control flow graphs. Further application domains
include games, planning, and network analysis. Very often, graph problems and
their algorithmic solutions have common characteristics, independent of their
application domain. The goal of this event is to gather scientists from
different communities, who do research on graph analysis algorithms, such that
awareness of each others' work is increased. More information can be found at
