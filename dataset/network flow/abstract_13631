The stochastic properties of the total internal energy of a dilute granular
gas in the steady uniform shear flow state are investigated. A recent theory
formulated for fluctuations about the homogeneous cooling state is extended by
analogy with molecular systems. The theoretical predictions are compared with
molecular dynamics simulation results. Good agreement is found in the limit of
weak inelasticity, while systematic and relevant discrepancies are observed
when the inelasticity increases. The origin of this behavior is discussed.
