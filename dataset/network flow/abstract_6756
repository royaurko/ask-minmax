We extend our previous studies of shock waves and shock-free solutions in
thin accretion and winds in pseudo-Newtonian geometry to the case when the flow
is ``two-dimensional'' and around a ``Kerr black hole''. We present
equations for fully general relativistic viscous transonic flows and classify
the parameter space according to whether or not shocks form in an inviscid
flow. We discuss the behaviors of shear, angular momentum distribution, heating
and cooling in viscous flows. We obtain a very significant result: we find that
in weak viscosity limit the presence of the standing shock waves is more
generic in the sense that flows away from the equatorial plane can produce
shock waves in a wider range of parameter space. Similar conclusion also holds
when the angular momentum of the black hole is increased. Generally, our
conclusions regarding the shape of the shock waves are found to agree with
results of the existing numerical simulations of the two dimensional accretion
in Schwarzschild geometry. In a strong viscosity limit, the shocks may be
located farther out or disappear completely as in the pseudo-Newtonian
geometry.
