In this article we show that three dimensional vector advection equation is
self dual in certain sense defined below. As a consequence, we infer classical
result of Serrin of existence of strong solution of Navier-Stokes equation.
Also we deduce Feynman-Kac type formula for solution of the vector advection
equation and show that the formula is not unique i.e. there exist flows which
differ from standard flow along which vorticity is conserved.
