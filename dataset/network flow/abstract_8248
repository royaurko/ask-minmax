Disordered networks of fragile elastic elements have been proposed as a model
for inner porous regions of large bones [Gunaratne et.al., cond-mat/0009221].
In numerical studies, weakening of such networks is seen to be accompanied by
reductions in the fraction of load carrying bonds. This observation is used to
show that the ratio $\Gamma$ of linear responses of networks to DC and AC
driving can be used as a surrogate for their strength. The possibility of using
$\Gamma$ as a non-invasive diagnostic of osteoporotic bone is discussed.
