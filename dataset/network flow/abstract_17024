In this paper, we completely characterize the deterministic capacity region
of a four-node relay network with no direct links between the nodes, where each
node communicates with the three other nodes via a relay. Towards this end, we
develop an upper bound on the deterministic capacity region, based on the
notion of a one-sided genie. To establish achievability, we use the detour
schemes that achieve the upper bound by routing specific bits via indirect
paths instead of sending them directly.
