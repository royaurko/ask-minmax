In superconductors where the coherence length is comparable to the Fermi
wavelength, the electronic levels within a vortex core are quantized, and
separated by energies of the order of the superconducting gap. The absence of a
continuum modifies significantly the energy dissipation due to the motion of
vortices. At zero temperature, dissipation is suppressed, and the system shows
non ohmic behavior. The I-V characteristics show two distinct regimes. Below a
given electric field, I is strongly dependent on V. Flux flow resistivity also
shows a marked dependence on temperature, and reaches conventional values near
$T_c$.
