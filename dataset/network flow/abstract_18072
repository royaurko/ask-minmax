We study associative memory neural networks of the Hodgkin-Huxley type of
spiking neurons in which multiple periodic spatio-temporal patterns of spike
timing are memorized as limit-cycle-type attractors. In encoding the
spatio-temporal patterns, we assume the spike-timing-dependent synaptic
plasticity with the asymmetric time window. Analysis for periodic solution of
retrieval state reveals that if the area of the negative part of the time
window is equivalent to the positive part, then crosstalk among encoded
patterns vanishes. Phase transition due to the loss of the stability of
periodic solution is observed when we assume fast alpha-function for direct
interaction among neurons. In order to evaluate the critical point of this
phase transition, we employ Floquet theory in which the stability problem of
the infinite number of spiking neurons interacting with alpha-function is
reduced into the eigenvalue problem with the finite size of matrix. Numerical
integration of the single-body dynamics yields the explicit value of the
matrix, which enables us to determine the critical point of the phase
transition with a high degree of precision.
