In this paper, we propose a novel genie chains approach to obtain information
theoretic degrees of freedom (DoF) outer bounds for MIMO wireless interference
networks. This new approach creates a chain of mappings from genie signals
provided to a receiver to the exposed signal spaces at that receiver, which
then serve as the genie signals for the next receiver in the chain subject to
certain linear independence requirements, essentially converting an information
theoretic DoF outer bound problem into a linear algebra problem. Several
applications of the genie chains approach are presented.
