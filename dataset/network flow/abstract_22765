The LHCb detector with its unique pseudorapidity coverage allows to perform
soft-QCD measurements in the kinematic forward region where QCD models have
large uncertainties. Selected analyses related to soft-Diffraction will be
summarised in these proceedings. Energy flow and charged particle multiplicity
have been measured separately in different event classes. They give input for
modelling the underlying event in pp collisions. Prompt hadron ratios are
important for hadronisation models, while the $\bar p/p$ ratio is a good
observable to test models of baryon number transport.
