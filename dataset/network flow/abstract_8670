Predicting the popularity of items in rating networks is an interesting but
challenging problem. This is especially so when an item has first appeared and
has received very few ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
predicting the future popularity of new items in rating networks, defining a
new bipartite clustering coefficient to predict the popularity of movies in the
MovieLens network. We show that the clustering behaviour of the first user who
rates a new item gives insight into the future popularity of that item. Our
method predicts, with a success rate of over 60\%, how popular a movie will
become in the future.
