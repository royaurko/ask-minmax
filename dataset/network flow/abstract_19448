The convective period leading up to a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion is
characterized by very low Mach number flows, requiring hydrodynamical methods
well-suited to long-time integration. We continue the development of the low
Mach number equation set for stellar scale flows by incorporating the effects
of heat release due to external sources. Low Mach number hydrodynamics
equations with a time-dependent background state are derived, and a numerical
method based on the approximate projection formalism is presented. We
demonstrate through validation with a fully compressible hydrodynamics code
that this low Mach number model accurately captures the expansion of the
stellar atmosphere as well as the local dynamics due to external heat sources.
This algorithm provides the basis for an efficient simulation tool for studying
the ignition of SNe Ia.
