We show that a layered superconductor, described by a two-component order
parameter, has a gapped state above the ground state, topologically protected
from decay, containing flow and counter flow in the absence of an applied
magnetic field. This state is made of skyrmions, breaks time reversal symmetry
and produces a weak local magnetic field below the present threshold of
detection by $\mu$SR and NMR/NQR. We estimate the density of carriers that
condense into the pseudogap.
