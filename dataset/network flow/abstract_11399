In this paper we study a model of synchronization process on scale free
networks with degree-degree correlations. This model was already studied on
this kind of networks without correlations by Pastore y Piontti {\it et al.},
Phys. Rev. E {\bf 76}, 046117 (2007). Here, we study the effects of the
degree-degree correlation on the behavior of the load fluctuations $W_s$ in the
steady state. We found that for assortative networks there exist a specific
correlation where the system is optimal synchronized. In addition, we found
that close to this optimally value the fluctuations does not depend on the
system size and therefore the system becomes fully scalable. This result could
be very important for some technological applications. On the other hand, far
from the optimal correlation, $W_s$ scales logarithmically with the system
size.
