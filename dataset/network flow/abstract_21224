We developed an analytical approach, for a wave propagation in
metal-dielectric nanostructures in the quasi-static limit. This consideration
establishes a link between fractional geometry of the nanostructure and
fractional integro-differentiation. The method is based on fractional calculus
and permits to obtain analytical expressions for the electric field
enhancement.
