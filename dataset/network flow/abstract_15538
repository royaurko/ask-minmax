The problem of community detection receives great attention in recent years.
Many methods have been proposed to discover communities in networks. In this
paper, we propose a Gaussian stochastic blockmodel that uses Gaussian
distributions to fit weight of edges in networks for non-overlapping community
detection. The maximum likelihood estimation of this model has the same
objective function as general label propagation with node preference. The node
preference of a specific vertex turns out to be a value proportional to the
intra-community eigenvector centrality (the corresponding entry in principal
eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of the subgraph inside that vertex's
community) under maximum likelihood estimation. Additionally, the maximum
likelihood estimation of a constrained version of our model is highly related
to another extension of label propagation algorithm, namely, the label
propagation algorithm under constraint. Experiments show that the proposed
Gaussian stochastic blockmodel performs well on various benchmark networks.
