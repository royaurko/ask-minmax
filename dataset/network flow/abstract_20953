Recently, utilizing renewable energy for wireless system has attracted
extensive attention. However, due to the instable energy supply and the limited
battery capacity, renewable energy cannot guarantee to provide the perpetual
operation for wireless sensor networks (WSN). The coexistence of renewable
energy and electricity grid is expected as a promising energy supply manner to
remain function for a potentially infinite lifetime. In this paper, we propose
a new system model suitable for WSN, taking into account multiple energy
consumptions due to sensing, transmission and reception, heterogeneous energy
supplies from renewable energy, electricity grid and mixed energy, and
multidimension stochastic natures due to energy harvesting profile, electricity
price and channel condition. A discrete-time stochastic cross-layer
optimization problem is formulated to achieve the optimal trade-off between the
time-average rate utility and electricity cost subject to the data and energy
queuing stability constraints. The Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty with
perturbation technique and block coordinate descent method is applied to obtain
a fully distributed and low-complexity cross-layer algorithm only requiring
knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The explicit trade-off between the
optimization objective and queue backlog is theoretically proven. Finally, the
extensive simulations verify the theoretic claims.
