The dynamics of swollen fractal networks (Rouse model) has been studied
through computer simulations. The fluctuation-relaxation theorem was used
instead of the usual Langevin approach to Brownian dynamics. We measured the
equivalent of the mean square displacement $\langle \vec r^{\,2} \rangle$ and
the coefficient of self-diffusion $D$ of two-and three-dimensional Sierpinski
networks and of the two-dimensional percolation network. The results showed an
anomalous diffusion, i. e., a power law for $D$, decreasing with time with an
exponent proportional to the spectral dimension of the network.
