Though, IPv6 has presented a long list of features that will actually change
the entire networking environment, it still represents a very small proportion
of Internet traffic. One of the major reasons behind its partial acceptance is
its security, as these features were incorporated in IPv6 just to enhance its
overall performance and quality of service, thereby neglecting its security
part. One such feature is Stateless Address Auto Configuration or simply SLAAC,
which have undoubtedly reduced a lot of overhead in configuring networks, but
on the same time it has challenged the security of IPv6 networks. This research
work, therefore targets at proposing some security policies to mitigate the
risks associated with SLAAC, by understanding its working scenario and trying
to create the possible attack vector to highlight its security concerns. Hence,
the implementation of these policies will directly add security to networks and
make them resistant to SLAAC based attacks.
