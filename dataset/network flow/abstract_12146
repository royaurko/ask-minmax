We reconsider the problem of percolation on an equilibrium random network
with degree-degree correlations between nearest-neighboring vertices focusing
on critical singularities at a percolation threshold. We obtain criteria for
degree-degree correlations to be irrelevant for critical singularities. We
present examples of networks in which assortative and disassortative mixing
leads to unusual percolation properties and new critical exponents.
