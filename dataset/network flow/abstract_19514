In the frame of an exactly solvable model we calculate electric and magnetic
fields created by uniformly moving lattice of Josephson vortices driven by the
transport current in the magnetic field parallel to conducting layers. The
distribution of fields and currents is strongly modified at large velocities of
the vortex lattice, plasma oscillations of superconducting electrons being
excited by flux flow at low temperatures. This modifies the flux flow
resistivity and results in interference features in I-V curves, thus regions of
negative differential conductivity appear in which the uniform motion of the
vortex lattice is not stable. The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation by
moving vortices contains large peaks related to the excitation of plasma
oscillations and to the Cherenkov radiation.
