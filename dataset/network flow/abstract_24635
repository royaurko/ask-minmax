In this paper, we first study a two-user interference channel with
generalized feedback. We establish an inner bound on its capacity region. The
coding scheme that we employ for the inner bound is based on an appropriate
combination of Han-Kobayash rate splitting and compress-and-forward at the
senders. Each sender compresses the channel output that is observes using a
compression scheme that is \`a-la Lim et al. noisy network coding and
Avestimeher et al. quantize-map-and-forward. Next, we study an injective
deterministic model in which the senders obtain output feedback only
intermittently. Specializing the coding scheme of the model with generalized
feedback to this scenario, we obtain useful insights onto effective ways of
combining noisy network coding with interference alignment techniques. We also
apply our results to linear deterministic interference channels with
intermittent feedback.
