The lattice Boltzmann method with enhanced collisions and rest particles is
used to calculate the flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. The
abilitity of this method to compute the velocity and the pressure of an
incompressible fluid in a geometry with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions is verified by calculating a test-problem where the analytical
solution is known. Different parameter configurations have been tested for
Reynolds numbers from $Re=10$ to $Re=2000$. The vortex structure for a more
generalized lid-driven cavity problem with a non-uniform top speed has been
studied for various acpect ratios.
