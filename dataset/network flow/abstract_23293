We investigate accretion of solid materials onto circumplanetary disks from
heliocentric orbits rotating in protoplanetary disks, which is a key process
for the formation of regular satellite systems. In the late stage of
gas-capturing phase of giant planet formation, the accreting gas from
protoplanetary disks forms circumplanetary disks. Since the accretion flow
toward the circumplanetary disks affects the particle motion through gas drag
force, we use hydrodynamic simulation data for the gas drag term to calculate
the motion of solid materials. We consider wide range of size for the solid
particles ($10^{-2}$-$10^6$m), and find that the accretion efficiency of the
solid particles peaks around 10m-sized particles because energy dissipation of
drag with circum-planetary disk gas in this size regime is most effective. The
efficiency for particles larger than 10m size becomes lower because gas drag
becomes less effective. For particles smaller than 10m, the efficiency is lower
because the particles are strongly coupled with the back-ground gas flow, which
prevent particles from accretion. We also find that the distance from the
planet where the particles are captured by the circumplanetary disks is in a
narrow range and well described as a function of the particle size.
