In this paper, we introduce two deterministic models aimed at capturing the
dynamics of congested Internet connections. The first model is a
continuous-time model that combines a system of differential equations with a
sudden change in one of the state variables. The second model is a
discrete-time model with a time step that arises naturally from the system.
Results from these models show good agreement with the well-known ns network
simulator, better than the results of a previous, similar model. This is due in
large part to the use of the sudden change to reflect the impact of lost data
packets. We also discuss the potential use of this model in network traffic
state estimation.
