A theoretical study of the influence of pressure on the dielectric relaxation
related with polaron tunneling and phonon assisted hopping in disordered solids
is developed. The sign and absolute value of the migration volume, which is
obtained by employing the present formulation, evidence about the nature of the
relaxation. As a paradigm, positive and negative values of migration volume are
evaluated by analyzing recently published dielectric loss measurements under
pressure in semiconducting polypyrrole. A straightforward relation between the
value of the migration volume and the nature of short-range polaron flow and
the size of polaron distortion is revealed.
