In this paper, we consider the stability analysis of large-scale distributed
networked control systems with random communication delays between linearly
interconnected subsystems. The stability analysis is performed in the Markov
jump linear system framework. There have been considerable researches on
stability analysis of Markov jump systems, however, these methods are not
applicable to large-scale systems because large numbers of subsystems result in
an extremely large number of the switching modes. To avoid this scalability
issue, we propose a new reduced mode model for stability analysis, which is
computationally efficient. We also consider the case in which the transition
probabilities for the Markov jump process contain uncertainties. We provide a
new method that estimates bounds for uncertain Markov transition probability
matrix to guarantee the system stability. The efficiency and the usefulness of
the proposed methods are verified through examples.
