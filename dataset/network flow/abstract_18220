Motivation: In the last few years a growing interest in biology has been
shifting towards the problem of optimal information extraction from the huge
amount of data generated via large scale and high-throughput techniques. One of
the most relevant issues has recently become that of correctly and reliably
predicting the functions of observed but still functionally undetermined
proteins starting from information coming from the network of co-observed
proteins of known functions.
  Method: The method proposed in this article is based on a message passing
algorithm known as Belief Propagation, which takes as input the network of
proteins physical interactions and a catalog of known proteins functions, and
returns the probabilities for each unclassified protein of having one chosen
function. The implementation of the algorithm allows for fast on-line analysis,
and can be easily generalized to more complex graph topologies taking into
account hyper-graphs, {\em i.e.} complexes of more than two interacting
proteins.
