An m x n cobweb network consists of n radial lines emanating from a center
and connected by $m$ concentric n-sided polygons. A conjecture of Tan, Zhou and
Yang for the resistance from center to perimeter of the cobweb is proved by
extending the method used by the above contributors to derive formulae for m = 1, 2
and 3 and general n. The resistance of an m x (s+t+1) fan network from the apex
to a point on the boundary distant s from the corner is also found.
