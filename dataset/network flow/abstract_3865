In this paper, we have introduced the notion of UselessGate and
ReverseOperation. We have also given an algorithm to implement a sorting
network for reversible logic synthesis based on swapping bit strings. The
network is constructed in terms of n*n Toffoli Gates read from left to right
and it has shown that there will be no more gates than the number of swappings
the algorithm requires. The gate complexity of the network is O(n2). The number
of gates in the network can be further reduced by template reduction technique
and removing UselessGate from the network.
