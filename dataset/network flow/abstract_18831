Recently, secure in-network aggregation in wireless sensor networks becomes a
challenge issue, there is an extensive research on this area due to the large
number of applications where the sensors are deployed and the security needs.
In the last few years, aggregation of encrypted data has been proposed in order
to maintain secrecy between the sensors and the sink, so the end-to-end data
confidentiality is provided. However, the data integrity was not addressed. In
this paper, we propose RSAED that allows integrity verification at intermediate
nodes, ensures the base station to receive ciphertexts which come only from
legitimate nodes and also improves the efficiency. Through implementation
results, we evaluate our scheme using computation and communication overhead.
