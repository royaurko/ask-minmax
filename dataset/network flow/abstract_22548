In this paper, we study the gradient estimates of Hamilton type for positive
solutions to both drifting heat equation and the simple nonlinear heat equation
problem $$ u_t-\Delta u=au\log u, u>0 $$ on the compact Riemannian manifold
$(M,g)$ of dimension $n$ and with non-negative (Bakry-Emery)-Ricci curvature.
Here $a\leq 0$ is a constant. The latter heat equation is a basic evolution
equation which is the negative gradient heat flow to the functional of
Log-Sobolev inequality on the Riemannian manifold. An open question concerning
the Hamilton type gradient estimate is proposed.
