We present an achievable rate for general deterministic relay networks, with
broadcasting at the transmitters and interference at the receivers. In
particular we show that if the optimizing distribution for the
information-theoretic cut-set bound is a product distribution, then we have a
complete characterization of the achievable rates for such networks. For linear
deterministic finite-field models discussed in a companion paper [3], this is
indeed the case, and we have a generalization of the celebrated max-flow
min-cut theorem for such a network.
