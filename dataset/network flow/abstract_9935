We studied experimentally the effect of turbulent thermal diffusion in a
multi-fan turbulence generator which produces a nearly homogeneous and
isotropic flow with a small mean velocity. Using Particle Image Velocimetry and
Image Processing techniques we showed that in a turbulent flow with an imposed
mean vertical temperature gradient (stably stratified flow) particles
accumulate in the regions with the mean temperature minimum. These experiments
detected the effect of turbulent thermal diffusion in a multi-fan turbulence
generator for relatively high Reynolds numbers. The experimental results are in
compliance with the results of the previous experimental studies of turbulent
thermal diffusion in oscillating grids turbulence (Buchholz et al. 2004;
Eidelman et al. 2004). We demonstrated that turbulent thermal diffusion is an
universal phenomenon. It occurs independently of the method of turbulence
generation, and the qualitative behavior of particle spatial distribution in
these very different turbulent flows is similar. Competition between turbulent
fluxes caused by turbulent thermal diffusion and turbulent diffusion determines
the formation of particle inhomogeneities.
