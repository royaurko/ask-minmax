We present a sensor network testbed that monitors a hallway. It consists of
120 load sensors and 29 passive infrared sensors (PIRs), connected to 30
wireless sensor nodes. There are also 29 LEDs and speakers installed, operating
as actuators, and enabling a direct interaction between the testbed and
passers-by. Beyond that, the network is heterogeneous, consisting of three
different circuit boards---each with its specific responsibility. The design of
the load sensors is of extremely low cost compared to industrial solutions and
easily transferred to other settings. The network is used for in-network data
processing algorithms, offering possibilities to develop, for instance,
distributed target-tracking algorithms. Special features of our installation
are highly correlated sensor data and the availability of miscellaneous sensor
types.
