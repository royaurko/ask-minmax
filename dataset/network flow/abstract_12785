We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model including time-varying predictors
in dynamic network inference. The model is applied to infer the dependence
structure among financial markets during the global financial crisis,
estimating effects of verbal and material cooperation efforts. We interestingly
learn contagion effects, with increasing influence of verbal relations during
the financial crisis and opposite results during the United States housing
bubble.
