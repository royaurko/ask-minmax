Here I present the present the first major result of a novel form of network
analysis - a temporal interpretation. Treating numerical edges labels as the
time at which an interaction occurs between the two vertices comprising that
edge generates a number of intriguing questions. For example, given the
structure of a graph, how many ``fundamentally'' different temporally
non-isomorphic forms are there, across all possible edge labelings.
Specifically, two networks, N and M, are considered to be in the same
isotemporal class if there exists a function alpha(N)->M that is a graph
isomorphism and preserves all paths in N with strictly increasing edge labels.
I present a closed formula for the number of isotemporal classes N(n) of
n-gons. This result is strongly tied to number theoretic identities; in the
case of $n$ odd, N(n)= 1/n sum_{d|n} (2^{n/d -1}-1)Phi(d), where Phi is the
Euler totient function.
