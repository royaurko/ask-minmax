Computer-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems have
evolved over the past four decades, from standalone, compartmentalized
operations into networked architectures that communicate across large
distances. There is an emerging trend comprising SCADA and conventional IT
units toward consolidating some overlapping activities. This trend is motivated
by cost savings achieved by consolidating disparate platforms, networks,
software, and maintenance tools. For reasons of efficiency, maintenance,
economics, data acquisition, control platforms have migrated from isolated
in-plant networks using proprietary hardware and software to PC-based systems
using standard software, network protocols, and the Internet. In this thesis,
we present an approach for web-based SCADA systems that adapt to the behavior
of the target application. In addition, we take into account the real time
constraints that imposed by the nature of the problem. We show that our
approach is more efficient than other approaches in terms of consuming as
little as possible of the available resources (computational power and network
bandwidth).
