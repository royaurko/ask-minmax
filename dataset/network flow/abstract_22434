We consider the evolution of an interface generated between two immiscible
incompressible and irrotational fluids. Specifically we study the Muskat and
water wave problems. We show that starting with a family of initial data given
by $(\al,f_0(\al))$, the interface reaches a regime in finite time in which is
no longer a graph. Therefore there exists a time $t^*$ where the solution of
the free boundary problem parameterized as $(\al,f(\al,t))$ blows-up: $\|\da
f\|_{L^\infty}(t^*)=\infty$. In particular, for the Muskat problem, this result
allows us to reach an unstable regime, for which the Rayleigh-Taylor condition
changes sign and the solution breaks down.
