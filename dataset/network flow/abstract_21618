Conformally flat tilted Bianchi type V cosmological models in presence of a
bulk viscous fluid and heat flow are investigated. The coefficient of bulk
viscosity is assumed to be a power function of mass density. The cosmological
constant is found to be a decreasing function of time, which is supported by
results from recent type Ia supernovae observations. Some physical and
geometric aspects of the models are also discussed.
