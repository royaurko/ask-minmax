Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a link-tracing network sampling strategy
for collecting data from hard-to-reach populations, such as injection drug
users or individuals at high risk of being infected with HIV. The mechanism is
to find initial participants (seeds), and give each of them a fixed number of
coupons allowing them to recruit people they know from the population of
interest, with a mutual financial incentive. The new participants are given
coupons again and the process repeats. Currently, the standard RDS estimator
used in practice is known as the Volz-Heckathorn (VH) estimator. It relies on
strong assumptions about the underlying social network and the RDS process. Via
simulation, we study the relative performance of the plain mean and VH
estimator when assumptions of the latter are not satisfied, under different
network types (including homophily and rich-get-richer networks), participant
referral patterns, and varying number of coupons. The analysis demonstrates
that the plain mean outperforms the VH estimator in many but not all of the
simulated settings, including homophily networks. Also, we highlight the
implications of multiple recruitment and varying referral patterns on the depth
of RDS process. We develop interactive visualizations of the findings and RDS
process to further build insight into the various factors contributing to the
performance of current RDS estimation techniques.
