Estimates are given of the time scales which govern spreading of a coherent
state wave packet. The estimates, based on dimensional analysis, suggest that
spreading should be small for coherent states with average angular momentum of
order 100 or larger. It is conjectured that in the classical limit, terms in
the Hamiltonian which add a new vertex will be suppressed, compared to terms
which modify the existing spin network without changing the number of vertices.
