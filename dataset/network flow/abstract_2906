Network measures that reflect the most salient properties of complex
large-scale networks are in high demand in the network research community. In
this paper we adapt a combinatorial measure of negative curvature (also called
hyperbolicity) to parameterized finite networks, and show that a variety of
biological and social networks are hyperbolic. This hyperbolicity property has
strong implications on the higher-order connectivity and other topological
properties of these networks. Specifically, we derive and prove bounds on the
distance among shortest or approximately shortest paths in hyperbolic networks.
We describe two implications of these bounds to cross-talk in biological
networks, and to the existence of central, influential neighborhoods in both
biological and social networks.
