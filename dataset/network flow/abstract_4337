The sensor network is a network technique for the implementation of
Ubiquitous computing environment. It is wireless network environment that
consists of the many sensors of lightweight and low power. Though sensor
network provides various capabilities, it is unable to ensure the secure
authentication between nodes. Eventually it causes the losing reliability of
the entire network and many secure problems. Therefore, encryption algorithm
for the implementation of reliable sensor network environments is required to
the applicable sensor network. In this paper, we proposed the solution of
reliable sensor network to analyze the communication efficiency through
measuring performance of AES encryption algorithm by plaintext size, and cost
of operation per hop according to the network scale.
