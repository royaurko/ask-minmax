A Monte Carlo method is used in order to simulate the competition between the
molecular relaxation and crystallization times in the formation of a glass. The
results show that nucleation is avoided during supercooling and produce
self-organization in the sense of the rigidity theory, where the number of
geometrical constraints due to bonding and excluded volume are compared with
the degress of freedom available to the system. Following this idea, glass
transitions were obtained by producing self-organization, and in the case of
geometrical frustration, self-organization is naturally observed.
