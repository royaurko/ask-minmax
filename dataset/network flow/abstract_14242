In this paper computer simulation results of higher order density correlation
for cellular automaton models of traffic flow are presented. The examinations
show the jamming transition as a function of both the density and the magnitude
of noise and allow to calculate the velocity of upstream moving jams. This
velocity is independent of the density and decreases with growing noise. The
point of maximum flow in the fundamental diagram determines its value. For that
it is not necessary to define explicitly jams in the language of the selected
model, but only based upon the well defined characteristic density profiles
along the line.
