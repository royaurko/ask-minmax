We discuss the relation between three recent approaches of describing the
dynamics and the spatial distribution of particles suspended in turbulent
flows: phase-space singularities in the inertial particle dynamics (caustics),
real-space singularities of the deformation tensor, and random uncorrelated
motion. We discuss how the phase- and real-space singularities are related.
Their formation is well understood in terms of a local theory. We discuss
implications for random uncorrelated motion. Our results are supported by
results of direct numerical simulations of inertial particles in model flows.
