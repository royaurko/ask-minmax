Time-distance helioseismology is a technique for measuring the time for waves
to travel from one point on the solar surface to another. These wave travel
times are affected by advection by subsurface flows. Inferences of plasma flows
based on observed travel times depend critically on the ability to accurately
model the effects of subsurface flows on time-distance measurements. We present
a Born approximation based computation of the sensitivity of time distance
travel times to weak, steady, inhomogeneous subsurface flows. Three sensitivity
functions are obtained, one for each component of the 3D vector flow. We show
that the depth sensitivity of travel times to horizontally uniform flows is
given approximately by the kinetic energy density of the oscillation modes
which contribute to the travel times. For flows with strong depth dependence,
the Born approximation can give substantially different results than the ray
approximation.
