The orientational dynamics of weakly inertial axisymmetric particles in a
steady flow is investigated. We derive an asymptotic equation of motion for the
unit axial vector along the particle symmetry axis, valid for small Stokes
number St, and for any axisymmetric particle in any steady linear viscous flow.
This reduced dynamics is analysed in two ways, both pertain to the case of a
simple shear flow. In this case inertia induces a coupling between precession
and nutation. This coupling affects the dynamics of the particle, breaks the
degeneracy of the Jeffery orbits, and creates two limiting periodic orbits. We
calculate the leading-order Floquet exponents of the limiting periodic orbits
and show analytically that prolate objects tend to a tumbling orbit, while
oblate objects tend to a log-rolling orbit, in agreement with previous
analytical and numerical results. Second, we analyse the role of the limiting
orbits when rotational noise is present. We formulate the Fokker-Planck
equation describing the orientational distribution of an axisymmetric particle,
valid for small St and general Peclet number Pe. Numerical solutions of the
Fokker-Planck equation, obtained by means of expansion in spherical harmonics,
show that stationary orientational distributions are close to the inertia-free
case when Pe St << 1, whereas they are determined by inertial effects, though
small, when Pe >> 1/St >> 1.
