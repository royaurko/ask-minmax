We study the soliton flow on the domain of a twistorial harmonic morphism
between Riemannian manifolds of dimensions four and three. Assuming
real-analyticity, we prove that, for the Gibbons-Hawking construction, any
soliton flow is uniquely determined by its restriction to any local section of
the corresponding harmonic morphism. For the Beltrami fields construction, we
identify a contour integral whose vanishing characterises the trivial soliton
flows.
