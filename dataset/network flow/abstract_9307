Recent research has shown that language and the socio-cognitive phenomena
associated with it can be aptly modeled and visualized through networks of
linguistic entities. However, most of the existing works on linguistic networks
focus only on the local properties of the networks. This study is an attempt to
analyze the structure of languages via a purely structural technique, namely
spectral analysis, which is ideally suited for discovering the global
correlations in a network. Application of this technique to PhoNet, the
co-occurrence network of consonants, not only reveals several natural
linguistic principles governing the structure of the consonant inventories, but
is also able to quantify their relative importance. We believe that this
powerful technique can be successfully applied, in general, to study the
structure of natural languages.
