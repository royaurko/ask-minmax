The Josephson quasiparticle (JQP) cycle in a voltage-biased superconducting
single-electron transistor (SSET) combines coherent Cooper pair tunneling with
incoherent quasiparticle decay. We have measured the influence of current flow
through an independently-biased SSET on the JQP cycle when the two SSET's have
a strong mutual capacitive coupling. We find, among other effects, that the JQP
current in one SSET is enhanced by the presence of a quasiparticle current in
the other SSET. A simplified model of the coupled-SSET system is presented
which reproduces the enhancement effect.
