This paper discusses new analytic algorithms and software for the enumeration
of all integer flows inside a network. Concrete applications abound in graph
theory \cite{Jaeger}, representation theory \cite{kirillov}, and statistics
\cite{persi}. Our methods clearly surpass traditional exhaustive enumeration
and other algorithms and can even yield formulas when the input data contains
some parameters. These methods are based on the study of rational functions
with poles on arrangements of hyperplanes.
