We present a detailed study of the effect of local chemical ordering on the
structural, electronic, and dynamical properties of amorphous gallium arsenide.
Using the recently-proposed ``activation-relaxation technique'' and empirical
potentials, we have constructed two 216-atom tetrahedral continuous random
networks with different topological properties, which were further relaxed
using tight-binding molecular dynamics. The first network corresponds to the
traditional, amorphous, Polk-type, network, randomly decorated with Ga and As
atoms. The second is an amorphous structure with a minimum of wrong (homopolar)
bonds, and therefore a minimum of odd-membered atomic rings, and thus
corresponds to the Connell-Temkin model. By comparing the structural,
electronic, and dynamical properties of these two models, we show that the
Connell-Temkin network is energetically favored over Polk, but that most
properties are little affected by the differences in topology. We conclude that
most indirect experimental evidence for the presence (or absence) of wrong
bonds is much weaker than previously believed and that only direct structural
measurements, i.e., of such quantities as partial radial distribution
functions, can provide quantitative information on these defects in a-GaAs.
