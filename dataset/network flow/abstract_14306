The Laplace operator admits infinite self-adjoint extensions when considered
on a segment of the real line. They have different domains of essential
self-adjointness characterized by a suitable set of boundary conditions on the
wave functions. In this paper we show how to recover these extensions by
studying the continuum limit of certain discretized versions of the Laplace
operator on a lattice. Associated to this limiting procedure, there is a
renormalization flow in the finite dimensional parameter space describing the
dicretized operators. This flow is shown to have infinite fixed points,
corresponding to the self-adjoint extensions characterized by scale invariant
boundary conditions. The other extensions are recovered by looking at the other
trajectories of the flow.
