We introduce a stochastic model which describes diffusions of tweets on the
Twitter network. By dividing the followers into generations, we describe the
dynamics of the tweet diffusion as a random multiplicative process. We confirm
our model by directly observing the statistics of the multiplicative factors in
the Twitter data.
