MAP is the problem of finding a most probable instantiation of a set of
variables in a Bayesian network, given evidence. Unlike computing marginals,
posteriors, and MPE (a special case of MAP), the time and space complexity of
MAP is not only exponential in the network treewidth, but also in a larger
parameter known as the "constrained" treewidth. In practice, this means that
computing MAP can be orders of magnitude more expensive than
computingposteriors or MPE. Thus, practitioners generally avoid MAP
computations, resorting instead to approximating them by the most likely value
for each MAP variableseparately, or by MPE.We present a method for
approximating MAP using local search. This method has space complexity which is
exponential onlyin the treewidth, as is the complexity of each search step. We
investigate the effectiveness of different local searchmethods and several
initialization strategies and compare them to otherapproximation
schemes.Experimental results show that local search provides a much more
accurate approximation of MAP, while requiring few search steps.Practically,
this means that the complexity of local search is often exponential only in
treewidth as opposed to the constrained treewidth, making approximating MAP as
efficient as other computations.
