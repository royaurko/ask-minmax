In this paper we present a fully relativistic study of axisymmetric
magnetohydrodynamic Bondi--Hoyle accretion onto a moving Kerr black hole. The
equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics are solved using high
resolution shock capturing methods. In this treatment we consider the ideal MHD
limit. The parameters of interest in this study are the adiabatic constant
$\Gamma$, the asymptotic speed of sound $c_{s}^{\infty}$, and the plasma beta
parameter $\beta_{P}$. We focus the investigation on the parameter regime in
which the flow is supersonic, or when $v_\infty \ge c_{s}^{\infty}$. In some
cases, subsonic asymptotic flows are considered for comparison purposes. We
study the accretion rates of the total energy and momenta, as well as the
hydrodynamic energy and momentum accretion rates. The models presented in this
study exhibit a matter density depletion in the downstream region of the black
hole which tends to vacuum $(\rho_0=0)$ in convergence tests. This feature is
due to the presence of the magnetic field, more specifically the magnetic
pressure, and is not seen in previous purely hydrodynamic studies.
