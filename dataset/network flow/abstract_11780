Recent tumor genome sequencing confirmed that one tumor often consists of
multiple cell subpopulations (clones) which bear different, but related,
genetic profiles such as mutation and copy number variation profiles. Thus far,
one tumor has been viewed as a whole entity in cancer functional studies. With
the advances of genome sequencing and computational analysis, we are able to
quantify and computationally dissect clones from tumors, and then conduct
clone-based analysis. Emerging technologies such as single-cell genome
sequencing and RNA-Seq could profile tumor clones. Thus, we should reconsider
how to conduct cancer systems biology studies in the genome sequencing era. We
will outline new directions for conducting cancer systems biology by
considering that genome sequencing technology can be used for dissecting,
quantifying and genetically characterizing clones from tumors. Topics discussed
in Part 1 of this review include computationally quantifying of tumor
subpopulations; clone-based network modeling, cancer hallmark-based networks
and their high-order rewiring principles and the principles of cell survival
networks of fast-growing clones.
