We study how the dynamics of a class of discrete dynamical system models for
neuronal networks depends on the connectivity of the network. Specifically, we
assume that the network is an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{enyi} random graph and analytically
derive scaling laws for the average lengths of the attractors and transients
under certain restrictions on the intrinsic parameters of the neurons, that is,
their refractory periods and firing thresholds. In contrast to earlier results
that were reported in \cite{TAWJ}, here we focus on the connection
probabilities near the phase transition where the most complex dynamics is
expected to occur.
