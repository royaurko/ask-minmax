Many localization algorithms and systems have been developed by means of
wireless sensor networks for both indoor and outdoor environments. To achieve
higher localization accuracy, extra hardware equipments are utilized by most of
the existing localization algorithms, which increase the cost and greatly limit
the range of location-based applications. In this paper we present a method
which can effectively meet different localization accuracy requirements of most
indoor and outdoor location services in realistic applications. Our algorithm
is composed of two phases: partition phase, in which the target region is split
into small grids and localization refinement phase in which a higher accuracy
location can be generated by applying a trick algorithm. A realistic demo
system using our algorithm has been developed to illustrate its feasibility and
availability. The results show that our algorithm can improve the localization
accuracy.
