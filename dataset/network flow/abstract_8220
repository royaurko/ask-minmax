The magnetohydrodynamic linear stability with the localized bulk flow
oriented parallel to the neutral sheet is investigated, by including the Hall
effect and the guide magnetic field. We observe three different unstable modes:
a "streaming tearing" mode at a slow flow speed, a "streaming sausage" mode at
a medium flow speed, and a "streaming kink" mode at a fast flow speed. The
streaming tearing and sausage modes have a standard tearing mode-like structure
with symmetric density fluctuations in the neutral sheet, while the kink mode
has an asymmetric fluctuation. The growth rate of the streaming tearing mode
decreases with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, while the growth rates of
the sausage and kink modes do not depend strongly on the Reynolds number. The
sausage and kink modes can be unstable for not only super-Alfv\'enic flow but
also sub-Alfv\'enic flow when the lobe density is low. The wavelengths of these
unstable modes are of the same order of magnitude as the thickness of the
plasma sheet. Their maximum growth rates are higher than that of a standard
tearing mode, and under a strong guide magnetic field, the growth rates of the
sausage and kink modes are enhanced, while under a weak guide magnetic field,
they are suppressed. For a thin plasma sheet with the Hall effect, the
fluctuations of the streaming modes can exist over the plasma sheet. These
unstable modes may be regarded as being one of the processes generating
Alfv\'enic turbulence in the plasma sheet during magnetic reconnection.
