We study perturbations of the Allen-Cahn equation and prove the convergence
to forced mean curvature flow in the sharp interface limit. We allow for
perturbations that are square-integrable with respect to the diffuse surface
area measure. We give a suitable generalized formulation for forced mean
curvature flow and apply previous results for the Allen-Cahn action functional.
Finally we discuss some applications.
