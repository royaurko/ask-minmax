Given a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation, one can associate
to this equation a stochastic flow on $[0,+\infty )$, which has an absorbing
barrier at zero. Then one can define its dual stochastic flow. In \cite{AW},
Akahori and Watanabe showed that its one-point motion solves a corresponding
stochastic differential equation of Skorokhod-type. In this paper, we consider
a discrete-time stochastic-flow which approximates the original stochastic
flow. We show that under some assumptions, one-point motions of its dual flow
also approximates the corresponding reflecting diffusion. We investigate the
relation between them in weak and strong approximation sense.
