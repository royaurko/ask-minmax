We present generalized delayed neural network (DNN) model with positive delay
feedback and neuron history. The local stability analysis around trivial local
equilibria of delayed neural networks has applied and determine the conditions
for the existence of zero root. We develop few innovative delayed neural
network models in different dimensions through transformation and extension of
some existing models. We found that zero root can have multiplicity two under
certain conditions. We further show how the characteristic equation can have
zero root and its multiplicity is dependent on the conditions undertaken.
Finally, we generalize the neural network of $N$ neurons through which we
determine the general form of Jacobian of the linear form and corresponding
characteristic equation of the system.
