We use the nudged elastic band method from computational chemistry to analyze
high-dimensional data. Our approach is inspired by Morse theory, and as output
we produce an increasing sequence of small cell complexes modeling the dense
regions of the data. We test the method on data sets arising in social networks
and in image processing. Furthermore, we apply the method to identify new
topological structure in a data set of optical flow patches.
