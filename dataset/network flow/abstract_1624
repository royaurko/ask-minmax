Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS), an
optically transparent organic semi-conductor, constitutes a suspension of
conducting PEDOT:PSS grains, shelled by an insulating layer of PSS. While a
percolation network enhances dc conductivity, structural and electrical
inhomogenity hinters electric charge flow giving rise to capacitance effects.
In the present work, two distinct relaxation mechanisms are detected by
Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS). Double polarization mechamisms are
predicted by bi-phase suspension dielectric theory. Within the frame of
interfacial polarization, we propose a methodology to have an insight into the
local conductivity of the interior of mesoscopic conducting phase.
