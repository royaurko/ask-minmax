Storage replication is one of the essential requirements for network
environments. While many forms of Network Attached Storage (NAS), Storage Area
Networks (SAN) and other forms of network storage exist, there is a need for a
reliable synchronous storage replication technique between distant sites (less
than 1 mile). Such technology allows setting new standards for network failover
and failback systems for virtual servers; specifically, addressing the growing
need for effective disaster recovery (DR) planning. The purpose of this
manuscript is to identify newest technologies such as SAN/iQ and Storage
VMotion that allow for remote storage synchronous replication for virtual
servers. This study provides an analysis and a comparison of various SANs that
create solutions for enterprise needs. Additionally, the interoperability of
these technologies with the industry s leading product VMware ESX Server will
be discussed.
