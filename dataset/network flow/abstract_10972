We analyze the mixing properties of growing networks and find that, in some
cases, the assortativity patterns are reversed once links' direction is
considered: the disassortative behavior observed in such networks is a spurious
effect, and a careful analysis reveals genuine positive correlations. We prove
our claim by analytical calculations and numerical simulations for two classes
of models based on preferential attachment and fitness. Such counterintuitive
phenomenon is a manifestation of the well known Simpson's paradox. Results
concerning mixing patterns may have important consequences, since they reflect
on structural properties as resilience, epidemic spreading and synchronization.
Our findings suggest that a more detailed analysis of real directed networks,
such as the World Wide Web, is needed.
