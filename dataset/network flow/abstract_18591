Taking an interaction network oriented perspective in informatics raises the
challenge to describe deterministic finite systems which take part in networks
of nondeterministic interactions. The traditional approach to describe
processes as stepwise executable activities which are not based on the
ordinarily nondeterministic interaction shows strong centralization tendencies.
As suggested in this article, viewing processes and their interactions as
complementary can circumvent these centralization tendencies.
  The description of both, processes and their interactions is based on the
same building blocks, namely finite input output automata (or transducers).
Processes are viewed as finite systems that take part in multiple, ordinarily
nondeterministic interactions. The interactions between processes are described
as protocols.
  The effects of communication between processes as well as the necessary
coordination of different interactions within a processes are both based on the
restriction of the transition relation of product automata. The channel based
outer coupling represents the causal relation between the output and the input
of different systems. The coordination condition based inner coupling
represents the causal relation between the input and output of a single system.
  All steps are illustrated with the example of a network of resource
administration processes which is supposed to provide requesting user processes
exclusive access to a single resource.
