Comprehending the virality of a meme can help us in addressing the problems
pertaining to disciplines like epidemiology and digital marketing. Therefore,
it is not surprising that memetics remains a highly analyzed research topic
ever since the mid 1990s. Some scientists choose to investigate the intrinsic
contagiousness of a meme while others study the problem from a network theory
perspective. In this paper, we revisit the idea of a core-periphery structure
and apply it to understand the trajectory of a viral meme in a social network.
We have proposed shell-based hill climbing algorithms to determine the path
from a periphery shell(where the meme originates) to the core of the network.
Further simulations and analysis on the networks behavioral characteristics
helped us unearth specialized shells which we term Pseudo-Cores. These shells
emulate the behavior of the core in terms of size of the cascade triggered. In
our experiments, we have considered two sets for the target nodes, one being
core and the other being any of the pseudo-core. We compare our algorithms
against already existing path finding algorithms and validate the better
performance experimentally.
