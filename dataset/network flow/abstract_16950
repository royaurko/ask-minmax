Automated collection of environmental data may be accomplished with wireless
sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, a general discussion of WSNs is given
for the gathering of data for educational research. WSNs have the capability to
enhance the scope of a researcher to include multiple streams of data:
environmental, location, cyberdata, video, and RFID. The location of data
stored in a database can allow reconstruction of the learning activity for the
evaluation of significance at a later time. A brief overview of the technology
forms the basis of an exploration of a setting used for outdoor learning.
