We study the finite element formulation of general boundary conditions for
incompressible flow problems. Distinguishing between the contributions from the
inviscid and viscid parts of the equations, we use Nitsche's method to develop
a discrete weighted weak formulation valid for all values of the viscosity
parameter, including the limit case of the Euler equations. In order to control
the discrete kinetic energy, additional consistent terms are introduced. We
treat the limit case as a (degenerate) system of hyperbolic equations, using a
balanced spectral decomposition of the flux Jacobian matrix, in analogy with
compressible flows. Then, following the theory of Friedrich's systems, the
natural characteristic boundary condition is generalized to the considered
physical boundary conditions. Several numerical experiments, including standard
benchmarks for viscous flows as well as inviscid flows are presented.
