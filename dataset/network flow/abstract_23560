We investigate the transport properties of a classical wave propagating
through a quasi-periodic Fibonacci array of waveguide segments in the form of
loops. The formulation is general, and applicable for electromagnetic or
acoustic waves through such structures. We examine the conditions for resonant
transmission in a Fibonacci waveguide structure. The local positional
correlation between the loops are found to be responsible for the resonance. We
also show that, depending on the number of segments attached to a particular
loop, the intensity at the nodes displays a perfectly periodic or a
self-similar pattern. The former pattern corresponds to a perfectly extended
mode of propagation, which is to be contrasted to the electron or phonon
characteristics of a pure one dimensional Fibonacci quasi-crystal.
