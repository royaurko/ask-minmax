We present results of a series of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and hydro-
dynamic (HD) 2.5D simulations of the morphology of outflows driven by nested
wide-angle winds - i.e. winds which eminate from a central star as well as from
an orbiting accretion disk. While our results are broadly relevent to nested
wind systems we have tuned the parameters of the simulations to touch on issues
in both Young Stellar Objects and Planetary Nebula studies. In particular our
studies connect to open issues in the early evolution of Planetary Nebulae. We
find that nested MHD winds exhibit marked morphological differences from the
single MHD wind case along both dimensions of the flow. Nested HD winds on the
other hand give rise mainly to geometric distortions of an outflow that is
topologically similar to the flow arising from a single stellar HD wind. Our
MHD results are insensitive to changes in ambient temperature between ionized
and un-ionized circumstellar environments. The results are sensitive to the
relative mass-loss rates, and to the relative speeds of the stellar and disk
winds. We also present synthetic emission maps of both nested MHD and HD
simulations. We find that nested MHD winds show knots of emission appearing
on-axis that do not appear in the HD case.
