Networks of spins, or spintronic networks, are given an Information Transfer
Fidelity (ITF) derived from an upper bound on the probability of transmission
of the excitation from one spin to another. It is shown that this theoretical
bound can be reached asymptotically in time under certain conditions. The
process of achieving maximum transfer probability is given a dynamical model,
the translation on the torus, and the time to reach the maximum probability is
estimated using the simultaneous Diophantine approximation computationally
implemented using a variant of the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\'asz (LLL) algorithm.
The ITF induces a prametric on the network. For a ring with homogeneous
couplings, it is shown that this prametric satisfies the triangle inequality,
opening up the road to an ITF geometry, which turns out to be completely
different from the geometry of the physical arrangement of the spin in the
spintronic device. It is shown that transfer fidelities and transfer times can
be improved by means of simple controls taking the form of strong localized
magnetic fields, opening up the possibility for intelligent design of
spintronic networks and dynamic routing of information encoded in such
networks. The approach is much more flexible than engineering the couplings to
favor some transfers.
