Dynamical system models of complex biochemical reaction networks are usually
high-dimensional, nonlinear, and contain many unknown parameters. In some cases
the reaction network structure dictates that positive equilibria must be unique
for all values of the parameters in the model. In other cases multiple
equilibria exist if and only if special relationships between these parameters
are satisfied. We describe methods based on homotopy invariance of degree which
allow us to determine the number of equilibria for complex biochemical reaction
networks and how this number depends on parameters in the model.
