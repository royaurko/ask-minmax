We investigate the rheological characteristics of human blood plasma in shear
and elongational flows. While we can confirm a Newtonian behavior in shear flow
within experimental resolution, we find a viscoelastic behavior of blood plasma
in the pure extensional flow of a capillary break-up rheometer. The influence
of the viscoelasticity of blood plasma on capillary blood flow is tested in a
microfluidic device with a contraction-expansion geometry. Differential
pressure measurements revealed that the plasma has a pronounced flow resistance
compared to that of pure water. Supplementary measurements indicate that the
viscoelasticity of the plasma might even lead to viscoelastic instabilities
under certain conditions. Our findings show that the viscoelastic properties of
plasma should not be ignored in future studies on blood flow.
