The advent of real-time multimedia services over the Internet has stimulated
new technologies for expanding the information carrying capacity of optical
network backbones. Multilayer wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) packet
switching is an emerging technology for increasing the bandwidth of optical
networks. Two algorithms for the routing of the multimedia traffic flows were
applied: (i) Capacitated Shortest Path First (CSPF) routing, which minimizes
the distance of each flow linking the given source and destination nodes and
satisfying capacity constraints; and (ii) Flow Deviation Algorithm (FDA)
routing, which minimizes the network?wide average packet delay.
