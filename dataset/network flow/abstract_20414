We study the expanded mixed finite element method applied to degenerate
parabolic equations with the Dirichlet boundary condition. The equation is
considered a prototype of the nonlinear Forchheimer equation, a inverted to the
nonlinear Darcy equation with permeability coefficient depending on pressure
gradient, for slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media. The bounds for
the solutions are established. In both continuous and discrete time procedures,
utilizing the monotonicity properties of Forchheimer equation and boundedness
of solutions we prove the optimal error estimates in $L^2$-norm for solution.
The error bounds are established for the solution and divergence of the vector
variable in Lebesgue norms and Sobolev norms under some additional regularity
assumptions. A numerical example using the lowest order Raviart-Thomas ($RT_0$)
mixed element are provided agreement with our theoretical analysis.
