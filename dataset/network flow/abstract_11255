In this paper, researchers estimated the stock price of activated companies
in Tehran (Iran) stock exchange. It is used Linear Regression and Artificial
Neural Network methods and compared these two methods. In Artificial Neural
Network, of General Regression Neural Network method (GRNN) for architecture is
used. In this paper, first, researchers considered 10 macro economic variables
and 30 financial variables and then they obtained seven final variables
including 3 macro economic variables and 4 financial variables to estimate the
stock price using Independent components Analysis (ICA). So, we presented an
equation for two methods and compared their results which shown that artificial
neural network method is more efficient than linear regression method.
