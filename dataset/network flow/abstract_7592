Measurements of anisotropic flow at low (p_T < 1.5 GeV/c) and intermediate
(1.5 < p_T < 5 GeV/c) transverse momentum from the STAR collaboration are
reviewed. While at low p_T an ordering of elliptic flow strength with particle
mass is observed, the measured signals appear to follow number-of-constituent
quark scaling at intermediate p_T. The observations of higher harmonics support
this picture qualitatively, and are sensitive to specific model assumptions.
