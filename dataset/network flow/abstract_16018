Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become more prominent
recently, both in frequency of occurrence, as well as magnitude. Such attacks
render key Internet resources unavailable and disrupt its normal operation. It
is therefore of paramount importance to quickly identify malicious Internet
activity. The DDoS threat model includes characteristics such as: (i)
heavy-hitters that transmit large volumes of traffic towards "victims", (ii)
persistent-hitters that send traffic, not necessarily large, to specific
destinations to be used as attack facilitators, (iii) host and port scanning
for compiling lists of un-secure servers to be used as attack amplifiers, etc.
This conglomeration of problems motivates the development of space/time
efficient summaries of data traffic streams that can be used to identify
heavy-hitters associated with the above attack vectors. This paper presents a
hashing-based framework and fast algorithms that take into account the
large-dimensionality of the incoming network stream and can be employed to
quickly identify the culprits. The algorithms and data structures proposed
provide a synopsis of the network stream that is not taxing to fast-memory, and
can be efficiently implemented in hardware due to simple bit-wise operations.
The methods are evaluated using real-world Internet data from a large academic
network.
