In this paper we analytically propose an alternative approach to achieve
better fairness in scheduling mechanisms which could provide better quality of
service particularly for real time application. Our proposal oppose the
allocation of the bandwidth which adopted by all previous scheduling mechanism.
It rather adopt the opposition approach be proposing the notion of
Maxmin-charge which fairly distribute the congestion. Furthermore, analytical
proposition of novel mechanism named as Just Queueing is been demonstrated.
