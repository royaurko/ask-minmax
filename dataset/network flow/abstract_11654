The revolution of wireless sensors networks (WSNs) has highly augmented the
expectations of people to get the work done efficiently, but there is little
bit impediment to deal with deployed nodes in WSNs. The nature of used routing
and medium access control (MAC) protocols in WSNs is completely different from
wireless adhoc network protocols. Sensor nodes do not have enough capability to
synchronize with robust way, in resulting causes of longer delay and waste of
energy. In this paper, we deploy efficientenergy consuming sensors and to find
one hop robust and efficient destination search in WSNs. We firstly deploy BT
(Bluetooth enabled) sensors, which offer passive and active sensing capability
to save energy. This work is a continuation of previous published work in [2].
The BT node is supported with efficient searchmethodss. The main objective of
this contribution is to control different types of objects from remote places
using cellular phone. To validate our proposed methodology,simulation is done
with network simulator (ns2) to examine the behavior of WSNs. Based on
simulation results, we claim that our approach saves 62% energy spent for
finding best one- hop destination as compared with existing techniques.
