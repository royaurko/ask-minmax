We devise in this work a simple mechanism for constructing flows on a Banach
space from approximate flows, and show how it can be used in a simple way to
reprove from scratch and extend the main existence and well-posedness results
for rough differential equations, in the context of dynamics on a Banach space
driven by a finite dimensional Holder weak geometric p-rough path, for any 2<p;
the explosion question under linear growth conditions on the vector fields,
Taylor expansion and convergence rates for Euler estimates are also dealt with.
We illustrate our approach by proving an existence and well-posedness result
for some mean field stochastic rough differential equation.
