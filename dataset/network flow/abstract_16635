We study the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) and Debye-Stokes-Einstein
(DSE) relations for translational and rotational motion in a prototypical model
of a network-forming liquid, the ST2 model of water. We find that the emergence
of ``fractional'' SE and DSE relations at low temperature is ubiquitous in this
system, with exponents that vary little over a range of distinct physical
regimes. We also show that the same fractional SE relation is obeyed by both
mobile and immobile dynamical heterogeneities of the liquid.
