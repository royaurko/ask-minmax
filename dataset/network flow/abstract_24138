The conventional wireless schedulers of Unicast and Multicast either fulfill
multiuser diversity or broadcast gain, but not both together. To achieve
optimal system throughput we need a scheduler that exploits both the multiuser
diversity gain and the Multicasting gain simultaneously. We first propose a new
medianthreshold scheduler that selects all users having instantaneous SNR above
the median value for transmission. The system rate equation for the proposed
scheduler is also derived. We then optimize the median-threshold so that it
performs well over an entire SNR range.With the help of simulation results we
compare performance of the proposed scheduler with schedulers like Unicast,
Multicast and other Opportunistic Multicast Schedulers (OMS) which are the best
schedulers in terms of throughput and show that the proposed optimized
threshold scheme outperforms all of them.
