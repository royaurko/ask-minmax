A four-node network consisting of a negative loop controlling a positive one
is studied. It models some of the features of the p53 gene network. Using
piecewise linear dynamics with thresholds, the allowed dynamical classes are
fully characterized and coded. The biologically relevant situations are
identified and conclusions drawn concerning the effectiveness of the p53
network as a tumour inhibitor mechanism.
