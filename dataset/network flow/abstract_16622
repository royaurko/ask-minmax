Topology of exponential and scale-free trees and simple graphs is
investigated numerically. The numbers of the nearest neighbors, the
next-nearest neighbors, the next-next-nearest neighbors, the 4-th and the 5-th
neighbors are calculated. The functional dependence of the node-to-node
distance d_{ij} on the product of connectivities k_ik_j has been also checked.
The results of simulations for exponential networks agree with the existing
analytical predictions.
