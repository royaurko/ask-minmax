The flows in and around sunspots are rich in detail. Starting with the
Evershed flow along low-lying flow channels, which are cospatial with the
horizontal penumbral magnetic fields, Evershed clouds may continue this motion
at the periphery of the sunspot as moving magnetic features in the sunspot
moat. Besides these well-ordered flows, peculiar motions are found in complex
sunspots, where they contribute to the build-up or relaxation of magnetic
shear. In principle, the three-dimensional structure of these velocity fields
can be captured. The line-of-sight component of the velocity vector is
accessible with spectroscopic measurements, whereas local correlation or
feature tracking techniques provide the means to assess horizontal proper
motions. The next generation of ground-based solar telescopes will provide
spectropolarimetric data resolving solar fine structure with sizes below 50 km.
Thus, these new telescopes with advanced post-focus instruments act as a "zoom
lens" to study the intricate surface flows associated with sunspots.
Accompanied by "wide-angle" observations from space, we have now the
opportunity to describe sunspots as a system. This review reports recent
findings related to flows in and around sunspots and highlights the role of
advanced instrumentation in the discovery process.
