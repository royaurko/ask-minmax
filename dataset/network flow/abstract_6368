Graphs and networks provide a canonical representation of relational data,
with massive network data sets becoming increasingly prevalent across a variety
of scientific fields. Although tools from mathematics and computer science have
been eagerly adopted by practitioners in the service of network inference, they
do not yet comprise a unified and coherent framework for the statistical
analysis of large-scale network data. This paper serves as both an introduction
to the topic and a first step toward formal inference procedures. We develop
and illustrate our arguments using the example of hypothesis testing for
network structure. We invoke a generalized likelihood ratio framework and use
it to highlight the growing number of topics in this area that require strong
contributions from statistical science. We frame our discussion in the context
of previous work from across a variety of disciplines, and conclude by
outlining fundamental statistical challenges whose solutions will in turn serve
to advance the science of network inference.
