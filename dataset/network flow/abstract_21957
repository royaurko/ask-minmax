We find the evolution toward power-law scaling in the distribution of roll
lengths and nearest-neighbor distributions in a weakly turbulent regime of
Rayleigh-Benard convection, known as spiral defect chaos. The state has a
bounded domain of wave vectors in Fourier space attributed to the flow being
highly confined to two dimensions. Our results indicates the existence of
power-law scaling in the unconstrained horizontal dimension. The techniques
described are broadly applicable to other pattern forming systems as well.
