The integrated elliptic flow of charged particles produced in Pb+Pb
collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=2.76 TeV has been measured with the ATLAS detector
using data collected at the Large Hadron Collider. The anisotropy parameter,
v_2, was measured in the pseudorapidity range |eta| <= 2.5 with the event-plane
method. In order to include tracks with very low transverse momentum pT, thus
reducing the uncertainty in v_2 integrated over pT, a 1 mu b-1 data sample
without a magnetic field in the tracking detectors is used. The centrality
dependence of the integrated v_2 is compared to other measurements obtained
with higher pT thresholds. A weak pseudorapidity dependence of the integrated
elliptic flow is observed for central collisions, and a small decrease when
moving away from mid-rapidity is observed only in peripheral collisions. The
integrated v2 transformed to the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei is
compared to the lower-energy RHIC data.
