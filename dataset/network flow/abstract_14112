It is first shown that the observational light curve data of R Scuti, a star
of the RV Tau type, is not multi-periodic, and that it cannot have been
generated by a linear stochastic (AR) process. By default, the signal must be a
manifestation of deterministic chaos. We use a novel nonlinear time-series
analysis, the global flow reconstruction technique, to probe the properties of
the irregular pulsation cycles. We show in particular that the chaotic dynamics
of this star's complicated lightcurve is captured by a simple 4D polynomial map
or flow (4 first order ODEs).
  Importantly also, the method allows us to quantify an irregular signal which
has the potential benefit for extracting novel stellar constraints from an
irregular light-curve.
  Finally, from the low dimensionality 4 of the flow we can infer a simple
physical picture of the pulsations, and arguments are presented that the
pulsations of R Sct are the result of the nonlinear interaction of two
vibrational normal modes of the star.
