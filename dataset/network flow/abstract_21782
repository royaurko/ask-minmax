We prove that a Hamiltonian $p\in C^\infty(T^*{\bf R}^n)$ is locally
integrable near a non-degenerate critical point $\rho_0$ of the energy,
provided that the fundamental matrix at $\rho_0$ has no purely imaginary
eigenvalues. This is done by using Birkhoff normal forms, which turn out to be
convergent in the $C^\infty$ sense. We also give versions of the
Lewis-Sternberg normal form near a hyperbolic fixed point of a canonical
transformation. Then we investigate the almost holomorphic case.
