We study 2D solids with weak substrate disorder, using Coulomb gas
renormalisation. The melting transition is found to be replaced by a sharp
crossover between a high $T$ liquid with thermally induced dislocations, and a
low $T$ glassy regime with disorder induced dislocations at scales larger than
$\xi_{d}$ which we compute ($\xi_{d}\gg R_{c}\sim R_{a}$, the Larkin and
translational correlation lengths). We discuss experimental consequences,
reminiscent of melting, such as size effects in vortex flow and AC response in
superconducting films.
