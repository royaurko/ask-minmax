Mass inflow in barred galaxies has been invoked to account for a wide variety
of phenomena, but until now direct evidence for inflow has been lacking. We
present Fabry-Perot H-alpha observations of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1530
from which we determine velocities of the ionized gas for the entire region
swept by the bar. We compare the velocity field to models of gas flow in barred
spirals and show that it is well reproduced by ideal gas hydrodynamic models.
Inspection of the models and observations reveals that gas entering the bar
dust lanes streams directly down the dust lanes toward the 2 kpc radius nuclear
ring. The models predict that approximately 20% of the gas flowing down the
dust lane enters the nuclear ring; the remaining gas sprays around the ring to
the other bar dust lane. The fraction of the gas entering the ring is
relatively insensitive to the shape or size of the bar. Our observations of the
velocity field and dust optical depth yield a mass inflow rate into the nuclear
ring of 1 solar mass per year.
