Distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) protocols are proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ad-hoc networks with contention-based
medium access. The proposed scheduling protocols distinguish themselves from
other existing works by their explicit design for system throughput improvement
through exploiting spatial multiplexing and diversity in a {\em distributed}
manner. As a result, multiple links can be scheduled to simultaneously transmit
over the spatial channels formed by transmit/receiver antennas. Taking into
account the tradeoff between feedback requirements and system throughput, we
propose and compare protocols with different levels of feedback information.
Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional random access protocols that
ignore the physical channel conditions of contending links, the proposed
protocols implement a pure threshold policy derived from optimal stopping
theory, i.e. only links with threshold-exceeding channel conditions are allowed
for data transmission. Simulation results confirm that the proposed protocols
can achieve impressive throughput performance by exploiting spatial
multiplexing and diversity.
