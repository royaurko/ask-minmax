An explicit isomorphism between Morse homology and singular homology is
constructed via the technique of pseudo-cycles. Given a Morse cycle as a formal
sum of critical points of a Morse function, the unstable manifolds for the
negative gradient flow are compactified in a suitable way, such that gluing
them appropriately leads to a pseudo-cycle and a well-defined integral homology
class in singular homology.
