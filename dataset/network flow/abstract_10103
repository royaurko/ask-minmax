Incompressible stationary flows of ideal plasma are observed. By introduction
of curvilinear system of coordinates in which streamlines and magnetic force
lines form a family of coordinate surfaces, MHD equations are partially
integrated and brought to a certain convenient form. It is demonstrated that
the admissible group of Bogoyavlenskij's symmetry transformations performs as a
scaling transformation for the curvilinear coordinates. Analytic description of
stationary flows with constant total pressure is given. It is shown, that
contact magnetic surfaces of such flows are translational surfaces, i.e. are
swept out by translating one curve rigidly along another curve. Explicit
examples of solutions with constant total pressure possessing a significant
functional arbitrariness are given.
