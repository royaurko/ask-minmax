In this paper we show how to go beyond the study of the topological
properties of the Internet, by measuring its dynamical state using special
active probing techniques and the methods of network tomography. We demonstrate
this approach by measuring the key state parameters of Internet paths, the
characteristics of queueing delay, in a part of the European Internet. In the
paper we describe in detail the ETOMIC measurement platform that was used to
conduct the experiments, and the applied method of queueing delay tomography.
The main results of the paper are maps showing various spatial structure in the
characteristics of queueing delay corresponding to the resolved part of the
European Internet. These maps reveal that the average queueing delay of network
segments spans more than two orders of magnitude, and that the distribution of
this quantity is very well fitted by the log-normal distribution.
