We consider a simple multiple access network (SMAN), where $k$ sources of
unit rates transmit their data to a common sink via $n$ relays. Each relay is
connected to the sink and to certain sources. A coding scheme (for the relays)
is weakly secure if a passive adversary who eavesdrops on less than $k$
relay-sink links cannot reconstruct the data from each source. We show that
there exists a weakly secure maximum distance separable (MDS) coding scheme for
the relays if and only if every subset of $\ell$ relays must be collectively
connected to at least $\ell+1$ sources, for all $0 < \ell < k$. Moreover, we
prove that this condition can be verified in polynomial time in $n$ and $k$.
Finally, given a SMAN satisfying the aforementioned condition, we provide
another polynomial time algorithm to trim the network until it has a sparsest
set of source-relay links that still supports a weakly secure MDS coding
scheme.
