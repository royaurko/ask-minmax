We propose a network model with a fixed number of nodes and links with a
dynamics which favors links between nodes differing in connectivity. Parameter
regimes where the degree distributions follow power-laws, P(k) ~ k^-gamma, high
clustering following C(N) ~ 1/N and small-world properties, with a network
diameter following D(N) ~ A+ B log N, are observed. Our model gives results
comparable with real-world protein networks.
