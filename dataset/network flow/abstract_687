In this paper we propose a Godunov-based discretization of a hyperbolic
system of conservation laws with discontinuous flux, modeling vehicular flow on
a network. Each equation describes the density evolution of vehicles having a
common path along the network. We show that the algorithm selects automatically
an admissible solution at junctions, hence ad hoc external procedures (e.g.,
maximization of the flux via a linear programming method) usually employed in
classical approaches are no needed. Since users have not to deal explicitly
with vehicle dynamics at junction, the numerical code can be implemented in
minutes. We perform a detailed numerical comparison with a Godunov-based scheme
coming from the classical theory of traffic flow on networks which maximizes
the flux at junctions.
