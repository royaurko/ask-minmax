In most models of the spread of disease over contact networks it is assumed
that the probabilities per unit time of disease transmission and recovery from
disease are constant, implying exponential distributions of the time intervals
for transmission and recovery. Time intervals for real diseases, however, have
distributions that in most cases are far from exponential, which leads to
disagreements, both qualitative and quantitative, with the models. In this
paper, we study a generalized version of the SIR
(susceptible-infected-recovered) model of epidemic disease that allows for
arbitrary distributions of transmission and recovery times. Standard
differential equation approaches cannot be used for this generalized model, but
we show that the problem can be reformulated as a time-dependent message
passing calculation on the appropriate contact network. The calculation is
exact on trees (i.e., loopless networks) or locally tree-like networks (such as
random graphs) in the large system size limit. On non-tree-like networks we
show that the calculation gives a rigorous bound on the size of disease
outbreaks. We demonstrate the method with applications to two specific models
and the results compare favorably with numerical simulations.
