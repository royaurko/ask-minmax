Sampling techniques such as Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) are widely used
in epidemiology to sample "hidden" populations, such that properties of the
network can be deduced from the sample. We consider how similar techniques can
be designed that allow the discovery of the structure, especially the community
structure, of networks. Our method involves collecting samples of a network by
random walks and reconstructing the network by probabilistically coalescing
vertices, using vertex attributes to determine the probabilities. Even though
our method can only approximately reconstruct a part of the original network,
it can recover its community structure relatively well. Moreover, it can find
the key vertices which, when immunized, can effectively reduce the spread of an
infection through the original network.
