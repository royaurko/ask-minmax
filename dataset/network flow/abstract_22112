Recently the dynamic distance potential field (DDPF) was introduced as a
computationally efficient method to make agents in a simulation of pedestrians
move rather on the quickest path than the shortest. It can be considered to be
an estimated-remaining-journey-time-based one-shot dynamic assignment method
for pedestrian route choice on the operational level of dynamics. In this
contribution the method is shortly introduced and the effect of the method on
RiMEA's test case 11 is investigated.
