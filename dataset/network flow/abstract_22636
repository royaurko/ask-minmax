B_c meson production in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt{s}=2.76 A TeV is surveyed in
both a statistical coalescence model and a transport model. The nuclear
modification factor R_{AA} is predicted to be between 2 and 18 in the most
central collisions, which can help to confirm the regeneration mechanism. In
addition, the momentum dependence is also investigated as given by the
transport model. A strong suppression of the transverse momentum is found in
central collisions accompanying the enhancement in yield. The spectrum and
elliptic flow of B_c are also discussed.
