We introduce a new rule of motion for a totally asymmetric exclusion process
(TASEP) representing pedestrian traffic on a lattice. Its characteristic
feature is that the positions of the pedestrians, modeled as hard-core
particles, are updated in a fixed predefined order, determined by a phase
attached to each of them. We investigate this model analytically and by Monte
Carlo simulation on a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary
conditions. At a critical value of the particle density a transition occurs
from a phase with `free flow' to one with `jammed flow'. We are able to
analytically predict the current-density diagram for the infinite system and to
find the scaling function that describes the finite size rounding at the
transition point.
