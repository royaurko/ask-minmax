Wireless Communication is an application of science and technology that has
come to be vital for modern existence. From the early radio and telephone to
current devices such as mobile phones and laptops, accessing the global network
has become the most essential and indispensable part of our lifestyle. Wireless
communication is an ever developing field, and the future holds many
possibilities in this area. One expectation for the future in this field is
that, the devices can be developed to support communication with higher data
rates and more security. Research in this area suggests that a dominant means
of supporting such communication capabilities will be through the use of
Wireless LANs. As the deployment of Wireless LAN increases well around the
globe, it is increasingly important for us to understand different technologies
and to select the most appropriate one.
  This paper provides a detailed study of the available wireless LAN
technologies and the concerned issues, will give a brief description of what
wireless LANs are, the need of Wireless LAN, History of wireless LAN,
advantages of Wireless Networks, with summarizing the related work on WLAN in
academic area, Wireless LAN technologies, some risks attacks against wireless
technologies, suggesting some recommendations to protect wireless LAN network
from attack, Finally we propose some research issues should be focused on in
the future.
