The asymmetry model for the highly viscous flow postulates thermally
activated jumps from a practically undistorted ground state to strongly
distorted, but stable structures, with a pronounced Eshelby backstress from the
distorted surroundings. The viscosity is ascribed to those stable distorted
structures which do not jump back, but relax by the relaxation of the
surrounding viscoelastic matrix. It is shown that this mechanism implies a
description in terms of the shear compliance, with a viscosity which can be
calculated from the cutoff of the retardation spectrum. Consistency requires
that this cutoff lies close to the Maxwell time. The improved asymmetry model
compares well with experiment.
