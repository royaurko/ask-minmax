Motivated by "condensation" phenomena often observed in social networks such
as Twitter where one "superstar" vertex gains a positive fraction of the edges,
while the remaining empirical degree distribution still exhibits a power law
tail, we formulate a mathematically tractable model for this phenomenon which
provides a better fit to empirical data than the standard preferential
attachment model across an array of networks observed in Twitter. Using
embeddings in an equivalent continuous time version of the process, and
adapting techniques from the stable age-distribution theory of branching
processes, we prove limit results for the proportion of edges that condense
around the superstar, the degree distribution of the remaining vertices,
maximal non-superstar degree asymptotics, and height of these random trees in
the large network limit.
