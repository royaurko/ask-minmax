We report hybrid lattice Boltzmann (HLB) simulations of the hydrodynamics of
an active nematic liquid crystal sandwiched between confining walls with
various anchoring conditions. We confirm the existence of a transition between
a passive phase and an active phase, in which there is spontaneous flow in the
steady state. This transition is attained for sufficiently ``extensile'' rods,
in the case of flow-aligning liquid crystals, and for sufficiently
``contractile'' ones for flow-tumbling materials. In a quasi-1D geometry, deep
in the active phase of flow-aligning materials, our simulations give evidence
of hysteresis and history-dependent steady states, as well as of spontaneous
banded flow. Flow-tumbling materials, in contrast, re-arrange themselves so
that only the two boundary layers flow in steady state. Two-dimensional
simulations, with periodic boundary conditions, show additional instabilities,
with the spontaneous flow appearing as patterns made up of ``convection
rolls''. These results demonstrate a remarkable richness (including dependence
on anchoring conditions) in the steady-state phase behaviour of active
materials, even in the absence of external forcing; they have no counterpart
for passive nematics. Our HLB methodology, which combines lattice Boltzmann for
momentum transport with a finite difference scheme for the order parameter
dynamics, offers a robust and efficient method for probing the complex
hydrodynamic behaviour of active nematics.
