This work is focused to study the development and control of the laminar
vortex breakdown of a flow enclosed in a cylinder. We show that vortex
breakdown can be controlled by the introduction of a small fixed rod in the
axis of the cylinder. Our method to control the onset of vortex breakdown is
simpler than those previously proposed, since it does not require any auxiliary
device system. The effect of the fixed rods may be understood using a simple
model based on the failure of the quasi-cylindrical approximation. We report
experimental results of the critical Reynolds number for the appearance of
vortex breakdown for different radius of the fixed rods and different aspect
ratios of the system. Good agreement is found between the theoretical and
experimental results.
