Small-world networks are highly clustered networks with small distances among
the nodes. There are many biological neural networks that present this kind of
connections. There are no special weightings in the connections of most
existing small-world network models. However, this kind of simply-connected
models cannot characterize biological neural networks, in which there are
different weights in synaptic connections. In this paper, we present a neural
network model with weighted small-world connections, and further investigate
the stability of this model.
