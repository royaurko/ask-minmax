Recent XMM-Newton observations of the cooling flow gas in M87 indicate
sharply decreasing oxygen, iron and silicon abundances within $\sim 5$ kpc of
the galactic center. This result is unexpected since stellar mass loss and Type
Ia supernovae are expected to produce pronounced central abundance maxima for
all three elements. However, it has been suggested that many of the strong
X-ray lines are optically thick and diffuse to larger radii in the cooling flow
before escaping, falsifying the central abundances. We verify with radiation
transfer calculations that this effect does indeed occur in the M87 cooling
flow, but that it is insufficient to account for the M87 observations. We
suggest that some source of continuous opacity is required to reduce the
central X-ray line emission, perhaps by warm gas at $T \sim 10^5 - 10^6$ K. The
radial surface brightness profiles of X-ray resonance lines are also sensitive
to turbulence in cooling flows which reduces the line center optical depths
considerably. Turbulence may provide sufficient energy to continuously heat the
warm absorbing gas.
