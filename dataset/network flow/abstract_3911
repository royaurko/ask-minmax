We propose an approach based on analysis of cost-quality tradeoffs for
comparison of efficiency of various algorithms for small-world network
construction. A number of both known in the literature and original algorithms
for complex small-world networks construction are shortly reviewed and
compared. The networks constructed on the basis of these algorithms have basic
structure of 1D regular lattice with additional shortcuts providing the
small-world properties. It is shown that networks proposed in this work have
the best cost-quality ratio in the considered class.
