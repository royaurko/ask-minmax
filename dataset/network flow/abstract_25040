A class of characteristic function games arising from maximum flow problems is introduced and is shown to coincide with the class of totally balanced games. The proof relies on the max flow-min cut theorem of Ford and Fulkerson and on the observation that the class of totally balanced games is the span of the additive games with the minimum operation.
