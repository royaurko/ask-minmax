We propose a new self-consistent dynamo mechanism for the generation of
large-scale magnetic fields in natural objects. Recent computational studies
have described the formation of large-scale vortices (LSVs) in rotating
turbulent convection. Here we demonstrate that for magnetic Reynolds numbers
below the threshold for small-scale dynamo action, such turbulent flows can
sustain large-scale magnetic fields --- i.e. fields with a significant
component on the scale of the system.
