We present results of our calculations of NLTE model stellar atmospheres for
hot Population III stars composed of hydrogen and helium. We use our own
computer code for calculation of spherically symmetric NLTE model atmospheres
in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium. The model atmospheres are then used
for calculation of emergent fluxes. These fluxes serve for the evaluation of
the flow of high-energy photons for energies higher than ionization energies of
hydrogen and helium, the so-called ionizing photon fluxes. We also present the
time evolution of the ionizing photon fluxes.
