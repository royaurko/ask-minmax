We present a new method to extract anisotropic flow in heavy ion collisions
from the genuine correlation among a large number of particles. Anisotropic
flow is obtained from the zeroes in the complex plane of a generating function
of azimuthal correlations, in close analogy with the theory of phase
transitions by Lee and Yang. Flow is first estimated globally, i.e., averaged
over the phase space covered by the detector, and then differentially, as a
function of transverse momentum and rapidity for identified particles. The
corresponding estimates are less biased by nonflow correlations than with any
other method. The practical implementation of the method is rather
straightforward. Furthermore, it automatically takes into account most
corrections due to azimuthal anisotropies in the detector acceptance. The main
limitation of the method is statistical errors, which can be significantly
larger than with the ``standard'' method of flow analysis if the flow and/or
the event multiplicities are too small. In practice, we expect this to be the
most accurate method to analyze directed and elliptic flow in fixed-target
heavy-ion collisions between 100 MeV and 10 GeV per nucleon (at the Darmstadt
SIS synchrotron and the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron), and
elliptic flow at ultrarelativistic energies (at the Brookhaven Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider, and the forthcoming Large Hadron Collider at CERN).
