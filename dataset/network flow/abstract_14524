We review and compare the phenomenological aspects and physical origin of
shear-localization and shear-banding in various material types, namely
emulsions, suspensions, colloids, granular materials and micellar systems. It
appears that shear-banding, which must be distinguished from the simple effect
of coexisting static-flowing regions in yield stress fluids, occurs in the form
of a progressive evolution of the local viscosity towards two significantly
different values in two adjoining regions of the fluids in which the stress
takes slightly different values. This suggests that from a global point of view
shear-banding in these systems has a common physical origin: two physical
phenomena (for example, in colloids, destructuration due to flow and
restructuration due to aging) are in competition and, depending on the flow
conditions, one of them becomes dominant and makes the system evolve in a
specific direction.
