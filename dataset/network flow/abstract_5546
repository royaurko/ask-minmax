Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with their dynamic applications gained a
tremendous attention of researchers. Constant monitoring of critical situations
attracted researchers to utilize WSNs at vast platforms. The main focus in WSNs
is to enhance network life-time as much as one could, for efficient and optimal
utilization of resources. Different approaches based upon clustering are
proposed for optimum functionality. Network life-time is always related with
energy of sensor nodes deployed at remote areas for constant and fault tolerant
monitoring. In this work, we propose Quadrature-LEACH (Q-LEACH) for homogenous
networks which enhances stability period, network life-time and throughput
quiet significantly.
