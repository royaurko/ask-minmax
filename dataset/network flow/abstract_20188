We propose a remarkably simple solution of cubic open string field theory
which describes inhomogeneous tachyon condensation. The solution is in
one-to-one correspondence with the IR fixed point of the RG-flow generated in
the two--dimensional world-sheet theory by integrating a relevant operator with
mild enough OPE on the boundary. It is shown how the closed string overlap
correctly captures the shift in the closed string one point function between
the UV and the IR limits of the flow. Examples of lumps in non-compact and
compact transverse directions are given.
