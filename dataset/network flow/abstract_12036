Monte Carlo simulations and dynamical mean-field approximations are performed
to study the phase transitions in rock-scissors-paper game on different host
networks. These graphs are originated from lattices by introducing quenched and
annealed randomness simultaneously. In the resulting phase diagrams three
different stationary states are identified for all structures. The comparison
of results on different networks suggests that the value of clustering
coefficient plays an irrelevant role in the emergence of a global oscillating
phase. The critical behavior of phase transitions seems to be universal and can
be described by the same exponents.
