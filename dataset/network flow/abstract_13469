For integrable Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom whose
Hamiltonian vector fields have incomplete flows, an analogue of the Liouville
theorem is established. A canonical Liouville fibration is defined by means of
an "exact" 2-parameter family of flat polygons equipped with certain pairing of
sides. For the integrable Hamiltonian systems given by the vector field
$v=(-\partial f/\partial w, \partial f/\partial z)$ on ${\mathbb C}^2$ where
$f=f(z,w)$ is a complex polynomial in 2 variables, geometric properties of
Liouville fibrations are described.
