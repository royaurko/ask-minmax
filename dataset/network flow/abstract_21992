Given a renormalizable theory we construct the dilatation operator, in the
sense of generator of RG flow of composite operators. The generator is found as
a differential operator acting on the space of normal symbols of composite
operators in the theory. In the spirit of AdS/CFT correspondence, this operator
is interpreted as the Hamiltonian of the dual theory. In the case of a field
theory with non-abelian gauge symmetry the resulting system is a matrix model.
  The one-loop case is analyzed in details and it is shown that we reproduce
known results from N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
