We construct gravity solutions describing renormalization group flows
relating relativistic and non-relativistic conformal theories. We work both in
a simple phenomenological theory with a massive vector field, and in an N=4,
d=6 gauged supergravity theory, which can be consistently embedded in string
theory. These flows offer some further insight into holography for Lifshitz
geometries: in particular, they enable us to give a description of the field
theory dual to the Lifshitz solutions in the latter theory. We also note that
some of the AdS and Lifshitz solutions in the N=4, d=6 gauged supergravity
theory are dynamically unstable.
