Most accreting black holes emit a substantial fraction of their luminosity in
hard X-rays/soft $\gamma$-rays of up to $\sim{\rm few}\times100$ keV. The
observations suggest that the radiating gas is very hot, $T>10^9$ K, and
optically thin. Theoretical attempts to explain the observations are reviewed
and unresolved issues are highlighted.
