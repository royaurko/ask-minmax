The phenomenon of bursting, in which streaks in turbulent boundary layers
oscillate and then eject low speed fluid away from the wall, has been studied
experimentally, theoretically, and computationally for more than 50 years
because of its importance to the three-dimensional structure of turbulent
boundary layers. We produce five new three-dimensional solutions of turbulent
plane
  Couette flow, one of which is periodic while four others are relative
periodic. Each of these five solutions demonstrates the break-up and
re-formation of near-wall coherent structures.
  Four of our solutions are periodic but with drifts in the streamwise
direction. More surprisingly, two of our solutions are periodic but with drifts
in the spanwise direction, a possibility that does not seem to have been
considered in the literature. We argue that a considerable part of the
streakiness observed experimentally in the near-wall region could be due to
spanwise drifts that accompany the break-up and re-formation of coherent
structures. We also compute a new periodic solution of plane Couette flow that
could be related to transition to turbulence.
