In vehicular traffic planning it is a long standing problem how to assign
demand such on the available model of a road network that an equilibrium with
regard to travel time or generalized costs is realized. For pedestrian traffic
this question can be asked as well. However, as the infrastructure of
pedestrian dynamics is not a network (a graph), but two-dimensional, there is
in principle an infinitely large set of routes. As a consequence none of the
iterating assignment methods developed for road traffic can be applied for
pedestrians. In this contribution a method to overcome this problem is briefly
summarized and applied with an example geometry which as a result is enhanced
with routes with intermediate destination areas of certain shape. The enhanced
geometry is used in some exemplary assignment calculations.
