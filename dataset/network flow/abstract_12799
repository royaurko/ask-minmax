CitNetExplorer has been used to study the citation networks among the
scientific publications on tribology during the 15 years period from 1998-2012.
Three data sets from Web of Science have been analyzed: (1) Core publications
of tribology research, (2) publications on nanotribology and (3) publications
of Bharat Bhushan (a top-contributor to nanotribology research). Based on this
study, some suggestions are made to improve the CitNetExplorer.
