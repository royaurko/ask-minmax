This paper investigates the throughput for wireless network with full-duplex
radios using stochastic geometry. Full-duplex (FD) radios can exchange data
simultaneously with each other. On the other hand, the downside of FD
transmission is that it will inevitably cause extra interference to the network
compared to half-duplex (HD) transmission. In this paper, we focus on a
wireless network of nodes with both HD and FD capabilities and derive and
optimize the throughput in such a network. Our analytical result shows that if
the network is adapting an ALOHA protocol, the maximal throughput is always
achieved by scheduling all concurrently transmitting nodes to work in FD mode
instead of a mixed FD/HD mode or HD mode regardless of the network
configurations. Moreover, the throughput gain of using FD transmission over HD
transmission is analytically lower and upper bounded.
