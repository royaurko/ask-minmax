We use an acoustic Lagrangian tracking technique, particularly adapted to
measurements in open flows, and a versatile material particles generator (in
the form of soap bubbles with adjustable size and density) to characterize
Lagrangian statistics of finite sized, neutrally bouyant, particles transported
in an isotropic turbulent flow of air. We vary the size of the particles in a
range corresponding to turbulent inertial scales and explore how the turbulent
forcing experienced by the particles depends on their size. We show that, while
the global shape of the intermittent acceleration probability density function
does not depend significantly on particle size, the acceleration variance of
the particles decreases as they become larger in agreement with the classical
scaling for the spectrum of Eulerian pressure fluctuations in the carrier flow.
