Networked structure emerged from a wide range of fields such as biological
systems, World Wide Web and technological infrastructure. A deeply insight into
the topological complexity of these networks has been gained. Some works start
to pay attention to the weighted network, like the world-wide airport network
and the collaboration network, where links are not binary, but have
intensities. Here, we construct a novel knowledge network, through which we
take the first step to uncover the topological structure of the knowledge
system. Furthermore, the network is extended to the weighted one by assigning
weights to the edges. Thus, we also investigate the relationship between the
intensity of edges and the topological structure. These results provide a novel
description to understand the hierarchies and organizational principles in
knowledge system, and the interaction between the intensity of edges and
topological structure. This system also provides a good paradigm to study
weighted networks.
