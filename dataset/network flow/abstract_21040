Fermi surfaces of several quasicrystalline approximants are calculated by
means of ab-initio methods which enable direct comparison with dHvA
experiments. A criterion for anomalous metallic transport is proposed and
power-law temperature dependence of electronic conductivity is deduced from
scaling analysis of the Kubo formula.
