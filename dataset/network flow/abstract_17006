To achieve security in wireless networks, it is important to be able to
encrypt and authenticate messages sent among sensor nodes. Due to resource
constraints, achieving such key agreement in wireless sensor networks in
nontrivial. Blom's scheme is a symmetric key exchange protocol used in
cryptography. In this paper, we propose a new key pre-distribution scheme by
modifying Blom's scheme which reduces the computational complexity as well as
memory usage.
