We study the pressure-driven flow of concentrated colloids confined in glass
micro-channels at the single particle level using fast confocal microscopy. For
channel to particle size ratios $a/\bar{D} \lesssim 30$, the flow rate of the
suspended particles shows fluctuations. These turn into regular oscillations
for higher confinements ($a/\bar{D} \simeq 20$). We present evidence to link
these oscillations with the relative flow of solvent and particles (permeation)
and the effect of confinement on shear thickening.
