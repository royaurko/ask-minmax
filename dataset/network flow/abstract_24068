For a realistic traffic mix, we evaluate the hit rates attained in a
two-layer cache hierarchy designed to reduce Internet bandwidth requirements.
The model identifies four main types of content, web, file sharing, user
generated content and video on demand, distinguished in terms of their traffic
shares, their population and object sizes and their popularity distributions.
Results demonstrate that caching VoD in access routers offers a highly
favorable bandwidth memory tradeoff but that the other types of content would
likely be more efficiently handled in very large capacity storage devices in
the core. Evaluations are based on a simple approximation for LRU cache
performance that proves highly accurate in relevant configurations.
