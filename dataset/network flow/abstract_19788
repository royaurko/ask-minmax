This paper develops a posteriori error estimates of residual type for
conforming and mixed finite element approximations of the fourth order
Cahn-Hilliard equation $u_t+\De\bigl(\eps \De u-\eps^{-1} f(u)\bigr)=0$. It is
shown that the {\it a posteriori} error bounds depends on $\eps^{-1}$ only in
some low polynomial order, instead of exponential order. Using these a
posteriori error estimates, we construct an adaptive algorithm for computing
the solution of the Cahn-Hilliard equation and its sharp interface limit, the
Hele-Shaw flow. Numerical experiments are presented to show the robustness and
effectiveness of the new error estimators and the proposed adaptive algorithm.
