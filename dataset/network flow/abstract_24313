The linear noise approximation (LNA) offers a simple means by which one can
study intrinsic noise in monostable biochemical networks. Using simple physical
arguments, we have recently introduced the slow-scale LNA (ssLNA) which is a
reduced version of the LNA under conditions of timescale separation. In this
paper, we present the first rigorous derivation of the ssLNA using the
projection operator technique and show that the ssLNA follows uniquely from the
standard LNA under the same conditions of timescale separation as those
required for the deterministic quasi-steady state approximation. We also show
that the large molecule number limit of several common stochastic model
reduction techniques under timescale separation conditions constitutes a
special case of the ssLNA.
