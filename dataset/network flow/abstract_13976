We introduce a novel formalism to investigate the role of the spin angular
momentum of astrophysical black holes in influencing the behaviour of low
angular momentum general relativistic accretion. We propose a metric
independent analysis of axisymmetric general relativistic flow, and
consequently formulate the space and time dependent equations describing the
general relativistic hydrodynamic accretion flow in the Kerr metric. The
associated stationary critical solutions for such flow equations are provided
and the stability of the stationary transonic configuration is examined using
an elegant linear perturbation technique. We examine the properties of
infalling material for both prograde and retrograde accretion as a function of
the Kerr parameter at extremely close proximity to the event horizon. Our
formalism can be used to identify a new spectral signature of black hole spin,
and has the potential of performing the black hole shadow imaging corresponding
to the low angular momentum accretion flow.
