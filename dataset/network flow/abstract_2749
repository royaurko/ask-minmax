We introduce a class of neural networks derived from probabilistic models in
the form of Bayesian networks. By imposing additional assumptions about the
nature of the probabilistic models represented in the networks, we derive
neural networks with standard dynamics that require no training to determine
the synaptic weights, that perform accurate calculation of the mean values of
the random variables, that can pool multiple sources of evidence, and that deal
cleanly and consistently with inconsistent or contradictory evidence. The
presented neural networks capture many properties of Bayesian networks,
providing distributed versions of probabilistic models.
