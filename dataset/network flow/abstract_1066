We study how long range directional beams can be used for self-organization
of a wireless network to exhibit small world properties. Using simulation
results for randomized beamforming as a guideline, we identify crucial design
issues for algorithm design. Subsequently, we propose an algorithm for
deterministic creation of small worlds. We define a new centrality measure that
estimates the structural importance of nodes based on traffic flow in the
network, which is used to identify the optimum nodes for beamforming. This
results in significant reduction in path length while maintaining connectivity.
