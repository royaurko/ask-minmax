I construct a well-defined expansion in $\epsilon=2-d$ for diffusion
processes on small-world networks. The technique permits one to calculate the
average over disorder of moments of the Green's function, and is used to
calculate the average Green's function and fluctuations to first non-leading
order in $\epsilon$, giving results which agree with numerics. This technique
is also applicable to other problems of diffusion in random media.
