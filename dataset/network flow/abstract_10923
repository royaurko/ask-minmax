We train Artificial Neural Networks to classify galaxies based solely on the
morphology of the galaxy images as they appear on blue survey plates. The
images are reduced and morphological features such as bulge size and the number
of arms are extracted, all in a fully automated manner. The galaxy sample was
first classified by 6 independent experts. We use several definitions for the
mean type of each galaxy, based on those classifications. We then train and
test the network on these features. We find that the rms error of the network
classifications, as compared with the mean types of the expert classifications,
is 1.8 Revised Hubble Types. This is comparable to the overall rms dispersion
between the experts. This result is robust and almost completely independent of
the network architecture used.
