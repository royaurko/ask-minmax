In this work we study the connection between anisotropic flows and lumpy
initial conditions for Au+Au collisions at 200GeV. We present comparisons
between anisotropic flow coefficients and eccentricities up to sixth order, and
between initial condition reference angles and azimuthal particle distribution
angles. We also present a toy model to justify the lack of connection between
flow coefficients and eccentricities for individual events.
