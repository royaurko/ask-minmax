The aim of this article is to promote the use of probabilistic methods in the
study of problems in mathematical general relativity. Two new and simple
singularity theorems, whose features are different from the classical
singularity theorems, are proved using probabilistic methods. Under some energy
conditions, and without any causal or initial/boundary assumption, simple
conditions on the energy flow imply probabilistic incompleteness. Also we
introduce a probabilistic notion of spacetime boundary which has none of the
pathological defects that the classical boundaries may have.
