We consider volume-preserving perturbations of the time-one map of the
geodesic flow of a compact surface with negative curvature. We show that if the
Liouville measure has Lebesgue disintegration along the center foliation then
the perturbation is itself the time-one map of a smooth volume-preserving flow,
and that otherwise the disintegration is necessarily atomic.
