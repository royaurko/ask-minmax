Recently, a continuous dynamics was proposed to simulate dynamics of
interpersonal relations in a society represented by a fully connected graph.
Final state of such a society was found to be identical with the so-called
Heider balance (HB), where the society is divided into two mutually hostile
groups. In the continuous model, a polarization of opinions was found in HB.
Here we demonstrate that the polarization occurs also in Barabasi-Albert
networks, where the Heider balance is not necessarily present. In the second
part of this work we demonstrate the results of our formalism, when applied to
reference examples: the Southern women and the Zachary club.
