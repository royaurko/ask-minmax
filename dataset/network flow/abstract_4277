We introduce the pyunicorn (Pythonic unified complex network and recurrence
analysis toolbox) open source software package for applying and combining
modern methods of data analysis and modeling from complex network theory and
nonlinear time series analysis. pyunicorn is a fully object-oriented and easily
parallelizable package written in the language Python. It allows for the
construction of functional networks such as climate networks in climatology or
functional brain networks in neuroscience representing the structure of
statistical interrelationships in large data sets of time series and,
subsequently, investigating this structure using advanced methods of complex
network theory such as measures and models for spatial networks, networks of
interacting networks, node-weighted statistics or network surrogates.
Additionally, pyunicorn provides insights into the nonlinear dynamics of
complex systems as recorded in uni- and multivariate time series from a
non-traditional perspective by means of recurrence quantification analysis
(RQA), recurrence networks, visibility graphs and construction of surrogate
time series. The range of possible applications of the library is outlined,
drawing on several examples mainly from the field of climatology.
