Nowadays System-On-Chips (SoCs) have evolved considerably in term of
performances, reliability and integration capacity. The last advantage has
induced the growth of the number of cores or Intellectual Properties (IPs) in a
same chip. Unfortunately, this important number of IPs has caused a new issue
which is the intra-communication between the elements of a same chip. To
resolve this problem, a new paradigm has been introduced which is the
Network-On-Chip (NoC). Since the introduction of the NoC paradigm in the last
decade, new methodologies and approaches have been presented by research
community and many of them have been adopted by industrials. The literature
contains many relevant studies and surveys discussing NoC proposals and
contributions. However, few of them have discussed or proposed a comparative
study of NoC tools. The objective of this work is to establish a reliable
survey about available design, simulation or implementation NoC tools. We
collected an important amount of information and characteristics about NoC
dedicated tools that we will present throughout this survey. This study is
built around a respectable amount of references and we hope it will help
scientists.
