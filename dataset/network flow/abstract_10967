We find a new structural feature of equilibrium complex random networks
without multiple and self-connections. We show that if the number of
connections is sufficiently high, these networks contain a core of highly
interconnected vertices. The number of vertices in this core varies in the
range between $const N^{1/2}$ and $const N^{2/3}$, where $N$ is the number of
vertices in a network. At the birth point of the core, we obtain the
size-dependent cut-off of the distribution of the number of connections and
find that its position differs from earlier estimates.
