For a spatial characteristic, there exist commonly fat-tail frequency
distributions of fragment-size and -mass of glass, areas enclosed by city
roads, and pore size/volume in random packings. In order to give a new
analytical approach for the distributions, we consider a simple model which
constructs a fractal-like hierarchical network based on random divisions of
rectangles. The stochastic process makes a Markov chain and corresponds to
directional random walks with splitting into four particles. We derive a
combinatorial analytical form and its continuous approximation for the
distribution of rectangle areas, and numerically show a good fitting with the
actual distribution in the averaging behavior of the divisions.
