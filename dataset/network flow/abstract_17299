Hard X-ray emission is ubiquitous in accreting black holes, both in Galactic
binary systems and in Active Galactic Nuclei. I review the different spectra
which can be seen from these systems, and possible ways of producing this
emission. X-ray reflection should give an observational test of these
scenarios, but we need better models before this can give an unambiguous
diagnostic of the accretion geometry.
