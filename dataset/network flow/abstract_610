A two-dimensional dense fluid of frictional grains is shown to exhibit
time-chaotic, spatially heterogeneous flow in a range of stress values,
$\sigma$, chosen in the unstable region of s-shaped flow curves. Stress
controlled simulations reveal a phase diagram with reentrant stationary flow
for small and large stress $\sigma$. In between no steady flow state can be
reached, instead the system either jams or displays time dependent
heterogeneous strain rates $\dot\gamma({\bf r},t)$. The results of simulations
are in agreement with the stability analysis of a simple hydrodynamic model,
coupling stress and microstructure which we tentatively associate with the
frictional contact network.
