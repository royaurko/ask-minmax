Pandemics have the potential to cause immense disruption and damage to
communities and societies. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model to
determine how the pandemic spread through the world. The model combines the
SEIR-based model for local areas and the network model for global connection
between countries. We simulate the potential pandemic with different origins
and find how the difference of the origin of a pandemic influences the impact
in the world. We investigate the travelers network which is derived from real
data, and simulate 65 countries, and see how the pandemic spread through the
world from different 14 countries as origins of pandemic. We compare the
difference in terms of the impact in countries and the impact in the world. As
a result, the impact in the world increases when pandemic originates from the
United States, India, and China.
