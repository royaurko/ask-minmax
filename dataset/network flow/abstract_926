The increasing penetration of electric vehicles over the coming decades,
taken together with the high cost to upgrade local distribution networks and
consumer demand for home charging, suggest that managing congestion on low
voltage networks will be a crucial component of the electric vehicle revolution
and the move away from fossil fuels in transportation. Here, we model the
max-flow and proportional fairness protocols for the control of congestion
caused by a fleet of vehicles charging on two real-world distribution networks.
We show that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition to a congested
state as a function of the rate of vehicles plugging to the network to charge.
We focus on the order parameter and its fluctuations close to the phase
transition, and show that the critical point depends on the choice of
congestion protocol. Finally, we analyse the inequality in the charging times
as the vehicle arrival rate increases, and show that charging times are
considerably more equitable in proportional fairness than in max-flow.
