We investigate the properties of an autoassociative network of
threshold-linear units whose synaptic connectivity is spatially structured and
asymmetric. Since the methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics cannot be
applied to such a network due to the lack of a Hamiltonian, we approach the
problem through a signal-to-noise analysis, that we adapt to spatially
organized networks. The conditions are analyzed for the appearance of stable,
spatially non-uniform profiles of activity with large overlaps with one of the
stored patterns. It is also shown, with simulations and analytic results, that
the storage capacity does not decrease much when the connectivity of the
network becomes short range. In addition, the method used here enables us to
calculate exactly the storage capacity of a randomly connected network with
arbitrary degree of dilution.
