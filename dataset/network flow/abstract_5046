In this paper we derive consistent shallow water equations for thin films of
power law fluids down an incline. These models account for the streamwise
diffusion of momentum which is important to describe accurately the full
dynamic of the thin film flows when instabilities like roll-waves arise. These
models are validated through a comparison with Orr Sommerfeld equations for
large scale perturbations. We only consider laminar flow for which the boundary
layer issued from the interaction of the flow with the bottom surface has an
influence all over the transverse direction to the flow. In this case the
concept itself of thin film and its relation with long wave asymptotic leads
naturally to flow conditions around a uniform free surface Poiseuille flow. The
apparent viscosity diverges at the free surface which, in turn, introduces a
singularity in the formulation of the Orr-Sommerfeld equations and in the
derivation of shallow water models. We remove this singularity by introducing a
weaker formulation of Cauchy momentum equations. No regularization procedure is
needed nor distinction between shear thinning/thickening cases. Our analysis is
only valid when the flow behavior index $n$ is larger than 1/2 and strongly
suggests that the equations are ill posed if $n<1/2$.
