We demonstrate that "moderate" departures from the no-slip hydrodynamic
boundary condition (hydrodynamic slip lengths in the nanometer range) can
result in a very large enhancement - up to two orders of magnitude- of most
interfacially driven transport phenomena. We study analytically and numerically
the case of neutral solute diffusio-osmosis in a slab geometry to account for
non-trivial couplings between interfacial structure and hydrodynamic slip.
Possible outcomes are fast transport of particles in externally applied or
self-generated gradient, and flow enhancement in nano- or micro-fluidic
geometries.
