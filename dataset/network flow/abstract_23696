We study mesoscopic disorder fluctuations in an anisotropic gap
superconductor, which lead to the spatial variations of the local pairing
temperature and formation of superconducting islands above the mean-field
transition. We derive the probability distribution function of the pairing
temperatures and superconducting gaps. It is shown that above the mean-field
transition, a disordered BCS superconductor with an unusual pairing symmetry is
described by a network of superconducting islands and metallic regions with a
strongly suppressed density of states due to superconducting fluctuations. We
argue that the phenomena associated with mesoscopic disorder fluctuations may
also be relevant to the high-temperature superconductors, in particular, to
recent STM experiments, where gap inhomogeneities have been explicitly
observed. It is suggested that the gap fluctuations in the pseudogap phase
should be directly related to the corresponding fluctuations of the pairing
temperature.
