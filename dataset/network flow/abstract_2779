Due to emerging technology, efficient multitasking approach is highly
demanded. But it is hard to accomplish in heterogeneous wireless networks,
where diverse networks have dissimilar geometric features in service and
traffic models. Multitasking loss examination based on Markov chain becomes
inflexible in these networks owing to rigorous computations is obligatory. This
paper emphases on the performance of heterogeneous wireless networks based on
multitasking. A method based on multitasking of the interrelated traffic is
used to attain an approximate performance in heterogeneous wireless networks
with congested traffic. The accuracy of the robust heterogeneous network with
multitasking is verified by using ns2 simulations.
