We present a measurement noise reduction scheme based on information flow of
a chaotic system. This scheme operates on conditions of chaoticity and
well-defined noise level, not depending on other detailed characteristics of
noise. Starting with a simple map and full knowledge of dynamics, we extend the
basic idea to general form applicable to higher dimensional systems. Reducing
noise in Lorenz system is demonstrated as an example. Inferring dynamics
without a priori knowledge is then discussed by proposing an indicator which
measures predictability.
