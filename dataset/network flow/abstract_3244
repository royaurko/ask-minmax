Elliptic flow of thermal photons has a great potential to explore the early
time dynamics and evolution of Quark Gluon Plasma. $p_T$ dependent temporal
contours for photon spectra and elliptic flow from quark matter and hadronic
phases, as well as the $p_T$ integrated results show gradual build-up of flow
with time and relative contributions from different phases to that very
clearly. Unlike hadrons, photon flow is quite sensitive to the initial
thermalization time $\tau_0$, and its value can be estimated with the
experimental determination of $v_2$.
