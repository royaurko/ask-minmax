Under the Neumann constraints, each equation of the KdV hierarchy is
decomposed into two finite dimensional systems, including the well-known
Neumann model. Like in the case of the Bargmann constraint, the explicit Lax
representations are deduced from the adjoint representation of the auxiliary
spectral problem. It is shown that the Lax operator satisfies the r-matrix
relation in the Dirac bracket. Thus, the integrabilities of these resulting
systems with the Neumann constraints are obtained.
