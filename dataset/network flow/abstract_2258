Methods of modeling cellular regulatory networks as diverse as differential
equations and Boolean networks co-exist, however, without any closer
correspondence to each other. With the example system of the fission yeast cell
cycle control network, we here set the two approaches in relation to each
other. We find that the Boolean network can be formulated as a specific
coarse-grained limit of the more detailed differential network model for this
system. This lays the mathematical foundation on which Boolean networks can be
applied to biological regulatory networks in a controlled way.
