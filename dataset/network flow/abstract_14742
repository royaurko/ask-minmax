This paper introduces an information-based model for the pricing of storable
commodities such as crude oil and natural gas. The model makes use of the
concept of market information about future supply and demand as a basis for
valuation. Physical ownership of a commodity is regarded as providing a stream
of "convenience dividends" equivalent to a continuous cash flow. The market
filtration is assumed to be generated jointly by (i) current and past levels of
the dividend rate, and (ii) partial information concerning the future of the
dividend flow. The price of a commodity is given by the expectation of the
totality of the discounted risk-adjusted future convenience dividend,
conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. In the
situation where the dividend rate is modelled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,
the prices of options on commodities can be derived in closed form, both in the
case when underlying is the spot price, and in the case when underlying is a
futures price. The approach presented can be applied to other assets that can
yield potentially negative effective cash flows, such as real estate,
factories, refineries, mines, and power generating plants.
