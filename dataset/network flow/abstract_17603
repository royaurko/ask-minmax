We study infinite translation surfaces which are Z-covers of compact
translation surfaces. We obtain conditions ensuring that such surfaces have
Veech groups which are Fuchsian of the first kind and give a necessary and
sufficient condition for recurrence of their straight-line flows. Extending
results of Hubert and Schmithusen, we provide examples of infinite
non-arithmetic lattice surfaces, as well as surfaces with infinitely generated
Veech groups.
