By choosing appropriate generators for the Similarity Renormalization Group
(SRG) flow equations, different patterns of decoupling in a Hamiltonian can be
achieved. Sharp and smooth block-diagonal forms of phase-shift equivalent
nucleon-nucleon potentials in momentum space are generated as examples and
compared to analogous low-momentum interactions ("v_lowk").
