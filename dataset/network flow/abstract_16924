In the present paper we propose to describe gene networks in biological
systems using probabilistic algorithms. We describe gene duplication in the
process of biological evolution using introduction of the replica procedure for
probabilistic algorithms. We construct the examples of such a replica procedure
for hidden Markov models. We introduce the family of hidden Markov models where
the set of hidden states is a finite additive group with a p-adic metric and
build the replica procedure for this family of markovian models.
