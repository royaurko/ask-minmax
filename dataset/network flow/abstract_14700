"Acoustic spacetimes", in which techniques of differential geometry are used
to investigate sound propagation in moving fluids, have attracted considerable
attention over the last few decades. Most of the models currently considered in
the literature are based on non-relativistic barotropic irrotational fluids,
defined in a flat Newtonian background. The extension, first to special
relativistic barotropic fluid flow, and then to general relativistic barotropic
fluid flow in an arbitrary background, is less straightforward than it might at
first appear. In this article we provide a pedagogical and simple derivation of
the general relativistic "acoustic spacetime" in an arbitrary (d+1) dimensional
curved-space background.
