A Lie-group based similarity theory is developed for both momentum and energy
distributions in a turbulent pipe flow, leading to asymptotic logarithmic
profiles of mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. Both channel and pipe
data over a wide range of Re yield 0.45 to be the universal Karman constant. A
new spatial invariant characterizing outer dynamics is discovered and validated
by reliable experimental data. The theory predicts the mean velocity profile
(MVP) with 99% accuracy for high Re experimental data (up to 40 millions), and
offers a quantitative explanation for recent observation of logarithmic kinetic
energy distribution by Hullmak et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 094501).
