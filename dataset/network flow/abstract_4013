We present a lattice Boltzmann algorithm for liquid crystal hydrodynamics.
The coupling between the tensor order parameter and the flow is treated
consistently allowing investigation of a wide range of non-Newtonian flow
behavior. We present results for the effect of hydrodynamics on defect
coalescence; of the appearance of the log-rolling and kayaking states in
Poiseuille flow; and for banding and coexistence of isotropic and nematic
phases under shear.
