This paper addresses the problem of finding cycles in the state transition
graphs of synchronous Boolean networks. Synchronous Boolean networks are a
class of deterministic finite state machines which are used for the modeling of
gene regulatory networks. Their state transition graph cycles, called
attractors, represent cell types of the organism being modeled. When the effect
of a disease or a mutation on an organism is studied, attractors have to be
re-computed every time a fault is injected in the model. We present an
algorithm for finding attractors which uses a SAT-based bounded model checking.
Novel features of the algorithm compared to the traditional SAT-based bounded
model checking approaches are: (1) a termination condition which does not
require an explicit computation of the diameter and (2) a technique to reduce
the number of additional clauses which are needed to make paths loop-free. The
presented algorithm uses much less space than existing BDD-based approaches and
has a potential to handle several orders of magnitude larger networks.
