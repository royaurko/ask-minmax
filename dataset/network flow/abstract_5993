The widely-used notion of triadic closure has been conceptualized and
measured in a variety of ways, most famously the clustering coefficient. This
paper proposes a measure of triadic closure in affiliation networks designed to
control for the influence of bicliques. In order to avoid arbitrariness, the
paper introduces a triadic framework for affiliation networks, within which a
range of possible statistics can be considered; it then takes an axiomatic
approach to narrowing this range. The paper conducts an instrumental assessment
of the proposed statistic alongside two previous proposals, for reliability,
validity, and usefulness. Finally, these tools demonstrate their collective
applicability in a multi-perspective investigation into triadic closure in
several empirical social networks.
