Mobile ad hoc networking (MANET) is a growing technology that can support the
operation of adaptive wireless networks. With the increased demand rate of
wireless applications it is useful to have more adaptive and self organizing
technologies that adapt to changes within a network region. In this paper we
initially present a brief listing of table driven ad hoc routing protocols and
eventually analyze in detail the behaviour of demand driven ad hoc routing
protocols like - Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), Dynamic
Source Routing (DSR), Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) in terms of
throughput, traffic dropped, routing traffic and mobility. The output graphs
are eventually discussed, thus enabling us to understand the routing technology
better.
