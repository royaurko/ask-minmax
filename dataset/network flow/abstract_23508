We investigated the properties of mixed states in a sparsely encoded
associative memory model with a structural learning method. When mixed states
are made of s memory patterns, s types of mixed states, which become
equilibrium states of the model, can be generated. To investigate the
properties of s types of the mixed states, we analyzed them using the
statistical mechanical method. We found that the storage capacity of the memory
pattern and the storage capacity of only a particular mixed state diverge at
the sparse limit. We also found that the threshold value needed to recall the
memory pattern is nearly equal to the threshold value needed to recall the
particular mixed state. This means that the memory pattern and the particular
mixed state can be made to easily coexist at the sparse limit. The properties
of the model obtained by the analysis are also useful for constructing a
transform-invariant recognition model.
