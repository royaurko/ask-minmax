A novel method is presented and explored within the framework of Potts neural
networks for solving optimization problems with a non-trivial topology, with
the airline crew scheduling problem as a target application. The key ingredient
to handle the topological complications is a propagator defined in terms of
Potts neurons. The approach is tested on artificial problems generated with two
real-world problems as templates. The results are compared against the
properties of the corresponding unrestricted problems. The latter are subject
to a detailed analysis in a companion paper [LU TP 97-11]. Very good results
are obtained for a variety of problem sizes. The computer time demand for the
approach only grows like (number of flights)^3. A realistic problem typically
is solved within minutes, partly due to a prior reduction of the problem size,
based on an analysis of the local arrival/departure structure at the single
airports.
  To facilitate the reading for audiences not familiar with Potts neurons and
mean field techniques, a brief review is given of recent advances in their
application to resource allocation problems.
