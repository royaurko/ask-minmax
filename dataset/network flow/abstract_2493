A network is said to show assortative mixing if the nodes in the network that
have many connections tend to be connected to other nodes with many
connections. We define a measure of assortative mixing for networks and use it
to show that social networks are often assortatively mixed, but that
technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative. We propose a
model of an assortative network, which we study both analytically and
numerically. Within the framework of this model we find that assortative
networks tend to percolate more easily than their disassortative counterparts
and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.
