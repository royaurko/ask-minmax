We have studied theoretically the flow of superfluid 3He-A in parallel-plate
geometry. The equilibrium order-parameter texture is calculated numerically in
two spatial dimensions consisting of the coordinates along the flow direction
and perpendicular to the plates. The calculations have been done using the
hydrostatic theory in the Ginzburg-Landau region and assuming a large external
magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of calculation. We have studied a
uniform texture and a dipole-unlocked splay soliton as initial configurations.
In the former case we find the Freedericksz transition and a helical
instability with increasing flow. In the latter case we find instability in the
soliton. This instability is closely related to the critical velocity in the
presence of a vortex sheet. Also, the transverse NMR frequency shift at the
soliton has been calculated.
