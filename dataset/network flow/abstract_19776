The phase structure of the bosonized multi-flavor Schwinger model is
investigated by means of the differential renormalization group (RG) method. In
the limit of small fermion mass the linearized RG flow is sufficient to
determine the low-energy behavior of the N-flavor model, if it has been rotated
by a suitable rotation in the internal space. For large fermion mass, the exact
RG flow has been solved numerically. The low-energy behavior of the
multi-flavor model is rather different depending on whether N=1 or N>1, where N
is the number of flavors. For N>1 the reflection symmetry always suffers
breakdown in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, in contrary to the N=1
case, where it remains unbroken in the strong coupling phase.
