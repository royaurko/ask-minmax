Oscillating sharp edges have been employed to achieve rapid and homogeneous
mixing in microchannels using acoustic streaming. Here we use a perturbation
approach to study the flow around oscillating sharp edges in a microchannel.
This work extends prior experimental studies to numerically characterize the
effect of various parameters on the acoustically induced flow. Our numerical
results match well with the experimental results. We investigated multiple
device parameters such as the tip angle, oscillation amplitude, and channel
dimensions. Our results indicate that, due to the inherent nonlinearity of
acoustic streaming, the channel dimensions could significantly impact the flow
patterns and device performance.
