We present an extension of the notion of infinitesimal Lyapunov function to
singular flows, and from this technique we deduce a characterization of
partial/sectional hyperbolic sets. In absence of singularities, we can also
characterize uniform hyperbolicity.
  These conditions can be expressed using the space derivative DX of the vector
field X together with a field of infinitesimal Lyapunov functions only, and are
reduced to checking that a certain symmetric operator is positive definite at
the tangent space of every point of the trapping region.
