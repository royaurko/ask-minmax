We solve a one-dimensional sandpile problem analytically in a thick flow
regime when the pile evolution may be described by a set of linear equations.
We demonstrate that, if an income flow is constant, a space periodicity takes
place while the sandpile evolves even for a pile of only one type of particles.
Hence, grains are piling layer by layer. The thickness of the layers is
proportional to the input flow of particles $r_0$ and coincides with the
thickness of stratified layers in a two-component sandpile problem which were
observed recently. We find that the surface angle $\theta$ of the pile reaches
its final critical value ($\theta_f$) only at long times after a complicated
relaxation process. The deviation ($\theta_f - \theta $) behaves asymptotically
as $(t/r_{0})^{-1/2}$. It appears that the pile evolution depends on initial
conditions. We consider two cases: (i) grains are absent at the initial moment,
and (ii) there is already a pile with a critical slope initially. Although at
long times the behavior appears to be similar in both cases, some differences
are observed for the different initial conditions are observed. We show that
the periodicity disappears if the input flow increases with time.
