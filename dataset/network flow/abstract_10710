Atmospheric flows exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations manifested
as the fractal geometry to the global cloud cover pattern concomitant with
inverse power law form for power spectra of temporal fluctuations on all
space-time scales ranging from turbulence(centimeters-seconds) to
climate(kilometers-years). Long-range spatiotemporal correlations are
ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures of
self-organized criticality. Standard models in meteorological theory cannot
explain satisfactorily the observed self-organized criticality in atmospheric
flows. Mathematical models for simulation and prediction of atmospheric flows
are nonlinear and do not possess analytical solutions. Finite precision
computer realizations of nonlinear models give unrealistic solutions because of
deterministic chaos, a direct consequence of round-off error growth in
iterative numerical computations. Recent studies show that round-off error
doubles on an average for each iteration of iterative computations. Round-off
error propagates to the main stream computation and gives unrealistic solutions
in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models which incorporate
thousands of iterative computations in long-term numerical integration schemes.
An alternative non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for atmospheric
flows described in this paper predicts the observed self-organized criticality
as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics governing flow dynamics.
