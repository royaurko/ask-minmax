Force networks form the skeleton of static granular matter. They are the key
ingredient to mechanical properties, such as stability, elasticity and sound
transmission, which are of utmost importance for civil engineering and
industrial processing. Previous studies have focused on the global structure of
external forces (the boundary condition), and on the probability distribution
of individual contact forces. The disordered spatial structure of the force
network, however, has remained elusive so far. Here we report evidence for
scale invariance of clusters of particles that interact via relatively strong
forces. We analyzed granular packings generated by molecular dynamics
simulations mimicking real granular matter; despite the visual variation, force
networks for various values of the confining pressure and other parameters have
identical scaling exponents and scaling function, and thus determine a
universality class. Remarkably, the flat ensemble of force configurations--a
simple generalization of equilibrium statistical mechanics--belongs to the same
universality class, while some widely studied simplified models do not.
