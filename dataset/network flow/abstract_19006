Pilot contamination problem in massive MIMO networks operating in
time-division duplex (TDD) mode can limit their expected capacity to a great
extent. This paper addresses this problem in cosine modulated multitone (CMT)
based massive MIMO networks; taking advantage of their so-called blind
equalization property. We extend and apply the blind equalization technique
from single antenna case to multi-cellular massive MIMO systems and show that
it can remove the channel estimation errors (due to pilot contamination effect)
without any need for cooperation between different cells or transmission of
additional training information. Our numerical results advocate the efficacy of
the proposed blind technique in improving the channel estimation accuracy and
removal of the residual channel estimation errors caused by the users of the
other cells.
