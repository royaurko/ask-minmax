We classify the periodic Hamiltonian flows on compact four dimensional
symplectic manifolds up to isomorphism of Hamiltonian S^1 spaces. Additionally,
we show that all these spaces are Kaehler, that every such space is obtained
from a simple model by a sequence of symplectic blowups, and that if the fixed
points are isolated then the space is a toric variety.
