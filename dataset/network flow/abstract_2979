We present a systematic numerical study of two-dimensional axisymmetric
accretion flows around black holes. The flows have no radiative cooling and are
treated in the framework of the hydrodynamical approximation. The models
calculated in this study cover the large range of the relevant parameter space.
There are four types of flows, determined by the values of the viscosity
parameter $\alpha$ and the adiabatic index $\gamma$: convective flows,
large-scale circulations, pure inflows and bipolar outflows. Thermal conduction
introduces significant changes to the solutions, but does not create a new flow
type. Convective accretion flows and flows with large-scale circulations have
significant outward-directed energy fluxes, which have important implications
for the spectra and luminosities of accreting black holes.
