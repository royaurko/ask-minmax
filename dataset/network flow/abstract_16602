We have studied the diffusion inside the silica network of sodium atoms
initially located outside the surfaces of an amorphous silica film. We have
focused our attention on structural and dynamical quantities, and we have found
that the local environment of the sodium atoms is close to the local
environment of the sodium atoms inside bulk sodo-silicate glasses obtained by
quench. This is in agreement with recent experimental results.
