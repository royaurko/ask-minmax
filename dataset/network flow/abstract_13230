The melodic consonance of a sequence of tones is explained using the overtone
series: the overtones form "flow lines" that link the tones melodically; the
strength of these flow lines determines the melodic consonance. This hypothesis
admits of psychoacoustical and neurophysiological interpretations that fit well
with the place theory of pitch perception. The hypothesis is used to create a
model for how the auditory system judges melodic consonance, which is used to
algorithmically construct melodic sequences of tones.
