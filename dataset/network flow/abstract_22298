We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the global existence of the
classical solution to the Cauchy problem of the compressible Euler-Poisson
equations with radial symmetry. We introduce a new quantity which describes the
balance between the initial velocity of the flow and the strength of the force
governed by Poisson equation.
