Epidemic forwarding has been proposed as a forwarding technique to achieve
opportunistic communication in Delay Tolerant Networks. Even if this technique
is well known and widely referred, one has to first deal with several practical
problems before using it. In particular, in order to manage the redundancy and
to avoid useless transmissions, it has been proposed to ask nodes to exchange
information about the buffer content prior to sending information. While Bloom
filter has been proposed to transport the buffer content information, up to our
knowledge no real evaluation has been provided to study the tradeoff that
exists in practice. In this paper we describe an implementation of an epidemic
forwarding scheme using Bloom filters. Then we propose some strategies for
Bloom filter management based on windowing and describe implementation
tradeoffs. By simulating our proposed strategies in ns-3 both with random
waypoint mobility and realistic mobility traces coming from San Francisco
taxicabs, we show that our proposed strategies alleviate the challenge of using
epidemic forwarding in DTNs.
