Transmission control protocol (TCP) was originally designed for fixed
networks to provide the reliability of the data delivery. The improvement of
TCP performance was also achieved with different types of networks with
introduction of new TCP variants. However, there are still many factors that
affect performance of TCP. Mobility is one of the major affects on TCP
performance in wireless networks and MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network). To
determine the best TCP variant from mobility point of view, we simulate some
TCP variants in real life scenario. This paper addresses the performance of TCP
variants such as TCP-Tahoe, TCP-Reno, TCP-New Reno, TCPVegas,TCP-SACK and
TCP-Westwood from mobility point of view.The scenarios presented in this paper
are supported by Zone routing Protocol (ZRP) with integration of random
waypoint mobility model in MANET area. The scenario shows the speed of walking
person to a vehicle and suited particularly for mountainous and deserted areas.
On the basis of simulation, we analyze Round trip time (RTT) fairness,
End-to-End delay, control overhead, number of broken links during the delivery
of data. Finally analyzed parameters help to find out the best TCP variant.
