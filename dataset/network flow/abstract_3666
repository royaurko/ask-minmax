Instabilities at interface of two stream granular flows have been reported in
recent experiment [1] that breaking waves can form at the interface between two
streams of identical grains flowing on an inclined plane downstream of a
splitter plate. In this report, the theory of hydrodynamic instability is used
to analyze the shear flow of granular materials. It is shown that the shear
instability in two-stream granular flows actually comes from the competition
between the energy gradients in transverse and streamwise directions as well as
the interaction of two streams. We argue that the flow energy loss in the
streamwise direction has a stabilizing effect, while the transverse component
of the friction force formed by grain surface friction acts as the source of
instabilities. An equation has been derived to characterize the transition
between steady and wavy flows. Good qualitative agreement with the experimental
data is obtained.
