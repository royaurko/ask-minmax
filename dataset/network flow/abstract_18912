Providing network access for multiple users in a visible light communication
(VLC) system that utilizes white light emitting diodes (LED) as sources
requires new networking techniques adapted to the lighting features. In this
paper we introduce two multiple access techniques using expurgated PPM (EPPM)
that can be implemented using LEDs and support lighting features such as
dimming. Multilevel symbols are used to provide M-ary signaling for multiple
users using multilevel EPPM (MEPPM). Using these multiple-access schemes we are
able to control the optical peak to average power ratio (PAPR) in the system,
and hereby control the dimming level. In the first technique, the M-ary data of
each user is first encoded using an optical orthogonal code (OOC) assigned to
the user, and the result is fed into a EPPM encoder to generate a multilevel
signal. The second multiple access method uses sub-sets of the EPPM
constellation to apply MEPPM to the data of each user. While the first approach
has a larger Hamming distance between the symbols of each user, the latter can
provide higher bit-rates for users in VLC systems using bandwidth-limited LEDs.
