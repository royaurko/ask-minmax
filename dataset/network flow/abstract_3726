Cerebrovascular diseases such as brain aneurysms are a primary cause of adult
disability. The flow dynamics in brain arteries, both during periods of rest
and increased activity, are known to be a major factor in the risk of aneurysm
formation and rupture. The precise relation is however still an open field of
investigation. We present an automated ensemble simulation method for modelling
cerebrovascular blood flow under a range of flow regimes. By automatically
constructing and performing an ensemble of multiscale simulations, where we
unidirectionally couple a 1D solver with a 3D lattice-Boltzmann code, we are
able to model the blood flow in a patient artery over a range of flow regimes.
We apply the method to a model of a middle cerebral artery, and find that this
approach helps us to fine-tune our modelling techniques, and opens up new ways
to investigate cerebrovascular flow properties.
