We model the interaction of several radio devices aiming to obtain wireless
connectivity by using a set of base stations (BS) as a non-cooperative game.
Each radio device aims to maximize its own spectral efficiency (SE) in two
different scenarios: First, we let each player to use a unique BS (BS
selection) and second, we let them to simultaneously use several BSs (BS
Sharing). In both cases, we show that the resulting game is an exact potential
game. We found that the BS selection game posses multiple Nash equilibria (NE)
while the BS sharing game posses a unique one. We provide fully decentralized
algorithms which always converge to a NE in both games. We analyze the price of
anarchy and the price of stability for the case of BS selection. Finally, we
observed that depending on the number of transmitters, the BS selection
technique might provide a better global performance (network spectral
efficiency) than BS sharing, which suggests the existence of a Braess type
paradox.
