We calculate the production of large mass dileptons from the jet-dilepton
conversion in the expanding quark-gluon plasma at Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. The jet-dilepton
conversion exceeds the thermal dilepton production and Drell-Yan process in the
large mass region of 3.9 GeV$<M<$5.8 GeV and 6.3 GeV$<M<$8.7 GeV in central
Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV and 5.5 TeV, respectively. We
present the numerical solution of ideal fluid hydrodynamics. We find that the
transverse flow leads to a rapid cooling of the fire ball. The suppression due
to transverse flow is appeared from small to large mass, the transverse flow
effect becomes important at LHC energies. The energy loss of jets in the hot
and dense medium is also included.
