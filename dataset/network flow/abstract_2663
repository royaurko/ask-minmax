We employ detailed numerical simulations to probe the mechanism of flow
reversals in two-dimensional turbulent convection. We show that the reversals
occur via vortex reconnection of two attracting corner rolls having same sign
of vorticity, thus leading to major restructuring of the flow. Large
fluctuations in heat transport are observed during the reversal due to this
flow reconfiguration. The flow configurations during the reversals have been
analyzed quantitatively using large-scale modes. Using these tools, we also
show why flow reversals occur for a restricted range of Rayleigh and Prandt
numbers.
