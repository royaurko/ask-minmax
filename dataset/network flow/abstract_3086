Temporal networks are such networks where nodes and interactions may appear
and disappear at various time scales. With the evidence of ubiquity of temporal
networks in our economy, nature and society, it's urgent and significant to
focus on structural controllability of temporal networks, which nowadays is
still an untouched topic. We develop graphic tools to study the structural
controllability of temporal networks, identifying the intrinsic mechanism of
the ability of individuals in controlling a dynamic and large-scale temporal
network. Classifying temporal trees of a temporal network into different types,
we give (both upper and lower) analytical bounds of the controlling centrality,
which are verified by numerical simulations of both artificial and empirical
temporal networks. We find that the scale-free distribution of node's
controlling centrality is virtually independent of the time scale and types of
datasets, meaning the inherent heterogeneity and robustness of the controlling
centrality of temporal networks.
