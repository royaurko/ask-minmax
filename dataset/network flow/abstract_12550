We apply a machine learning algorithm, the artificial neural network, to the
search for gravitational-wave signals associated with short gamma-ray bursts.
The multi-dimensional samples consisting of data corresponding to the
statistical and physical quantities from the coherent search pipeline are fed
into the artificial neural network to distinguish simulated gravitational-wave
signals from background noise artifacts. Our result shows that the data
classification efficiency at a fixed false alarm probability is improved by the
artificial neural network in comparison to the conventional detection
statistic. Therefore, this algorithm increases the distance at which a
gravitational-wave signal could be observed in coincidence with a gamma-ray
burst. In order to demonstrate the performance, we also evaluate a few seconds
of gravitational-wave data segment using the trained networks and obtain the
false alarm probability. We suggest that the artificial neural network can be a
complementary method to the conventional detection statistic for identifying
gravitational-wave signals related to the short gamma-ray bursts.
