In the recent series of papers (cond-mat/0402471, cond-mat/0403618,
cond-mat/0407618, cond-mat/0501586), Janis and Kolorenc discussed the role of
the diffision poles in the Anderson transition theory. Their picture
contradicts the general principles and is shown below to be completely
misleading. Correct setting of the problem is given and the contemporary
situation is discussed. The critical remarks are given on the relation of the
diffusion coefficient with multifractality of the wave functions.
