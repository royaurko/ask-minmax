This is the third in a series of works devoted to spectral asymptotics for
non-selfadjoint perturbations of selfadjoint $h$-pseudodifferential operators
in dimension 2. We assume that the unperturbed operator has a periodic Hamilton
flow, and study the remaining generic case; when the flow average of the
perturbation has a saddle point
