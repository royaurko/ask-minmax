In this paper we prove that the four-point function of massive
$\vp_4^4$-theory is continuous as a function of its independent external
momenta when posing the renormalization condition for the (physical) mass
on-shell. The proof is based on integral representations derived inductively
from the perturbative flow equations of the renormalization group. It closes a
longstanding loophole in rigorous renormalization theory in so far as it shows
the feasibility of a physical definition of the renormalized coupling.
