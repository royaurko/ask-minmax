We investigate Poisson properties of Postnikov's map from the space of edge
weights of a planar directed network into the Grassmannian. We show that this
map is Poisson if the space of edge weights is equipped with a representative
of a 6-parameter family of universal quadratic Poisson brackets and the
Grasmannian is viewed as a Poisson homogeneous space of the general linear
group equipped with an appropriately chosen R-matrix Poisson-Lie structure. We
also prove that Poisson brackets on the Grassmannian arising in this way are
compatible with the natural cluster algebra structure.
