With the fast development of video and voice network applications, CDN
(Content Distribution Networks) and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) content distribution
technologies have gradually matured. How to effectively use Internet resources
thus has attracted more and more attentions. For the study of resource pricing,
a whole pricing strategy containing pricing models, mechanisms and methods
covers all the related topics. We first introduce three basic Internet resource
pricing models through an Internet cost analysis. Then, with the evolution of
service types, we introduce several corresponding mechanisms which can ensure
pricing implementation and resource allocation. On network resource pricing
methods, we discuss the utility optimization in economics, and emphasize two
classes of pricing methods (including system optimization and entities'
strategic optimizations). Finally, we conclude the paper and forecast the
research direction on pricing strategy which is applicable to novel service
situation in the near future.
