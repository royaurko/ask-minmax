We study the long-range effective drift and diffusivity of a particle in a
random medium moving subject to a given molecular diffusivity and a local
drift. The local drift models the effect of a random electrostatic field on a
neutral but polarizable molecule. Although the electrostatic field is assumed
to obey Gaussian statistics the induced statistics of the drift velocity field
are non-Gaussian.
  We show that a four-loop perturbation theory calculation of the effective
diffusivity is in rather good agreement with the outcome of a numerical
simulation for a reasonable range of the disorder parameter. We also measure
the effective drift in our simulation and confirm the validity of the
``Einstein relation'' that expresses the equality of the renormalization
factors, induced by the random medium, for the effective drift and effective
diffusivity, relative to their molecular values. The Einstein relation has
previously only been confirmed for Gaussian random drift fields. The simulation
result, for our non-Gaussian drift model, is consistent with a previous
theoretical analysis showing the Einstein relation should remain true,
independently of the precise character of the statistics of the drift velocity
field.
