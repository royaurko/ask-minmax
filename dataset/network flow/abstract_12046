We study the transition to phase synchronization in a model for the spread of
infection defined on a small world network. It was shown (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
86} (2001) 2909) that the transition occurs at a finite degree of disorder $p$,
unlike equilibrium models where systems behave as random networks even at
infinitesimal $p$ in the infinite size limit. We examine this system under
variation of a parameter determining the driving rate, and show that the
transition point decreases as we drive the system more slowly. Thus it appears
that the transition moves to $p=0$ in the very slow driving limit, just as in
the equilibrium case.
