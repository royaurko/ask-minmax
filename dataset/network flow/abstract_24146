In this paper, we investigate the problem of nonmyopic (multi-step ahead)
quantizer design for target tracking using a wireless sensor network. Adopting
the alternative conditional posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (A-CPCRLB) as the
optimization metric, we theoretically show that this problem can be temporally
decomposed over a certain time window. Based on sequential Monte-Carlo methods
for tracking, i.e., particle filters, we design the local quantizer adaptively
by solving a particlebased non-linear optimization problem which is well suited
for the use of interior-point algorithm and easily embedded in the filtering
process. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.
