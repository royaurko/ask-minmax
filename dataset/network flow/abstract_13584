We present a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical investigation
of the geometric scaling of the onset of a purely-elastic flow instability in a
serpentine channel. Good qualitative agreement is obtained between experiments,
using dilute solutions of flexible polymers in microfluidic devices, and
two-dimensional numerical simulations using the UCM model. The results are
confirmed by a simple theoretical analysis, based on the dimensionless
criterion proposed by Pakdel-McKinley for onset of a purely-elastic
instability.
