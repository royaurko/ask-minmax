The interfirm buyer-seller network is important from both macroeconomic and
microeconomic perspectives. From a macroeconomic perspective, this network
represents a form of interconnectedness that allows firm-level idiosyncratic
shocks to be propagated to other firms. This propagation mechanism interferes
with the averaging out process of shocks, having a possible impact on aggregate
fluctuation. From a microeconomic perspective, the interfirm buyer-seller
network is a result of a firm's strategic link renewal processes. There has
been substantial research that models strategic link formation processes, but
the economy-wide consequences of such strategic behaviors are not clear. We
address these two questions using a unique dataset for the Japanese interfirm
buyer-seller network. We take a structural equation modeling, and show that a
large proportion of fluctuation in the average log growth rate of firms can be
explained by the network and that link renewal by firms decreases the standard
deviation of the log growth rate.
