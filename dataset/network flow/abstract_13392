Within the "Cosmic Flows" project, I-band photometry of 524 relatively nearby
galaxies has been carried out over the course of several years with the
University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope and a camera with a 7.5 arcmin field of
view. The primary scientific purpose was to provide global magnitudes and
inclinations for galaxies for the purpose of measuring distances through the
correlation between galaxy luminosities and rotation rates. The accuracy on a
total magnitude is 0.08 mag. The observations typically extend to 7-8
exponential disk scalelengths so the data are useful for studies of the
structural properties of galaxies.
