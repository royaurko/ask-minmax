We critically discuss the concept of ``synchronized flow'' from a historical,
empirical, and theoretical perspective. Problems related to the measurement of
vehicle data are highlighted, and questionable interpretations are identified.
Moreover, we propose a quantitative and consistent theory of the empirical
findings based on a phase diagram of congested traffic states, which is
universal for all conventional traffic models having the same instability
diagram and a fundamental diagram. New empirical and simulation data supporting
this approach are presented as well. We also give a short overview of the
various phenomena observed in panicking pedestrian crowds relevant from the
point of evacuation of buildings, ships, and stadia. Some of these can be
applied to the optimization of production processes, e.g. the
``slower-is-faster effect''.
