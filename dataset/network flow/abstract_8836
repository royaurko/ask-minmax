We consider strictly convex hypersurfaces which are evolving by the
non-parametric logarithmic Gauss curvature flow subject to a Neumann boundary
condition. Solutions are shown to converge smoothly to hypersurfaces moving by
translation. In particular, for bounded domains we prove that convex functions
with prescribed normal derivative satisfy a uniform oscillation estimate.
