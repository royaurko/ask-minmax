We apply signal processing analysis to the information spreading in
scale-free network. To reproduce typical behaviors obtained from the analysis
of information spreading in the world wide web we use a modified SIS model
where synergy effects and influential nodes are taken into account. This model
depends on a single free parameter that characterize the memory-time of the
spreading process. We show that by means of fractal analysis it is possible
-from aggregated easily accessible data- to gain information on the memory time
of the underlying mechanism driving the information spreading process.
