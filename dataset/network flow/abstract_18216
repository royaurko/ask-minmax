Background: Recent models of genome-proteome evolution have shown that some
of the key traits displayed by the global structure of cellular networks might
be a natural result of a duplication-diversification (DD) process. One of the
consequences of such evolution is the emergence of a small world architecture
together with a scale-free distribution of interactions. Here we show that the
domain of parameter space were such structure emerges is related to a phase
transition phenomenon. At this transition point, modular architecture
spontaneously emerges as a byproduct of the DD process.
  Results: Although the DD models lack any functionality and are thus free from
meeting functional constraints, they show the observed features displayed by
the real proteome maps when tuned close to a sharp transition point separating
a highly connected graph from a disconnected system. Close to such boundary,
the maps are shown to display scale-free hierarchical organization, behave as
small worlds and exhibit modularity.
  Conclusions: It is conjectured that natural selection tuned the average
connectivity in such a way that the network reaches a sparse graph of
connections. One consequence of such scenario is that the scaling laws and the
essential ingredients for building a modular net emerge for free close to such
transition.
