Nosocomial infection raises a serious public health problem, as implied by
the existence of pathogens characteristic to healthcare and hospital-mediated
outbreaks of influenza and SARS. We simulate stochastic SIR dynamics on social
networks, which are based on observations in a hospital in Tokyo, to explore
effective containment strategies against nosocomial infection. The observed
networks have hierarchical and modular structure. We show that healthcare
workers, particularly medical doctors, are main vectors of diseases on these
networks. Intervention methods that restrict interaction between medical
doctors and their visits to different wards shrink the final epidemic size more
than intervention methods that directly protect patients, such as isolating
patients in single rooms. By the same token, vaccinating doctors with priority
rather than patients or nurses is more effective. Finally, vaccinating
individuals with large betweenness centrality is superior to vaccinating ones
with large connectedness to others or randomly chosen individuals, as suggested
by previous model studies. [The abstract of the manuscript has more
