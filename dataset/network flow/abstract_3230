Elliptic flow at RHIC is computed event-by-event with NeXSPheRIO. We show
that when symmetry of the particle distribution in relation to the reaction
plane is assumed, as usually done in the experimental extraction of elliptic
flow, there is a disagreement between the true and reconstructed elliptic flows
(15-30% for $\eta$=0, 30% for $p_\perp$=0.5 GeV). We suggest a possible way to
take into account the asymmetry and get good agreement between these elliptic
flows.
