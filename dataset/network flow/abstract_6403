We develop a sequence of models describing information transmission and
decision dynamics for a network of individual agents subject to multiple
sources of influence. Our general framework is set in the context of an
impending natural disaster, where individuals, represented by nodes on the
network, must decide whether or not to evacuate. Sources of influence include a
one-to-many externally driven global broadcast as well as pairwise
interactions, across links in the network, in which agents transmit either
continuous opinions or binary actions. We consider both uniform and variable
threshold rules on the individual opinion as baseline models for
decision-making. Our results indicate that 1) social networks lead to
clustering and cohesive action among individuals, 2) binary information
introduces high temporal variability and stagnation, and 3) information
transmission over the network can either facilitate or hinder action adoption,
depending on the influence of the global broadcast relative to the social
network. Our framework highlights the essential role of local interactions
between agents in predicting collective behavior of the population as a whole.
