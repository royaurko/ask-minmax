Stock prices are observed to be random walks in time despite a strong, long
term memory in the signs of trades (buys or sells). Lillo and Farmer have
recently suggested that these correlations are compensated by opposite long
ranged fluctuations in liquidity, with an otherwise permanent market impact,
challenging the scenario proposed in Quantitative Finance 4, 176 (2004), where
the impact is *transient*, with a power-law decay in time. The exponent of this
decay is precisely tuned to a critical value, ensuring simultaneously that
prices are diffusive on long time scales and that the response function is
nearly constant. We provide new analysis of empirical data that confirm and
make more precise our previous claims. We show that the power-law decay of the
bare impact function comes both from an excess flow of limit order opposite to
the market order flow, and to a systematic anti-correlation of the bid-ask
motion between trades, two effects that create a `liquidity molasses' which
dampens market volatility.
