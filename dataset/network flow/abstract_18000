We study stable matching problems with locality of information and control.
In our model, each player is a node in a fixed network and strives to be
matched to another player. A player has a complete preference list over all
other players it can be matched with. Players can match arbitrarily, and they
learn about possible partners dynamically based on their current neighborhood.
We consider convergence of dynamics to locally stable matchings -- states that
are stable with respect to their imposed information structure in the network.
In the two-sided case of stable marriage in which existence is guaranteed, we
show that reachability becomes NP-hard to decide. This holds even when the
network exists only among one partition of players. In contrast, if one
partition has no network and players remember a previous match every round,
reachability is guaranteed and random dynamics converge with probability 1. We
characterize this positive result in various ways. For instance, it holds for
random memory and for cache memory with the most recent partner, but not for
cache memory with the best partner. Also, it is crucial which partition of the
players has memory. Finally, we present a variety of results for centralized
computation of locally stable matchings, e.g., computing maximum locally stable
matchings in the two-sided case and deciding and characterizing existence in
the general roommates case.
