The importance of wireless communication is increasing day by day throughout
the world due to cellular and broadband technologies. Everyone around the world
would like to be connected seamlessly anytime anywhere through the best
network. The 4G wireless system must have the capability to provide high data
transfer rates, quality of services and seamless mobility. In 4G, there are a
large variety of heterogeneous networks. The users for variety of applications
would like to utilize heterogeneous networks on the basis of their preferences
such as real time, high availability and high bandwidth. When connections have
to switch between heterogeneous networks for performance and high availability
reasons, seamless vertical handoff is necessary. The requirements like
capability of the network, handoff latency, network cost, network conditions,
power consumption and user's preferences must be taken into consideration
during vertical handoff. In this paper, we have extracted the requirements of a
vertical handoff from the literature surveyed. The evaluation of the existing
work is also being done on the basis of required parameters for vertical
handoff. A sophisticated, adaptive and intelligent approach is required to
implement the vertical handoff mechanism in 4G wireless networks to produce an
effective service for the user by considering dynamic and non dynamic
parameters.
