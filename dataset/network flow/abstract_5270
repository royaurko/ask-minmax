We combine non-hydrostatic flow simulations of the free surface with a
discharge model based on elementary gate flow equations for decision support in
operation of hydraulic structure gates. A water level-based gate control used
in most of today's general practice does not take into account the fact that
gate operation scenarios producing similar total discharged volumes and similar
water levels may have different local flow characteristics. Accurate and timely
prediction of local flow conditions around hydraulic gates is important for
several aspects of structure management: ecology, scour, flow-induced gate
vibrations and waterway navigation. The modelling approach is described and
tested for a multi-gate sluice structure regulating discharge from a river to
the sea. The number of opened gates is varied and the discharge is stabilized
with automated control by varying gate openings. The free-surface model was
validated for discharge showing a correlation coefficient of 0.994 compared to
experimental data. Additionally, we show the analysis of CFD results for
evaluating bed stability and gate vibrations.
