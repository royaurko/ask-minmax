We prove quantitative estimates for flows of vector fields subject to
anisotropic regularity conditions: some derivatives of some components are
(singular integrals of) measures, while the remaining derivatives are (singular
integrals of) integrable functions. This is motivated by the regularity of the
vector field in the Vlasov-Poisson equation with measure density. The proof
exploits an anisotropic variant of the argument of Crippa and De Lellis and
suitable estimates for the difference quotients in such anisotropic context. In
contrast to regularization methods, this approach gives quantitative estimates
in terms of the given regularity bounds. From such estimates it is possible to
recover the well posedness for the ordinary differential equation and for
Lagrangian solutions to the continuity and transport equations.
