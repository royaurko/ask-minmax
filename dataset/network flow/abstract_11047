Cayley graph techniques are introduced for the problem of constructing
networks having the maximum possible number of nodes, among networks that
satisfy prescribed bounds on the parameters maximum node degree and broadcast
diameter. The broadcast diameter of a network is the maximum time required for
a message originating at a node of the network to be relayed to all other
nodes, under the restriction that in a single time step any node can
communicate with only one neighboring node. For many parameter values these
algebraic methods yield the largest known constructions, improving on previous
graph-theoretic approaches. It has previously been shown that hypercubes are
optimal for degree $k$ and broadcast diameter $k$. A construction employing
dihedral groups is shown to be optimal for degree $k$ and broadcast diameter
$k+1$.
