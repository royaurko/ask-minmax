We prove that for any topological space $X$ of countable tightness, each
\sigma-convex subspace $\F$ of the space $SC_p(X)$ of scatteredly continuous
real-valued functions on $X$ has network weight $nw(\F)\le nw(X)$. This implies
that for a metrizable separable space $X$, each compact convex subset in the
function space $SC_p(X)$ is metrizable. Another corollary says that two
Tychonoff spaces $X,Y$ with countable tightness and topologically isomorphic
linear topological spaces $SC_p(X)$ and $SC_p(Y)$ have the same network weight
$nw(X)=nw(Y)$. Also we prove that each zero-dimensional separable Rosenthal
compact space is homeomorphic to a compact subset of the function space
$SC_p(\omega^\omega)$ over the space $\omega^\omega$ of irrationals.
