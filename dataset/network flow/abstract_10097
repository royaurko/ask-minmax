The Chern-Simons level k of ABJM gauge theory captures the orbifolding in the
dual geometry. This suggests that if we move the membranes away from the tip of
the orbifold to a smooth point, it should trigger an RG flow that changes the
level to k=1 in the IR. We construct an explicit supergravity solution that is
dual to this shift from generic k to k=1. In the gauge theory side, we present
arguments for why this shift is plausible at the end of the RG flow. We also
consider a resolution of the orbifold for the case k=4 (where explicit metrics
can be found), and construct the smooth supergravity solution that interpolates
between AdS4 X S7/Z4 and AdS4 X S7, corresponding to localized branes on the
blown up six cycle. In the gauge theory, we make some comments about the
dimension four operator dual to the resolution as well as the associated RG
flow.
