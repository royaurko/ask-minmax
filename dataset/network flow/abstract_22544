High density arrays of artificial hair sensors, biomimicking the extremely
sensitive mechanoreceptive filiform hairs found on cerci of crickets have been
fabricated successfully. We assess the sensitivity of these artificial sensors
and present a scheme for further optimization addressing the deteriorating
effects of stress in the structures. We show that, by removing a portion of
chromium electrodes close to the torsional beams, the upward lift at the edges
of the membrane due to the stress, will decrease hence increase the
sensitivity.
