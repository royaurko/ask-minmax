We study $O(d)$-equivariant polyharmonic maps and their associated heat
flows, paying particular attention to the (energy-)critical biharmonic case. We
are mainly interested in blowup phenomena for the higher-order flows. Such
results have been hard to prove, due to the inapplicability of the maximum
principle to these cases. Our main result proves that blowup occurs in the
biharmonic map heat flow from $B^4(0, 1)$ into $S^4$. To our knowledge, this
was the first example of blowup in the higher-order polyharmonic map heat
flows. We present Mathematica code for computing our symmetry reduction for the
polyharmonic map heat flow of any order. This code is then used to explicitly
compute our symmetry reduction for the biharmonic case. Next, the possible
$O(4)$-equivariant biharmonic maps from $\mathbf{R}^4$ into $S^4$ are
classified. Finally, we show that there exists, in contrast to the harmonic map
analogue, equivariant biharmonic maps from $B^4(0,1)$ into $S^4$ that wind
around $S^4$ as many times as we wish. We believe that the ideas developed
herein could be useful in the study of other higher-order parabolic equations.
