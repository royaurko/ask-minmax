The aim of this work is to prove $C^1$ weak Palis conjecture for nonsingular
flows. Weak Palis conjecture claims that a generic vector field either is
Morse-Smale or exhibits horseshoes. Central model is come up with by Crovisier
to obtain homoclinic intersection for diffeomorphisms. We adapt his method for
nonsingular flows.
