We show that the competition between interactions on different length scales,
as relevant for the formation of stripes in doped Mott insulators, can cause a
glass transition in a system with no explicitly quenched disorder. We
analytically determine a universal criterion for the emergence of an
exponentially large number of metastable configurations that leads to a finite
configurational entropy and a landscape dominated viscous flow. We demonstrate
that glassines is unambiguously tied to a new length scale which characterizes
the typical length over which defects and imperfections in the stripe pattern
are allowed to wander over long times.
