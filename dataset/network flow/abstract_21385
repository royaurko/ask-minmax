The theory of magnetically accelerated outflows and jets from accretion disks
is reviewed at an introductory level, with special attention to problem areas
like the launching conditions of the flow at the disk surface, stability of the
magnetic field, and collimation mechanisms. This text will appear in R.A.M.J.
