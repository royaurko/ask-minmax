A general lattice Boltzmann method for simulation of fluids with tailored
transport coefficients is presented. It is based on the recently introduced
quasi-equilibrium kinetic models, and a general lattice Boltzmann
implementation is developed. Lattice Boltzmann models for isothermal binary
mixtures with a given Schmidt number, and for a weakly compressible flow with a
given Prandtl number are derived and validated.
