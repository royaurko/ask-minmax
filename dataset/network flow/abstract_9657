Mobile media has undoubtedly become the predominant source of traffic in
wireless networks. The result is not only congestion and poor
Quality-of-Experience, but also an unprecedented energy drain at both the
network and user devices. In order to sustain this continued growth, novel
disruptive paradigms of media delivery are urgently needed. We envision that
two key contemporary advancements can be leveraged to develop greener media
delivery platforms: 1) the proliferation of navigation hardware and software in
mobile devices has created an era of location-awareness, where both the current
and future user locations can be predicted; and 2) the rise of context-aware
network architectures and self-organizing functionalities is enabling context
signaling and in-network adaptation. With these developments in mind, this
article investigates the opportunities of exploiting location-awareness to
enable green end-to-end media delivery. In particular, we discuss and propose
approaches for location-based adaptive video quality planning, in-network
caching, content prefetching, and long-term radio resource management. To
provide insights on the energy savings, we then present a cross-layer framework
that jointly optimizes resource allocation and multi-user video quality using
location predictions. Finally, we highlight some of the future research
directions for location-aware media delivery in the conclusion.
