The process algebra HYPE was recently proposed as a fine-grained modelling
approach for capturing the behaviour of hybrid systems. In the original
proposal, each flow or influence affecting a variable is modelled separately
and the overall behaviour of the system then emerges as the composition of
these flows. The discrete behaviour of the system is captured by instantaneous
actions which might be urgent, taking effect as soon as some activation
condition is satisfied, or non-urgent meaning that they can tolerate some
(unknown) delay before happening. In this paper we refine the notion of
non-urgent actions, to make such actions governed by a probability
distribution. As a consequence of this we now give HYPE a semantics in terms of
Transition-Driven Stochastic Hybrid Automata, which are a subset of a general
class of stochastic processes termed Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes.
