We consider random non-directed networks subject to dynamics conserving
vertex degrees and study analytically and numerically equilibrium three-vertex
motif distributions in the presence of an external field, $h$, coupled to one
of the motifs. For small $h$ the numerics is well described by the "chemical
kinetics" for the concentrations of motifs based on the law of mass action. For
larger $h$ a transition into some trapped motif state occurs in
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. We explain the existence of the transition by
employing the notion of the entropy of the motif distribution and describe it
in terms of a phenomenological Landau-type theory with a non-zero cubic term. A
localization transition should always occur if the entropy function is
non-convex. We conjecture that this phenomenon is the origin of the motifs'
pattern formation in real evolutionary networks.
