With the phenomenal growth in the Internet, network security has become an
integral part of computer and information security. In order to come up with
measures that make networks more secure, it is important to learn about the
vulnerabilities that could exist in a computer network and then have an
understanding of the typical attacks that have been carried out in such
networks. The first half of this paper will expose the readers to the classical
network attacks that have exploited the typical vulnerabilities of computer
networks in the past and solutions that have been adopted since then to prevent
or reduce the chances of some of these attacks. The second half of the paper
will expose the readers to the different network security controls including
the network architecture, protocols, standards and software/ hardware tools
that have been adopted in modern day computer networks.
