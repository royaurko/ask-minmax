A new ion guide has been modeled and tested for the production of a low
energy ($\approx$ 40 kV) ion beam of daughter products of alpha-emitting
isotopes. The guide is designed to evacuate daughter recoils originating from
the $\alpha$-decay of a $^{233}$U source. The source is electroplated onto
stainless steel strips and mounted along the inner walls of an ion guide
chamber. A combination of electric fields and helium gas flow transport the
ions through an exit hole for injection into a mass separator. Ion guide
efficiencies for the extraction of $^{229}$Th$^{+}$ (0.06%), $^{221}$Fr$^{+}$
(6%), and $^{217}$At$^{+}$ (6%) beams have been measured. A detailed study of
the electric field and gas flow influence on the ion guide efficiency is
described for two differing electric field configurations.
