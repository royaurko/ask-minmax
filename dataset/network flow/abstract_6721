In many scientific fields, the order of cocontributors on a paper conveys
information about each individual's contribution to a piece of joint work. We
argue that in prior network analyses of cocontributorship networks, the information
on ordering has been insufficiently considered because ties between contributors are
typically symmetrized. This is basically the same as assuming that each
co-contributor has contributed equally to a paper. We introduce a solution to this
problem by adopting a cocontributorship credit allocation model proposed by Kim and
Diesner (2014), which in its core conceptualizes co-contributoring as a directed,
weighted, and self-looped network. We test and validate our application of the
adopted framework based on a sample data of 861 contributors who have published in
the journal Psychometrika. Results suggest that this novel sociometric approach
can complement traditional measures based on undirected networks and expand
insights into cocontributoring patterns such as the hierarchy of collaboration among
scholars. As another form of validation, we also show how our approach
accurately detects prominent scholars in the Psychometric Society affiliated
with the journal.
