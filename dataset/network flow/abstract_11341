In this paper, we focus on two-dimensional connectivity in sparse vehicular
ad hoc networks (VANETs). In this respect, we find thresholds for the arrival
rates of vehicles at entrances of a block of streets such that the connectivity
is guaranteed for any desired probability. To this end, we exploit a mobility
model recently proposed for sparse VANETs, based on BCMP open queuing networks
and solve the related traffic equations to find the traffic characteristics of
each street and use the results to compute the exact probability of
connectivity along these streets. Then, we use the results from percolation
theory and the proposed fast algorithms for evaluation of bond percolation
problem in a random graph corresponding to the block of the streets. We then
find sufficiently accurate two dimensional connectivity-related parameters,
such as the average number of intersections connected to each other and the
size of the largest set of inter-connected intersections. We have also proposed
lower bounds for the case of heterogeneous network with two transmission
ranges. In the last part of the paper, we apply our method to several numerical
examples and confirm our results by simulations.
