A visualization of three-dimensional incompressible flows by divergence-free
quasi-two-dimensional projections of the velocity field on three coordinate
planes was recently proposed. The projections were calculated using
divergence-free Galerkin bases, which resulted in the whole procedure being
complicated and CPU-time consuming. Here we propose an alternative way based on
the Chorin projection combined with a SIMPLE-like iteration. The approach
proposed is much easier in realization, allows for faster computations, and can
be generalized for arbitrary curvilinear orthogonal coordinates. To illustrate
the visualization method, examples of flow visualization in cylindrical and
spherical coordinates, as well as post-processing of experimental 3D-PTV data
are presented.
