Qualitative probabilistic networks have been designed for probabilistic
reasoning in a qualitative way. Due to their coarse level of representation
detail, qualitative probabilistic networks do not provide for resolving
trade-offs and typically yield ambiguous results upon inference. We present an
algorithm for computing more insightful results for unresolved trade-offs. The
algorithm builds upon the idea of using pivots to zoom in on the trade-offs and
identifying the information that would serve to resolve them.
