A generic communication model of a boolean network with transmission errors
is proposed to explore the power-law scaling of states' evolution in
small-world networks. In the model, the power spectrum of the population
difference between agents with "1" and "-1" exhibits a power-law tail:
$P(f)\sim f^{-\alpha}$. The exponent $\alpha$ does not depend explicitly on the
error rate but on the structure of the networks. Error rate enters only into
the frequency scales and thus governs the frequency range over which these
power laws can be observed. On the other hand, the exponent $\alpha$ reveals
the intricate internal structure of networks and can serve as a structure
factor to classify complex networks. The finite transmission error is shown to
provide a mechanism for the common occurrence of the power-law relation in
complex systems, such as financial markets and opinion formation.
