We present a procedure to generate bipartite grids for simply connected
domains in 2-D and 3-D of prescribed size and controlled regularity elements.
The mesh elements $K$ of the triangulation satisfy $\zeta_{K} \leq C$ where
$\zeta_{K}$ is the regularity and $C$ is a constant depending on the shape
parameters of the initial mesh. Bipartite grids permit a well-posed mixed-mixed
variational formulation of problems such as the porous media flow equation and
other linear physical phenomena as well as Galerkin-type discontinuous
relaxations.
