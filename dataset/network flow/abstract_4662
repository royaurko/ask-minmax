We investigate the ergodicity of 2D large scale quasigeostrophic flows under
random wind forcing. We show that the quasigeostrophic flows are ergodic under
suitable conditions on the random forcing and on the fluid domain, and under no
restrictions on viscosity, Ekman constant or Coriolis parameter. When these
conditions are satisfied, then for any observable of the quasigeostrophic
flows, its time average approximates the statistical ensemble average, as long
as the time interval is sufficiently long.
