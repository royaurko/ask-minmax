Recent advances in the development of the low-cost, power-efficient embedded
devices, coupled with the rising need for support of new information processing
paradigms such as smart spaces and military surveillance systems, have led to
active research in large-scale, highly distributed sensor networks of small,
wireless, low-power, unattended sensors and actuators. While applications keep
diversifying, one common property they share is the need for an efficient
network architecture tailored towards information retrieval in sensor networks.
Previous solutions designed for traditional networks serve as good references;
however, due to the vast differences between previous paradigms and needs of
sensor networks, a framework is required to gather and impart only the required
information .To achieve this goal in this paper we have proposed a framework
for intelligent information retrieval and dissemination to desired destination
node. The proposed frame work combines three major concern areas in WSNs i.e.
data aggregation, information retrieval and data dissemination in a single
scenario. In the proposed framework data aggregation is responsible for
combining information from all nodes and removing the redundant data.
Information retrieval filters the processed data to obtain final information
termed as intelligent data to be disseminated to the required destination node.
