We propose a novel generalized cellular automaton(GCA) model for
discrete-time pulse-coupled oscillators and study the emergence of synchrony.
Given a finite simple graph and an integer $n\ge 3$, each vertex is an
identical oscillator of period $n$ with the following weak coupling along the
edges: each oscillator inhibits its phase update if it has at least one
neighboring oscillator at a particular "blinking" state and if its state is
ahead of this blinking state. We obtain conditions on initial configurations
and on network topologies for which states of all vertices eventually
synchronize. We show that our GCA model synchronizes arbitrary initial
configurations on paths, trees, and with random perturbation, any connected
graph. In particular, our main result is the following local-global principle
for tree networks: for $n\in \{3,4,5,6\}$, any $n$-periodic network on a tree
synchronizes arbitrary initial configuration if and only if the maximum degree
of the tree is less than the period $n$.
