A Boolean network model of the cell-cycle regulatory network of fission yeast
(Schizosaccharomyces Pombe) is constructed solely on the basis of the known
biochemical interaction topology. Simulating the model in the computer,
faithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along
the cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation
models, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory
circuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological
dynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the
biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state
space, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive
trajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of
the corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in
circuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a
strongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network
represents an auto-excited system with external damping.
