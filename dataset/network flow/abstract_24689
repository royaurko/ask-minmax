This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless power and information
transfer (SWPIT) for network-coded two-way re- lay transmission from an
information theoretical viewpoint, where two sources exchange information via
an energy har- vesting relay. By considering the time switching (TS) relay
receiver architecture, we present the TS-based two-way re- laying (TS-TWR)
protocol. In order to explore the system throughput limit with data rate
fairness, we formulate an op- timization problem under total power constraint.
To solve the problem, we first derive some explicit results and then de- sign
an efficient algorithm. Numerical results show that with the same total
available power, TS-TWR has a certain per- formance loss compared with
conventional non-EH two-way relaying due to the path loss effect on energy
transfer, where in relatively low and relatively high SNR regimes, the perfor-
mance losses are relatively small.
