Geographic routing with greedy relaying strategies have been widely studied
as a routing scheme in sensor networks. These schemes assume that the nodes
have perfect information about the location of the destination. When the
distance between the source and destination is normalized to unity, the
asymptotic routing delays in these schemes are $\Theta(\frac{1}{M(n)}),$ where
M(n) is the maximum distance traveled in a single hop (transmission range of a
radio). In this paper, we consider routing scenarios where nodes have location
errors (imprecise GPS), or where only coarse geographic information about the
destination is available, and only a fraction of the nodes have routing
information. We show that even with such imprecise or limited
destination-location information, the routing delays are
$\Theta(\frac{1}{M(n)})$. We also consider the throughput-capacity of networks
with progressive routing strategies that take packets closer to the destination
in every step, but not necessarily along a straight-line. We show that the
throughput-capacity with progressive routing is order-wise the same as the
maximum achievable throughput-capacity.
