We prove that a sequence of semi-discrete approximations converges to a
multiplicative functional for reflected Brownian motion, which intuitively
represents the Lyapunov exponent for the corresponding stochastic flow. The
method of proof is based on a study of the deterministic version of the problem
and the excursion theory.
