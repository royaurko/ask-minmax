We consider the linear transport equation with a globally Holder continuous
and bounded vector field. While this deterministic PDE may not be well-posed,
we prove that a multiplicative stochastic perturbation of Brownian type is
enough to render the equation well-posed. This seems to be the first explicit
example of partial differential equation that become well-posed under the
influece of noise. The key tool is a differentiable stochastic flow constructed
and analysed by means of a special transformation of the drift of Ito-Tanaka
type.
