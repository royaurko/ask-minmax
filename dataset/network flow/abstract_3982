In the near future, the delivery of multimedia multicast services over
next-generation networks is likely to become one of the main pillars of future
cellular networks. In this extended abstract, we address the issue of
efficiently multicasting layered video services by defining a novel
optimization paradigm that is based on an Unequal Error Protection
implementation of Random Linear Network Coding, and aims to ensure target
service coverages by using a limited amount of radio resources.
