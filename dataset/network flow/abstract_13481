Extending the results obtained in the case $N$ odd, the effect of slightly
relevant perturbations of the second parafermionic field theory with the
symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$, for $N$ even, are studied. The renormalization group
equations, and their infra red fixed points exhibit the same structure in both
cases. In addition to the standard flow from the $p$-th to the $(p-2)$-th
model, another fixed point corresponding to the $(p-1)$-th model is found.
