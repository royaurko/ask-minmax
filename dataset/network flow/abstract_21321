We propose and analyze centralized and distributed algorithms for
device-to-device video scheduling and streaming. The proposed algorithms
address jointly the problems of device-to-device link scheduling and video
quality adaptation in streaming. Our simulations show that the proposed
algorithms significantly outperform conventional separated approaches that
treat these two problems independently.
