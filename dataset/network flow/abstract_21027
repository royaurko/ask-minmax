The kinetic roughening of a driven interface between three dimensional
spin-up and spin-down domains in a model with non-conserved scalar order
parameter and quenched disorder is studied numerically within a discrete time
dynamics at zero temperature. The exponents characterizing the morphology of
the interface are obtained close to the depinning-transition
