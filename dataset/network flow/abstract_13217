It is shown that dynamics of the interface between ideal fluid and light
viscous fluid is exactly integrable in the approximation of small surface
slopes for two-dimensional flow. Stokes flow of viscous fluid provides a
relation between normal velocity and pressure at interface. Surface elevation
and velocity potential of ideal fluid are determined from two complex Burgers
equations corresponding to analytical continuation of velocity potential at the
interface into upper and lower complex half planes, respectively. The interface
loses its smoothness if complex singularities (poles) reach the interface.
