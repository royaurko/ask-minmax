In Wireless Sensor Network, sensor nodes life time is the most critical
parameter. Many researches on these lifetime extension are motivated by LEACH
scheme, which by allowing rotation of cluster head role among the sensor nodes
tries to distribute the energy consumption over all nodes in the network.
Selection of clusterhead for such rotation greatly affects the energy
efficiency of the network. Different communication protocols and algorithms are
investigated to find ways to reduce power consumption. In this paper brief
survey is taken from many proposals, which suggests different clusterhead
selection strategies and a global view is presented. Comparison of their costs
of clusterhead selection in different rounds, transmission method and other
effects like cluster formation, distribution of clusterheads and creation of
clusters shows a need of a combined strategy for better results.
