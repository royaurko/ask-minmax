A multiscale approach for fluid flow is developed that retains an atomistic
description in key regions. The method is applied to a classic problem where
all scales contribute: The force on a moving wall bounding a fluid-filled
cavity. Continuum equations predict an infinite force due to stress
singularities. Following the stress over more than six decades in length in
systems with characteristic scales of millimeters and milliseconds allows us to
resolve the singularities and determine the force for the first time. The
speedup over pure atomistic calculations is more than fourteen orders of
magnitude. We find a universal dependence on the macroscopic Reynolds number,
and large atomistic effects that depend on wall velocity and interactions.
