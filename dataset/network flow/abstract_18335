Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a new transport layer protocol
that is due to replace TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User
Datagram Protocol) protocols in future IP networks. Currently, it is
implemented in such operating systems like BSD, Linux, HP-UX or Sun Solaris. It
is also supported in Cisco network devices operating system (Cisco IOS) and may
be used in Windows. This paper describes potential steganographic methods that
may be applied to SCTP and may pose a threat to network security. Proposed
methods utilize new, characteristic SCTP features like multi-homing and
multistreaming. Identified new threats and suggested countermeasures may be
used as a supplement to RFC 5062, which describes security attacks in SCTP
protocol and can induce further standard modifications.
