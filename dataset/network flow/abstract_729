Many empirical networks display an inherent tendency to cluster, i.e. to form
circles of connected nodes. This feature is typically measured by the
clustering coefficient (CC). The CC, originally introduced for binary,
undirected graphs, has been recently generalized to weighted, undirected
networks. Here we extend the CC to the case of (binary and weighted) directed
networks and we compute its expected value for random graphs. We distinguish
between CCs that count all directed triangles in the graph (independently of
the direction of their edges) and CCs that only consider particular types of
directed triangles (e.g., cycles). The main concepts are illustrated by
employing empirical data on world-trade flows.
