Global Value Numbering (GVN) is an important static analysis to detect
equivalent expressions in a program. We present an iterative data-flow analysis
GVN algorithm in SSA for the purpose of detecting total redundancies. The
central challenge is defining a join operation to detect equivalences at a join
point in polynomial time such that later occurrences of redundant expressions
could be detected. For this purpose, we introduce the novel concept of value
$\phi$-function. We claim the algorithm is precise and takes only polynomial
time.
