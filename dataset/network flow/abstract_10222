We derive a system of coupled flow equations for the proper-vertices of the
background effective average action and we give an explicit representation of
these by means of diagrammatic and momentum space techniques. This explicit
representation can be used as a new computational technique that enables the
projection of the flow of a large new class of truncations of the background
effective average action. In particular, these can be single- or bi-field
truncations of local or non-local character. As an application we study
non-abelian gauge theories. We show how to use this new technique to calculate
the beta function of the gauge coupling (without employing the heat kernel
expansion) under various approximations. In particular, one of these
approximations leads to a derivation of beta functions similar to those
proposed as candidates for an "all-orders" beta function. Finally, we discuss
some possible phenomenology related to these flows.
