The extremely energetic (~10^-4 erg/cm^2) gamma-ray burst (GRB) of 1999
December 8 was triangulated to a ~14 sq. arcmin. error box ~1.8 d after its
arrival at Earth with the 3rd interplanetary network (IPN), consisting of the
Ulysses, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR), and WIND spacecraft. Radio
observations with the Very Large Array ~2.7 d after the burst revealed a bright
fading counterpart whose position is consistent with that of an optical
transient source whose redshift is z=0.707. We present the time history, peak
flux, fluence, and refined 1.3 sq. arcmin. error box of this event, and discuss
its energetics. This is the first time that a counterpart has been found for a
GRB localized only by the IPN.
