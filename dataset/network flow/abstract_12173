For arbitrary networks of random masses connected by random springs, we
define a general strong disorder real-space renormalization (RG) approach that
generalizes the procedures introduced previously by Hastings [Phys. Rev. Lett.
90, 148702 (2003)] and by Amir, Oreg and Imry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 070601
(2010)] respectively. The principle is to eliminate iteratively the elementary
oscillating mode of highest frequency associated with either a mass or a spring
constant. To explain the accuracy of the strong disorder RG rules, we compare
with the Aoki RG rules that are exact at fixed frequency.
