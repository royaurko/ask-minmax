Through academic publications, the contributors of these publications form a
social network. Instead of sharing casual thoughts and photos (as in Facebook),
contributors pick co-contributors and reference papers written by other contributors. Thanks
to various efforts (such as Microsoft Libra and DBLP), the data necessary for
analyzing the academic social network is becoming more available on the
Internet. What type of information and queries would be useful for users to
find out, beyond the search queries already available from services such as
Google Scholar? In this paper, we explore this question by defining a variety
of ranking metrics on different entities -contributors, publication venues and
institutions. We go beyond traditional metrics such as paper counts, citations
and h-index. Specifically, we define metrics such as influence, connections and
exposure for contributors. An contributor gains influence by receiving more citations,
but also citations from influential contributors. An contributor increases his/her
connections by co-contributoring with other contributors, and specially from other
contributors with high connections. An contributor receives exposure by publishing in
selective venues where publications received high citations in the past, and
the selectivity of these venues also depends on the influence of the contributors
who publish there. We discuss the computation aspects of these metrics, and
similarity between different metrics. With additional information of
contributor-institution relationships, we are able to study institution rankings
based on the corresponding contributors' rankings for each type of metric as well as
different domains. We are prepared to demonstrate these ideas with a web site
(http://pubstat.org) built from millions of publications and contributors.
