We present a study of transport on complex networks with routing based on
local information. Particles hop from one node of the network to another
according to a set of routing rules with different degrees of congestion
awareness, ranging from random diffusion to rigid congestion-gradient driven
flow. Each node can be either source or destination for particles and all nodes
have the same routing capacity, which are features of ad-hoc wireless networks.
It is shown that the transport capacity increases when a small amount of
congestion awareness is present in the routing rules, and that it then
decreases as the routing rules become too rigid when the flow becomes strictly
congestion-gradient driven. Therefore, an optimum value of the congestion
awareness exists in the routing rules. It is also shown that, in the limit of a
large number of nodes, networks using routing based on local information jam at
any nonzero load. Finally, we study the correlation between congestion at node
level and a betweenness centrality measure.
