We present an algorithm specifically tailored for solving kinetic equations
onto GPUs. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by solving the
one-dimensional shock wave structure problem and a two-dimensional low Mach
number driven cavity flow. Computational results show that it is possible to
cut down the computing time of the sequential codes of two order of magnitudes.
The algorithm can easily be extended to three-dimensional flows and more
general collision models.
