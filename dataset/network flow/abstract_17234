In this paper, we consider a stabilization problem of an uncertain system in
a networked control setting. Due to the network, the measurements are quantized
to finite-bit signals and may be randomly lost in the communication. We study
uncertain autoregressive systems whose state and input parameters vary within
given intervals. We derive conditions for making the plant output to be mean
square stable, characterizing limitations on data rate, packet loss
probabilities, and magnitudes of uncertainty. It is shown that a specific class
of nonuniform quantizers can achieve stability with a lower data rate compared
with the common uniform one.
