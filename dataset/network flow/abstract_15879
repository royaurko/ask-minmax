The measurement of performance of Internet Protocol IP network can be done by
Transmission Control Protocol TCP because it guarantees send data from one end
of the connection actually gets to the other end and in the same order it was
send, otherwise an error is reported. There are several methods to measure the
performance of TCP among these methods genetic algorithms, neural network, data
mining etc, all these methods have weakness and can't reach to correct measure
of TCP performance. This paper proposed a new method of measuring TCP
performance for real time IP network using Biocomputing, especially molecular
calculation because it provides wisdom results and it can exploit all
facilities of phylogentic analysis. Applying the new method at real time on
Biological Kurdish Messenger BIOKM model designed to measure the TCP
performance in two types of protocols File Transfer Protocol FTP and Internet
Relay Chat Daemon IRCD. This application gives very close result of TCP
performance comparing with TCP performance which obtains from Little's law
using same model (BIOKM), i.e. the different percentage of utilization (Busy or
traffic industry) and the idle time which are obtained from a new method base
on Bio-computing comparing with Little's law was (nearly) 0.13%.
