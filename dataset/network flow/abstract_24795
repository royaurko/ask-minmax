The idea of in-band full-duplex (FD) communications revives in recent years
owing to the significant progress in the self-interference cancellation and
hardware design techniques, offering the potential to double spectral
efficiency. The adaptations in upper layers are highly demanded in the design
of FD communication systems. In this letter, we propose a novel medium access
control (MAC) using FD techniques that allows transmitters to monitor the
channel usage while transmitting, and backoff as soon as collision happens.
Analytical saturation throughput of the FD-MAC protocol is derived with the
consideration of imperfect sensing brought by residual self- interference (RSI)
in the PHY layer. Both analytical and simulation results indicate that the
normalized saturation throughput of the proposed FD-MAC can significantly
outperforms conventional CSMA/CA under various network conditions.
