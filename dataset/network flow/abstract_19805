The anisotropic fluid equations governing a frictionless obliquely-flowing
plasma around an essentially arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional ion-absorbing
object in a strong magnetic field are solved analytically in the quasi-neutral
drift-approximation, neglecting parallel temperature gradients. The effects of
transverse displacements traversing the magnetic presheath are also quantified.
It is shown that the parallel collection flux density dependence upon external
Mach-number is $n_\infty c_s \exp[-1 -(M_{\parallel\infty}-
M_\perp\cot\theta)]$ where $\theta$ is the angle (in the plane of field and
drift velocity) of the object-surface to the magnetic-field and
$M_{\parallel\infty}$ is the external parallel flow. The perpendicular drift,
$\M_\perp$, appearing here consists of the external $\E\wedge\B$ drift plus a
weighted sum of the ion and electron electron diamagnetic drifts that depends
upon the total angle of the surface to the magnetic field. It is that somewhat
counter-intuitive combination that an oblique (transverse) Mach probe
experiment measures.
