The current work discusses how complex networks can be applied in order to
aid economical development and stability at several scales and contexts. The
following activities are involved: (a) compilation of several types of data
related to socioeconomic development; (b) representation of such data in terms
of multilayer interacting complex networks (cond-mat/0406369) registered
geographically; (c) application of traditional and new methods for complex
networks characterization and analysis. Such an approach allows the
identification of bottlenecks and deficits/surpluses, simulation of system
development under varying constraints and perturbations, as well as the
application of optimization methods in order to help identify the most
effective strategies leading to social and economic wealth and stability. In
addition to its practical implications, such an approach also emphasizes
several issues of substantial theoretical interest, including the integration
of networks of different natures, the interplay between the dynamics of
topological and node state evolution, the effects of geographical constraints,
community finding, as well as optimization issues. The discussed methodology is
particularly interesting for applications in developing countries because of
the greater potential for economic evolution in such nations. This manuscript
also includes a brief review of complex networks approaches to socioeconomics
modeling.
