We introduce a model to study the effect of degree-frequency correlations on
synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators. Analyzing this model, we
find several remarkable characteristics. We find a stationary synchronized
state that is (i) universal, i.e., the degree of synchrony, as measured by a
global order parameter, is independent of network topology, and (ii) fully
phase-locked, i.e., all oscillators become simultaneously phase-locked despite
having different natural frequencies. This state separates qualitatively
different behaviors for two other classes of correlations where, respectively,
slow and fast oscillators can remain unsynchronized. We close by presenting
analysis of the dynamics under arbitrary degree-frequency correlations.
