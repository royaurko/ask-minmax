A prescription to incorporate the effects of nuclear flow on the process of
multifragmentation of hot nuclei is proposed in an analytically solvable
canonical model. Flow is simulated by the action of an effective negative
external pressure. It favors sharpening the signatures of liquid-gas phase
transition in finite nuclei with increased multiplicity and a lowered phase
transition temperature.
