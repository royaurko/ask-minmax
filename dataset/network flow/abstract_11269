Reactive routing protocols like Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing
(AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)in Ad-Hoc Wireless Networks which are
used in Mobile and Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) work by flooding the network with
control packets. There is generally a limit on the number of these packets that
can be generated or forwarded. But a malicious node can disregard this limit
and flood the network with fake control packets. These packets hog the limited
bandwidth and processing power of genuine nodes in the network while being
forwarded. Due to this, genuine route requests suffer and many routes either do
not get a chance to materialize or they end up being longer than otherwise. In
this paper we propose a non cryptographic solution to the above problem and
prove its efficiency by means of simulation.
