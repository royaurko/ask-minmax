With globalization, countries are more connected than before by trading
flows, which currently amount to at least 36 trillion dollars. Interestingly,
approximately 30-60 percent of global exports consist of intermediate products.
Therefore, the trade flow network of a particular product with high added
values can be regarded as a value chain. The problem is weather we can
discriminate between these products based on their unique flow network
structure. This paper applies the flow analysis method developed in ecology to
638 trading flow networks of different products. We claim that the allometric
scaling exponent $\eta$ can be used to characterize the degree of
hierarchicality of a flow network, i.e., whether the trading products flow on
long hierarchical chains. Then, the flow networks of products with higher added
values and complexity, such as machinery&transport equipment with larger
exponents, are highlighted. These higher values indicate that their trade flow
networks are more hierarchical. As a result, without extra data such as global
input-output table, we can identify the product categories with higher
complexity and the relative importance of a country in the global value chain
solely by the trading network.
