This paper studies the homotopy invariant $\cat(X,\xi)$ introduced in
\cite{farbe2}. Given a finite cell-complex $X$, we study the function
$\xi\mapsto \cat(X,\xi)$ where $\xi$ varies in the cohomology space
$H^1(X;\R)$. Note that $\cat(X,\xi)$ turns into the classical Lusternik -
Schnirelmann category $\cat(X)$ in the case $\xi=0$. Interest in $\cat(X,\xi)$
is based on its applications in dynamics where it enters estimates of
complexity of the chain recurrent set of a flow admitting Lyapunov closed
1-forms.
