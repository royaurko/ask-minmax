We report experimental evidences of anomalous kinetic roughening in the
stable displacement of an oil-air interface in a Hele-Shaw cell with strong
quenched disorder. The disorder consists on a random modulation of the gap
spacing transverse to the growth direction (tracks). We have performed
experiments varying average interface velocity and gap spacing, and measured
the scaling exponents. We have obtained beta=0.50, beta*=0.25, alpha=1.0,
alpha_l=0.5, and z=2. When there is no fluid injection, the interface is driven
solely by capillary forces, and a higher value of beta around beta=0.65 is
measured. The presence of multiscaling and the particular morphology of the
interfaces, characterized by high slopes that follow a L\'evy distribution,
confirms the existence of anomalous scaling. From a detailed study of the
motion of the oil--air interface we show that the anomaly is a consequence of
different local velocities over tracks plus the coupling in the motion between
neighboring tracks. The anomaly disappears at high interface velocities, weak
capillary forces, or when the disorder is not sufficiently persistent in the
growth direction. We have also observed the absence of scaling when the
disorder is very strong or when a regular modulation of the gap spacing is
introduced.
