We propose a distributed algorithm for sparse signal recovery in sensor
networks based on Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT). Every agent has a set of
measurements of a signal x, and the objective is for the agents to recover x
from their collective measurements at a minimal communication cost and with low
computational complexity. A naive distributed implementation of IHT would
require global communication of every agent's full state in each iteration. We
find that we can dramatically reduce this communication cost by leveraging
solutions to the distributed top-K problem in the database literature.
Evaluations show that our algorithm requires up to three orders of magnitude
less total bandwidth than the best-known distributed basis pursuit method.
