This study presents generalization of the Landau hydrodynamic solution for
multiparticle production applied to non-central relativistic heavy ion
collisions. Obtained results shows longitudinal scaling of elliptic flow $v_2$
as a function of rapidity shifted by beam rapidity ($y-y_{beam}$) for different
energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=62.4$ GeV and 200 GeV) and for different systems
(Au-Au and Cu-Cu). It is argued, that the elliptic flow and its longitudinal
scaling is due to the initial transverse energy density distribution and
initial longitudinal thickness effect.
