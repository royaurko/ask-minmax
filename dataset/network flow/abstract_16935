A family of explicit Lyapunov function for positive recurrent Markovian
Jackson network is constructed. With this result we obtain explicit estimates
of the tail distribution of the first time, when the process returns to large
compact sets, and some explicit estimates of the essential spectral radius of
the process. The essential spectral radius of the process provides the best
geometric convergence rate to equilibrium that one can get by changing the
transitions of the process in a finite set.
