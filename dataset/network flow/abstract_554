Network coding in geometric space, a new research direction also known as
Space Information Flow, is a promising research field which shows the
superiority of network coding in space over routing in space. Present
literatures proved that given six terminal nodes, network coding in space is
strictly superior to routing in space in terms of single-source multicast in
regular (5+1) model, in which five terminal nodes forms a regular pentagon
centered at a terminal node. In order to compare the performance between
network coding in space and routing in space, this paper quantitatively studies
two classes of network coding in space and optimal routing in space when any
terminal node moves arbitrarily in two-dimensional Euclidean space, and cost
advantage is used as the metric. Furthermore, the upper-bound of cost advantage
is figured out as well as the region where network coding in space is superior
to routing in space. Several properties of Space Information Flow are also
presented.
