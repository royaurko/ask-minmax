In this work, the cross-layer design problem of joint multiuser detection and
power control is studied using a game-theoretic approach. The uplink of a
direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) data network is
considered and a non-cooperative game is proposed in which users in the network
are allowed to choose their uplink receivers as well as their transmit powers
to maximize their own utilities. The utility function measures the number of
reliable bits transmitted by the user per joule of energy consumed. Focusing on
linear receivers, the Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is
shown that the equilibrium is one where the powers are SIR-balanced with the
minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector as the receiver. In addition, this
framework is used to study power control games for the matched filter, the
decorrelator, and the MMSE detector; and the receivers' performance is compared
in terms of the utilities achieved at equilibrium (in bits/Joule). The optimal
cooperative solution is also discussed and compared with the non-cooperative
approach. Extensions of the results to the case of multiple receive antennas
are also presented. In addition, an admission control scheme based on
maximizing the total utility in the network is proposed.
