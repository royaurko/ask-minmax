Previously, we have proposed a direct simulation scheme for colloidal
dispersions in a Newtonian solvent [Phys.Rev.E 71,036707 (2005)]. An improved
formulation called the ``Smoothed Profile (SP) method'' is presented here in
which simultaneous time-marching is used for the host fluid and colloids. The
SP method is a direct numerical simulation of particulate flows and provides a
coupling scheme between the continuum fluid dynamics and rigid-body dynamics
through utilization of a smoothed profile for the colloidal particles.
Moreover, the improved formulation includes an extension to incorporate
multi-component fluids, allowing systems such as charged colloids in
electrolyte solutions to be studied. The dynamics of the colloidal dispersions
are solved with the same computational cost as required for solving
non-particulate flows. Numerical results which assess the hydrodynamic
interactions of colloidal dispersions are presented to validate the SP method.
The SP method is not restricted to particular constitutive models of the host
fluids and can hence be applied to colloidal dispersions in complex fluids.
