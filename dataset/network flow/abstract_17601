We study the possible regularization of collision solutions for one centre
problems with a weak singularity. In the case of logarithmic singularities, we
consider the method of regularization via smoothing of the potential. With this
technique, we prove that the extended flow, where collision solutions are
replaced with a transmission trajectory, is continuous, though not
differentiable, with respect to the initial data.
