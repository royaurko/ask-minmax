Gi-Fi stands for Gigabit Wireless. Gi-Fi is a wireless transmission system
which is ten times faster than other technology and its chip delivers
short-range multigigabit data transfer in a local environment. Gi-Fi is a
wireless technology which promises high speed short range data transfers with
speeds of up to 5 Gbps within a range of 10 meters. The Gi-Fi operates on the
60GHz frequency band. This frequency band is currently mostly unused. It is
manufactured using (CMOS) technology. This wireless technology named as Gi-Fi.
The benefits and features of this new technology can be helpful for use in
development of the next generation of devices and places. In this paper, the
comparison is perform between Gi-Fi and some of existing technologies with very
high speed large files transfers within seconds it is expected that Gi-Fi to be
the preferred wireless technology used in home and office of future.
