TCP is designed for networks with assumption that major losses occur only due
to congestion of network traffic. On a wireless network TCP misinterprets the
transmission losses due to bit errors and handoffs as losses caused by
congestion, and triggers congestion control mechanisms. Because of its end to
end delivery model, congestion handling and avoidance mechanisms, TCP has been
widely accepted as Transport layer protocol for internetworks. Extension of
Internetworks over wireless links is inevitable with the spread of ubiquitous
computing and mobile communications. This paper presents study of different
mechanisms proposed to extend Transport Control Protocol and other alternate
solutions to enhance end to end performance over lossy wireless links. The
paper studies details of different design choices proposed and their technical
advantages and disadvantages. Finally, an analysis and proposal for best choice
of proposed schemes are made for wireless networks.
