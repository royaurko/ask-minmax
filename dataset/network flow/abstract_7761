Being able to accurately model and predict the dynamics of dispersed
inclusions transported by a turbulent flow, remains a challenge with important
scientific, environmental and economical issues. One critical and difficult
point is to correctly describe the dynamics of particles over a wide range of
sizes and densities. Our measurements show that acceleration statistics of
particles dispersed in a turbulent flow do exhibit specific size and density
effects but that they preserve an extremely robust turbulent signature with
lognormal fluctuations, regardless of particles size and density. This has
important consequences in terms of modelling of the turbulent transport of
dispersed inclusions.
