A particle-based model for mesoscopic fluid dynamics is used to simulate
steady and unsteady flows around a circular and a square cylinder in a
two-dimensional channel for a range of Reynolds number between 10 and 130.
Numerical results for the recirculation length, the drag coefficient, and the
Strouhal number are reported and compared with previous experimental
measurements and computational fluid dynamics data. The good agreement
demonstrates the potential of this method for the investigation of complex
flows.
