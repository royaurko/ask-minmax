Traditionally, network operators have used simple flat-rate broadband data
plans for both wired and wireless network access. But today, with the
popularity of mobile devices and exponential growth of apps, videos, and
clouds, service providers are gradually moving towards more sophisticated
pricing schemes. This decade will therefore likely witness a major change in
the ways in which network resources are managed, and the role of economics in
allocating these resources. This survey reviews some of the well-known past
broadband pricing proposals (both static and dynamic), including their current
realizations in various consumer data plans around the world, and discusses
several research problems and open questions. By exploring the benefits and
challenges of pricing data, this paper attempts to facilitate both the
industrial and the academic communities' efforts in understanding the existing
literature, recognizing new trends, and shaping an appropriate and timely
research agenda.
