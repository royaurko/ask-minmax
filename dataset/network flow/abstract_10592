The universal secure network coding presented by Silva et al. realizes secure
and reliable transmission of a secret message over any underlying network code,
by using maximum rank distance codes. Inspired by their result, this paper
considers the secure network coding based on arbitrary linear codes, and
investigates its security performance and error correction capability that are
guaranteed independently of the underlying network code. The security
performance and error correction capability are said to be universal when they
are independent of underlying network codes. This paper introduces new code
parameters, the relative dimension/intersection profile (RDIP) and the relative
generalized rank weight (RGRW) of linear codes. We reveal that the universal
security performance and universal error correction capability of secure
network coding are expressed in terms of the RDIP and RGRW of linear codes. The
security and error correction of existing schemes are also analyzed as
applications of the RDIP and RGRW.
