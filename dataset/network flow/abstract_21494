We show that hyperscaling and finite-size scaling imply that the probability
distribution of the order parameter in finite size critical systems exhibit
data collapse. We consider the examples of equilibrium critical systems, and a
statistical model of ecology. We explain recent observations that the
probability distribution of turbulent power fluctuations in closed flows is the
same as that of the harmonic 2DXY model.
