Measurements of traffic flow show the existence of metastable states of very
high throughput. These observations cannot be reproduced by the CA model of
Nagel and Schreckenberg (NaSch model), not even qualitatively. Here we present
two variants on the NaSch model with modified acceleration rules
('slow-to-start' rules). Although these models are still discrete in time and
space, different types of metastable states can be observed.
