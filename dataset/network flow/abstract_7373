This introductory talk to the 1999 Victoria Conference on Large-Scale Flows
will present the ``big questions'' which will be discussed in the conference:
(a) Does the velocity field converge on the largest scales? (b) Why can't we
agree on the value of beta? (c) How can we properly measure the small-scale
velocity dispersion? (d) Just how complicated can biasing be? (e) How universal
are the distance indicators we are using? (f) How do we design our next
generation of surveys to answer the above questions?
