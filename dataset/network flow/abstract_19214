Traffic load balancing and resource allocation is set to play a crucial role
in leveraging the dense and increasingly heterogeneous deployment of wireless
networks. Although the problem of optimal user to access point (AP) association
has received considerable traction, optimal algorithms for splitting user
traffic across multiple radio access technologies (RATs) and/or across APs
available to a user are not well investigated. In this paper, we consider a
scenario where traffic for each user may be split across macrocell and small
cell, and develop a closed form solution is developed for optimal splitting and
aggregation. The optimal solution lends itself to a "water-filling" based
interpretation, where the fraction of user's traffic sent over macrocell is
proportional to ratio of user's peak capacity on that macrocell and its
throughput on the small cell. Moreover, this fraction is shown to increase with
increasing latency on the small cell backhaul. Using comprehensive system level
simulations, the developed optimal solution is shown to provide substantial
edge and median throughput gain over representative association algorithms.
