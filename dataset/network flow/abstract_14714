This paper presents a theoretical study of blood flow through a tapered and
overlapping stenosed artery under the action of an externally applied magnetic
field. The fluid (blood) medium is assumed to be porous in nature. The variable
viscosity of blood depending on hematocrit (percentage volume of erythrocytes)
is taken into account in order to improve resemblance to the real situation.
The governing equation for laminar, incompressible and Newtonian fluid subject
to the boundary conditions is solved by using a well known Frobenius method.
The analytical expressions for velocity component, volumetric flow rate, wall
shear stress and pressure gradient are obtained. The numerical values are
extracted from these analytical expressions and are presented graphically. It
is observed that the influence of hematocrit, magnetic field and the shape of
artery have important impact on the velocity profile, pressure gradient and
wall shear stress. Moreover, the effect of primary stenosis on the secondary
one has been significantly observed.
