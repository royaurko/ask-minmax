In recent surveys of Radio-loud AGN, a new sub-class of objects, known as
Weak-Line Radio Galaxies (WLRGs) has emerged. These radio galaxies have only
weak, low-ionization optical emission lines. In the X-ray band, these objects
are much fainter and have flatter spectra than broad-line and narrow-line radio
galaxies. In these respects, WLRGs are reminiscent of Low Ionization Nuclear
Emission Regions (LINERs). We have begun a multi-wavelength study of WLRGs to
better understand their possible connection to LINERs and the structure of the
accretion flow in both these systems. Here, we present new optical spectra of a
sample of WLRGs. We find that 81% of the objects have optical emission-line
properties that are similar to LINERs, indicating that these two classes of AGN
may be related. Future high resolution X-ray observations of WLRGs will be
critical in determining the true nature of the accretion flow in these objects.
