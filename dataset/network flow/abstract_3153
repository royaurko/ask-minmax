We study the collective dynamics of oscillator networks with phase-repulsive
coupling, considering various network sizes and topologies. The notion of link
frustration is introduced to characterize and quantify the network dynamical
states. In opposition to widely studied phase-attractive case, the properties
of final dynamical states in our model critically depend on the network
topology. In particular, each network's total frustration value is intimately
related to its topology. Moreover, phase-repulsive networks in general display
multiple final frustration states, whose statistical and stability properties
are uniquely identifying them.
