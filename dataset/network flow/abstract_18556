In this paper, we investigate the optimal precoding scheme for relay networks
with finite-alphabet constraints. We show that the previous work utilizing
various design criteria to maximize either the diversity order or the
transmission rate with the Gaussian-input assumption may lead to significant
loss for a practical system with finite constellation set constraint. A linear
precoding scheme is proposed to maximize the mutual information for relay
networks. We exploit the structure of the optimal precoding matrix and develop
a unified two-step iterative algorithm utilizing the theory of convex
optimization and optimization on the complex Stiefel manifold. Numerical
examples show that this novel iterative algorithm achieves significant gains
compared to its conventional counterpart.
