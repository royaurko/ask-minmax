In a recent paper, Li and Melrose have claimed that the splitting - due to
relativistic effects - of the Alfven surface in an axisymmetric pulsar wind
does not occur. Here we refute this claim by showing that, unless the solution
that describes the flow along each open magnetic field line passes through the
pure Alfvenic point (which is one of the manifestations of the splitting of the
Alfvenic point), it would not be physically viable both at the surface of the
star and at infinity.
