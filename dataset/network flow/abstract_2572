In this paper we introduce new models of complex weighted networks sharing
several properties with fractal sets: the deterministic non-homogeneous
weighted fractal networks and the stochastic weighted fractal networks.
Networks of both classes can be completely analytically characterized in terms
of the involved parameters. The proposed algorithms improve and extend the
framework of weighted fractal networks recently proposed in (T. Carletti & S.
