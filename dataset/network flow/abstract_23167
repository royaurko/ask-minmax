We demonstrate that a highly frustrated anisotropic Josephson junction
array(JJA) on a square lattice exhibits a zero-temperature jamming transition,
which shares much in common with those in granular systems. Anisotropy of the
Josephson couplings along the horizontal and vertical directions plays roles
similar to normal load or density in granular systems. We studied numerically
static and dynamic response of the system against shear, i. e. injection of
external electric current at zero temperature. Current-voltage curves at
various strength of the anisotropy exhibit universal scaling features around
the jamming point much as do the flow curves in granular rheology, shear-stress
vs shear-rate. It turns out that at zero temperature the jamming transition
occurs right at the isotropic coupling and anisotropic JJA behaves as an exotic
fragile vortex matter : it behaves as superconductor (vortex glass) into one
direction while normal conductor (vortex liquid) into the other direction even
at zero temperature. Furthermore we find a variant of the theoretical model for
the anisotropic JJA quantitatively reproduces universal master flow-curves of
the granular systems. Our results suggest an unexpected common paradigm
stretching over seemingly unrelated fields - the rheology of soft materials and
superconductivity.
