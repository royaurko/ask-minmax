Interactions between microorganisms and their complex flowing environments
are essential in many biological systems. We develop a model for microswimmer
dynamics in non-Newtonian Poiseuille flows. We predict that swimmers in
shear-thickening (-thinning) fluids migrate upstream more (less) quickly than
in Newtonian fluids and demonstrate that viscoelastic normal stress differences
reorient swimmers causing them to migrate upstream at the centreline, in
contrast to well-known boundary accumulation in quiescent Newtonian fluids.
Based on these observations, we suggest a sorting mechanism to select microbes
by swimming speed.
