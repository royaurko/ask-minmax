In order to curtail the escalating packet loss rates caused by an exponential
increase in network traffic, active queue management techniques such as Random
Early Detection (RED) have come into picture. Flow Random Early Drop (FRED)
keeps state based on instantaneous queue occupancy of a given flow. FRED
protects fragile flows by deterministically accepting flows from low bandwidth
connections and fixes several shortcomings of RED by computing queue length
during both arrival and departure of the packet. Stochastic Fair Queuing (SFQ)
ensures fair access to network resources and prevents a busty flow from
consuming more than its fair share. In case of (Random Exponential Marking)
REM, the key idea is to decouple congestion measure from performance measure
(loss, queue length or delay). Stabilized RED (SRED) is another approach of
detecting nonresponsive flows. In this paper, we have shown a comparative
analysis of throughput, delay and queue length for the various congestion
control algorithms RED, SFQ and REM. We also included the comparative analysis
of loss rate having different bandwidth for these algorithms.
