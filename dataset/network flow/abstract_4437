We present Conedy, a performant scientific tool to numerically investigate
dynamics on complex networks. Conedy allows to create networks and provides
automatic code generation and compilation to ensure performant treatment of
arbitrary node dynamics. Conedy can be interfaced via an internal script
interpreter or via a Python module.
