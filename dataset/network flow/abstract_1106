The large-scale magnetic pattern of the quiet sun is dominated by the
magnetic network. This network, created by photospheric magnetic fields swept
into convective downflows, delineates the boundaries of large scale cells of
overturning plasma and exhibits voids in magnetic organization. Such voids
include internetwork fields, a mixed-polarity sparse field that populate the
inner part of network cells. To single out voids and to quantify their
intrinsic pattern a fast circle packing based algorithm is applied to 511
SOHO/MDI high resolution magnetograms acquired during the outstanding solar
activity minimum between 23 and 24 cycles. The computed Void Distribution
Function shows a quasi-exponential decay behavior in the range 10-60 Mm. The
lack of distinct flow scales in such a range corroborates the hypothesis of
multi-scale motion flows at the solar surface. In addition to the
quasi-exponential decay we have found that the voids reveal departure from a
simple exponential decay around 35 Mm.
