Disordered $RL-C$ networks are known to be an adequate model for describing
fluctuations of electric fields in a random metal-dielectric composite. We show
that under appropriate conditions the statistical properties of such a system
can be studied in the framework of the Efetov's non-linear $\sigma-$ model.
This fact provides a direct link to the theory of Anderson localization.
