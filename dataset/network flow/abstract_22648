We prove a sharp inequality for hypersurfaces in the n-dimensional
Anti-deSitter-Schwarzschild manifold for general n greater or equal to 3. This
inequality generalizes the classical Minkowski inequality for surfaces in the
three dimensional Euclidean space, and has a natural interpretation in terms of
the Penrose inequality for collapsing null shells of dust. The proof relies on
a new monotonicity formula for inverse mean curvature flow, and uses a
geometric inequality established by the first contributor in [3].
