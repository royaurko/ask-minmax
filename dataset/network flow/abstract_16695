Developed by the APE group, APENet is a new high speed, low latency,
3-dimensional interconnect architecture optimized for PC clusters running
LQCD-like numerical applications. The hardware implementation is based on a
single PCI-X 133MHz network interface card hosting six indipendent
bi-directional channels with a peak bandwidth of 676 MB/s each direction. We
discuss preliminary benchmark results showing exciting performances similar or
better than those found in high-end commercial network systems.
