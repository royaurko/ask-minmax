We obtain a robust, non-parametric, estimate of the Hubble constant from
galaxy linear diameters calibrated using HST Cepheid distances. Our method is
independent of the parametric form of the diameter function and the spatial
distribution of galaxies and is insensitive to Malmquist bias. We include
information on the galaxy rotation velocities; unlike Tully-Fisher, however, we
retain a fully non-parametric treatment. We find $H_0=66\pm6$ km/s/Mpc,
somewhat larger than previous results using galaxy diameters.
