With the development of the networks and the Internet, the problems of
automated deployment on broad scale became increasingly crucial. Software
deployment is a complex process covering several activities going from the
configuration to the retirement of a software product. During the execution of
a deployment process, exceptions can be met which put the site in an incoherent
state. To solve them, we propose an approach based on transactional concepts
which describes the actions to be undertaken when an exceptional situation is
met during the deployment process. The approach guaranties the respect of the
site's consistency by preserving part of the work already carried out by the
process. This article presents our approach and an experimentation made in an
academic deployment system.
