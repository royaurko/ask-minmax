Layered video streaming in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has drawn great
interest, since it can not only accommodate large numbers of users, but also
handle peer heterogeneity. However, there's still a lack of comprehensive
studies on chunk scheduling for the smooth playout of layered streams in P2P
networks. In these situations, a playout smoothing mechanism can be used to
ensure the uniform delivery of the layered stream. This can be achieved by
reducing the quality changes that the stream undergoes when adapting to
changing network conditions. This paper complements previous efforts in
throughput maximization and delay minimization for P2P streaming by considering
the consequences of playout smoothing on the scheduling mechanisms for stream
layer acquisition. The two main problems to be considered when designing a
playout smoothing mechanism for P2P streaming are the fluctuation in available
bandwidth between peers and the unreliability of user-contributed
resources--particularly peer churn. Since the consideration of these two
factors in the selection and scheduling of stream layers is crucial to maintain
smooth stream playout, the main objective of our smoothing mechanism becomes
the determination of how many layers
