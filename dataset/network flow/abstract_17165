When there is a possibility to wirelessly stream video over a network, a
sophisticated computer analysis of the transmitted video is possible. Such
process is used in biomechanics when it is important to analyze athletes
performance via streaming digital uncompressed video to a computer and then
analyzing it using specific software such as Arial Performance Analysis Systems
or Dartfish. This manuscript presents some approaches and challenges in
streaming video as well as some applications of Information Technology in
biomechanics. An example of how scientists from Indiana State University
approached the wireless transmission of video is also introduced.
