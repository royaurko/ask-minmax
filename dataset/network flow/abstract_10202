In this work we construct the $\Co^{\r}$-completion and $\Co^{\l}$-completion
of a dynamical system. If $X$ is a flow, we construct canonical maps $X\to
\Co^{\r}(X)$ and $X\to \Co^{\l}(X)$ and when these maps are homeomorphism we
have the class of $\Co^{\r}$-complete and $\Co^{\l}$-complete flows,
respectively. In this study we find out many relations between the topological
properties of the completions and the dynamical properties of a given flow. In
the case of a complete flow this gives interesting relations between the
topological properties (separability properties, compactness, convergence of
nets, etc.) and dynamical properties (periodic points, omega limits,
attractors, repulsors, etc.).
