We prove two new estimates for the level set flow of mean convex domains in
Riemannian manifolds. Our estimates give control - exponential in time - for
the infimum of the mean curvature, and the ratio between the norm of the second
fundamental form and the mean curvature. In particular, the estimates remove a
stumbling block that has been left after the work of White and
Haslhofer-Kleiner, and thus allow us to extend the structure theory for mean
convex level set flow to general ambient manifolds of arbitrary dimension.
