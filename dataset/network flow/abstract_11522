Here, we review the research we have done on social contagion. We describe
the methods we have employed (and the assumptions they have entailed) in order
to examine several datasets with complementary strengths and weaknesses,
including the Framingham Heart Study, the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health, and other observational and experimental datasets that we
and others have collected. We describe the regularities that led us to propose
that human social networks may exhibit a "three degrees of influence" property,
and we review statistical approaches we have used to characterize
inter-personal influence with respect to phenomena as diverse as obesity,
smoking, cooperation, and happiness. We do not claim that this work is the
final word, but we do believe that it provides some novel, informative, and
stimulating evidence regarding social contagion in longitudinally followed
networks. Along with other scholars, we are working to develop new methods for
identifying causal effects using social network data, and we believe that this
area is ripe for statistical development as current methods have known and
often unavoidable limitations.
