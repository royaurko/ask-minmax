We give a new approach to the well-known convergence to the hydrodynamic
limit for the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP). More precisely, we
characterize any possible limit of its empirical density measures as solutions
to the heat equation by passing to the limit in the gradient flow structure of
the particle system.
