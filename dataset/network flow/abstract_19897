We show that simple 2 and 3-layer flux-transport dynamos, when forced at the
top by a poloidal source term, can produce a widely varying amplitude of
toroidal field at the bottom, depending on how close the meridional flow speed
of the bottom layer is to the propagation speed of the forcing applied above
the top layer, and how close the amplitude of the $\alpha$-effect is to two
values that give rise to a resonant response. This effect should be present in
this class of dynamo model no matter how many layers are included. This result
could have implications for the prediction of future solar cycles from the
surface magnetic fields of prior cycles. It could be looked for in
flux-transport dynamos that are more realistic for the Sun, done in spherical
geometry with differential rotation, meridional flow and $\alpha$-effect that
vary with latitude and time as well as radius. Because of these variations, if
resonance occurs, it should be more localized in time, latitude and radius.
