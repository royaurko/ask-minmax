Evolutionary relationships between species are usually represented in
phylogenies, i.e. evolutionary trees, which are a type of networks. The
terminal nodes of these trees represent species, which are made of individuals
and populations among which gene flow occurs. This flow can also be represented
as a network. In this paper we briefly show some properties of these complex
networks of evolutionary and ecological relationships. First, we characterize
large scale evolutionary relationships in the Tree of Life by a degree
distribution. Second, we represent genetic relationships between individuals of
a Mediterranean marine plant, Posidonia oceanica, in terms of a Minimum
Spanning Tree. Finally, relationships among plant shoots inside populations are
represented as networks of genetic similarity.
