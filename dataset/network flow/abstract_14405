Binary symmetry constraints are applied to the nonlinearization of spectral
problems and adjoint spectral problems into so-called binary constrained flows,
which provide candidates for finite-dimensional Liouville integrable
Hamiltonian systems. The resulting constraints on the potentials of spectral
problems give rise to a kind of involutive solutions to zero curvature
equations, and thus the integrability by quadratures can be shown for zero
curvature equations once the corresponding binary constrained flows are proved
to be integrable. The whole process to carry out binary symmetry constraints is
called binary nonlinearization. The principal task of binary nonlinearization
is to expose the Liouville integrability for the resulting binary constrained
flows, which can usually be achieved as a consequence of the existence of
hereditary recursion operators. The theory of binary nonlinearization is
applied to the multi-wave interaction equations associated with a 4x4 matrix
spectral problem as an illustrative example. The Backlund transformations
resulted from symmetry constraints are given for the multi-wave interaction
equations, and thus a kind of involutive solutions is presented and the
integrability by quadratures is shown for the multi-wave interaction equations.
