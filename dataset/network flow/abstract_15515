In this paper, we look into the problem of channel assignment in
multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks. We propose a new learning
automata based channel assignment scheme that adaptively improve network
overall throughput by expecting channel state. Since the ability of sending
packets via upstream links will be evaluation bases for assigning channels to
radio interfaces on each node. We use a link capacity function that potentially
reflects degree of interferences imposed by selected channels by each node.
According to dynamics of system, proposed algorithm assigns channels to radio
interface in distributed fashion such that minimize interference in
neighborhood of a node. We analyze the stability of the system via appropriate
Lyapunov-like trajectory; we show that stability and optimum point of the
system is converged.
