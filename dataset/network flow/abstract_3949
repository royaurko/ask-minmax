Using closure concepts, we show that within every undirected network, or
graph, there is a unique irreducible subgraph which we call its "spine". The
chordless cycles which comprise this irreducible core effectively characterize
the connectivity structure of the network as a whole. In particular, it is
shown that the center of the network, whether defined by distance or
betweenness centrality, is effectively contained in this spine. By counting the
number of cycles of length 3 <= k <= max_length, we can also create a kind of
signature that can be used to identify the network. Performance is analyzed,
and the concepts we develop are illurstrated by means of a relatively small
running sample network of about 400 nodes.
