Complex networks are an important paradigm of modern complex systems sciences
which allows quantitatively assessing the structural properties of systems
composed of different interacting entities. During the last years, intensive
efforts have been spent on applying network-based concepts also for the
analysis of dynamically relevant higher-order statistical properties of time
series. Notably, many corresponding approaches are closely related with the
concept of recurrence in phase space. In this paper, we review recent
methodological advances in time series analysis based on complex networks, with
a special emphasis on methods founded on recurrence plots. The potentials and
limitations of the individual methods are discussed and illustrated for
paradigmatic examples of dynamical systems as well as for real-world time
series. Complex network measures are shown to provide information about
structural features of dynamical systems that are complementary to those
characterized by other methods of time series analysis and, hence,
substantially enrich the knowledge gathered from other existing (linear as well
as nonlinear) approaches.
