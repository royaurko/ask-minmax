In this paper we consider a network of boolean agents that compete for a
limited resource. The agents play the so called Generalized Minority Game where
the capacity level is allowed to vary externally. We study the properties of
such a system for different values of the mean connectivity $K$ of the network,
and show that the system with K=2 shows a high degree of coordination for
relatively large variations of the capacity level.
