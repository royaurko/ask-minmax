In VANET high speed is the real characteristics which leads to frequent
breakdown, interference etc. Therefore Performance of adhoc routing protocols
is helpful to improve the Quality of Service (QOS). In this paper we studied
various adhoc routing protocols, Reactive, Proactive & Hybrid, taking in to
consideration parameters like speed, altitude, mobility etc in real VANET
scenario. The AODV and DYMO (Reactive), OLSR (Proactive) and ZRP (hybrid)
protocols are compared for IEEE 802.11(MAC) and IEEE 802.11(DCF) standard using
Qualnet as a Simulation tool. Since IEEE 802.11, covers both physical and data
link layer. Hence performance of the protocols in these layers helps to make a
right selection of Protocol for high speed mobility. Varying parameters of
VANET shows that in the real traffic scenarios proactive protocol performs more
efficiently for IEEE 802.11 (MAC) and IEEE 802.11(DCF).
