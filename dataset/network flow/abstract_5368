Wireless sensor networks are finally becoming a reality. In this paper, we
present a scalable architecture for using wireless sensor networks in
combination with wireless Ethernet networks to provide a complete end-to-end
solution to narrow the gap between the low-level information and context
awareness. We developed and implemented a complete proximity detector in order
to give a wearable computer, such as a PDA, location context. Since location is
only one element of contextawareness, we pursued utilizing photo sensors and
temperature sensors in learning as much as possible about the environment. We
used the TinyOS RF Motes as our test bed WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), 802.11
compatible hardware as our wireless Ethernet network, and conventional PCs and
wired 802.3 networks to build the upper levels of the architecture.
