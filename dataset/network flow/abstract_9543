Social network companies maintain complete visibility and ownership of the
data they store. However users should be able to maintain full control over
their content. For this purpose, we propose WARP, an architecture based upon
Information-Centric Networking (ICN) designs, which expands the scope of the
ICN architecture beyond media distribution, to provide data control in social
networks. The benefit of our solution lies in the lightweight nature of the
protocol and in its layered design. With WARP, data distribution and access
policies are enforced on the user side. Data can still be replicated in an ICN
fashion but we introduce control channels, named \textit{thread updates}, which
ensures that the access to the data is always updated to the latest control
policy. WARP decentralizes the social network but still offers APIs so that
social network providers can build products and business models on top of WARP.
Social applications run directly on the user's device and store their data on
the user's \textit{butler} that takes care of encryption and distribution.
Moreover, users can still rely on third parties to have high-availability
without renouncing their privacy.
