In this letter we investigate link scheduling algorithms for throughput
maximization in multicast wireless networks. According to our system model,
each source node transmits to a multicast group that resides one hop away. We
adopt the physical interference model to reflect the aggregate signal to
interference and noise ratio (SINR) at each node of the multicast group. We
present an ILP formulation of the aforementioned problem. The basic feature of
the problem formulation is that it decomposes the single multicast session into
the corresponding point-to-point links. The rationale is that a solution
algorithm has more flexibility regarding the scheduling options for individual
nodes. The extended MILP problem that also considers power control is solved
with LP relaxation. Performance results for both the ILP and MILP problems are
obtained for different traffic loads and different number of nodes per
multicast group.
