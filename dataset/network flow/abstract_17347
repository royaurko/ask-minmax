We use an "equation-free", coarse-grained computational approach to
accelerate molecular dynamics-based computations of demixing (segregation) of
dissimilar particles subject to an upward gas flow (gas-fluidized beds). We
explore the coarse-grained dynamics of these phenomena in gently fluidized beds
of solid mixtures of different densities, typically a slow process for which
reasonable continuum models are currently unavailable.
