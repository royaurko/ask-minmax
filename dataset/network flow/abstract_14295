Solvent loss due to evaporation in a drying drop can drive capillary flows
and solute migration. The flow is controlled by the evaporation profile and the
geometry of the drop. We predict the flow and solute migration near a sharp
corner of the perimeter under the conditions of uniform evaporation. This
extends the study of Ref. 6, which considered a singular evaporation profile,
characteristic of a dry surrounding surface. We find the rate of the deposit
growth along contact lines in early and intermediate time regimes. Compared to
the dry-surface evaporation profile of Ref. 6, uniform evaporation yields more
singular deposition in the early time regime, and nearly uniform deposition
profile is obtained for a wide range of opening angles in the intermediate time
regime. Uniform evaporation also shows a more pronounced contrast between acute
opening angles and obtuse opening angles.
