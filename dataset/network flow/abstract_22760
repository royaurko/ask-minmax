The filamentation instability triggered when two counter streaming plasma
shells overlap appears to be the main mechanism by which collisionless shocks
are generated. It has been known for long that a flow aligned magnetic field
can completely suppress this instability. In a recent paper [PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
18, 080706 (2011)], it was demonstrated in two dimensions that for the case of
two cold, symmetric, relativistically colliding shells, such cancellation
cannot occur if the field is not perfectly aligned. Here, this result is
extended to the case of two asymmetric shells. The filamentation instability
appears therefore as an increasingly robust mechanism to generate shocks.
