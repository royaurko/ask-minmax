We propose a method to improve community division techniques in networks that
are based on agglomeration by introducing dendrogram jumping. The method is
based on iterations of sub-optimal dendrograms instead of optimization of each
agglomeration step. We find the algorithm to exhibit excellent scaling behavior
of its computational complexity. In its present form the algorithm scales as
$\mathcal{O} (N^{2})$, but by using more efficient data structures it is
possible to achieve a scaling of $\mathcal{O} (N \log^{2} N)$. We compare our
results with other methods such as the greedy algorithm and the extremal
optimization method. We find modularity values larger than the greedy algorithm
and values comparable to the extremal optimization method.
