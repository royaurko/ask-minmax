J. Nilsson, G. Walin, and G. Brostroem (paper accepted by Journal of Marine
Research, 2005) have recently shown how a velocity field in geostrophic and
hydrostatic balance in an f-plane may be diagnosed from prescribed
distributions of buoyancy and wind stress, in a basin with closed isobaths. I
extend their analysis to cover basins with more complex depth contours,
treating in particular the behaviour of the flow in the presence of a saddle
point.
