We consider the algorithmic problem of selecting a set of target nodes that
cause the biggest activation cascade in a network. In case when the activation
process obeys the diminishing returns property, a simple hill-climbing
selection mechanism has been shown to achieve a provably good performance. Here
we study models of influence propagation that exhibit critical behavior, and
where the property of diminishing returns does not hold. We demonstrate that in
such systems, the structural properties of networks can play a significant
role. We focus on networks with two loosely coupled communities, and show that
the double-critical behavior of activation spreading in such systems has
significant implications for the targeting strategies. In particular, we show
that simple strategies that work well for homogeneous networks can be overly
sub-optimal, and suggest simple modification for improving the performance, by
taking into account the community structure.
