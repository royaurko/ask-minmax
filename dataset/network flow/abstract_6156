In many real world networks agents are initially unsure of each other's
qualities and learn about each other over time via repeated interactions. This
paper is the first to provide a methodology for studying the formation of such
networks, taking into account that agents differ from each other, that they
begin with incomplete information, and that they must learn through
observations which connections/links to form and which to break. The network
dynamics in our model vary drastically from the dynamics emerging in models of
complete information. With incomplete information and learning, agents who
provide high benefits will develop high reputations and remain in the network,
while agents who provide low benefits will drop in reputation and become
ostracized. We show, among many other things, that the information to which
agents have access and the speed at which they learn and act can have
tremendous impact on the resulting network dynamics. Using our model, we can
also compute the ex ante social welfare given an arbitrary initial network,
which allows us to characterize the socially optimal network structures for
different sets of agents. Importantly, we show through examples that the
optimal network structure depends sharply on both the initial beliefs of the
agents, as well as the rate of learning by the agents.
