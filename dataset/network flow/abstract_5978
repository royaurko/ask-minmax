Street networks, as one of the oldest infrastructures of transport in the
world, play a significant role in modernization, sustainable development, and
human daily activities in both ancient and modern times. Although street
networks have been well studied in a variety of engineering and scientific
disciplines, including for instance transport, geography, urban planning,
economics, and even physics, our understanding of street networks in terms of
their structure and dynamics remains limited, especially when dealing with such
real-world problems as traffic jams, pollution, and human evacuations for
disaster management. One goal of this special issue is to promote different
ways of thinking about understanding street networks, and of conducting spatial
analysis.
