This series explores a new notion of T-homotopy equivalence of flows. The new
definition involves embeddings of finite bounded posets preserving the bottom
and the top elements and the associated cofibrations of flows. In this fourth
part, it is proved that the generalized T-homotopy equivalences preserve the
underlying homotopy type of a flow. The proof is based on Reedy model category
techniques.
