This paper proves that non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic
programs can be solved in polynomial time when their underlying graph is
acyclic, provided the constraints satisfy a certain technical condition. When
this condition is not satisfied, we propose a heuristic to obtain a feasible
point. We demonstrate this approach on optimal power flow problems over radial
networks.
