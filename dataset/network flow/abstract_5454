Collaboration in science is one of the key components of world-class
research. The European Commission supports collaboration between institutions
and funds young researchers appointed by these partner institutions. In these
networks, the mobility of the researchers is enforced in order to enhance the
collaboration. In this study, based on a real Marie Curie Initial Training
Network, an algorithm to construct a collaboration network is investigated. The
algorithm suggests that a strongly efficient expansion leads to a star-like
network. The results might help the design of efficient collaboration networks
for future Initial Training Network proposals.
