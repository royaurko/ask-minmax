Community structure has many practical applications and identifying
communities could help us to understand and exploit networks more effectively.
Generally, real-world networks include several different kinds of nodes which
are general cluster nodes within communities, as well as some special nodes
like hubs and outliers. In addition, real-world networks often have a
hierarchical structure with communities embedded within other communities.
However, there are few effective methods can identify these structures. This
paper proposes an algorithm (OHELPA) to detect overlapping and hierarchical
communities, which also can find hubs and outliers. OHELPA is based on coreness
centrality to update nodes' possible community labels, and uses communities as
nodes to building new network. By repeat the procedure, the proposed algorithm
can effectively reveal the overlapping and hierarchical community structure in
large scale networks. Moreover, it overcomes the high complexity and poor
applicability problem of similar algorithms. To illustrate our methodology, we
conduct experiments with real-world networks for community detection, and
compare with many other classic methods. Experimental results demonstrate that
OHELPA achieves excellent performance.
