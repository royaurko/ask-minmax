Are large biological extinctions such as the Cretaceous/Tertiary KT boundary
due to a meteorite, extreme volcanic activity or self-organized critical
extinction cascades? Are commercial successes due to a progressive reputation
cascade or the result of a well orchestrated advertisement? Determining the
chain of causality for extreme events in complex systems requires disentangling
interwoven exogenous and endogenous contributions with either no clear or too
many signatures. Here, we study the precursory and recovery signatures
accompanying shocks, that we test on a unique database of the Amazon sales
ranking of books. We find clear distinguishing signatures classifying two types
of sales peaks. Exogenous peaks occur abruptly and are followed by a power law
relaxation, while endogenous sale peaks occur after a progressively
accelerating power law growth followed by an approximately symmetrical power
law relaxation which is slower than for exogenous peaks. These results are
rationalized quantitatively by a simple model of epidemic propagation of
interactions with long memory within a network of acquaintances. The slow
relaxation of sales implies that the sales dynamics is dominated by cascades
rather than by the direct effects of news or advertisements, indicating that
the social network is close to critical.
