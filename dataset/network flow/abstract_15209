We consider the delay properties of max-weight opportunistic scheduling in a
multi-user ON/OFF wireless system, such as a multi-user downlink or uplink. It
is well known that max-weight scheduling stabilizes the network (and hence
yields maximum throughput) whenever input rates are inside the network capacity
region. We show that when arrival and channel processes are independent,
average delay of the max-weight policy is order-optimal, in the sense that it
does not grow with the number of network links. While recent queue-grouping
algorithms are known to also yield order-optimal delay, this is the first such
result for the simpler class of max-weight policies. We then consider
multi-rate transmission models and show that average delay in this case
typically does increase with the network size due to queues containing a small
number of "residual" packets.
