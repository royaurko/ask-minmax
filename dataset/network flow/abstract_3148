This paper considers distributed coding for multi-source single-sink data
collection wireless networks. A unified framework for network coding and
channel coding, termed "generalized adaptive network coded cooperation"
(GANCC), is proposed. Key ingredients of GANCC include: matching code graphs
with the dynamic network graphs on-the-fly, and integrating channel coding with
network coding through circulant low-density parity-check codes. Several code
constructing methods and several families of sparse-graph codes are proposed,
and information theoretical analysis is performed. It is shown that GANCC is
simple to operate, adaptive in real time, distributed in nature, and capable of
providing remarkable coding gains even with a very limited number of
cooperating users.
