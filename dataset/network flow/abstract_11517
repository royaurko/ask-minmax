We consider the resource allocation problem in cooperative wireless networks
wherein nodes perform mutual information accumulation. We consider a unicast
setting and arbitrary arrival processes at the source node. Source arrivals can
be broken down into numerous packets to better exploit the spatial and temporal
diversity of the routes available in the network. We devise a
linear-program-based algorithm which allocates network resource to meet a
certain transmission objective. Given a network, a source with multiple
arriving packets and a destination, our algorithm generates a policy that
regulates which nodes should participate in transmitting which packets, when
and with what resource. By routing different packets through different nodes
the policy exploits spatial route diversity, and by sequencing packet
transmissions along the same route it exploits temporal route diversity.
