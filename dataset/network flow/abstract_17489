We present recent results on counting and distribution of circles in a given
circle packing invariant under a geometrically finite Kleinian group and
discuss how the dynamics of flows on geometrically finite hyperbolic $3$
manifolds are related. Our results apply to Apollonian circle packings,
Sierpinski curves, Schottky dances, etc.
