Many researches show that the complicated motion of fluid, such as
turbulence, cannot be well solved by the Navier-Stokes equation. Chen Zida has
founded that the definition of vortex, based on the Stokes decomposition,
cannot well describe the local rotation when the velocity gradient is highly
asymmetric. Chen reformulates the Stokes S+R decomposition into a general S+R
decomposition. By further extending Chen results, this research studies the
motion equation of fluid for the case where highly asymmetric velocity gradient
is exhibited. The result shows that the classical NS equation does not meet the
requirement of angular momentum conservation, which is apparently ignored for
infinitesimal velocity gradient of fluid. This paper reformulates the intrinsic
geometric description of fluid motion and two additional equations are
introduced. Combining with the classical NS equation, the reformulated motion
equations are in closed-form. The research shows that the NS equation is good
approximation for average flow, so it can not solve the turbulent problem in
essential sense. However, this conclusion does not deny that with suitable
additional condition for special engineering problem it is still a would-be
acceptable approximation.
