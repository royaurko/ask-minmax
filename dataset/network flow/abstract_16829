Some BitTorrent users are running BitTorrent on top of Tor to preserve their
privacy. In this extended abstract, we discuss three different attacks to
reveal the IP address of BitTorrent users on top of Tor. In addition, we
exploit the multiplexing of streams from different applications into the same
circuit to link non-BitTorrent applications to revealed IP addresses.
