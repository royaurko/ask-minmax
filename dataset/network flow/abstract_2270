We obtain a criterion for pulsating front speed-up by general periodic
incompressible flows in two dimensions and in the presence of KPP
nonlinearities. We achieve this by showing that the ratio of the minimal front
speed and the effective diffusivity of the flow is bounded away from zero and
infinity by constants independent of the flow. We also study speed-up of
reaction-diffusion fronts by various examples of flows in two and three
dimensions.
