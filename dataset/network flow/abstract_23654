We study the behavior of the random walk on the infinite cluster of
independent long range percolation in dimensions $d=1,2$, where $x$ and $y$ a
re connected with probability $\sim\beta/\|x-y\|^{-s}$. We show that when
$d<s<2d$ the walk is transient, and when $s\geq 2d$, the walk is recurrent. The
proof of transience is based on a renormalization argument. As a corollary of
this renormalization argument, we get that for every dimension $d$, if
$d<s<2d$, then critical percolation has no infinite clusters. This result is
extended to the free random cluster model. A second corollary is that when
$d\geq 2$ and $d<s<2d$ we can erase all long enough bonds and still have an
infinite cluster. The proof of recurrence in two dimensions is based on general
stability results for recurrence in random electrical networks. In particular,
we show that i.i.d. conductances on a recurrent graph of bounded degree yield a
recurrent electrical network.
