We study the Greek and Roman mythology using the network theory. We construct
a directed network by using a dictionary of Greek and Roman mythology in which
the nodes represent the entries listed in the dictionary and we make
directional links from an entry to other entries that appear in its explanatory
part. We find that this network is clearly not a random network but a directed
scale-free network. Also measuring the various quantities which characterize
the mythology network, we analyze the Greek and Roman mythology and compare it
to other real networks.
