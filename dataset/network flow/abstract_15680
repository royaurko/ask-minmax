Quantitative analysis of channel networks plays an important role in river
studies. To provide a quantitative representation of channel networks, we
propose a new method that extracts channels from remotely sensed images and
estimates their widths. Our fully automated method is based on a recently
proposed Multiscale Singularity Index that responds strongly to curvilinear
structures but weakly to edges. The algorithm produces a channel map, using a
single image where water and non-water pixels have contrast, such as a Landsat
near-infrared band image or a water index defined on multiple bands. The
proposed method provides a robust alternative to the procedures that are used
in remote sensing of fluvial geomorphology and makes classification and
analysis of channel networks easier. The source code of the algorithm is
