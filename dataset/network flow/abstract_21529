We present results of a renormalization-group calculation of the thermal
conductivity of confined $\rm^4$He in a $L^2 \times \infty$ geometry above and
at $T_\lambda$ within model F with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the order
parameter. We assume a heat flow parallel to the boundaries which implies
Neumann boundary conditions for the entropy density. No adjustable parameters
other than those known from bulk theory and static finite-size theory are used.
Our theoretical results are compared with experimental data by Kahn and Ahlers.
