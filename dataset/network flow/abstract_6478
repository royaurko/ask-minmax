Termites present a very good natural metaphor to evolutionary computation.
While each individuals computational power is small compared to more evolved
species, it is the power of their colonies that inspires communication
engineers. This paper presents a study of artificial termites in sensor
networks for the purpose of solving its routing problem. The behaviors of each
of the termites in their colony allow their simulation in a restricted
environment. The simulating behavior demonstrates how the termites make use of
an auto-catalytic behavior in order to collectively find a solution for a posed
problem in reasonable time. The derived algorithm termed Termite-hill
demonstrates the principle of termites behavior to routing problem solving in
the real applications of sensor networks. The performance of the algorithm was
tested on static and dynamic sink scenarios. The results as compared with other
routing algorithms and with varying network density show that Termite-hill is
scalable and improved on network energy consumption with a control over
best-effort-service.
