Extrinsic Geometric Flow (EGF) for a codimension-one foliation has been
recently introduced by contributors as deformations of Riemannian metrics subject to
quantities expressed in terms of its second fundamental form. In the paper we
introduce soliton solutions to EGF and study their geometry for totally
umbilical foliations, foliations on surfaces, and when the EGF is produced by
the extrinsic Ricci tensor.
