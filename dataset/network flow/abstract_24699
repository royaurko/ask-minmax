Motivated by the growing interest in today's massive parallel computing
capabilities we analyze a queueing network with many servers in parallel to
which jobs arrive a according to a Poisson process. Each job, upon arrival, is
split into several pieces which are randomly routed to specific servers in the
network, without centralized information about the status of the servers'
individual queues. The main feature of this system is that the different pieces
of a job must initiate their service in a synchronized fashion. Moreover, the
system operates in a FCFS basis. The synchronization and service discipline
create blocking and idleness among the servers, which is compensated by the
fast service time attained through the parallelization of the work. We analyze
the stationary waiting time distribution of jobs under a many servers limit and
provide exact tail asymptotics; these asymptotics generalize the celebrated
Cram\'er-Lundberg approximation for the single-server queue.
