We calculate the central charges a, c and k_G of a large class of
four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories arising from compactifying
the six-dimensional N=(2,0) theory on a Riemann surface with regular and
irregular punctures. We also study the renormalization group flows between the
general Argyres-Douglas theories, which all agree with the a-theorem.
