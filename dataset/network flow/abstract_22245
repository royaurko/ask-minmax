Kahn and Markovic \cite{KahnMark} proved that the fundamental group of each
closed hyperbolic three manifold contains a closed surface subgroup. One of the
main ingredients in their proof is a theorem which states that an assignment of
nearly real, complex Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates to the cuffs of a pants
decomposition of a closed surface $S$ induces a quasiFuchsian representation of
the fundamental group of $S$. We give a new proof of this theorem with a
slightly stronger conditions on the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates and explain how
to use the exponential mixing of the geodesic flow on a closed hyperbolic three
manifold to prove that our theorem is sufficient for the applications in the
work of Kahn and Markovic \cite{KahnMark}.
