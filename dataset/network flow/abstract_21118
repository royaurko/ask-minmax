Polarization fluctuations were measured in nanoscale volumes of a polymer
glass during aging following a temperature quench through the glass transition.
Statistical properties of the noise were studied in equilibrium and during
aging. The noise spectral density had a larger temporal variance during aging,
i.e. the noise was more non-Gaussian, demonstrating stronger correlations
during aging.
