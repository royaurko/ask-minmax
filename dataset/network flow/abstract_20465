Efficiency, comfort, and convenience are three major aspects in the design of
control systems for residential Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning
(HVAC) units. In this paper we propose an optimization-based algorithm for HVAC
control that minimizes the energy consumption while maintains a desired
temperature in a room. Our algorithm uses a Computer Fluid Dynamics model,
mathematically formulated using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), to
describe the interactions between temperature, pressure, and air flow. Our
model allow us to naturally formulate problems such as controlling the
temperature of a small region of interest within a room, or to control the
direction of the air flow at the vents at the same time we control its speed,
which are hard to describe using finite-dimensional ODE models. Our results
show that our algorithm produce significant energy savings without a decrease
of comfort.
