Nowadays, information spreading on social networks has triggered an explosive
attention in various disciplines. Most of previous works in this area mainly
focus on discussing the effects of spreading probability or immunization
strategy on static networks. However, in real systems, the peer-to-peer network
structure changes constantly according to frequently social activities of
users. In order to capture this dynamical property and study its impact on
information spreading, in this paper, a link rewiring strategy based on the
Fermi function is introduced. In the present model, the informed individuals
tend to break old links and reconnect to their second-order friends with more
uninformed neighbors. Simulation results on the susceptible-infected-recovered
(\textit{SIR}) model with fixed recovery time $T=1$ indicate that the
information would spread more faster and broader with the proposed rewiring
strategy. Extensive analyses of the information cascade size distribution show
that the spreading process of the initial steps plays a very important role,
that is to say, the information will spread out if it is still survival at the
beginning time. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth
understanding of information spreading on dynamical social networks.
