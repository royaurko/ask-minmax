Social networks have risen to prominence over the last years as the
predominant form of electronic interaction between individuals. In an attempt
to harness the power of the large user base which they have managed to attract,
this study proposes an e-learning prototype which integrates concepts of the
social and semantic web. A selected set of services are deployed which have
been scientifically proven to positively impact the learning process of users
via electronic means. The integrability of these services into a social network
platform application is visualized through an exploratory prototype. The
Graphical User Interface (GUI) which is developed to implement these key
features is in alignment with User-Centered principles. The designed prototype
proves that a number of services can be integrated in a user-friendly
application and can potentially serve to gain feedback regarding additional
aspects that should be included.
