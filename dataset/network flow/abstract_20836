Modern ICT (Information and Communication Technology) has developed a vision
where the "computer" is no longer associated with the concept of a single
device or a network of devices, but rather the entirety of situated services
originating in a digital world, which are perceived through the physical world.
It is observed that services with explicit user input and output are becoming
to be replaced by a computing landscape sensing the physical world via a huge
variety of sensors, and controlling it via a plethora of actuators. The nature
and appearance of computing devices is changing to be hidden in the fabric of
everyday life, invisibly networked, and omnipresent, with applications greatly
being based on the notions of context and knowledge. Interaction with such
globe spanning, modern ICT systems will presumably be more implicit, at the
periphery of human attention, rather than explicit, i.e. at the focus of human
attention. Socio-inspired ICT assumes that future, globe scale ICT systems
should be viewed as social systems. Such a view challenges research to identify
and formalize the principles of interaction and adaptation in social systems,
so as to be able to ground future ICT systems on those principles. This
position paper therefore is concerned with the intersection of social behaviour
and modern ICT, creating or recreating social conventions and social contexts
through the use of pervasive, globe-spanning, omnipresent and participative
ICT.
