The basic idea of many effective immunization strategies is first to rank the
importance of vertices according to the degrees of vertices and then remove the
vertices from highest importance to lowest until the network becomes
disconnected. Here we define the effective degrees of vertex, i.e., the number
of its connections linking to un-immunized nodes in current network during the
immunization procedure, to rank the importance of vertex, and modify these
strategies by using the effective degrees of vertices. Simulations on both the
scale-free network models with various degree correlations and two real
networks have revealed that the immunization strategies based on the effective
degrees are often more effective than those based on the degrees in the initial
network.
