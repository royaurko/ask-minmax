To conceive the full potential of wireless IP services, Mobile Nodes (MNs)
must be able to roam seamlessly across different networks. Mobile Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP) is a transport layer solution, which
unlike Mobile IP (MIP), provides seamless mobility with minimum delay and
negligible packet loss. However, mSCTP fails to locate the current IP address
of the mobile node when Correspondent Node (CN) wants to initiate a session. In
this paper, we propose DHT Chord to provide the required location management.
Chord is a P2P algorithm, which can efficiently provide the IP address of the
called MN by using its key-value mapping. The proposed decentralized mobility
framework collectively exploits the multihoming feature of mSCTP, and efficient
key-value mapping of chord to provide seamless mobility. Suitability of the
framework is analyzed by preliminary analysis of chord lookup efficiency, and
mSCTP handover procedure using overlay weaver and NS-2. Performance analysis
shows that mSCTP multihoming feature and Chord efficient key-value mapping can
provide a non-delayed, reliable, and an efficient IP handover solution.
