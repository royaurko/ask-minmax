We consider the NP-complete network connectivity problem of Dual Power
Assignment (DPA). This models an ad hoc networks where each node can either
operate at high or low power. The goal is to produce a minimum power strongly
connected network. We give a Dual-Fitting algorithm to DPA with a
3/2-approximation ratio, improving the previous best know approximation of
$11/7\approx 1.57$. Another standard network design problem is Minimum Strongly
Connected Spanning Subgraph (MSCS). We propose a new problem generalizing MSCS
and DPA called Star Strong Connectivity (SSC). Then we show that our
Dual-Fitting approach achieves a 1.6-approximation ratio to SSC. This
Dual-Fitting approach may have applications to other connectivity programs with
cut-based linear programming relaxations. As a result of our approximations, we
prove new upper bounds on the integrality gaps of these problems. For
completeness, we present a family of instances of MSCS (and thus SSC) with
integrality gap approaching 4/3.
