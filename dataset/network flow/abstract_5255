We experimentally investigate flow of quasi two-dimensional disordered foams
in Couette geometries, both for foams squeezed below a top plate and for freely
floating foams. With the top-plate, the flows are strongly localized and rate
dependent. For the freely floating foams the flow profiles become essentially
rate-independent, the local and global rheology do not match, and in particular
the foam flows in regions where the stress is below the global yield stress. We
attribute this to nonlocal effects and show that the "fluidity" model recently
introduced by Goyon {\em et al.} ({\em Nature}, {\bf 454} (2008)) captures the
essential features of flow both with and without a top plate.
