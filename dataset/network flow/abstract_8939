We identify and discuss a family of azimuthally symmetric, incompressible,
magnetohydrodynamic plasma equilibria with poloidal and toroidal flows in terms
of solutions of the Generalized Grad Shafranov (GGS) equation. These solutions
are derived by exploiting the incompressibility assumption, in order to rewrite
the GGS equation in terms of a different dependent variable, and the continuous
Lie symmetry properties of the resulting equation and in particular a special
type of "weak" symmetries.
