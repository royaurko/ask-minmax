The quark gluon plasma produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions
exhibits remarkable features. It behaves like a nearly perfect liquid with a
small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and leads to the quenching of
highly energetic particles. We show that both effects can be understood for the
first time within one common framework. Employing the parton cascade Boltzmann
Approach to Multi-Parton Scatterings (BAMPS), the microscopic interactions and
the space-time evolution of the quark gluon plasma are calculated by solving
the relativistic Boltzmann equation. Based on cross sections obtained from
perturbative QCD with explicitly taking the running coupling into account, we
calculate the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow in
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. With only one single parameter
associated with coherence effects of medium-induced gluon radiation, the
experimental data of both observables can be understood on a microscopic level.
Furthermore, we show that perturbative QCD interactions with a running coupling
lead to a sufficiently small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the
quark gluon plasma, which provides a microscopic explanation for the
observations stated by hydrodynamic calculations.
