Explosive percolation in a network is a phase transition where a large
portion of nodes becomes connected with an addition of a small number of edges.
Although extensively studied in random network models and reconstructed real
networks, explosive percolation has not been observed in a more realistic
scenario where a network is generated by thresholding a similarity matrix
describing between-node associations. In this report, I examine construction
schemes of such thresholded networks, and demonstrate that explosive
percolation can be observed by introducing edges in a particular order.
