Future Information Retrieval, especially in connection with the internet,
will incorporate the content descriptions that are generated with social
network extraction technologies and preferably incorporate the probability
theory for assigning the semantic. Although there is an increasing interest
about social network extraction, but a little of them has a significant impact
to infomation retrieval. Therefore this paper proposes a model of information
retrieval from the social network extraction.
