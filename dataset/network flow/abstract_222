In this paper we investigate the limiting values of the lift and drag
coefficients of profiles in the Helmholtz--Kirchhoff (infinite cavity) flow.
The coefficients are based on the wetted arc length of profile surfaces.
Namely, for a given value of the lift coefficient we find minimum and maximum
values of the drag coefficient. Thereby, we determine maximum and minimum
values of the lift-to-drag ratios.
