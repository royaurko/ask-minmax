We introduce a flow of Riemannian metrics and positive volume forms over
compact oriented manifolds whose formal limit is a shrinking Ricci soliton. The
case of a fixed volume form has been considered in our previous work. We still
call this new flow the Soliton-Ricci flow. It corresponds to a forward Ricci
type flow up to a gauge transformation generated by the gradient of the density
of the volumes. The new Soliton-Ricci flow exist for all times and represents
the gradient flow of Perelman's $\mathcal{W}$ functional with respect to a
pseudo-Riemannian structure over the space of metrics and normalized positive
volume forms. We obtain an expression of the Hessian of the $\mathcal{W}$
functional with respect to such structure. Our expression shows the elliptic
nature of this operator in directions orthogonal to the orbits obtained by the
action of the group of diffeomorphism. In the case the initial data is K\"ahler
then the Soliton-Ricci flow preserves the K\"ahler condition and the symplectic
form. The space of tamed complex structures embeds naturally to the space of
metrics and normalized positive volume forms via the Chern-Ricci map. Over such
space the pseudo-Riemannian structure restricts to a Riemannian one. We perform
a study of the sign of the restriction of the Hessian of the $\mathcal{W}$
functional over such space. This allows us to obtain a finite dimensional
reduction, and thus the solution, of the well known problem of the stability of
K\"ahler-Ricci solitons.
