Self-similar networks with scale-free degree distribution have recently
attracted much attention, since these apparently incompatible properties were
reconciled in a paper by Song et al. by an appropriate box-counting method that
enters the measurement of the fractal dimension. We study two genetic
regulatory networks ({\it Saccharomyces cerevisiae} and {\it Escherichai coli}
and show their self-similar and scale-free features, in extension to the
datasets studied by Song et al. Moreover, by a number of numerical results we
support the conjecture that self-similar scale-free networks are not
assortative. From our simulations so far these networks seem to be
disassortative instead. We also find that the qualitative feature of
disassortativity is scale-invariant under renormalization, but it appears as an
intrinsic feature of the renormalization prescription, as even assortative
networks become disassortative after a sufficient number of renormalization
steps.
