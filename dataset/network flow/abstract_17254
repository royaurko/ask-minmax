In this work, we are interested in the negotiation between several PU and
several SU in a cognitive radio context by using multi-agent systems. So, we
have implemented PU coalitions (CPU) and SU coalitions (CSU). We also used the
multi-criteria decision (TOPSIS algorithm) to best meet the needs of
SU.Management by coalitions and the aggregation technique that we have used in
this context significantly reduce the number of messages exchanged in the
network. Processing negotiations simultaneously by several CSU minimizes
response time side SU.
