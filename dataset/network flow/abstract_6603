In this research report, we examine the effects of small-world network
organization on spike synchronization dynamics in networks of Izhikevich
spiking units. We interpolate network organizations from regular ring lattices,
through the small-world region, to random networks, and measure global spike
synchronization dynamics. We examine how average path length and clustering
effect the dynamics of global and neighborhood clique spike organization and
propagation. We show that the emergence of global synchronization undergoes a
phase transition in the small-world region, between the clustering and path
length phase transitions that are known to exist. We add additional realistic
constraints on the dynamics by introducing propagation delays of spiking
signals proportional to wiring length. The addition of delays interferes with
the ability of random networks to sustain global synchronization, in relation
to the breakdown of clustering in the networks. The addition of delays further
enhances the finding that small-world organization is beneficial for balancing
neighborhood synchronized waves of organization with global synchronization
dynamics.
