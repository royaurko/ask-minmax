A highly efficient formulation of moment equations for stochastic reaction
networks is introduced. It is based on a set of binomial moments that capture
the combinatorics of the reaction processes. The resulting set of equations can
be easily runcated to include moments up to any desired order. The number of
equations is dramatically reduced compared to the master equation. This
formulation enables the simulation of complex reaction networks, involving a
large number of reactive species much beyond the feasibility limit of any
existing method. It provides an equation-based paradigm to the analysis of
stochastic networks, complementing the commonly used Monte Carlo simulations.
