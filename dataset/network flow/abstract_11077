A dramatic increase in the number of computing devices with wireless
communication capability has resulted in the emergence of a new class of
computer worms which specifically target such devices. The most striking
feature of these worms is that they do not require Internet connectivity for
their propagation but can spread directly from device to device using a
short-range radio communication technology, such as WiFi or Bluetooth. In this
paper, we develop a new model for epidemic spreading of these worms and
investigate their spreading in wireless ad hoc networks via extensive Monte
Carlo simulations. Our studies show that the threshold behaviour and dynamics
of worm epidemics in these networks are greatly affected by a combination of
spatial and temporal correlations which characterize these networks, and are
significantly different from the previously studied epidemics in the Internet.
