Novel method of reconstructing dynamical networks from empirically measured
time series is proposed. By examining the variable--derivative correlation of
network node pairs, we derive a simple equation that directly yields the
adjacency matrix, assuming the intra-network interaction functions to be known.
We illustrate the method on a simple example, and discuss the dependence of the
reconstruction precision on the properties of time series. Our method is
applicable to any network, allowing for reconstruction precision to be
maximized, and errors to be estimated.
