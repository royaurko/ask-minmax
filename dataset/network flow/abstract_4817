We present results for the elliptic and triangular flow coefficients in Au+Au
collisions at root-s=200 AGeV using event-by-event (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic
simulations. We study the effect of initial state fluctuations and finite
viscosities on the flow coefficients v_2 and v_3 as functions of transverse
momentum and pseudo-rapidity. Fluctuations are essential to reproduce the
measured centrality dependence of elliptic flow. We argue that simultaneous
measurements of v_2 and v_3 can determine eta/s more precisely.
