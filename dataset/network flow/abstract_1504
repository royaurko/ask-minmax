Hybrid traffic modeling and simulation provide an important way to represent
and evaluate large-scale traffic networks at different levels of details. The
first level, called "microscopic" allows the description of individual vehicles
and their interactions as well as the study of driver's individual behavior.
The second, based on the analogy with fluidic dynamic, is the "macroscopic" one
and provides an efficient way to represent traffic flow behavior in large
traffic infrastructures, using three aggregated variables: traffic density,
mean speed and traffic volume. An intermediate level called "mesoscopic"
considers a group of vehicles sharing common properties such as a same origin
and destination. The work conducted in this paper presents a first step
allowing simulation of wide area traffic network on the basis of dynamic hybrid
modeling, where the representation associated to a network section can change
at runtime. The proposed approach is implemented in a simulation platform,
called Jam-free.
