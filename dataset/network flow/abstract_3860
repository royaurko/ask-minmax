The interest for networks of dynamical systems has been increasing in the
past years, especially because of their capability of modeling and describing a
large variety of phenomena and behaviors. We propose a technique, based on
Wiener filtering, which provides general theoretical guarantees for the
detection of links in a network of dynamical systems. For a large class of
network that we name "self-kin" sufficient conditions for a correct detection
of a link are formulated. For networks not belonging to this class we give
conditions for correct detection of links belonging to the smallest self-kin
network containing the actual one.
