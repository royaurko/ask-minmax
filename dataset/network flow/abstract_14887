Failure and flow of amorphous materials are central to various phenomena
including earthquakes and landslides. There is accumulating evidence that the
yielding transition between a flowing and an arrested phase is a critical
phenomenon, but the associated exponents are not understood, even at a
mean-field level where the validity of popular models is debated. Here we solve
a mean-field model that captures the broad distribution of the mechanical noise
generated by plasticity, whose behavior is related to biased L\'evy flights
near an absorbing boundary. We compute the exponent $\theta$ characterizing the
density of shear transformation $P(x)\sim x^{\theta}$, where $x$ is the stress
increment beyond which they yield. We find that after an isotropic thermal
quench, $\theta=1/2$. However, $\theta$ depends continuously on the applied
shear stress, this dependence is not monotonic, and its value at the yield
stress is not universal. The model rationalizes previously unexplained
observations, and captures reasonably well the value of exponents in three
dimensions. These results support that it is the true mean-field model that
applies in large dimension, and raise fundamental questions on the nature of
the yielding transition.
