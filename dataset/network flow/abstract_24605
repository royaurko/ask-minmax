Neural network techniques are widely applied to obtain high-quality
distributed representations of words, i.e., word embeddings, to address text
mining, information retrieval, and natural language processing tasks. Recently,
efficient methods have been proposed to learn word embeddings from context that
captures both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. However, it
is challenging to handle unseen words or rare words with insufficient context.
In this paper, inspired by the study on word recognition process in cognitive
psychology, we propose to take advantage of seemingly less obvious but
essentially important morphological knowledge to address these challenges. In
particular, we introduce a novel neural network architecture called KNET that
leverages both contextual information and morphological word similarity built
based on morphological knowledge to learn word embeddings. Meanwhile, the
learning architecture is also able to refine the pre-defined morphological
knowledge and obtain more accurate word similarity. Experiments on an
analogical reasoning task and a word similarity task both demonstrate that the
proposed KNET framework can greatly enhance the effectiveness of word
embeddings.
