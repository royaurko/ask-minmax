Coarsening systems under uniform shear display a long time regime
characterized by the presence of highly stretched and thin domains. The
question then arises whether thermal fluctuations may actually destroy this
layered structure. To address this problem in the case of non-conserved
dynamics we study an anisotropic version of the Burgers equation, constructed
to describe thermal fluctuations of an interface in the presence of a uniform
shear flow. As a result, we find that stretched domains are only marginally
stable against thermal fluctuations in $d=2$, whereas they are stable in $d=3$.
