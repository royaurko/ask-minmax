An information theory description of finite systems explicitly evolving in
time is presented. We impose a MaxEnt variational principle on the Shannon
entropy at a given time while the constraints are set at a former time. The
resulting density matrix contains explicit time odd components in the form of
collective flows. As a specific application we consider the dynamics of the
expansion in connection with heavy ion experiments. Lattice gas and classical
molecular dynamics simulations are shown.
