Intersections of pedestrian flows feature multiple types, varying in the
numbers of flow directions as well as intersecting angles. In this article
results from diverse bidirectional flow experiments with different intersecting
angles are compared. To analyze the transport capabilities the Voronoi method
is used to resolve the fine structure of the resulting velocity-density
relations and spatial dependence of the measurements. The fundamental diagrams
of various flow types are compared and show no apparent difference with respect
to the intersecting angle. This result indicates that head-on conflicts of
different types of flow have the same influence on the transport properties of
the system, which demonstrates the high self-organization capabilities of
pedestrians.
