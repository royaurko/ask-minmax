This paper deals with the estimation of the performance and stability for a
shrouded-fan unmanned rotorcraft whose mission profile also prescribes the
flight in ground effect. The not so simple estimation of the aerodynamic
coefficients and of the thrust in the various situations makes the performance
calculation and the stability analysis difficult tasks. This is due to the
strong interaction between the fan flow and shroud that causes quite different
flow structures about the airframe depending on flight conditions. A further
difficulty is related to the ground effect which produces substantial
modifications in the rotor thrust and aerodynamic coefficients. To evaluate
performance and stability, two models have been developed. One determines the
aerodynamic coefficients of the shroud, whereas the other one calculates thrust
and moment of the rotors system. Both models take into account the mutual
interference between fan flow and fuselage and ground effect. Performance and
stability are then discussed with reference to significant flight conditions.
