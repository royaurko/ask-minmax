Particles with density different from that of the advecting turbulent fluid
cluster due to the different response of light/heavy particles to turbulent
fluctuations. This study focuses on the quantitative characterization of the
segregation of dilute poly-disperse inertial particles evolving in turbulent
flow, as obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation of the Navier-Stokes
equations. We introduce an indicator of segregation amongst particles of
different inertia and/or size, from which a length scale r_{seg} quantifying
the degree of segregation of two different types of particles is deduced.
