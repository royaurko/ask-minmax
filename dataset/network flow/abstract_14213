We put forward an alternative view to the Bondi-driven feedback between
heating and cooling of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) in cooling flow galaxies
and clusters. We adopt the popular view that the heating is due to an active
galactic nucleus (AGN), i.e. a central black hole accreting mass and launching
jets and/or winds. We propose that the feedback occurs with the entire cool
inner region (5-30 kpc). A moderate cooling flow does exist here, and
non-linear over-dense blobs of gas cool fast and are removed from the ICM
before experiencing the next major AGN heating event. Some of these blobs may
not accrete on the central black hole, but may form stars and cold molecular
clouds. We discuss the conditions under which the dense blobs may cool to low
temperatures and feed the black hole.
