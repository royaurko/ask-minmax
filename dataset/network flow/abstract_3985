A hybrid social network for building social communities for a university
community is presented. The system employed the semantic ontology for an
offline/online social network site (SNS). It captures the core features of an
SNS including profile creation, friend invite/search, group formation,
chatting/messaging, blogging and voting. Three core frameworks - the peer2me
framework, SMSN semantic mobile social network and Peoplepods framework were
considered in the implementation phase. The results show remarkable matching
performance for prosumers with similar interests with relevance close to unity.
The social network was able to capture the needs of the university students by
serving as a handy direction to popular locations within the campus.
