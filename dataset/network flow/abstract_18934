We study asymptotic dynamical patterns that emerge among a set of nodes that
interact in a dynamically evolving signed random network. Node interactions
take place at random on a sequence of deterministic signed graphs. Each node
receives positive or negative recommendations from its neighbors depending on
the sign of the interaction arcs, and updates its state accordingly. Positive
recommendations follow the standard consensus update while two types of
negative recommendations, each modeling a different type of antagonistic or
malicious interaction, are considered. Nodes may weigh positive and negative
recommendations differently, and random processes are introduced to model the
time-varying attention that nodes pay to the positive and negative
recommendations. Various conditions for almost sure convergence, divergence,
and clustering of the node states are established. Some fundamental
similarities and differences are established for the two notions of negative
recommendations.
