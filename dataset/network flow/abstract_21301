In this article, we introduce a new method to model stochastic gene
expression. The protein concentration dynamics follows a backward stochastic
differential equation (BSDE). To validate our approach we employ the Gillespie
method to generate benchmark data. The numerical simulation shows that the data
produced by both methods agree quite well.
