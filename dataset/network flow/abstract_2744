The Sznajd model has been largely applied to simulate many sociophysical
phenomena. In this paper we applied the Sznajd model with more than two
opinions on three different network topologies and observed the evolution of
surviving opinions after many interactions among the nodes. As result, we
obtained a scaling law which depends of the network size and the number of
possible opinions. We also observed that this scaling law is not the same for
all network topologies, being quite similar between scale-free networks and
Sznajd networks but different for random networks.
