We investigate the dynamics of two models of biological networks with purely
suppressive interactions between the units; species interacting via niche
competition and neurons via inhibitory synaptic coupling. In both of these
cases, power-law scaling of the density of states with probability arises
without any fine-tuning of the model parameters. These results argue against
the increasingly popular notion that non-equilibrium living systems operate at
special critical points, driven by there by evolution so as to enable adaptive
processing of input data.
