We introduce a family of new centralities, the k-spectral centralities.
k-Spectral centrality is a measurement of importance with respect to the
deformation of the graph Laplacian associated with the graph. Due to this
connection, k-spectral centralities have various interpretations in terms of
spectrally determined information.
  We explore this centrality in the context of several examples. While for
sparse unweighted networks 1-spectral centrality behaves similarly to other
standard centralities, for dense weighted networks they show different
properties. In summary, the k-spectral centralities provide a novel and useful
measurement of relevance (for single network elements as well as whole
subnetworks) distinct from other known measures.
