A game-theoretic approach for studying power control in multiple-access
networks with transmission delay constraints is proposed. A non-cooperative
power control game is considered in which each user seeks to choose a transmit
power that maximizes its own utility while satisfying the user's delay
requirements. The utility function measures the number of reliable bits
transmitted per joule of energy and the user's delay constraint is modeled as
an upper bound on the delay outage probability. The Nash equilibrium for the
proposed game is derived, and its existence and uniqueness are proved. Using a
large-system analysis, explicit expressions for the utilities achieved at
equilibrium are obtained for the matched filter, decorrelating and minimum mean
square error multiuser detectors. The effects of delay constraints on the
users' utilities (in bits/Joule) and network capacity (i.e., the maximum number
of users that can be supported) are quantified.
