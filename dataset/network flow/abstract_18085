On directed Barabasi-Albert networks with two and seven neighbours selected
by each added site, the Ising model does not seem to show a spontaneous
magnetisation. Instead, the decay time for flipping of the magnetisation
follows an Arrhenius law for Metropolis and Glauber algorithms, but for Wolff
cluster flipping the magnetisation decays exponentially with time. On these
networks the magnetisation behaviour of the Ising model, with Glauber,
HeatBath,
 Metropolis, Wolf or Swendsen-Wang algorithm competing against Kawasaki
dynamics, is studied by Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the model
exhibits the phenomenon of self-organisation (= stationary equilibrium) when
 Kawasaki dynamics is not dominant in its competition with Glauber, HeatBath
and Swendsen-Wang algorithms. Only for Wolff cluster flipping the
magnetisation, this phenomenon occurs after an exponentially decay of
magnetisation with time. The Metropolis results are independent of competition.
We also study the same process of competition described above but with Kawasaki
dynamics at the same temperature as the other algorithms. The obtained results
are similar for Wolff cluster flipping, Metropolis and Swendsen-Wang algorithms
but different for HeatBath.
