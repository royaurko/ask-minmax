We construct the first example of asymptotically flat solution which carries
three charges (D1,D5 and momentum) and which is completely regular everywhere.
The construction utilizes the relation between gravity solutions and spectral
flow in the dual CFT. We show that the solution has the right properties to
describe one of the microscopic states which are responsible for the entropy of
the black hole with three charges.
