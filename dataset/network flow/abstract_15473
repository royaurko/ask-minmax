In many applications, it is a basic operation for the sink to periodically
collect reports from all sensors. Since the data gathering process usually
proceeds for many rounds, it is important to collect these data efficiently,
that is, to reduce the energy cost of data transmission. Under such
applications, a tree is usually adopted as the routing structure to save the
computation costs for maintaining the routing tables of sensors. In this paper,
we work on the problem of constructing a data aggregation tree that minimizes
the total energy cost of data transmission in a wireless sensor network. In
addition, we also address such a problem in the wireless sensor network where
relay nodes exist. We show these two problems are NP-complete, and propose
O(1)-approximation algorithms for each of them. Simulations show that the
proposed algorithms each have good performance in terms of the energy cost.
