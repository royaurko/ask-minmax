We re-examine the vertical structure of the post-shock flow in the accretion
region of mCVs, and the X-ray emission as a function of height. We then predict
X-ray light curves and phase-resolved spectra, taking into account the vertical
structure, examine the implications and check whether the predicted heights are
compatible with observation.
