We propose an explanation for the appearance of superconductivity at the
interfaces of graphite with Bernal stacking order. A network of line defects
with flat bands appears at the interfaces between two slightly twisted graphite
structures. Due to the flat band the probability to find high temperature
superconductivity at these quasi one-dimensional corridors is strongly
enhanced. When the network of superconducting lines is dense it becomes
effectively two-dimensional. The model provides an explanation for several
reports on the observation of superconductivity up to room temperature in
different oriented graphite samples, graphite powders as well as
graphite-composite samples published in the past.
