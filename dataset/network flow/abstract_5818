This paper addresses a method to analyze the covert social network foundation
hidden behind the terrorism disaster. It is to solve a node discovery problem,
which means to discover a node, which functions relevantly in a social network,
but escaped from monitoring on the presence and mutual relationship of nodes.
The method aims at integrating the expert investigator's prior understanding,
insight on the terrorists' social network nature derived from the complex graph
theory, and computational data processing. The social network responsible for
the 9/11 attack in 2001 is used to execute simulation experiment to evaluate
the performance of the method.
