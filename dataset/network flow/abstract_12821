We discuss the role that magnetic fields in low luminosity accretion flows
can play in creating and maintaining a multi-phase medium, and show that small
magnetically-confined clouds or filaments of dense cold gas can dramatically
reprocess the `primary' radiation from tori. In particular, radio emission
would be suppressed by free-free absorption, and an extra (weak) component
would appear at optical wavelengths. This is expected to be a common process in
various environments in the central regions of Active Galaxies, such as broad
line regions, accretion disk coronae and jets.
