We apply an algorithm for radiative feedback on a dusty flow (detailed in
Edgar and Clarke (2003)) to the problem of Bondi--Hoyle accretion. This
calculation is potentially relevant to the formation of massive stars in
ultradense cores of stellar clusters. We find that radiative feedback is
\emph{more effective} than in the case of previous calculations in spherical
symmetry. The Bondi-Hoyle geometry implies that material is flowing nearly
tangentially when it experiences the sharp radiative impulse at the dust
destruction radius, and consequently it is readily perturbed into outflowing
orbits. We find that it is difficult for stellar masses to grow beyond around
10 M_sol (for standard interstellar dust abundances). We discuss the possible
implications of this result for the formation mechanism of OB stars in cluster
cores. We end by proposing a series of conditions which must be fulfilled if
Bondi--Hoyle accretion is to continue.
