We study the dynamics of network-coupled phase oscillators in the presence of
coupling frustration. It was recently demonstrated that in heterogeneous
network topologies, the presence of coupling frustration causes perfect phase
synchronization to become unattainable even in the limit of infinite coupling
strength. Here, we consider the important case of heterogeneous coupling
functions and extend previous results by deriving analytical predictions for
the total erosion of synchronization. Our analytical results are given in terms
of basic quantities related to the network structure and coupling frustration.
In addition to fully heterogeneous coupling, where each individual interaction
is allowed to be distinct, we also consider partially heterogeneous coupling
and homogeneous coupling in which the coupling functions are either unique to
each oscillator or identical for all network interactions, respectively. We
demonstrate the validity of our theory with numerical simulations of multiple
network models, and highlight the interesting effects that various coupling
choices and network models have on the total erosion of synchronization.
Finally, we consider some special network structures with well-known spectral
properties, which allows us to derive further analytical results.
