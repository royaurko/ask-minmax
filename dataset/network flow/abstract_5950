Wordnets are semantic networks containing nouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs organized according to linguistic principles, by means of semantic
relations. In this work, we adopt a complex network perspective to perform a
comparative analysis of the English and Polish wordnets. We determine their
similarities and show that the networks exhibit some of the typical
characteristics observed in other real-world networks. We analyse interlingual
relations between both wordnets and deliberate over the problem of mapping the
Polish lexicon onto the English one.
