This paper describes the results of our theoretical and numerical studies of
hydrodynamic interactions in a suspension of spherical particles confined
between two parallel planar walls, under creeping-flow conditions. We propose a
novel algorithm for accurate evaluation of the many-particle friction matrix in
this system--no such algorithm has been available so far.
  Our approach involves expanding the fluid velocity field into spherical and
Cartesian fundamental sets of Stokes flows. The interaction of the fluid with
the particles is described using the spherical basis fields; the flow scattered
with the walls is expressed in terms of the Cartesian fundamental solutions. At
the core of our method are transformation relations between the spherical and
Cartesian basis sets. These transformations allow us to describe the flow field
in a system that involves both the walls and particles.
  We used our accurate numerical results to test the single-wall superposition
approximation for the hydrodynamic friction matrix. The approximation yields
fair results for quantities dominated by single particle contributions, but it
fails to describe collective phenomena, such as a large transverse resistance
coefficient for linear arrays of spheres.
