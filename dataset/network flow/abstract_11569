Complex software systems are among most sophisticated human-made systems, yet
only little is known about the actual structure of 'good' software. We here
study different software systems developed in Java from the perspective of
network science. The study reveals that network theory can provide a prominent
set of techniques for the exploratory analysis of large complex software
system. We further identify several applications in software engineering, and
propose different network-based quality indicators that address software
design, efficiency, reusability, vulnerability, controllability and other. We
also highlight various interesting findings, e.g., software systems are highly
vulnerable to processes like bug propagation, however, they are not easily
controllable.
