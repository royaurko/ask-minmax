Systems incorporating many particles such as agents, molecules, stars or
birds are gaining popularity as research topics. When modeled, the state space
of the model is often very high-dimensional, using a separate dimension for
each variable of each particle. However, the interesting properties of such a
system can often be described by very few variables such as density, flow or
other averaged quantities. The problem is that the dynamics in this
low-dimensional space is often unknown or very hard to find.
  In this paper, we describe and discuss an approach to numerically construct
this low-dimensional space including the dynamics for a broad range of systems.
The key idea is to transform observed values of the system, such as density or
flow, into a new state space. In this new space, every point has enough
information for the new dynamics to decide what the next point will be. In this
case, we call the state \textit{closed}. The points in this new space cannot be
interpreted directly in their original, physical sense. Hence we need an
additional observer function that reconstructs the original observations given
any point in the new space. Since the points in this new space are closed and
observable, we call them \textit{closed observables}.
  All abstract concepts are complemented by illustrative examples and
algorithms to compute the new space. We use the original model to produce
observations and then re-parametrize the output by diffusion maps. The new
dynamics including parameters and the new observer are computed numerically as
well.
