We report on the application of the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model
to granular high-TC superconductors. Some derived predictions of the RSJ model
are applied to a set of superconducting granular samples which can be
considered as a network of Josephson junctions. The investigated samples belong
to both hole-doped Y1-xPrxBa2Cu3O7-d (x = 0.0, 0.35, and 0.45) and the
electron-doped Sm2-xCexCuO4-d (x = 0.18) systems which display the so-called
double resistive superconducting transition. We have performed several
transport measurements in these compounds including temperature and magnetic
field dependence of the electrical resistance, R(T,H), and I-V characteristics.
Several aspects of the I-V characteristics were quantitatively well described
by the RSJ model. The combined results strongly suggest that dissipation in
granular superconducting samples is a natural consequence of the normal current
flowing in parallel with the supercurrent current.
