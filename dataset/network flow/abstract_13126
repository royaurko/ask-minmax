It is shown that preferential concentrations of inertial (finite-size)
particle suspensions in turbulent flows follow from the dissipative nature of
their dynamics. In phase space, particle trajectories converge toward a
dynamical fractal attractor. Below a critical Stokes number (non-dimensional
viscous friction time), the projection on position space is a dynamical fractal
cluster; above this number, particles are space filling. Numerical simulations
and semi-heuristic theory illustrating such effects are presented for a simple
model of inertial particle dynamics.
