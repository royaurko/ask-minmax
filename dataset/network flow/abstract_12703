A natural condition on the structure of the underlying chemical reaction
network, namely weak reversibility, is shown to guarantee the existence of an
equilibrium (steady state) in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class
for the associated mass-action system. Furthermore, an index formula is given
for the set of equilibria in a given stoichiometric compatibility class.
