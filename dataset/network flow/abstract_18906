We consider a multiphysics system with multiple component models coupled
together through network coupling interfaces, i.e., a handful of scalars. If
each component model contains uncertainties represented by a set of parameters,
a straightfoward uncertainty quantification (UQ) study would collect all
uncertainties into a single set and treat the multiphysics model as a black
box. Such an approach ignores the rich structure of the multiphysics system,
and the combined space of uncertainties can have a large dimension that
prohibits the use of polynomial surrogate models. We propose an intrusive
methodology that exploits the structure of the network coupled multiphysics
system to efficiently construct a polynomial surrogate of the model output as a
function of uncertain inputs. Using a nonlinear elimination strategy, we treat
the solution as a composite function: the model outputs are functions of the
coupling terms which are functions of the uncertain parameters. The composite
structure allows us to construct and employ a reduced polynomial basis that
depends on the coupling terms; the basis can be constructed with many fewer
system solves than the naive approach, which results in substantial
computational savings. We demonstrate the method on an idealized model of a
nuclear reactor.
