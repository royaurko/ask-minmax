Using numerical simulations we investigate the transverse depinning of moving
vortex lattices interacting with random disorder. We observe a finite
transverse depinning barrier for vortex lattices that are driven with high
longitudinal drives, when the vortex lattice is defect free and moving in
correlated 1D channels. The transverse barrier is reduced as the longitudinal
drive is decreased and defects appear in the vortex lattice, and the barrier
disappears in the plastic flow regime. At the transverse depinning transition,
the vortex lattice moves in a staircase pattern with a clear transverse
narrow-band voltage noise signature.
