A transition to unsteadiness of a flow inside a cubic diagonally lid-driven
cavity with no-slip boundaries is numerically investigated by a series of
direct numerical simulations (DNS) performed on 100^3 and 200^3 stretched
grids. It is found that the observed oscillatory instability is setting in via
a subcritical symmetry-breaking Hopf bifurcation. The instability evolves on
two vortices in a coupled manner. Critical values of Reynolds number Recr=2320
and non-dimensional angular oscillating frequency omegacr=0.249 for transition
from steady to oscillatory flow are accurately estimated. Characteristic
patterns of the 3D oscillatory flow are presented.
