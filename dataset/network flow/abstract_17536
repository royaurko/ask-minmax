The second del Pezzo surface is known by work of Tian-Zhu and Wang-Zhu to
admit a unique Kaehler-Ricci soliton. Applying a method described in
hep-th/0703057, we use Ricci flow to numerically compute that soliton metric.
We numerically compute the value of its Perelman entropy (or Gaussian density).
