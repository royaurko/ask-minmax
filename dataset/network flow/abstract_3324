We introduce transverse Chern-Ricci flow for transversely Hermitian
foliations, which is analogous to the Chern-Ricci flow. We show that when
$\mathcal{F}$ is homologically orientable and the basic first Bott-Chern class
is zero, starting at any transversely Hermitian metric the flow exists for all
time and as $t\rightarrow \infty$ converges smoothly to a transversely
Hermitian metric $\omega_\infty$ with the transverse Chern-Ricci form
$\rho^T(\omega_\infty)=0$. We also determine the maximal existence time of the
flow in the general case. These are foliated version of results of Gill and
Tosatti-Weinkove, and also extend recent work of Bedulli-He-Vezzoni.
