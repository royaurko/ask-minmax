We find there is relationship between the associated bigraph and the cluster
(or community) detecting on network. By imbedding the associated bigraph of
some network (suppose it has cluster structures) into some space, we can
identify the clusters on this network, which is a new method for network
cluster detecting. And this method, of which the physical meaning is clear and
the time complexity is acceptable, may provide us a new point to understand the
structure and character of networks. In this paper, We test the methods on
serval computer-generated networks and real networks. A computer-generated
network with 128 vertexes and the Zachary Network, which presents the structure
of a karate club, can be partitioned correctly by these methods. And the
Dolphin Network, which presents the relationship between 62 dolphins on the
coast of New Zealand, is partitioned reasonably.
