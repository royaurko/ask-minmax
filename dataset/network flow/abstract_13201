Observations indicate that the magnetotail convection is turbulent and
bi-modal, consisting of fast bursty bulk flows (BBF) and a nearly stagnant
background. We demonstrate that this observed phenomenon may be understood in
terms of the intermittent interactions, dynamic mergings and preferential
accelerations of coherent magnetic structures under the influence of a
background magnetic field geometry that is consistent with the development of
an X-point mean-field structure.
