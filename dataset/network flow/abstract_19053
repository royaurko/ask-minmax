This paper introduces algorithms for target tracking in wireless sensor
networks (WSNs) that enable reduction of data communication cost. The objective
of the considered problem is to control movement of a mobile sink which has to
reach a moving target in the shortest possible time. Consumption of the WSN
energy resources is reduced by transferring only necessary data readings
(target positions) to the mobile sink. Simulations were performed to evaluate
the proposed algorithms against existing methods. The experimental results
confirm that the introduced tracking algorithms allow the data communication
cost to be considerably reduced without significant increase in the amount of
time that the sink needs to catch the target.
