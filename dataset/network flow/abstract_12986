The recently introduced consistent lattice Boltzmann model with energy
conservation [S. Ansumali, I.V. Karlin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 260605 (2005)] is
extended to the simulation of thermal flows on standard lattices. The
two-dimensional thermal model on the standard square lattice with nine
velocities is developed and validated in the thermal Couette and
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard natural convection problems.
