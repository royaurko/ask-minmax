Under many conditions, macroscopic grains flow like a fluid; kinetic theory
pred icts continuum equations of motion for this granular fluid. In order to
test the theory, we perform event driven molecular simulations of a
two-dimensional gas of inelastic hard disks, driven by contact with a heat
bath. Even for strong dissipation, high densities, and small numbers of
particles, we find that continuum theory describes the system well. With a bath
that heats the gas homogeneously, strong velocity correlations produce a
slightly smaller energy loss due to inelastic collisions than that predicted by
kinetic theory. With an inhomogeneous heat bath, thermal or velocity gradients
are induced. Determination of the resulting fluxes allows calculation of the
thermal conductivity and shear viscosity, which are compared to the predictions
of granular kinetic theory, and which can be used in continuum modeling of
granular flows. The shear viscosity is close to the prediction of kinetic
theory, while the thermal conductivity can be overestimated by a factor of 2;
in each case, transport is lowered with increasing inelasticity.
