Urbanisation is a fundamental phenomenon whose quantitative characterisation
is still inadequate. We report here the empirical analysis of a unique data set
regarding almost 200 years of evolution of the road network in a large area
located north of Milan (Italy). We find that urbanisation is characterised by
the homogenisation of cell shapes, and by the stability throughout time of
high-centrality roads which constitute the backbone of the urban structure,
confirming the importance of historical paths. We show quantitatively that the
growth of the network is governed by two elementary processes: (i)
`densification', corresponding to an increase in the local density of roads
around existing urban centres and (ii) `exploration', whereby new roads trigger
the spatial evolution of the urbanisation front. The empirical identification
of such simple elementary mechanisms suggests the existence of general, simple
properties of urbanisation and opens new directions for its modelling and
quantitative description.
