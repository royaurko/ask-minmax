We present a new mechanism for the fluidization of a vibrated granular bed in
the presence of interstitial air. We show that the air flow induced across the
bed, as the gap in the bottom of the cell evolves, can fluidize the bed in a
similar way as in gas-fluidized {\it static} beds. We use the model of Kroll to
quantify the relevant variables suggested by the mechanism proposed. The
relevance of the above fluidization for segregation phenomena is discussed.
