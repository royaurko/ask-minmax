Viscous flow past a finite flat plate moving in direction normal to itself is
studied numerically.The plate moves with velocity $at^p$, where $p=0,0.5,1,2$.
We present the evolution of vorticity profiles, streaklines and streamlines,
and study the dependence on the acceleration parameter $p$. Four stages in the
vortex evolution, as proposed by Luchini & Tognaccini (2002), are clearly
identified. The initial stage, in which the vorticity consists solely of a
Rayleigh boundary layer, is shown to last for a time-interval whose length
shrinks to zero like $p^3$, as $p \to 0$. In the second stage, a center of
rotation develops near the tip of the plate, well before a vorticity maximum
within the vortex core develops. Once the vorticity maximum develops, its
position oscillates and differs from the center of rotation. The difference
between the two increases with increasing $p$, and decreases in time. In the
third stage, the center of rotation and the shed circulation closely satisfy
self-similar scaling laws for inviscid flow. Finally, in the fourth stage, the
finite plate length becomes relevant and the flow begins to depart from the
self-similar behaviour. While the core trajectory and circulation closely
satisfy inviscid scaling laws, the vorticity maximum and the boundary layer
thickness follow viscous scaling laws. The results are compared with
experimental results of Pullin & Perry (1980), and Taneda & Honji (1971), where
available.
