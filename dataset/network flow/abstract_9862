We investigate spatial and temporal cross-correlations between streamwise and
normal velocity components in three shear flows: a low-dimensional model for
vortex-streak interactions, direct numerical simulations for a nearly
homogeneous shear flow and experimental data for a turbulent boundary layer. A
driving of streamwise streaks by streamwise vortices gives rise to a temporal
asymmetry in the short time correlation. Close to the wall or the bounding
surface in the free-slip situations, this asymmetry is identified. Further away
from the boundaries the asymmetry becomes weaker and changes character,
indicating the prevalence of other processes. The systematic variation of the
asymmetry measure may be used as a complementary indicator to separate
different layers in turbulent shear flows. The location of the extrema at
different streamwise displacements can be used to read off the mean advection
speed; it differs from the mean streamwise velocity because of asymmetries in
the normal extension of the structures.
