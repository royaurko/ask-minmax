Modern day's vehicles require advanced communication system on board to
enable passengers benefit the most from available services. IEEE 802.11p is the
new extension of IEEE 802.11 standards; especially proposed for the high
vehicular environment. The WAVE documentation represents enhancements to the
Media Access Control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) layer of IEEE 802.11 standards to
work efficiently in high vehicular environment. In this research work, the main
emphasis is on the new IEEE 802.11p enhancement of MAC and PHY layers. More
specifically, the target of this research is to setup a simulation environment
which will allow us to investigate the use of real time voice application,
using IEEE 802.11p (WAVE) enhance setting, in a single hop and multi-hop
environment where nodes are not directly connected. Also, the evaluation of
transmission between moving nodes are tested by simply sending and receiving
FTP file between them with varying speed of the moving nodes.
