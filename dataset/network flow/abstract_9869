Directed sideward flow of light charged particles and intermediate mass
fragments was measured in different symmetric reactions at bombarding energies
from 90 to 800 AMeV. The flow parameter is found to increase with the charge of
the detected fragment up to Z = 3-4 and then turns into saturation for heavier
fragments. Guided by simple simulations of an anisotropic expanding thermal
source, we show that the value at saturation can provide a good estimate of the
flow angle, $\Theta_{flow}$, in the participant region. It is found that
$\Theta_{flow}$ depends strongly on the impact parameter. The excitation
function of $\Theta_{flow}$ reveals striking deviations from the ideal
hydrodynamical scaling. The data exhibit a steep rise of $\Theta_{\flow}$ to a
maximum at around 250-400 AMeV, followed by a moderate decrease as the
bombarding energy increases further.
