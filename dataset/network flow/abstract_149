Flows over time are used to model many real-world logistic and routing
problems. The networks underlying such problems -- streets, tracks, etc. -- are
inherently undirected and directions are only imposed on them to reduce the
danger of colliding vehicles and similar problems. Thus the question arises,
what influence the orientation of the network has on the network flow over time
problem that is being solved on the oriented network. In the literature, this
is also referred to as the contraflow or lane reversal problem.
  We introduce and analyze the price of orientation: How much flow is lost in
any orientation of the network if the time horizon remains fixed? We prove that
there is always an orientation where we can still send $\frac{1}{3}$ of the
flow and this bound is tight. For the special case of networks with a single
source or sink, this fraction is $\frac12$ which is again tight. We present
more results of similar flavor and also show non-approximability results for
finding the best orientation for single and multicommodity maximum flows over
time.
