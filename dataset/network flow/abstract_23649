This paper considers a formulation of a differential game with constrained
dynamics, where one player selects the dynamics and the other selects the
applicable cost. When the game is considered on a finite time horizon, its
value satisfies an HJB equation with oblique Neumann boundary conditions. The
first main result is uniqueness for viscosity solutions to this equation. This
uniqueness is applied to obtain the second main result,i which is a unique
characterization of the value function for a corresponding infinite time
problem. The motivation comes from problems associated with queueing networks,
where the games appear in several contexts, including a robust approach to
network modeling and optimization and risk-sensitive control.
