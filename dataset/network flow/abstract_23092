I present the first isolation of azimuth quadrupole components from published
$v_2(p_t)$ data (called elliptic flow) as spectra on transverse rapidity $y_t$
for identified pions, kaons and lambdas/protons from minimum-bias Au-Au
collisions at 200 GeV. The form of the spectra on $y_t$ indicates that the
three hadron species are emitted from a common boosted source with boost
$\Delta y_{t0} \sim 0.6$. The quadrupole spectra have a L\'evy form similar to
the soft component of the single-particle spectrum, but with significantly
reduced ($\sim 0.7\times$) slope parameters $T$. Comparison of quadrupole
spectra with single-particle spectra suggests that the quadrupole component
comprises a small fraction ($< 5$%) of the total hadron yield, contradicting
the hydrodynamic picture of a thermalized, flowing bulk medium. The form of
$v_2(p_t)$ is, within a constant factor, the product of $p'_t$ ($p_t$ in the
boost frame) times the ratio of quadrupole spectrum to single-particle
spectrum. That ratio in turn implies that above 0.5 GeV/c the form of
$v_2(p_t)$ is dominated by the hard component of the single-particle spectrum
(interpreted as due to minijets). It is therefore unlikely that so-called {\em
constituent-quark scaling} attributed to $v_2$ is relevant to soft hadron
production mechanisms (e.g., chemical freezeout).
