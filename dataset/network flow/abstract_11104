There are fundamental differences between citation networks and other classes
of graphs. In particular, given that citation networks are directed and
acyclic, methods developed primarily for use with undirected social network
data may face obstacles. This is particularly true for the dynamic development
of community structure in citation networks. Namely, it is neither clear when
it is appropriate to employ existing community detection approaches nor is it
clear how to choose among existing approaches. Using simulated data, we attempt
to clarify the conditions under which one should use existing methods and which
of these algorithms is appropriate in a given context. We hope this paper will
serve as both a useful guidepost and an encouragement to those interested in
the development of more targeted approaches for use with longitudinal citation
data.
