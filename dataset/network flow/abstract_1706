Harmful Internet hijacking incidents put in evidence how fragile the Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) is, which is used to exchange routing information
between Autonomous Systems (ASes). As proved by recent research contributions,
even S-BGP, the secure variant of BGP that is being deployed, is not fully able
to blunt traffic attraction attacks. Given a traffic flow between two ASes, we
study how difficult it is for a malicious AS to devise a strategy for hijacking
or intercepting that flow. We show that this problem marks a sharp difference
between BGP and S-BGP. Namely, while it is solvable, under reasonable
assumptions, in polynomial time for the type of attacks that are usually
performed in BGP, it is NP-hard for S-BGP. Our study has several by-products.
E.g., we solve a problem left open in the literature, stating when performing a
hijacking in S-BGP is equivalent to performing an interception.
