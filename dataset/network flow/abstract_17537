We establish a precise asymptotic formula for the number of homotopy classes
of periodic orbits for the geodesic flow on rank one manifolds of nonpositive
curvature. This extends a celebrated result of G. A. Margulis to the
nonuniformly hyperbolic case and strengthens previous results by G. Knieper. We
also establish some useful properties of the measure of maximal entropy.
