The paper presents a Stateflow based network test-bed to validate real-time
optimal control algorithms. Genetic Algorithm (GA) based time domain
performance index minimization is attempted for tuning of PI controller to
handle a balanced lag and delay type First Order Plus Time Delay (FOPTD)
process over network. The tuning performance is validated on a real-time
communication network with artificially simulated stochastic delay, packet loss
and out-of order packets characterizing the network.
