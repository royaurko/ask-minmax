Tracer diffusion in a granular gas in simple shear flow is analyzed. The
analysis is made from a perturbation solution of the Boltzmann kinetic equation
through first order in the gradient of the mole fraction of tracer particles.
The reference state (zeroth-order approximation) corresponds to a Sonine
solution of the Boltzmann equation, which holds for arbitrary values of the
restitution coefficients. Due to the anisotropy induced in the system by the
shear flow, the mass flux defines a diffusion tensor $D_{ij}$ instead of a
scalar diffusion coefficient. The elements of this tensor are given in terms of
the restitution coefficients and mass and size ratios. The dependence of the
diffusion tensor on the parameters of the problem is illustrated in the
three-dimensional case. The results show that the influence of dissipation on
the elements $D_{ij}$ is in general quite important, even for moderate values
of the restitution coefficients. In the case of self-diffusion (mechanically
equivalent particles), the trends observed in recent molecular dynamics
simulations are similar to those obtained here from the Boltzmann kinetic
theory.
