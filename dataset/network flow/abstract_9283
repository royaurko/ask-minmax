An approach to information processing based on the excitation of patterns of
activity by non-linear active resonators in response to their input patterns is
proposed. Arguments are presented to show that any computation performed by a
conventional Turing machine-based computer, called T-machine in this paper,
could also be performed by the pattern excitation-based machine, which will be
called P-machine. A realization of this processing scheme by neural networks is
discussed. In this realization, the role of the resonators is played by neural
pattern excitation networks, which are the neural circuits capable of exciting
different spatio-temporal patterns of activity in response to different inputs.
Learning in the neural pattern excitation networks is also considered. It is
shown that there is a duality between pattern excitation and pattern
recognition neural networks, which allows to create new pattern excitation
modes corresponding to recognizable input patterns, based on Hebbian learning
rules. Hierarchically organized, such networks can produce complex behavior.
Animal behavior, human language and thought are treated as examples produced by
such networks.
