In this article we prove that if a flow exhibits a partially hyperbolic
attractor and it has two periodic saddles with different indices, and the
stable index of one of them coincides with the dimension of strongly stable
bundles, then it does not satisfy the specification property. As an
application, we prove that all Geometric Lorenz attractors do not satisfy the
specification property.
