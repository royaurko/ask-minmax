For a broad range single-seed contagion processes acting on generalized
random networks, we derive a unifying analytic expression for the possibility
of global spreading events in a straightforward, physically intuitive fashion.
Our reasoning lays bare a direct mechanical understanding of an archetypal
spreading phenomena that is not evident in circuitous extant mathematical
approaches.
