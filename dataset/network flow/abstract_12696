We report recent research on computing with biology-based neural network
models by means of physics-based opto-electronic hardware. New technology
provides opportunities for very-high-speed computation and uncovers problems
obstructing the wide-spread use of this new capability. The Computation
Modeling community may be able to offer solutions to these cross-boundary
research problems.
