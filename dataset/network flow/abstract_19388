We present a scenario for non-radiative accretion onto the supermassive black
hole at the galactic center. Conducting MHD simulations with 1400^3 grid zones
that break the axial and reflection symmetries of earlier investigations and
extend inward from the Bondi radius, we find a quasi-hydrostatic radial density
profile rho propto r^{-0.72} with superadiabatic gradient corresponding to an
n~0.72 polytrope. Buoyancy generated by magnetic dissipation is resisted by the
same fields so effectively that energy is advected inward: a state of
magnetically-frustrated convection. This scenario is consistent with
observational constraints on energetics andouter boundary conditions.
