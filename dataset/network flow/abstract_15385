We investigate the effects of mobility and density on the amplitude death of
coupled oscillators in metapopulation networks, wherein each node represents a
subpopulation with any number of mobile individuals. We perform stochastic
simulations of the dynamical reaction-diffusion processes associated with the
Landau-Stuart oscillators in scale-free networks. Interestingly, we find that,
with increasing the mobility rate or density, the system may undergo phase
transitions from incoherent state to amplitude death, and then to frequency
synchronization. Especially, there exists an extent of intermediate mobility
rate and density leading to global oscillator death. In addition, we show this
nontrivial phenomenon is robust to different network topologies. Our findings
may invoke further efforts and attentions to explore the underlying mechanism
of collective behaviors in metapopulation coupled systems.
