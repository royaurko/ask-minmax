A geometrical description of the Heisenberg magnet (HM) equation with
classical spins is given in terms of flows on the quotient space $G/H_+$ where
$G$ is an infinite dimensional Lie group and $H_+$ is a subgroup of $G$. It is
shown that the HM flows are induced by an action of $\mathbb{R}^2$ on $G/H_+$,
and that the HM equation can be integrated by solving a Birkhoff factorization
problem for $G$. For the HM flows which are Laurent polynomials in the spectral
variable we derive an algebraic transformation between solutions of the
nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) and Heisenberg magnet equations. The Birkhoff
factorization for $G$ is treated in terms of the geometry of the Segal-Wilson
Grassmannian $Gr(H)$. The solution of the problem is given in terms of a pair
of Baker functions for special subspaces of $Gr(H)$. The Baker functions are
constructed explicitly for subspaces which yield multisoliton solutions of NLS
and HM equations.
