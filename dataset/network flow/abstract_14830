The restriction of hydrodynamics to non-viscous, potential (gradient,
irrotational) flows is a theory both simple and elegant; a favorite topic of
introductory textbooks. It is known that this theory can be formulated as an
action principle and expanded to include thermodynamicics. This paper presents
an action principle for hydrodynamics that includes general, rotational flows.
  The new theory is a combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian hydrodynamics,
with an extension to thermodynamics that includes all the elements of the
Gibbsean variational principle. In the first place it is an action principle
for adiabatic systems, including the usual conservation laws. Viscosity can be
introduced in the usual way, by adding a dissipative term to the momentum
equation. The equation for energy dissipation then follows. It is an ideal
framework for the description of quasi-static processes, including dissipation.
It is a major development of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier approach, the principal
advantage being a hamiltonian structure with a natural concept of energy in the
form of a first integral of the motion, conserved by virtue of the
Euler-Lagrange equations.
