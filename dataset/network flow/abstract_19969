We propose a minimal model for the emergence of a directed flow in autonomous
Hamiltonian systems. It is shown that internal breaking of the spatio-temporal
symmetries, via localised initial conditions, that are unbiased with respect to
the transporting degree of freedom, and transient chaos conspire to form the
physical mechanism for the occurrence of a current. Most importantly, after
passage through the transient chaos, trajectories perform solely regular
transporting motion so that the resulting current is of continual ballistic
nature. This has to be distinguished from the features of transport reported
previously for driven Hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space where
transport is determined by intermittent behaviour exhibiting power-law decay
statistics of the duration of regular ballistic periods.
