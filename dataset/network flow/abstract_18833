In this paper, we provide new complexity results for algorithms that learn
discrete-variable Bayesian networks from data. Our results apply whenever the
learning algorithm uses a scoring criterion that favors the simplest model able
to represent the generative distribution exactly. Our results therefore hold
whenever the learning algorithm uses a consistent scoring criterion and is
applied to a sufficiently large dataset. We show that identifying high-scoring
structures is hard, even when we are given an independence oracle, an inference
oracle, and/or an information oracle. Our negative results also apply to the
learning of discrete-variable Bayesian networks in which each node has at most
k parents, for all k > 3.
