Transcriptional delay can significantly impact the dynamics of gene networks.
Here we examine how such delay affects bistable systems. We investigate several
stochastic models of bistable gene networks and find that increasing delay
dramatically increases the mean residence times near stable states. To explain
this, we introduce a non-Markovian, analytically tractable reduced model. The
model shows that stabilization is the consequence of an increased number of
failed transitions between stable states. Each of the bistable systems that we
simulate behaves in this manner.
