We model the Internet as a network of interconnected Autonomous Systems which
self-organize under an absolute lack of centralized control. Our aim is to
capture how the Internet evolves by reproducing the assembly that has led to
its actual structure and, to this end, we propose a growing weighted network
model driven by competition for resources and adaptation to maintain
functionality in a demand and supply ``equilibrium''. On the demand side, we
consider the environment, a pool of users which need to transfer information
and ask for service. On the supply side, ASs compete to gain users, but to be
able to provide service efficiently, they must adapt their bandwidth as a
function of their size. Hence, the Internet is not modeled as an isolated
system but the environment, in the form of a pool of users, is also a
fundamental part which must be taken into account. ASs compete for users and
big and small come up, so that not all ASs are identical. New connections
between ASs are made or old ones are reinforced according to the adaptation
needs. Thus, the evolution of the Internet can not be fully understood if just
described as a technological isolated system. A socio-economic perspective must
also be considered.
