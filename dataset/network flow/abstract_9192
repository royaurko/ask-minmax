Artificial neural networks are algorithms which have been developed to tackle
a range of computational problems. These range from modelling brain function to
making predictions of time-dependent phenomena to solving hard (NP-complete)
problems. In this introduction we describe a single, yet very important, type
of network known as a feedforward network. This network is a mathematical model
which can be trained to learn an arbitrarily complex relationship between a
data and a parameter domain, so can be used to solve interpolation and
classification problems. We discuss the structure, training and interpretation
of these networks, and their implementation, taking the classification of
stellar spectra as an example.
