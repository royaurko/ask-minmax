This review is concerned with a discussion of numerical methods for the
solution of the equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD).
Particular emphasis is put on a comprehensive review of the application of
high-resolution shock-capturing methods in SRHD. Results obtained with
different numerical SRHD methods are compared, and two astrophysical
applications of SRHD flows are discussed. An evaluation of the various
numerical methods is given and future developments are analyzed.
