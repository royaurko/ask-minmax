We analyze by means of Granger causality the effect of synergy and redundancy
in the inference (from time series data) of the information flow between
subsystems of a complex network. Whilst fully conditioned Granger causality is
not affected by synergy, the pairwise analysis fails to put in evidence
synergetic effects. We show that maximization of the total Granger causality to
a given target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving
variables, puts in evidence redundant multiplets of variables influencing the
target, provided that an {\it unnormalized} definition of Granger causality is
adopted. Along the same lines we also introduce a pairwise index of synergy
(w.r.t. to information flow to a third variable) which is zero when two
independent sources additively influence a common target, differently from
previous definitions of synergy.
