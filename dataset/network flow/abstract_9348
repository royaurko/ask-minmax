Stanley Milgram's small world experiment presents "six degrees of separation"
of our world. One phenomenon of the experiment still puzzling us is that how
individuals operating with the social network information with their
characteristics can be very adept at finding the short chains. The previous
works on this issue focus whether on the methods of navigation in a given
network structure, or on the effects of additional information to the searching
process. In this paper, we emphasize that the growth and shape of network
architecture is tightly related to the individuals' attributes. We introduce a
method to reconstruct nodes' intimacy degree based on local interaction. Then
we provide an intimacy based approach for orientation in networks. We find that
the basic reason of efficient search in social networks is that the degree of
"intimacy" of each pair of nodes decays with the length of their shortest path
exponentially. Meanwhile, the model can explain the hubs limitation which was
observed in real-world experiment.
