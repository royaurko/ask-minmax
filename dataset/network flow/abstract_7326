In this short note we review deterministic simulation of biochemical
pathways, i.e. networks of biochemical reactions obeying the law of mass
action. It is meant as a basis for the MATLAB code, written by the contributor,
which permits easy input and simulation of general biochemical networks. This
work was carried out for the European Project `CardioWorkBench'.
