We investigate Threshold Random Boolean Networks with $K = 2$ inputs per
node, which are equivalent to Kauffman networks, with only part of the
canalyzing functions as update functions. According to the simplest
consideration these networks should be critical but it turns out that they show
a rich variety of behaviors, including periodic and chaotic oscillations. The
results are supported by analytical calculations and computer simulations.
