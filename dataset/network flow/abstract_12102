We discuss the generalization of recently discovered BPS configurations,
corresponding to the planar string networks, to non-planar ones by considering
the U-duality symmetry of type II string theory in various dimensions. As an
explicit example, we analyze the string solutions in 8-dimensional space-time,
carrying SL(3) charges, and show that by aligning the strings along various
directions appropriately, one can obtain a string network which preserves 1/8
supersymmetry.
