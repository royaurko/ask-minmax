Our work is motivated by and illustrated with application of association
networks in computational biology, specifically in the context of gene/protein
regulatory networks. Association networks represent systems of interacting
elements, where a link between two different elements indicates a sufficient
level of similarity between element attributes. While in reality relational
ties between elements can be expected to be based on similarity across multiple
attributes, the vast majority of work to date on association networks involves
ties defined with respect to only a single attribute. We propose an approach
for the inference of multi-attribute association networks from measurements on
continuous attribute variables, using canonical correlation and a
hypothesis-testing strategy. Within this context, we then study the impact of
partial information on multi-attribute network inference and characterization,
when only a subset of attributes is available. We consider in detail the case
of two attributes, wherein we examine through a combination of analytical and
numerical techniques the implications of the choice and number of node
attributes on the ability to detect network links and, more generally, to
estimate higher-level network summary statistics, such as node degree,
clustering coefficients, and measures of centrality. Illustration and
applications throughout the paper are developed using gene and protein
expression measurements on human cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 database.
