In the present paper we give a brief summary of some recent theoretical
advances in the treatment of inhomogeneous fluids and methods which have
applications in the study of dynamical properties of liquids in situations of
extreme confinement, such as nanopores, nanodevices, etc. The approach obtained
by combining kinetic and density functional methods is microscopic, fully
self-consistent and allows to determine both configurational and flow
properties of dense fluids.
  The theory predicts the correct hydrodynamic behavior and provides a
practical and numerical tool to determine how the transport properties are
modified when the length scales of the confining channels are comparable with
the size of the molecules. The applications range from the dynamics of simple
fluids under confinement, to that of neutral binary mixtures and electrolytes
where the theory in the limit of slow gradients reproduces the known
phenomenological equations such as the Planck-Nernst-Poisson and the
Smoluchowski equations. The approach here illustrated allows for fast numerical
solution of the evolution equations for the one-particle phase-space
distributions by means of the weighted density lattice Boltzmann method and is
particularly useful when one considers flows in complex geometries.
