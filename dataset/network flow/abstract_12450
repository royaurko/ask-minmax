Video streaming applications have newly attracted a large number of
participants in a distribution network. Traditional client-server based video
streaming solutions sustain precious bandwidth provision rate on the server.
Recently, several P2P streaming systems have been organized to provide
on-demand and live video streaming services on the wireless network at reduced
server cost. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing is a new pattern to construct
disseminated network applications. Typical error control techniques are not
very well matched and on the other hand error prone channels has increased
greatly for video transmission e.g., over wireless networks and IP. These two
facts united together provided the essential motivation for the development of
a new set of techniques (error concealment) capable of dealing with
transmission errors in video systems. In this paper, we propose an flexible
multiple description coding method named as Flexible Spatial-Temporal (FST)
which improves error resilience in the sense of frame loss possibilities over
independent paths. It introduces combination of both spatial and temporal
concealment technique at the receiver and to conceal the lost frames more
effectively. Experimental results show that, proposed approach attains
reasonable quality of video performance over P2P wireless network.
