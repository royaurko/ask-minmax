We establish a relation between the growth of the cylindrical contact
homology of a contact manifold and the topological entropy of Reeb flows on
this manifold. We show that if a contact manifold $(M,\xi)$ admits a hypertight
contact form $\lambda_0$ for which the cylindrical contact homology has
exponential homotopical growth rate, then the Reeb flow of every contact form
on $(M,\xi)$ has positive topological entropy. Using this result, we provide
numerous new examples of contact 3-manifolds on which every Reeb flow has
positive topological entropy.
