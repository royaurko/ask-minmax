Complex networks are characterized by several topological properties: degree
distribution, clustering coefficient, average shortest path length, etc. Using
a simple model to generate scale-free networks embedded on geographical space,
we analyze the relationship between topological properties of the network and
attributes (fitness and location) of the vertices in the network. We find there
are two crossovers for varying the scaling exponent of the fitness
distribution.
