Asymptotic analysis of the Hele-Shaw flow with a small moving obstacle is
performed. The method of solution utilises the uniform asymptotic formulas for
Green's and Neumann functions recently obtained by V. Maz'ya and A. Movchan.
Theoretical results of the paper are illustrated by the numerical simulations.
