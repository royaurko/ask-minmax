The problem of error control in random linear network coding is addressed
from a matrix perspective that is closely related to the subspace perspective
of K\"otter and Kschischang. A large class of constant-dimension subspace codes
is investigated. It is shown that codes in this class can be easily constructed
from rank-metric codes, while preserving their distance properties. Moreover,
it is shown that minimum distance decoding of such subspace codes can be
reformulated as a generalized decoding problem for rank-metric codes where
partial information about the error is available. This partial information may
be in the form of erasures (knowledge of an error location but not its value)
and deviations (knowledge of an error value but not its location). Taking
erasures and deviations into account (when they occur) strictly increases the
error correction capability of a code: if $\mu$ erasures and $\delta$
deviations occur, then errors of rank $t$ can always be corrected provided that
$2t \leq d - 1 + \mu + \delta$, where $d$ is the minimum rank distance of the
code. For Gabidulin codes, an important family of maximum rank distance codes,
an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed that can properly exploit erasures
and deviations. In a network coding application where $n$ packets of length $M$
over $F_q$ are transmitted, the complexity of the decoding algorithm is given
by $O(dM)$ operations in an extension field $F_{q^n}$.
