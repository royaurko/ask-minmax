We have investigated the critical conditions required for an efficient steady
propeller mechanism in the spin-down phases of magnetized neutron stars with
optically thick accretion disks. We have shown through simple analytical
calculations that: (1) the strength of the dipole field at the Alfven radius is
not sufficient to sustain an efficient mass-outflow even when the magnetic
dipole field lines rotate much faster than the escape speed, (2) in the
spin-down phase, mass accretion onto the star could persist above a minimum
disk mass-flow rate that is orders of magnitude lower than the rate
corresponding to the transition between the spin-up and the spin-down states,
(3) below this critical mass-flow rate, a steady propeller state could be
established with a maximum inner disk radius about 25 times smaller than the
Alfven radius. Our results indicate that only for spherical accretion, the
inner disk radius is likely to approach the Alfven radius, and for all
realistic cases, the accretion-propeller transition could take place at a
mass-flow rate lower than the rate equating the Alfven and the co-rotation
radii. Our results are consistent with the properties of the transitional
millisecond pulsars which show transitions between the accretion powered X-ray
pulsar and the rotational powered radio pulsar states, and emit X-ray pulses in
the sub-luminous X-ray phases.
