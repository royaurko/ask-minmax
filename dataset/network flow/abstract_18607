The attractor dimension at the transition to complete synchronization in a
network of chaotic units with time-delayed couplings is investigated. In
particular, we determine the Kaplan-Yorke dimension from the spectrum of
Lyapunov exponents for iterated maps and for two coupled semiconductor lasers.
We argue that the Kaplan-Yorke dimension must be discontinuous at the
transition and compare it to the correlation dimension. For a system of
Bernoulli maps we indeed find a jump in the correlation dimension. The
magnitude of the discontinuity in the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is calculated for
networks of Bernoulli units as a function of the network size. Furthermore the
scaling of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension as well as of the Kolmogorov entropy with
system size and time delay is investigated.
