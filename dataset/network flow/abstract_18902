A comprehensive research framework for a comparative analysis of candidate
network architectures and protocols in the clean-slate design of
next-generation optical access is proposed. The proposed research framework
consists of a comparative analysis framework based on multivariate
non-inferiority testing and a notion of equivalent circuit rate taking into
account user-perceived performances, and a virtual test bed providing a
complete experimental platform for the comparative analysis. The capability of
the research framework is demonstrated through numerical results from the study
of the elasticity of hybrid TDM/WDM-PON based on tunable transceivers.
