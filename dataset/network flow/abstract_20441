The pp collisions have been studied for a long time, however, there are still
some effects which are not completely understood, such as the long range
angular correlations and the flow patterns in high multiplicity events, which
were recently discovered at the LHC. In a recent work it was demonstrated that
in Pythia 8, multi-parton interactions and color reconnection can give some of
the observed effects similar to the collective flow well known from heavy-ion
collisions. Now using the same model, a study based on mid-rapidity charged
hadron transverse spherocity is presented. The main purpose of this work is to
show that a differential study combining multiplicity and event shapes opens
the possibility to understand better the features of data, specially at high
multiplicity.
