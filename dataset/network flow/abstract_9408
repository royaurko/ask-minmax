In this paper, we present an algorithm for optimizing synchronizability of
complex dynamical networks. Based on some network properties, rewirings, i.e.
eliminating an edge and creating a new edge elsewhere, are performed
iteratively avoiding always self-loops and multiple edges between the same
nodes. We show that the method is able to enhance the synchronizability of
networks of any size and topological properties in a small number of steps that
scales with the network size.Although we take the eigenratio of the Laplacian
as the target function for optimization, we will show that it is also possible
to choose other appropriate target functions exhibiting almost the same
performance. The optimized networks are Ramanujan graphs, and thus, this
rewiring algorithm could be used to produce Ramanujan graphs of any size and
average degree.
