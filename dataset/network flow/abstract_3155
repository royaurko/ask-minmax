We represent collaboration of contributors in computer science papers in terms of
both affiliation and collaboration networks and observe how these networks
evolved over time since 1960. We investigate the temporal evolution of
bibliometric properties, like size of the discipline, productivity of scholars,
and collaboration level in papers, as well as of large-scale network
properties, like reachability and average separation distance among scientists,
distribution of the number of scholar collaborators, network clustering and
network assortativity by number of collaborators.
