We have performed a high resolution search for galactic halo axions in cold
flows using a microwave cavity detector. The analysis procedure and other
details of this search are described. No axion signal was found in the mass
range 1.98-2.17 micro-eV. We place upper limits on the density of axions in
local discrete flows based on this result.
