Shear thickening appears as an increase of the viscosity of a dense
suspension with the shear rate, sometimes sudden and violent at high volume
fraction. Its origin for noncolloidal suspension with non-negligible inertial
effects is still debated. Here we consider a simple shear flow and demonstrate
that fluid inertia causes a strong microstructure anisotropy that results in
the formation of a shadow region with no relative flux of particles. We show
that shear thickening at finite inertia can be explained as an increase of the
effective volume fraction when considering the dynamically excluded volume due
to these shadow regions
