We show that hadronization via quark coalescence enhances hadron elliptic
flow at large pT relative to that of partons at the same transverse momentum.
Therefore, compared to earlier results based on covariant parton transport
theory, more moderate initial parton densities dN/d\eta(b=0) ~ 1500-3000 can
explain the differential elliptic flow v_2(pT) data for Au+Au reactions at
s^1/2=130 and 200 AGeV from RHIC. In addition, v2(pT) could saturate at about
50% higher values for baryons than for mesons. If strange quarks have weaker
flow than light quarks, hadron v_2 at high pT decreases with relative
strangeness content.
