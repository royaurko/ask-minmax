Living cells are the product of gene expression programs that involve the
regulated transcription of thousands of genes. The elucidation of
transcriptional regulatory networks in thus needed to understand the cell's
working mechanism, and can for example be useful for the discovery of novel
therapeutic targets. Although several methods have been proposed to infer gene
regulatory networks from gene expression data, a recent comparison on a
large-scale benchmark experiment revealed that most current methods only
predict a limited number of known regulations at a reasonable precision level.
We propose SIRENE, a new method for the inference of gene regulatory networks
from a compendium of expression data. The method decomposes the problem of gene
regulatory network inference into a large number of local binary classification
problems, that focus on separating target genes from non-targets for each TF.
SIRENE is thus conceptually simple and computationally efficient. We test it on
a benchmark experiment aimed at predicting regulations in E. coli, and show
that it retrieves of the order of 6 times more known regulations than other
state-of-the-art inference methods.
