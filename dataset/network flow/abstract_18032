In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness to traffic
localization techniques driven by the emergence of heterogeneous networks
(HetNet) with small cells deployment and the green networks. The localization
of hotspot data traffic with a very high accuracy is indeed of great interest
to know where the small cells should be deployed and how can be managed for
sleep mode concept. In this paper, we propose a new traffic localization
technique based on the combination of different key performance indicators
(KPI) extracted from the operation and maintenance center (OMC). The proposed
localization algorithm is composed with five main steps; each one corresponds
to the determination of traffic weight per area using only one KPI. These KPIs
are Timing Advance (TA), Angle of Arrival (AoA), Neighbor cell level, the load
of each cell and the Harmonic mean throughput (HMT) versus the Arithmetic mean
throughput (AMT). The five KPIs are finally combined by a function taking as
variables the values computed from the five steps. By mixing such KPIs, we show
that it is possible to lessen significantly the errors of localization in a
high precision attaining small cell dimensions.
