We analyze the correlation properties of the Erdos-Renyi random graph (RG)
and the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network (SF) under the attack and repair
strategy with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The maximum degree k_max,
representing the local property of the system, shows similar scaling behaviors
for random graphs and scale-free networks. The fluctuations are quite random at
short time scales but display strong anticorrelation at longer time scales
under the same system size N and different repair probability p_re. The average
degree <k>, revealing the statistical property of the system, exhibits
completely different scaling behaviors for random graphs and scale-free
networks. Random graphs display long-range power-law correlations. Scale-free
networks are uncorrelated at short time scales; while anticorrelated at longer
time scales and the anticorrelation becoming stronger with the increase of
p_re.
