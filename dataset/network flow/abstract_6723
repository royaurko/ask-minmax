Quantum transport through disordered structures is inhibited by (Anderson)
localization effects. The disorder can be either topological as in random
networks or energetical as in the original Anderson model. In both cases the
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian associated with the network become localized. We
show how to overcome localization by network multiplexing. Here, multiple
layers of random networks with the same number of nodes are stacked in such a
way that in the perpendicular directions regular one-dimensional networks are
formed. Depending on the ratio of the coupling within the layer and
perpendicular to it, transport gets either enhanced or diminished. In
particular, if the couplings are of the same order, transport gets enhanced and
localization effects can be overcome. We exemplify our results by two examples:
multiplexes of random networks and of one-dimensional Anderson models.
