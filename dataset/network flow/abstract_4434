We present a consistent definition for braided ribbon networks in
3-dimensional manifolds, unifying both three and four valent networks in a
single framework. We present evolution moves for these networks which are dual
to the Pachner moves on simplices and present an invariant of this evolution.
Finally we relate these results back to previous work in the subject.
