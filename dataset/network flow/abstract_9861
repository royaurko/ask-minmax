We study a family of solutions to the Saffman-Taylor problem with zero
surface tension at a critical regime. In this regime, the interface develops a
thin singular finger. The flow of an isolated finger is given by the Whitham
equations for the KdV integrable hierarchy. We show that the flow describing
bubble break-off is identical to the Gurevich-Pitaevsky solution for
regularization of shock waves in dispersive media. The method provides a scheme
for the continuation of the flow through singularites.
