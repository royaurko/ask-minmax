We analyze the evolution of Sznajd Model with synchronous updating in several
complex networks. Similar to the model on square lattice, we have found a
transition between the state with no-consensus and the state with complete
consensus in several complex networks. Furthermore, by adjusting the network
parameters, we find that a large clustering coefficient favors development of a
consensus. In particular, in the limit of large system size with the initial
concentration p=0.5 of opinion +1, a consensus seems to be never reached for
the Watts-Strogatz small-world network, when we fix the connectivity k and the
rewiring probability p_s; nor for the scale-free network, when we fix the
minimum node degree m and the triad formation step probability p_t.
