The heterogeneous wireless networks where coexistence of different Radio
access technology (RAT) are widely deployed for various services and support
various traffic demand, channel allocation. Under heterogeneous wireless
networks, a user can send data through a single or multi RATs simultaneous. The
objective of this paper is to choose the optimal bandwidth for the services and
power allocation to that bandwidth. The proposed distributed joint allocation
algorithm using modified Newton method is adopted to maximize the total system
capacity. We validate the performance of the proposed algorithm through
numerical results.
