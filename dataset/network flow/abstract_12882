The critical behaviour of a system of two coupled scalar fields in three
dimensions is studied within the formalism of the effective average action. The
fixed points of the system are identified and the crossover between them is
described in detail. Besides the universal critical behaviour, the flow of the
coarse grained free energy also describes the approach to scaling.
