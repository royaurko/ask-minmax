In this paper we theoretically study how structural disorder in coupled
semiconductor heterostructures influences single-particle scattering events
that would otherwise be forbidden by symmetry. We extend the model of V. Savona
to describe Rayleigh scattering in coupled planar microcavity structures, and
answer the question, whether effective filter theories can be ruled out. They
can.
