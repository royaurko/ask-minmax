The circulation around any closed loop is a Lagrangian invariant for
classical, smooth solutions of the incompressible Euler equations in any number
of space dimensions. However, singular solutions relevant to turbulent flows
need not preserve the classical integrals of motion. Here we generalize the
Kelvin theorem on conservation of circulations to distributional solutions of
Euler and give necessary conditions for the anomalous dissipation of
circulations. We discuss the important role of Kelvin's theorem in turbulent
vortex-stretching dynamics and conjecture a version of the theorem which may
apply to suitable singular solutions.
