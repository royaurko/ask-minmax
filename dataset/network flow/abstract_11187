The measuring stations of a geophysical network are often spatially
distributed in an inhomogeneous manner. The areal inhomogeneity can be well
characterized by the fractal dimension D_H of the network, which is usually
smaller than the euclidean dimension of the surface, this latter equal to 2.
The resulting dimensional deficit, (2-D_H), is a measure of precipitating
events which cannot be detected by the network. The aim of the present study is
to estimate the fractal dimension of a rain-gauge network in Tuscany (Central
Italy) and to relate its dimension to the dimensions of daily rainfall events
detected by a mixed satellite/radar methodology. We find that D_H = 1.85, while
typical summer precipitations are characterized by a dimension much greater
than the dimensional deficit 0.15.
