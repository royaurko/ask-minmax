We introduce a distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) strategy, based on
two pre-determined thresholds, for uplink $K$-cell networks with time-invariant
channel coefficients. Each base station (BS) opportunistically selects a mobile
station (MS) who has a large signal strength of the desired channel link among
a set of MSs generating a sufficiently small interference to other BSs. Then,
performance on the achievable throughput scaling law is analyzed. As our main
result, it is shown that the achievable sum-rate scales as
$K\log(\text{SNR}\log N)$ in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, if the
total number of users in a cell, $N$, scales faster than
$\text{SNR}^{\frac{K-1}{1-\epsilon}}$ for a constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. This
result indicates that the proposed scheme achieves the multiuser diversity gain
as well as the degrees-of-freedom gain even under multi-cell environments.
Simulation results show that the DOS provides a better sum-rate throughput over
conventional schemes.
