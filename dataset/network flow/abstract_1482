IEEE 802.11 is a widely used wireless LAN standard which offers a good
bandwidth at low cost In an ESS, multiple APs can co-exist with overlapping
coverage area. A mobile node connects to the AP from which it receives the best
signal. Changes in traffic to and from different MNs occur over time. Load
imbalance may develop on different APs. Throughput and delay of the different
flows passing through the APs, where the load has increased beyond certain
limit, may degrade. Different MNs associated to the overloaded APs will
experience performance degradation. Overall performance of the ESS will also
drop. In this paper we propose a scheme where MNs experiencing degraded
performance will initiate action and with assistance from the associate AP
perform handoff to less loaded AP within its range to improve performance.
