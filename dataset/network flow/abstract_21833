It is proposed that the spatial (and temporal) patterns spontaneously
appearing in dissipative systems maximize the energy flow through the pattern
forming interface. In other words - the patterns maximize the entropy growth
rate in an extended conservative system (consisting of the pattern forming
interface and the energy bathes). The proposal is supported by examples of the
pattern formation in different systems. No example contradicting the proposal
is known.
