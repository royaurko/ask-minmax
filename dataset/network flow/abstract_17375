It is shown in the framework of the N-component scalar model that the saddle
point structure may generate non-trivial renormalization group flow. The
spinodal phase separation can be described in this manner and a flat action is
found as an exact result which is valid up to any order of the loop expansion.
The correlation function is computed in a mean-field approximation.
