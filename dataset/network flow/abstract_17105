We model the mechanics of associating trivalent dendrimer network glasses
with a focus on their energy dissipation properties. Various combinations of
sticky bond (SB) strength and kinetics are employed. The toughness
(work-to-fracture) of these systems displays a surprising deformation-protocol
dependence; different association parameters optimize different properties. In
particular, "strong, slow" SBs optimize strength, while "weak, fast" SBs
optimize ductility via self-healing during deformation. We relate these
observations to breaking, reformation, and partner-switching of SBs during
deformation. These studies point the way to creating associating-polymer
network glasses with tailorable mechanical properties.
