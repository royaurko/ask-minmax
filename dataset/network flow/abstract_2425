Broad absorption lines (BALs), seen in a small fraction of both the
radio-quiet and radio-loud quasar populations, are probably caused by the
outflow of gas with high velocities and are part of the accretion process. The
presence of BALs is the geometrical effect and/or it is connected with the
quasar evolution. Using the final release of FIRST survey combined with a A
Catalog of BAL QSOs (SDSS/DR3), we have constructed a new sample of compact
radio-loud BAL QSOs, which makes the majority of radio-loud BAL QSOs. The main
goal of this project is to study the origin of BALs by analysis the BAL QSOs
radio morphology, their orientation and jets evolution, using EVN at 1.6 GHz
and VLBA at 5 and 8.4 GHz. We will discuss also the first multi-frequency radio
observations of very compact BAL quasar 1045+352 made using the VLBA, EVN,
MERLIN and CHANDRA. We speculate that the most probable interpretation of the
observed radio structure of 1045+352 is the ongoing process of the jet
precession due to internal instabilities within the flow.
