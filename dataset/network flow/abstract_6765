We present initial results from our new two-dimensional (radius and
latitude), self-consistent model of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere. We
focus on the latitudinal variations in the solar wind flow caused by the
energetic particles. Among other things our results show that the cosmic rays
significantly modify the latitudinal structure of the solar wind flow
downstream of the termination shock. Specifically, for A>0 (corresponding to
the present solar minimum) the wind beyond the shock is driven towards the
equator, resulting in a faster wind flow near the current sheet, while for A<0
the effect is reversed and the wind turns towards the pole, with a faster flow
at high latitudes. We attribute this effect to the latitudinal gradients in the
cosmic ray pressure, caused by drifts, that squeeze the flow towards the
ecliptic plane or the pole, respectively.
