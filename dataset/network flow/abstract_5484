The stack in various forms has been widely used as an architectural template
for networking systems. Recently the stack has been subject to criticism for a
lack of flexibility. However, when it comes right down to it nobody has offered
a truly compelling alternative. Various cross-layer optimizations have been
proposed, but these optimizations are frequently hacks to achieve a particular
goal and offer no direct insight into why the existing network stack is
inadequate. We propose that a fundamental problem with the existing network
stack is that it attempts to layer functionality that is not well-suited to
layering. In this work we use a "bottom up" model of information computation,
storage, and transfer and the "top down" goals of networking systems to
formulate a modular decomposition of networking systems. Based on this modular
decomposition we propose a semantic layered structure for networking systems
that eliminates many awkward cross-layer interactions that arise in the
canonical layered stack.
