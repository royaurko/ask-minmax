We study the notion of stochastic stability with respect to diffusive
perturbations for flows with smooth invariant measures. We investigate the
question fully for non-singular flows on the circle. We also show that
volume-preserving flows are stochastically stable with respect to perturbations
that are associated with homogeneous diffusions.
