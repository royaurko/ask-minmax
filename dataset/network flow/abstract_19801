Strong and weak simulation relations have been proposed for Markov chains,
while strong simulation and strong probabilistic simulation relations have been
proposed for probabilistic automata. However, decision algorithms for strong
and weak simulation over Markov chains, and for strong simulation over
probabilistic automata are not efficient, which makes it as yet unclear whether
they can be used as effectively as their non-probabilistic counterparts. This
paper presents drastically improved algorithms to decide whether some
(discrete- or continuous-time) Markov chain strongly or weakly simulates
another, or whether a probabilistic automaton strongly simulates another. The
key innovation is the use of parametric maximum flow techniques to amortize
computations. We also present a novel algorithm for deciding strong
probabilistic simulation preorders on probabilistic automata, which has
polynomial complexity via a reduction to an LP problem. When extending the
algorithms for probabilistic automata to their continuous-time counterpart, we
retain the same complexity for both strong and strong probabilistic
simulations.
