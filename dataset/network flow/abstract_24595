In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent advances in
microwave-enabled wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies and their
applications in wireless communications. Specifically, we divide our
discussions into three parts. First, we introduce the state-of-the-art WET
technologies and the signal processing techniques to maximize the energy
transfer efficiency. Then, we discuss an interesting paradigm named
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where energy and
information are jointly transmitted using the same radio waveform. At last, we
review the recent progress in wireless powered communication networks (WPCN),
where wireless devices communicate using the power harvested by means of WET.
Extensions and future directions are also discussed in each of these areas.
