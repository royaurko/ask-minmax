Sustainability of communities, agriculture, and industry is strongly
dependent on an effective storage and supply of water resources. In some
regions the economic growth has led to a level of water demand which can only
be accomplished through efficient reservoir networks. Such infrastructures are
not always planned at larger scale but rather made by farmers according to
their local needs of irrigation during droughts. Based on extensive data from
the upper Jaguaribe basin, one of the world's largest system of reservoirs,
located in the Brazilian semiarid northeast, we reveal that surprisingly it
self-organizes into a scale-free network exhibiting also a power-law in the
distribution of the lakes and avalanches of discharges. With a new
self-organized-criticality-type model we manage to explain the novel critical
exponents. Implementing a flow model we are able to reproduce the measured
overspill evolution providing a tool for catastrophe mitigation and future
planning.
