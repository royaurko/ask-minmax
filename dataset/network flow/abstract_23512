We develop a ``unified'' model that describes both ``micro'' and ``macro''
evolutions within a single theoretical framework. The eco-system is described
as a dynamic network; the population dynamics at each node of this network
describes the ``micro''-evolution over ecological time scales (i.e., birth,
ageing and natural death of individual organisms) while the appearance of new
nodes, the slow changes of the links and the disappearance of existing nodes
accounts for the ``macro'' evolution over geological time scales (i.e., the
origination, evolution and extinction of species). In contrast to several
earlier claims in the literature, we observe strong deviations from power law
in the regime of long life times where the statistics is, usually, poor.
