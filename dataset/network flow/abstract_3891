Human micro RNAs (miRNAs) target about 90% of the coding genes and form a
complex regulatory network. We study the community structure of the miRNA
co-target network considering miRNAs as the nodes which are connected by
weighted links. The weight of link that connects a pair of miRNAs denote the
total number of common transcripts targeted by that pair. We argue that the
network consists of about 74 modules, quite similar to the components (or
clusters) obtained earlier [Online J Bioinformatics, 10,280 ], indicating that
the components of the miRNA co-target network are self organized in a way to
maximize the modularity.
