The structure entropy is an important index to illuminate the structure
property of the complex network. Most of the existing structure entropies are
based on the degree distribution of the complex network. But the structure
entropy based on the degree can not illustrate the structure property of the
weighted networks. In order to study the structure property of the weighted
networks, a new structure entropy of the complex networks based on the
betweenness is proposed in this paper. Comparing with the existing structure
entropy, the proposed method is more reasonable to describe the structure
property of the complex weighted networks.
