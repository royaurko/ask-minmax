We prove the non--triviality of the Reeb flow for the (2n+1)--dimensional
standard contact spheres inside the fundamental group of their contactomorphism
group, n greater than 3. The argument uses the existence of homotopically
non--trivial 2--spheres in the space of contact structures of a 3--Sasakian
manifold.
