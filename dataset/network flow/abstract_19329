We construct a model of Cyg X-1 which describes self-consistently its
emission from soft X-rays to MeV gamma rays. Instead of a compact
pair-dominated gamma-ray emitting region, we consider a hot optically thin and
spatially extended proton-dominated cloud surrounding the whole accretion disc.
The gamma-ray emission is due to the bremsstrahlung, Comptonization, and
positron annihilation, while the corona-disc model is retained for the X-ray
emission. We show that the Cyg X-1 spectrum accumulated by OSSE, BATSE, and
COMPTEL in 1991--95, as well as the HEAO-3 gamma1 and gamma2 spectra can be
well fitted by our model. The derived parameters are in qualitative agreement
with the picture in which the spectral changes are governed by the mass flow
rate in the accretion disc. In this context, the hot outer corona could be
treated as the advection-dominated flow co-existing with a standard thin
accretion disc.
