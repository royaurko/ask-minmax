We have carried out a detailed programme to explore the superconducting
characteristics of reactive DC-magnetron sputtered NbN. The basic principle is
to ignite a plasma using argon, and then to introduce a small additional
nitrogen flow to achieve the nitridation of a Nb target. Subsequent sputtering
leads to the deposition of NbN onto the host substrate. The characteristics of
a sputtered film depend on a number of parameters: argon pressure, nitrogen
flow rate and time-evolution profile, substrate material, etc. Crucially, the
hysteresis in the target voltage as a function of the nitrogen flow can be used
to provide a highly effective monitor of nitrogen consumption during the
reactive process. By studying these dependencies we have been able to achieve
highly reproducible film characteristics on sapphire, silicon dioxide on
silicon, and silicon nitride on silicon. Intrinsic film stress was minimised by
optimising the argon pressure, giving NbN films having Tc = 14.65 K. In the
paper, we report characteristics such as deposition rate, Residual Resistance
Ratio (RRR), film resistivity, transition temperature, and stress, as a
function of deposition conditions. In order to enhance our understanding of the
microwave properties of the films, we fabricated a wide range of microstrip NbN
resonators (half wavelength, quarter wavelength, ring resonators). In the
paper, we provide an illustrative result from this work showing a 2.1097 GHz
resonator having a Q of 15,962 at 3.3 K.
