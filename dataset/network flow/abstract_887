In this study we explore the performance gain that can be achieved at the
network level by employing successive interference cancelation (SIC) instead of
treating interference as noise for random access wireless mesh networks with
multi-packet reception capabilities. More precisely we explore both the
throughput and the delay of a distributed flow allocation scheme aimed at
maximizing average aggregate flow throughput while also providing bounded delay
combined with SIC. Simulation results derived from three simple topologies show
that the gain over treating interference as noise for this scheme can be up to
$15\%$ for an SINR threshold value equal to $0.5$. For SINR threshold values as
high as $2.0$ however, this gain is either insignificant or treating
interference as noise proves a better practice. The reason is that although SIC
improves the throughput on a specific link, it also increases the interference
imposed on neighboring receivers. We also show that the gain of applying SIC is
more profound in cases of a large degree of asymmetry among interfering links.
