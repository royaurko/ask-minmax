The effects of opacity of the nuclei together with a blackbody type of
emission along the system history are considered as a means to explain the
ratio $R_{out}/R_{sid}$ observed by STAR and PHENIX collaborations at RHIC.
Within our model, no flow is required to explain the data trend of this ratio
for large surface emissivities.
