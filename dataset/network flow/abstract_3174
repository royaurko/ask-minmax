This paper presents a novel framework for ubiquitous social networks (USNs).
Instead of making virtual connections, on the basis of human social networks,
an effort has been made to facilitate interactions among human social networks
with the help of virtual social networks. The imperative domains that support
ubiquitous social networks are highlighted and different scenarios are provided
to project real world applications of proposed framework. Our proposed
framework can provide preliminary foundations for creating ubiquitous social
networks in true essence.
