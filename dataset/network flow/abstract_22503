Using flow equations, equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of a two-level
system are investigated, which couples via non-commuting components to two
independent oscillator baths. In equilibrium the two-level energy splitting is
protected when the TLS is coupled symmetrically to both bath. A critical
asymmetry angle separates the localized from the delocalized phase.
  On the other hand, real-time decoherence of a non-equilibrium initial state
is for a generic initial state faster for a coupling to two baths than for a
single bath.
