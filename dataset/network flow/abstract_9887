Elliptical energy flow patterns in non-central Au(11.7AGeV) on Au reactions
have been studied employing the RQMD model. The strength of these azimuthal
asymmetries is calculated comparing the results in two different modes of RQMD
(mean field and cascade). It is found that the elliptical flow which is readily
observable with current experimental detectors may help to distinguish
different reasonable expansion scenarios for baryon-dense matter. The final
asymmetries are very sensitive to the pressure at maximum compression, because
they involve a partial cancelation between early squeeze-out and subsequent
flow in the reaction plane. This cancelation can be expected to occur in a
broad energy region covered by the current heavy ion fixed-target programs at
BNL and at CERN.
