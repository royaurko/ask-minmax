The ALICE experiment studies Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC in order to
investigate the properties of the hot and dense QCD matter at extreme energy
densities. Recent results from ALICE in identified particle flow allow for the
exploration of the collective properties of the medium created in heavy-ion
collisions. In this paper, I give special attention to strange and charm
particles which probe the medium differently and thus provide new constraints
for the study of its properties. The paper covers results on elliptic flow for
pion, kaon, kzero, antiproton, phi, lambda, xi, omega, dplus, dzero and dstar
measured at midrapidity by ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76
TeV. I present also the comparison with available models that predict the
hydrodynamical evolution of the medium and the energy loss of light and heavy
quarks as they travel through.
