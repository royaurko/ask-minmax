The dynamic response of a gas bubble entrapped in a cavity on the surface of
a submerged solid subject to an acoustic field is investigated in the linear
approximation. We derive semi-analytical expressions for the resonance
frequency, damping and interface shape of the bubble. For the liquid phase, we
consider two limit cases: potential flow and unsteady Stokes flow. The
oscillation frequency and interface shape are found to depend on two
dimensionless parameters: the ratio of the gas stiffness to the surface tension
stiffness, and the Ohnesorge number, representing the relative importance of
viscous forces. We perform a parametric study and show, among others, that an
increase in the gas pressure or a decrease in the surface tension leads to an
increase in the resonance frequency until an asymptotic value is reached.
