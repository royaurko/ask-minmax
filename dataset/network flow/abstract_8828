Bogoliubov pseudoparticle creation in a BEC undergoing a WH like flow is
investigated analytically in the case of a one dimensional geometry with
stepwise homogeneous regions. Comparison of the results with those
corresponding to a BH flow is performed. The implications for the analogous
gravitational problem is discussed.
