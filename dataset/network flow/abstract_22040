We make here a short overview of the recent developments regarding
translation-invariant models on the noncommutative Moyal space. A scalar model
was first proposed and proved renormalizable. Its one-loop renormalization
group flow and parametric representation were calculated. Furthermore, a
mechanism to take its commutative limit was recently given. Finally, a
proposition for a renormalizable, translation-invariant gauge model was made.
