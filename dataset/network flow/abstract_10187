It is shown that the recently developed hybrid code VISHNU, which couples a
relativistic viscous fluid dynamical description of the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP) with a microscopic Boltzmann cascade for the late hadronic rescattering
stage, yields an excellent description of charged and identified hadron spectra
and elliptic flow measured in 200 A GeV Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). Using initial conditions that incorporate
event-by-event fluctuations in the initial shape and orientation of the
collision fireball and values eta/s for the specific shear viscosity of the
quark-gluon plasma that were recently extracted from the measured centrality
dependence of the eccentricity-scaled, p_T-integrated charged hadron elliptic
flow, we obtain universally good agreement between theory and experiment for
the p_T-spectra and differential elliptic flow v_2(p_T) for both pions and
protons at all collision centralities.
