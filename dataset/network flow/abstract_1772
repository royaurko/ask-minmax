A neural network theory of visual perception and recognition is presented.
Information flows both from the retina to the brain and from the brain to the
retina. A report that when a scene is perceived 50 retinal cells are much more
active than any of the other retinal cells is ascribed significance in the
theory. The theory involves neurons that exhibit hysteresis, without the need
for any changes in synaptic connection strengths during learning. The fact that
the brain is able to recognize faces and other objects very rapidly is
discussed in the context of the theory. The theory can be epitomized as "We see
with our eyes and remember with our brains".
