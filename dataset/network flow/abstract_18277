We study the transport properties of disordered two-dimensional electron
systems with a perfectly conducting channel. We introduce an asymmetric
Chalker-Coddington network model and numerically investigate the point-contact
conductance. We find that the behavior of the conductance in this model is
completely different from that in the symmetric model. Even in the limit of a
large distance between the contacts, we find a broad distribution of
conductance and a non-trivial power law dependence of the averaged conductance
on the system width. Our results are applicable to systems such as zigzag
graphene nano-ribbons where the numbers of left-going and right-going channels
are different.
