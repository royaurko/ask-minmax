Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network (KAREN) has been used to
transfer large volumes of radio astronomical data between the AUT Radio
Astronomical Observatory at Warkworth, New Zealand and the international
organisations with which we are collaborating and conducting observations. Here
we report on the current status of connectivity and on the results of testing
different data transfer protocols. We investigate new UDP protocols such as
"tsunami" and UDT and demonstrate that the UDT protocol is more efficient than
"tsunami" and ftp. We report on our initial steps towards real-time eVLBI and
the attempt to directly stream data from the radio telescope receiving system
to the correlation centre without intermediate buffering/recording.
