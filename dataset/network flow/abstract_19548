The phase-separation kinetics of binary fluids in shear flow is studied
numerically in the framework of the continuum convection-diffusion equation
based on a Ginzburg-Landau free energy. Simulations are carried out for
different temperatures both in d=2 and in d=3. Our results confirm the
qualitative picture put forward by the large-N limit equations studied in
\cite{noi}. In particular, the structure factor is characterized by the
presence of four peaks whose relative oscillations give rise to a periodic
modulation of the behavior of the rheological indicators and of the average
domains sizes. This peculiar pattern of the structure factor corresponds to the
presence of domains with two characteristic thicknesses whose relative
abundance changes with time.
