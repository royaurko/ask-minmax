A class of centrality measures called betweenness centralities reflects
degree of participation of edges or nodes in communication between different
parts of the network. The original shortest-path betweenness centrality is
based on counting shortest paths which go through a node or an edge. One of
shortcomings of the shortest-path betweenness centrality is that it ignores the
paths that might be one or two steps longer than the shortest paths, while the
edges on such paths can be important for communication processes in the
network. To rectify this shortcoming a current flow betweenness centrality has
been proposed. Similarly to the shortest path betwe has prohibitive complexity
for large size networks. In the present work we propose two regularizations of
the current flow betweenness centrality, \alpha-current flow betweenness and
truncated \alpha-current flow betweenness, which can be computed fast and
correlate well with the original current flow betweenness.
