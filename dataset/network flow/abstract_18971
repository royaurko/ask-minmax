The introduction of device-to-device (D2D) into cellular networks poses many
new challenges in the resource allocation design due to the co-channel
interference caused by spectrum reuse and limited battery life of user
equipments (UEs). In this paper, we propose a distributed interference-aware
energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm to maximize each UE's energy
efficiency (EE) subject to its specific quality of service (QoS) and maximum
transmission power constraints. We model the resource allocation problem as a
noncooperative game, in which each player is self-interested and wants to
maximize its own EE. The formulated EE maximization problem is a non-convex
problem and is transformed into a convex optimization problem by exploiting the
properties of the nonlinear fractional programming. An iterative optimization
algorithm is proposed and verified through computer simulations.
