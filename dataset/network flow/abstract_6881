We study the behavior of an elastic loop embedded in a flowing soap film.
This deformable loop is wetted into the film and is held fixed at a single
point against the oncoming flow. We interpret this system as a two-dimensional
flexible body interacting in a two-dimensional flow. This coupled
fluid-structure system shows bistability, with both stationary and oscillatory
states. In its stationary state, the loop remains essentially motionless and
its wake is a von K\'arm\'an vortex street. In its oscillatory state, the loop
sheds two vortex dipoles, or more complicated vortical structures, within each
oscillation period. We find that the oscillation frequency of the loop is
linearly proportional to the flow velocity, and that the measured Strouhal
numbers can be separated based on wake structure.
