We have extended the PSCz to cover 93% of the sky, the practical limit for
any catalogue based on the Point Source Catalog. The galaxy identifications are
complete, and the core of the Great Attractor is quantitatively mapped for the
first time. We discuss the likely effect of the increased sky coverage on the
IRAS dipole.
