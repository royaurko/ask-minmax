We study the existence, regularity and so-called `strict physicality' of weak
solutions of a coupled Navier-Stokes Q-tensor system which is proposed as a
model for the incompressible flow of nematic liquid crystal materials. An
important contribution to the dynamics comes from a singular potential
introduced by John Ball and Apala Majumdar (Nematic Liquid Crystals: From
Maier-Saupe to a Continuum Theory, Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., Vol. 525: pp. 1-11,
2010) which replaces the commonly employed Landau-de Gennes bulk potential.
This is built into our model to ensure that a natural physical constraint on
the eigenvalues of the Q-tensor order parameter is respected by the dynamics of
the system.
