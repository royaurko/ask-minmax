We carry out a detail study of elliptic flows in Au-Au collisions at 200 AGeV
in a quark combination model. We find that elliptic flow data for a variety of
hadrons can be well reproduced except pions if constituent quarks with equal
parallel transverse momenta combine into initially produced hadrons. In a
combination mechanism where initial hadrons are formed by quarks with unequal
parallel transverse momenta, theoretical predictions agree with data for all
available hadrons including pions. The mass hierarchy at low transverse momenta
in elliptic flows can be understood in the same quark combination mechanism as
in the mediate range of transverse momenta.
