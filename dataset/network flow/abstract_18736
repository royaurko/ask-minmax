The real-time database service selection depends typically to the system
stability in order to handle the time-constrained transactions within their
deadline. However, applying the real-time database system in the mobile ad hoc
networks requires considering the mobile nodes limited capacities. In this
paper, we propose cross-layer service selection which combines performance
metrics measured in the real-time database system to those used by the routing
protocol in order to make the best selection decision. It ensures both
timeliness and energy efficiency by avoiding low-power and busy service
provider node. A multicast packet is used in order to reduce the transmission
cost and network load when sending the same packet to multiple service
providers. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol.
Simulation results, using the Network Simulator NS2, improve that the protocol
decreases the deadline miss ratio of packets, increases the service
availability and reduces the service response time.
