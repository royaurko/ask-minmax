This paper puts forth two new closure models for the proper orthogonal
decomposition reduced-order modeling of structurally dominated turbulent flows:
the dynamic subgrid-scale model and the variational multiscale model. These
models, which are considered state-of-the-art in large eddy simulation,
together with the mixing length and the Smagorinsky closure models, are tested
in the numerical simulation of a 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder
at Re = 1,000. Two criteria are used in judging the performance of the proper
orthogonal decomposition reduced-order models: the kinetic energy spectrum and
the time evolution of the POD coefficients. All the numerical results are
benchmarked against a direct numerical simulation. Based on these numerical
results, we conclude that the dynamic subgrid-scale and the variational
multiscale models perform best.
