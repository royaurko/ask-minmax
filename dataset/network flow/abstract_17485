Let $(Y, d)$ be a Gromov-Hausdorff limit of $n$-dimensional closed shrinking
K\"ahler-Ricci solitons with uniformly bounded volumes and Futaki invariants.
We prove that off a closed subset of codimension at least 4, Y is a smooth
manifold satisfying a shrinking K\"ahler-Ricci soliton equation. A similar
convergence result for K\"ahler-Ricci flow of positive first Chern class is
also obtained.
