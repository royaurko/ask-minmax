A flow line function is proposed to describe the material deformation in ECAE
for a 120\degree die. This new analytical approach is incorporated into a
viscoplastic self-consistent polycrystal code to simulate the texture evolution
in Route A of copper and compared to experimental textures as well as to those
corresponding to simple shear.
