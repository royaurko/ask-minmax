We present magnetoresistance measurements on all-amorphous ferromagnet (F) /
superconductor (S) heterostructures. The F/S/F trilayers show large
magnetoresistance peaks in a small field range around the coercive field of the
F layers, at temperatures within and below the superconducting transition. This
is interpreted as flux flow of weakly pinned vortices induced by the stray
field of Bloch magnetic domains in the F layers. Bilayers show much smaller
effects, implying that the Bloch walls of the F-layers in the trilayer line up
and focus the stray fields. The data are used to discuss the expected minimum
F-layer thickness needed to nucleate vortices.
