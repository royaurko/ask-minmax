Solar active regions (ARs) are thought to be formed by magnetic fields from
the convection zone. Our flux emergence simulations revealed that a strong
horizontal divergent flow (HDF) of unmagnetized plasma appears at the
photosphere before the flux begins to emerge. In our earlier study, we analyzed
HMI data for a single AR and confirmed presence of this precursor plasma flow
in the actual Sun. In this paper, as an extension of our earlier study, we
conducted a statistical analysis of the HDFs to further investigate their
characteristics and better determine the properties. From SDO/HMI data, we
picked up 23 flux emergence events over a period of 14 months, the total flux
of which ranges from 10^{20} to 10^{22} Mx. Out of 23 selected events, 6 clear
HDFs were detected by the method we developed in our earlier study, and 7 HDFs
detected by visual inspection were added to this statistic analysis. We found
that the duration of the HDF is on average 61 minutes and the maximum HDF speed
is on average 3.1 km s^{-1}. We also estimated the rising speed of the
subsurface magnetic flux to be 0.6-1.4 km s^{-1}. These values are highly
consistent with our previous one-event analysis as well as our simulation
results. The observation results lead us to the conclusion that the HDF is
rather a common feature in the earliest phase of AR emergence. Moreover, our
HDF analysis has capability of determining the subsurface properties of
emerging fields that cannot be directly measured.
