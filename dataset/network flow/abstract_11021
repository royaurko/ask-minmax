We simulate a network of N routers and M network users making concurrent
point-to-point connections by buying and selling router capacity from each
other. The resources need to be acquired in complete sets, but there is only
one spot market for each router. In order to describe the internal dynamics of
the market, we model the observed prices by N-dimensional Ito-processes.
Modeling using stochastic processes is novel in this context of describing
interactions between end-users in a system with shared resources, and allows a
standard set of mathematical tools to be applied. The derived models can also
be used to price contingent claims on network capacity and thus to price
complex network services such as quality of service levels, multicast, etc.
