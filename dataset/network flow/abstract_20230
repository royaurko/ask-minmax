We numerically study the effects of varying electric conductivity and
magnetic permeability of the bounding wall on a kinematic dynamo in a sphere
for parameters relevant to Madison plasma dynamo experiment (MPDX). The dynamo
is excited by a laminar, axisymmetric flow of von Karman type. The flow is
obtained as a solution to the Navier-Stokes equation for an isothermal fluid
with a velocity profile specified at the sphere's boundary. The properties of
the wall are taken into account as thin-wall boundary conditions imposed on the
magnetic field. It is found that an increase in the permeability of the wall
reduces the critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm_cr. An increase in the
conductivity of the wall leaves Rm_cr unaffected, but reduces the dynamo growth
rate.
