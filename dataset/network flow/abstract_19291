Granular flows in a narrow pipe are studied numerically by the model taking
account of hydrodynamic effects of fluid surrounding particles. In the
simulations density waves are observed over the wide range of the Stokes
number, which represents the inertial effect of particles. The mechanisms of
formation of the density waves are considered and two types of density waves,
which are observed in the systems with zero and finite Stokes numbers, are
presented. Power spectra of density waves obtained from the simulations with
non-zero Stokes number show $1/f^\alpha$ power law which is similar to that in
experiments.
