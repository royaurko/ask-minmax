The dynamical development of expanding Quark-gluon Plasma (QGP) flow is
studied in a 3+1D fluid dynamical model with a globally symmetric, initial
condition. We minimize fluctuations arising from complex dynamical processes at
finite impact parameters and from fluctuating random initial conditions to have
a conservative fluid dynamical background estimate for the statistical
distributions of the thermodynamical parameters. We also avoid a phase
transition in the equation of state, and we let the matter supercool during the
expansion.
  Then central Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV are studied in an
almost perfect fluid dynamical model, with azimuthally symmetric initial state
generated in a dynamical flux-tube model. The general development of
thermodynamical extensives are also shown for lower energies.
  We observe considerable deviations from a thermal equilibrium source as a
consequence of the fluid dynamical expansion arising from a least fluctuating
initial state.
