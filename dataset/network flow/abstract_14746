In linearly stable shear flows at moderate Re, turbulence spontaneously
decays despite the existence of a codimension-one manifold, termed the edge of
chaos, which separates decaying perturbations from those triggering turbulence.
We statistically analyse the decay in plane Couette flow, quantify the breaking
of self-sustaining feedback loops and demonstrate the existence of a whole
continuum of possible decay paths. Drawing parallels with low-dimensional
models and monitoring the location of the edge relative to decaying
trajectories we provide evidence, that the edge of chaos separates state space
not globally. It is instead wrapped around the turbulence generating structures
and not an independent dynamical structure but part of the chaotic saddle.
Thereby, decaying trajectories need not cross the edge, but circumnavigate it
while unwrapping from the turbulent saddle.
