The high-level contribution of this paper is a simulation-based detailed
performance comparison of three different classes of routing protocols for
mobile ad hoc networks: stability-based routing, power-aware routing and
load-balanced routing. We choose the Flow-Oriented Routing protocol (FORP), the
traffic interference based Load Balancing Routing (LBR) protocol and Min-Max
Battery Cost Routing (MMBCR) as representatives of the stability-based routing,
load-balancing and power-aware routing protocols respectively. Among the three
routing protocols, FORP incurs the least number of route transitions; while LBR
incurs the smallest hop count and lowest end-to-end delay per data packet.
Energy consumed per node is the least for MMBCR, closely followed by LBR. MMBCR
is the most fair in terms of node usage and hence it incurs the largest time
for first node failure. FORP tends to repeatedly use nodes lying on the stable
path and hence is the most unfair of the three routing protocols and it incurs
the smallest value for the time of first node failure. As we measure the
failure times of up to the first five nodes in the network, we observe that LBR
incurs the maximum improvement in the lifetime of the nodes and MMBCR incurs
the least improvement beyond the time of first node failure.
