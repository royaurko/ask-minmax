We present a weighted-Lasso method to infer the parameters of a first-order
vector auto-regressive model that describes time course expression data
generated by directed gene-to-gene regulation networks. These networks are
assumed to own a prior internal structure of connectivity which drives the
inference method. This prior structure can be either derived from prior
biological knowledge or inferred by the method itself. We illustrate the
performance of this structure-based penalization both on synthetic data and on
two canonical regulatory networks, first yeast cell cycle regulation network by
analyzing Spellman et al's dataset and second E. coli S.O.S. DNA repair network
by analysing U. Alon's lab data.
