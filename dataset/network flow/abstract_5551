Here we consider the topological properties of the integrated networks
emerging from the activity driven model [Perra at al. Sci. Rep. 2, 469 (2012)],
a temporal network model recently proposed to explain the power-law degree
distribution empirically observed in many real social networks. By means of a
mapping to a hidden variables network model, we provide analytical expressions
for the main topological properties of the integrated network, depending on the
integration time and the distribution of activity potential characterizing the
model. The expressions obtained, exacts in some cases, the results of
controlled asymptotic expansions in others, are confirmed by means of extensive
numerical simulations. Our analytical approach, which highlights the
differences of the model with respect to the empirical observations made in
real social networks, can be easily extended to deal with improved, more
realistic modifications of the activity driven network paradigm.
