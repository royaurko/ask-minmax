Cross-border equity and long-term debt securities portfolio investment
networks are analysed from 2002 to 2012, covering the 2008 global financial
crisis. They serve as network-proxies for measuring the robustness of the
global financial system and the interdependence of financial markets,
respectively. Two early-warning indicators for financial crises are identified:
First, the algebraic connectivity of the equity securities network, as a
measure for structural robustness, drops close to zero already in 2005, while
there is an over-representation of high-degree off-shore financial centres
among the countries most-related to this observation, suggesting an
investigation of such nodes with respect to the structural stability of the
global financial system. Second, using a phenomenological model, the edge
density of the debt securities network is found to describe, and even forecast,
the proliferation of several over-the-counter-traded financial derivatives,
most prominently credit default swaps, enabling one to detect potentially
dangerous levels of market interdependence and systemic risk.
