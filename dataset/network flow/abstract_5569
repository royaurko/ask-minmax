We consider networks with two types of nodes. The v-nodes, called centers,
are hyperconnected and interact one to another via many u-nodes, called
satellites. This centralized architecture, widespread in gene networks, realize
a bow-tie scheme and possesses interesting properties. Namely, this
organization creates feedback loops that are capable to generate any prescribed
patterning dynamics, chaotic or periodic, and create a number of equilibrium
states. We show that activation or silencing of a node can sharply switch the
network attractor, even if the activated or silenced node is weakly connected.
We distinguish between two dynamically different situations, "power of center"
(PC) when satellite response is fast and "satellite power" (SP) when center
response is fast. Using a simple network example we show that a centralized
network is more robust with respect to time dependent perturbations, in the PC
relative to the SP case. In theoretical molecular biology, this class of models
can be used to reveal a non-trivial relation between the architecture of
protein-DNA and protein-protein interaction networks and controllability of
space-time dynamics of cellular processes.
