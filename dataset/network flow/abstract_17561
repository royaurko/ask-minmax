We study a diophantine property for translation surfaces, defined in term of
saddle connections and inspired by the classical theorem of Khinchin. We prove
that the same dichotomy holds as in Khinchin' result, then we deduce a sharp
estimation on how fast the typical Teichmuller geodesic wanders towards
infinity in the moduli space of translation surfaces. Finally we prove some
stronger result in genus one.
