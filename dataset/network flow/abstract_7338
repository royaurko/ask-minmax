Considering an energy harvesting sensor network, the overall probability of
event loss is derived. Based on this result, a variety of harvesting resource
allocation schemes (sizing the energy storages and the harvesting devices,
under a total cost constraint) are provided. Their performances are verified
and compared through simulations.
