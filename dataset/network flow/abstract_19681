It is reported a great variety of functional actions of GABA in auditory
system. Although many studies reports the presence and distribution of GABA
receptors; nevertheless, the studies about the inhibitory GABA-dependent
neurons distribution in the Inferior Culliculus are scarce. We are interested
in studies on the role played by GABAergic neurons in the acoustic information
transmission in the Central Nucleus of Inferior Culliculus. The existence and
distribution of GABAergic neurons in CNIC, could give us understandings on how
the inhibitory actions of neurotransmitters are participating in ways which the
information flow is spatial-temporal associated with the firing synchrony in
each isofrequency region. And with these results, we could achieve some
insights over the emergence of certain mind properties from neurons dynamic
interactions.
