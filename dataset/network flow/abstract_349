In large wireless networks, acquiring full network state information is
typically infeasible. Hence, nodes need to flow the information and manage the
interference based on partial information about the network. In this paper, we
consider multi-hop wireless networks and assume that each source only knows the
channel gains that are on the routes from itself to other destinations in the
network. We develop several distributed strategies to manage the interference
among the users and prove their optimality in maximizing the achievable
normalized sum-rate for some classes of networks.
