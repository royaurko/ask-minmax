Hydrodynamic flows in biological systems are often generated by active chiral
processes near or on surfaces. Important examples are beating cilia, force
generation in actomyosin networks, and motile bacteria interacting with
surfaces. Here we develop a coarse grained description of active chiral films
that captures generic features of flow and rotation patterns driven by chiral
motors. We discuss force and torque balances within the film and on the surface
and highlight the role of the intrinsic rotation field. We arrive at a two
dimensional effective theory and discuss our results in the context of ciliary
carpets and thin films of bacterial suspensions.
