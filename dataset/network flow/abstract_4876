We prove a complete family of `cylindrical estimates' for solutions of a
class of fully non-linear curvature flows, generalising the cylindrical
estimate of Huisken-Sinestrari for the mean curvature flow. More precisely, we
show that, for the class of flows considered, an $(m+1)$-convex ($0\leq m\leq
n-2$) solution becomes either strictly $m$-convex, or its Weingarten map
approaches that of a cylinder $\R^m\times S^{n-m}$ at points where the
curvature is becoming large. This result complements the convexity estimate
proved by the contributors and McCoy for the same class of flows.
