We study steady flow of a second grade fluid past an obstacle in three space
dimensions. We prove existence of solution in weighted Lebesgue spaces with
anisotropic weights and thus existence of the wake region behind the obstacle.
We use properties of the fundamental Oseen tensor together with results
achieved in \cite{Koch} and properties of solutions to steady transport
equation to get up to arbitrarily small $\ep$ the same decay as the Oseen
fundamental solution.
