The problem of load balancing in a distribution network under unknown time-
varying demand and supply is studied. A set of distributed controllers which
regulate the amount of flow through the edges is designed to guarantee
convergence of the solution to the steady state solution. The results are then
extended to a class of nonlinear systems and compared with existing results.
Incremental passivity and internal model are the main analytical tools.
