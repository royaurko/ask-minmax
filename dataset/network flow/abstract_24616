Knowledge management (KM) adoption in the supply chain network needs a good
investment as well as few changes in the culture of the entire SC. Knowledge
management is the process of creating, distributing and transferring
information. The goal of this study is to Rank KM criteria in supply chain
network in Iran which is important for firms these days. Criterion used in this
paper were extracted from the literature review and were confirmed by supply
chain experts. The proposed approach for ranking and finding out about these
criterion is hybrid fuzzy DEMATEL-TODIM, with using fuzzy number as data for
our studies we could avoid uncertainty. The data was gathered from PhD. And Ms.
Students in industrial engineering of Kharrazmi university of Tehran and PhD.
And Ms. Students of the management department of Semnan university. A new
hybrid approach was used for achieving the results of this study. This new
hybrid approach ranks data criteria respect to each other, then by using TODIM
for ranking respect to the best situation (gains), the rates of criterion were
determined which is a very important advantage
