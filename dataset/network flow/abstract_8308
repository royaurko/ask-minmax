According to some recent analysis (M. Baiesi and M. Paczuski, Phys. Rev. E
{\bf 69}, 066106, 2004 \cite{maya1}) of earthquake data, aftershock epicenters
can be considered to represent the nodes of a network where the linking scheme
depends on several factors. In the present paper a model network of earthquake
aftershock epicenters is proposed based on this scheme and studied on fractals
of different dimensions. The various statistical features of this network, like
degree, link length, frequency and correlation distributions are evaluated and
compared to the observed data. The results are also found to be independent of
the fractal geometry.
