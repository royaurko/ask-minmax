Most papers about the evolutionary game on graph assume the statistic network
structure. However, social interaction could change the relationship of people.
And the changing social structure will affect the people's strategy too. We
build a coevolutionary model of prisoner's dilemma game and network structure
to study the dynamic interaction in the real world. Based on the asynchronous
update rule and Monte Carlo simulation, we find that, when players prefer to
rewire their links to the richer, the cooperation density will increase. The
reason of it has been analyzed.
