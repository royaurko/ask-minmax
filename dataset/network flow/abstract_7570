The Lagrangian derivatives of finite-time Lyapunov exponents and the
corresponding characteristic directions are shown to satisfy time-asymptotic
differential constraints in chaotic flows. The constraints are valid for any
metric tensor, and are realised with exponential accuracy in time. Some of
these constraints were derived previously for chaotic systems on
low-dimensional Euclidean spaces, by requiring that the Riemann curvature
tensor vanish in Lagrangian coordinates. The new derivation applies in any
number of dimensions, predicts the number of constraints for a given flow, and
provides a rigorous convergence rate of the constraints.
