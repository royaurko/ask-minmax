We discuss the elliptic flow dependence on pseudorapidity and number of
participating nucleons in the framework of string percolation, and argue that
the geometry of the initial overlap region of interaction, projected in the
impact parameter plane, determines the experimentally measured azimuthal
asymmetries. We found good agreement with data.
