The class of chain event graph models is a generalisation of the class of
discrete Bayesian networks, retaining most of the structural advantages of the
Bayesian network for model interrogation, propagation and learning, while more
naturally encoding asymmetric state spaces and the order in which events
happen. In this paper we demonstrate how with complete sampling, conjugate
closed form model selection based on product Dirichlet priors is possible, and
prove that suitable homogeneity assumptions characterise the product Dirichlet
prior on this class of models. We demonstrate our techniques using two
educational examples.
