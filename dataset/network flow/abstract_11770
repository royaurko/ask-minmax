Ameliorating the lifetime in heterogeneous wireless sensor network is an
important task because the sensor nodes are limited in the resource energy. The
best way to improve a WSN lifetime is the clustering based algorithms in which
each cluster is managed by a leader called Cluster Head. Each other node must
communicate with this CH to send the data sensing. The nearest base station
nodes must also send their data to their leaders, this causes a loss of energy.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to ameliorate a threshold distributed
energy efficient clustering protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks
by excluding closest nodes to the base station in the clustering process. We
show by simulation in MATLAB that the proposed approach increases obviously the
number of the received packet messages and prolongs the lifetime of the network
compared to TDEEC protocol.
