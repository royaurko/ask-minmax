Complex networks topologies present interesting and surprising properties,
such as community structures, which can be exploited to optimize communication,
to find new efficient and context-aware routing algorithms or simply to
understand the dynamics and meaning of relationships among nodes. Complex
networks are gaining more and more importance as a reference model and are a
powerful interpretation tool for many different kinds of natural, biological
and social networks, where directed relationships and contextual belonging of
nodes to many different communities is a matter of fact. This paper starts from
the definition of modularity function, given by M. Newman to evaluate the
goodness of network community decompositions, and extends it to the more
general case of directed graphs with overlapping community structures.
Interesting properties of the proposed extension are discussed, a method for
finding overlapping communities is proposed and results of its application to
benchmark case-studies are reported. We also propose a new dataset which could
be used as a reference benchmark for overlapping community structures
identification.
