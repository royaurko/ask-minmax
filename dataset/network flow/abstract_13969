We argue that the traditional event-plane method, which is still widely used
to analyze anisotropic flow in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, should
be abandoned because flow fluctuations introduce an uncontrolled bias in the
measurement. Instead, one should use an alternative, such as the scalar-product
method or cumulant method, which always measures an unambiguous property of the
underlying anisotropic flow and therefore eliminates this bias, and does so
without any disadvantages. It is known that this correction is important for
precision comparisons of traditional v_n measurements requiring better than a
few percent accuracy. However, we show that it is absolutely essential for
correlations between different harmonics, such as those that have been recently
measured by the ATLAS Collaboration, which can differ from the
nominally-measured quantity by a factor two or more. We also describe how,
using the corrected analysis method, the information from different subevents
can be combined in order to optimize the precision of analyses.
