In many applications we are interested in making inference on latent time
series from indirect measurements, which are often low-dimensional projections
resulting from mixing or aggregation. Positron emission tomography,
super-resolution, and network traffic monitoring are some examples. Inference
in such settings requires solving a sequence of ill-posed inverse problems,
y_t= A x_t, where the projection mechanism provides information on A. We
consider problems in which A specifies mixing on a graph of times series that
are bursty and sparse. We develop a multilevel state-space model for mixing
times series and an efficient approach to inference. A simple model is used to
calibrate regularization parameters that lead to efficient inference in the
multilevel state-space model. We apply this method to the problem of estimating
point-to-point traffic flows on a network from aggregate measurements. Our
solution outperforms existing methods for this problem, and our two-stage
approach suggests an efficient inference strategy for multilevel models of
dependent time series.
