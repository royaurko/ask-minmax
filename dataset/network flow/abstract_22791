We prove the conjecture by Kenji Fukaya on Witten deformation of wedge
product structure of differential forms, which said that the Witten twisted
product structures having asymptotic expansions whose leading order terms are
given by counting gradient flow trees appeared in the Morse category. This is
an enhancement of ordinary Witten deformation relating Witten twisted complex
to Morse complex. The proof uses semi-classical analysis for Witten twisted
Green's operator.
