We review recent measurements of the properties of the top quark: the decay
width of the top quark, of spin correlations between the top and the antitop
quarks in $\ttbar$ production, the $W$ boson helicity in top decays, the strong
colour flow in $\ttbar$ events, and the asymmetry of $\ttbar$ production due to
the strong colour charge. The measurements are performed on data samples of up
to 5.4 \fb\ of integrated luminosity acquired by the CDF and D0 collaborations
in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar p$ collider at a centre-of-mass
energy of $\sqrt s=1.96 \TeV$.
