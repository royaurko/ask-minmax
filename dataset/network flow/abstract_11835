Signed network analysis has attracted increasing attention in recent years.
This is in part because research on signed network analysis suggests that
negative links have added value in the analytical process. A major impediment
in their effective use is that most social media sites do not enable users to
specify them explicitly. In other words, a gap exists between the importance of
negative links and their availability in real data sets. Therefore, it is
natural to explore whether one can predict negative links automatically from
the commonly available social network data. In this paper, we investigate the
novel problem of negative link prediction with only positive links and
content-centric interactions in social media. We make a number of important
observations about negative links, and propose a principled framework NeLP,
which can exploit positive links and content-centric interactions to predict
negative links. Our experimental results on real-world social networks
demonstrate that the proposed NeLP framework can accurately predict negative
links with positive links and content-centric interactions. Our detailed
experiments also illustrate the relative importance of various factors to the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.
