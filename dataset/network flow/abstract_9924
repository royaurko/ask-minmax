Autocatalytic reaction fronts between reacted and unreacted species may
propagate as solitary waves, namely at a constant front velocity and with a
stationary concentration profile, resulting from a balance between molecular
diffusion and chemical reaction. A velocity field in the supporting medium may
affect the propagation of such fronts through different phenomena: convection,
diffusion enhancement, front shape changes... We report here on an experimental
study and lattice BGK numerical simulations of the effect of an oscillating
flow on the autocatalytic reaction between iodate and arsenous acid in a
Hele-Shaw cell. In the low frequency range covered by the experiments, the
front behavior is controlled by the flow across the gap and can be reproduced
with 2D numerical simulations. An analytical solution is also derived under the
condition of a weak flow velocity, and is found to be in reasonable agreement
with our data.
