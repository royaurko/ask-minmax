We consider a linear transport equation on the edges of a network with
time-varying coefficients. Using methods for non-autonomous abstract Cauchy
problems, we obtain well-posedness of the problem and describe the asymptotic
profile of the solutions under certain natural conditions on the network. We
further apply our theory to a model used for air traffic flow management.
