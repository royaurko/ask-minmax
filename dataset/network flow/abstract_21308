The hopping pattern for D2D Discovery are investi- gated. We propose three
metrics for hopping pattern performance evaluation: column period, maximal
collision ratio, maximal con- tinual collision number. A class of hopping
patterns is constructed based on the metrics, and through simulation the
patterns show better discovery performance.
