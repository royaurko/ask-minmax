In this work, we propose a fast and energy-efficient neighbor discovery
scheme for proximity-aware networks such as wireless ad hoc networks. Discovery
efficiency is accomplished by the use of a special discovery signal that
provides random multiple access with low transmit power consumption and low
synchronization requirement.
