Primary lymphoid follicles in secondary lymphoid tissue of mammals are the
backbone for the formation of follicular dendritic cell networks. These are
important for germinal center reactions. In the context of organogenesis
molecular requirements for the formation of follicles have been identified. The
present study complements this work with a simulation of the dynamics of the
primary lymphoid follicle formation. In contrast to other problems of pattern
formation, here, the homeostasis of the cell population is not governed by a
growth-death balance but by a flow equilibrium of migrating cells. The influx
of cells into secondary lymphoid tissue was extensively studied while less
information is available about the efflux of lymphocytes from secondary
lymphoid tissues. This study formulates the minimal requirements for cell
efflux that guarantee a flow equilibrium and, thus, a stable primary lymphoid
follicle. The model predicts that in addition to already identified mechanisms
a negative regulation of the generation of follicular dendritic cells is
required. Furthermore, a comparison with data concerning the microanatomy of
secondary lymphoid tissues yields the conclusion that dynamical changes during
the formation of FDC networks of the lymphatic endothelium are necessary to
understand the genesis and maintenance of follicles.
