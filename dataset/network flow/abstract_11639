Marketing literature states that it is more costly to engage a new customer
than to retain an existing loyal customer. Churn prediction models are
developed by academics and practitioners to effectively manage and control
customer churn in order to retain existing customers. As churn management is an
important activity for companies to retain loyal customers, the ability to
correctly predict customer churn is necessary. As the cellular network services
market becoming more competitive, customer churn management has become a
crucial task for mobile communication operators. This paper proposes a neural
network based approach to predict customer churn in subscription of cellular
wireless services. The results of experiments indicate that neural network
based approach can predict customer churn.
