Small-world networks (SWN), obtained by randomly adding to a regular
structure additional links (AL), are of current interest. In this article we
explore (based on physical models) a new variant of SWN, in which the
probability of realizing an AL depends on the chemical distance between the
connected sites. We assume a power-law probability distribution and study
random walkers on the network, focussing especially on their probability of
being at the origin. We connect the results to L\'evy Flights, which follow
from a mean field variant of our model.
