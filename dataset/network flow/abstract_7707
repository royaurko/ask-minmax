In this paper, a compensated compactness framework is established for
sonic-subsonic approximate solutions to the $n$-dimensional$(n\geq 2)$ Euler
equations for steady irrotational flow that may contain stagnation points. This
compactness framework holds provided that the approximate solutions are
uniformly bounded and satisfy $H^{-1}_{loc}(\Omega)$ compactness conditions. As
illustration, we show the existence of sonic-subsonic weak solution to
n-dimensional$(n\geq 2)$ Euler equations for steady irrotational flow past
obstacles or through an infinitely long nozzle. This is the first result
concerning the sonic-subsonic limit for $n$-dimension$(n\geq 3)$.
