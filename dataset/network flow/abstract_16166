The effect of small scale forcing on large scale structures in $\beta$-plane
two-dimensional (2D) turbulence is studied using long-term direct numerical
simulations (DNS). We find that nonlinear effects remain strong at all times
and for all scales and establish an inverse energy cascade that extends to the
largest scales available in the system. The large scale flow develops strong
spectral anisotropy: $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov scaling holds for almost all $\phi$,
$\phi=\arctan (k_y/k_x)$, except in the small vicinity of $k_x=0$, where
Rhines's $k^{-5}$ scaling prevails. Due to the $k^{-5}$ scaling, the spectral
evolution of $\beta$-plane turbulence becomes extremely slow which, perhaps,
explains why this scaling law has never before been observed in DNS.
Simulations with different values of $\beta$ indicate that the $\beta$-effect
diminishes at small scales where the flow is nearly isotropic. Thus, for
simulations of $\b$-plane turbulence forced at small scales sufficiently
removed from the scales where $\b$-effect is strong, large eddy simulation
(LES) can be used. A subgrid scale (SGS) parameterization for such LES must
account for the small scale forcing that is not explicitly resolved and
correctly accommodate two inviscid conservation laws, viz. energy and
enstrophy. This requirement gives rise to a new anisotropic stabilized negative
viscosity (SNV) SGS representation which is discussed in the context of LES of
isotropic 2D turbulence.
