We consider a finite horizon optimal stopping problem related to trade-off
strategies between expected profit and cost cash-flows of an investment under
uncertainty. The optimal problem is first formulated in terms of a system of
Snell envelopes for the profit and cost yields which act as obstacles to each
other. We then construct both a minimal and a maximal solutions using an
approximation scheme of the associated system of reflected backward SDEs. When
the dependence of the cash-flows on the sources of uncertainty, such as
fluctuation market prices, assumed to evolve according to a diffusion process,
is made explicit, we also obtain a connection between these solutions and
viscosity solutions of a system of variational inequalities (VI) with
interconnected obstacles. We also provide two counter-examples showing that
uniqueness of solutions of (VI) does not hold in general.
