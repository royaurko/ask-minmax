Modern social networks frequently encompass multiple distinct types of
connectivity information; for instance, explicitly acknowledged friend
relationships might complement behavioral measures that link users according to
their actions or interests. One way to represent these networks is as
multi-layer graphs, where each layer contains a unique set of edges over the
same underlying vertices (users). Edges in different layers typically have
related but distinct semantics; depending on the application multiple layers
might be used to reduce noise through averaging, to perform multifaceted
analyses, or a combination of the two. However, it is not obvious how to extend
standard graph analysis techniques to the multi-layer setting in a flexible
way. In this paper we develop latent variable models and methods for mining
multi-layer networks for connectivity patterns based on noisy data.
