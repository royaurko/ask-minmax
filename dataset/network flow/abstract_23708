The MultiNoC system implements a programmable on-chip multiprocessing
platform built on top of an efficient, low area overhead intra-chip
interconnection scheme. The employed interconnection structure is a Network on
Chip, or NoC. NoCs are emerging as a viable alternative to increasing demands
on interconnection architectures, due to the following characteristics: (i)
energy efficiency and reliability; (ii) scalability of bandwidth, when compared
to traditional bus architectures; (iii) reusability; (iv) distributed routing
decisions. An external host computer feeds MultiNoC with application
instructions and data. After this initialization procedure, MultiNoC executes
some algorithm. After finishing execution of the algorithm, output data can be
read back by the host. Sequential or parallel algorithms conveniently adapted
to the MultiNoC structure can be executed. The main motivation to propose this
design is to enable the investigation of current trends to increase the number
of embedded processors in SoCs, leading to the concept of "sea of processors"
systems.
