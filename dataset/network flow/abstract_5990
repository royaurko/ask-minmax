In a manner similar to the molecular chaos that underlies the stable
thermodynamics of gases, neuronal system may exhibit microscopic instability in
individual neuronal dynamics while a macroscopic order of the entire population
possibly remains stable. In this study, we analyze the microscopic stability of
a network of neurons whose macroscopic activity obeys stable dynamics,
expressing either monostable, bistable, or periodic state. We reveal that the
network exhibits a variety of dynamical states for microscopic instability
residing in given stable macroscopic dynamics. The presence of a variety of
dynamical states in such a simple random network implies more abundant
microscopic fluctuations in real neural networks, which consist of more complex
and hierarchically structured interactions.
