Spatial modeling of wireless networks via analytical means has been
considered as a widely practiced mechanism for inference. As a result, some
geometrical deployment models have been proposed in literature. Although
practical in certain simulation instances, these models do not always produce
inhomogeneous nodal geometries in an effective and simple manner for practical
deployment situations. Therefore, we conceptualized a flexible approach for
realizing random inhomogeneity by proposing the area-specific deployment (ASD)
algorithm, which takes into account the clustering tendency of users. Overall,
the developed spatial-level network tool has the distinct advantage of
automatically producing infinitely many random realizations of users' geometry
by simply entering three parameters to the simulator: the size of the cellular
network, the number of deployment layers, and the overall quantity of nodes.
