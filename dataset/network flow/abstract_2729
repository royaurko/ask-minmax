Inspired by empirical studies of networked systems such as the Internet,
social networks, and biological networks, researchers have in recent years
developed a variety of techniques and models to help us understand or predict
the behavior of these systems. Here we review developments in this field,
including such concepts as the small-world effect, degree distributions,
clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth
and preferential attachment, and dynamical processes taking place on networks.
