This letter reports on the realization of logic circuits employing
solution-processed networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes. We constructed
basic logic gates (inverter, NAND and NOR) with n- and p-type field-effect
transistors fabricated by solution-based chemical doping. Complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor inverters exhibited voltage gains of up to 20, which
illustrates the great potential of carbon nanotube networks for printable
flexible electronics.
