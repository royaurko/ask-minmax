We consider a continuum model for the dynamics of systems of self propelling
particles with kinematic constraints on the velocities. The model aims to be
analogous to a discrete algorithm used in works by T. Vicsek et al. In this
paper we prove that the only types of the stationary planar solutions in the
model are either of translational or axial symmetry of the flow. Within the
proposed model we differentiate between finite and infinite flocking behavior
by the finiteness of the kinetic energy functional.
