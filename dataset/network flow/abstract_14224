We analyze turbulent velocity signals measured by two probes in the
atmosphere, both at the height of 35 meters but displaced by 40 cm nominally
orthogonal to the mean wind. Choosing a suitable coordinate system with respect
to that of the mean wind, we derive theoretical forms for second order
structure functions, and fit them to experimental data. We show that the effect
of flow anisotropy is small on the longitudinal component but significant on
the transverse component. The data provide an estimate of a universal exponent
from among a hierarchy that governs the decay of flow anisotropy with the
scale-size.
