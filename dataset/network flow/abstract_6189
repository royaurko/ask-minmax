We investigate numerically kinematic dynamos driven by flow of electrically
conducting fluid in the shell between two concentric differentially rotating
spheres, a configuration normally referred to as spherical Couette flow. We
compare between axisymmetric (2D) and fully three dimensional flows, between
low and high global rotation rates, between prograde and retrograde
differential rotations, between weak and strong nonlinear inertial forces,
between insulating and conducting boundaries, and between two aspect ratios.
The main results are as follows. Azimuthally drifting Rossby waves arising from
the destabilisation of the Stewartson shear layer are crucial to dynamo action.
Differential rotation and helical Rossby waves combine to contribute to the
spherical Couette dynamo. At a slow global rotation rate, the direction of
differential rotation plays an important role in the dynamo because of
different patterns of Rossby waves in prograde and retrograde flows. At a rapid
global rotation rate, stronger flow supercriticality (namely the difference
between the differential rotation rate of the flow and its critical value for
the onset of nonaxisymmetric instability) facilitates the onset of dynamo
action. A conducting magnetic boundary condition and a larger aspect ratio both
favour dynamo action.
