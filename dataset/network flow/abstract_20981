The very original concept of cognitive radio (CR) raised by Mitola targets at
all the environment parameters, including those in physical layer, MAC layer,
application layer as well as the information extracted from reasoning. Hence
the first CR is also referred to as "full cognitive radio". However, due to its
difficult implementation, FCC and Simon Haykin separately proposed a much more
simplified definition, in which CR mainly detects one single parameter, i.e.,
spectrum occupancy, and is also called as "spectrum sensing cognitive radio".
With the rapid development of wireless communication, the infrastructure of a
wireless system becomes much more complicated while the functionality at every
node is desired to be as intelligent as possible, say the self-organized
capability in the approaching 5G cellular networks. It is then interesting to
re-look into Mitola's definition and think whether one could, besides obtaining
the "on/off" status of the licensed user only, achieve more parameters in a
cognitive way. In this article, we propose a new cognitive architecture
targeting at multiple parameters in future cellular networks, which is a one
step further towards the "full cognition" compared to the most existing CR
research. The new architecture is elaborated in detailed stages, and three
representative examples are provided based on the recent research progress to
illustrate the feasibility as well as the validity of the proposed
architecture.
