For the last few years, we assist to a growing interest of designing AQM
(Active Queue Management) using control theory. In this paper, we focus on the
synthesis of an AQM based on the Lyapunov theory for time delay systems. With
the help of a recently developed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and using a
state space representation of a linearized fluid model of TCP, two robust AQMs
stabilizing the TCP model are constructed. Notice that our results are
constructive and the synthesis problem is reduced to a convex optimization
scheme expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, an
example extracted from the literature and simulations via {\it NS simulator}
support our study.
