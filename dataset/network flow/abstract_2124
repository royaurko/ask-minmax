We consider a chain of one-dimensional dipole moments connected to two
thermal baths with different temperatures. The system is in nonequilibrium
steady state and heat flows through it. Assuming that fluctuation of the dipole
moment is a small parameter, we develop an analytically solvable model for the
problem. The effect of disorder is introduced by randomizing the positions of
the dipole moments. We show that the disorder leads to Anderson-like transition
from conducting to a thermal insulating state of the chain. It is shown that
considered chain supports both ballistic and diffusive heat transports
depending on the strength of the disorder. We demonstrate that nonequilibrium
leads to the emergence of the long-range order between dipoles along the chain
and make the conjecture that the interplay between nonequilibrium and
next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions results in the emergence of long-range
correlations in low-dimensional classical systems.
