Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study a unique expanded jammed
state. Tension transforms many glassy polymers from a dense glass to a network
of fibrils and voids called a craze. Entanglements between polymers and
interchain friction jam the system after a fixed increase in volume. As in
dense jammed systems, the distribution of forces is exponential, but they are
tensile rather than compressive. The broad distribution of forces has important
implications for fibril breakdown and the ultimate strength of crazes.
