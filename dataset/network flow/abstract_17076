It is well known that biology-inspired self-maintaining algorithms in
wireless sensor nodes achieve near optimum time division multiple access (TDMA)
characteristics in a decentralized manner and with very low complexity. We
extend such distributed TDMA approaches to multiple channels (frequencies).
This is achieved by extending the concept of collaborative reactive listening
in order to balance the number of nodes in all available channels. We prove the
stability of the new protocol and estimate the delay until the balanced system
state is reached. Our approach is benchmarked against single-channel
distributed TDMA and channel hopping approaches using TinyOS imote2 wireless
sensors.
