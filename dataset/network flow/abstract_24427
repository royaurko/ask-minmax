We propose dynamic resistive threshold-logic (DRTL) design based on
non-volatile resistive memory. A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs summation
of multiple inputs multiplied by a fixed set of weights and compares the sum
with a threshold. DRTL employs resistive memory elements to implement the
weights and the thresholds, while a compact dynamic CMOS latch is used for the
comparison operation. The resulting DRTL gate acts as a low-power, configurable
dynamic logic unit and can be used to build fully pipelined, high-performance
programmable computing blocks. Multiple stages in such a DRTL design can be
connected using energy-efficient low swing programmable interconnect networks
based on resistive switches. Owing to memory-based compact logic and
interconnect design and highspeed dynamic-pipelined operation, DRTL can achieve
more than two orders of magnitude improvement in energy-delay product as
compared to look-up table based CMOS FPGA.
