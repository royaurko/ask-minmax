A mathematical model for a two-gene regulatory network is derived and several
of their properties analyzed. Due to the presence of mixed continuous/discrete
dynamics and hysteresis, we employ a hybrid systems model to capture the
dynamics of the system. The proposed model incorporates binary hysteresis with
different thresholds capturing the interaction between the genes. We analyze
properties of the solutions and asymptotic stability of equilibria in the
system as a function of its parameters. Our analysis reveals the presence of
limit cycles for a certain range of parameters, behavior that is associated
with hysteresis. The set of points defining the limit cycle is characterized
and its asymptotic stability properties are studied. Furthermore, the stability
property of the limit cycle is robust to small perturbations. Numerical
simulations are presented to illustrate the results.
