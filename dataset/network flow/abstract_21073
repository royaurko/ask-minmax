We consider a magnetic impurity in the two-dimensional Heisenberg
antifferomagnet with long range antiferromagnetic order. At low temperature the
impurity magnetic susceptibility has a Curie term ($\propto 1/T$) and a
logarithmic correction ($\propto \ln(T)$). We calculate the correction and
derive related Ward identity for the impurity-spin-wave vertex.
