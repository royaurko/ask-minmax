Preliminary data on transverse energy `flow' and event asymmetries reported
by the E877(814) collaborations are compared to ARC model calculations for
Au+Au at full AGS beam energy. ARC triple differential cross-sections for
protons and pions are presented. Proton flow is produced in ARC, with the
maximum in-plane momentum about 120 MeV/c. For central events the directed
momentum for pions is near zero, consistent with experiment. Pion momentum
opposite to the nucleons' is evident in a peripheral sample, however,
indicating that this pion `anti-flow' involves absorption by `spectator'
matter. `Squeeze-out' of protons in central events at mid-rapidity is suggested
by the ARC distributions.
