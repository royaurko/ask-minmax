Passive scalars advected by a magnetically driven two-dimensional turbulent
flow are analyzed using methods of statistical topography. The passive tracer
concentration is interpreted as the height of a random surface and the scaling
properties of its contour loops are analyzed. Various exponents that describe
the loop ensemble are measured and compared to a scaling theory. This leads to
a geometrical criterion of intermittency of scalar fluctuations.
