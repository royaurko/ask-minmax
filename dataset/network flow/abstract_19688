The physical behaviour of a class of mesoscopic models for multiphase flows
is analyzed in details near interfaces. In particular, an extended
pseudo-potential method is developed, which permits to tune the equation of
state and surface tension independently of each other. The spurious velocity
contributions of this extended model are shown to vanish in the limit of high
grid refinement and/or high order isotropy. Higher order schemes to implement
self-consistent forcings are rigorously computed for 2d and 3d models. The
extended scenario developed in this work clarifies the theoretical foundations
of the Shan-Chen methodology for the lattice Boltzmann method and enhances its
applicability and flexibility to the simulation of multiphase flows to density
ratios up to O(100).
