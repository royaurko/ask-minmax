Recently Gizon, Duvall and Schou (2002) suggested that supergranulation has a
wave-like component. In this paper I show that the same phenomenon can be
observed using surface Doppler shift data, thereby confirming their
observations. I am also able to measure the dispersion relation to lower
wavenumbers and to extend the results for rotation and meridional flows beyond
+/-70 degrees latitude.
