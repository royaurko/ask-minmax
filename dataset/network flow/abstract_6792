Recently it was pointed out that nonmodally (transiently and/or
adiabatically) pre-amplified waves in shear flows, undergoing subsequent
viscous damping, can ultimately heat the ambient flow. The key ingredient of
this process is the ability of waves to grow, by extracting energy from the
spatially inhomogeneous mean flow. In this paper we examine this mechanism in
the context of the solar coronal plasma flows. "Self-heating" (SH) processes
are examined when both viscous damping and magnetic resistivity are at work. We
show that if the plasma viscosity is in the favorable range of values the
asymptotic SH rate in these flows can be quite substantial.
