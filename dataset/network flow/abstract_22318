The dynamics of an impurity (or tracer particle) immersed in a dilute
granular gas under uniform shear flow is investigated. A non-equilibrium phase
transition is identified from an exact solution of the inelastic Boltzmann
equation for a granular binary mixture in the tracer limit, where the impurity
carries either a vanishing (disordered phase) or a finite (ordered phase)
fraction of the total kinetic energy of the system. In the disordered phase,
the granular temperature ratio (impurity "temperature" over that of the host
fluid) is finite, while it diverges in the ordered phase. To correctly capture
this extreme violation of energy equipartition, we show that the picture of an
impurity enslaved to the host fluid is insufficient.
