In modern scenario we need to have mechanisms which can provide better
interaction with physical world by an efficient and more effective
communication and computation approach for multiple heterogeneous sensor
networks. Previous work provides efficient communication approach between
sensor nodes and a query centric approach for multiple collaborative
heterogeneous sensor networks. Even there is energy issues involved in wireless
sensor network operation. In this paper we have proposed Query centric Cyber
Physical System (QCPS)model to implement query centric user request using Cyber
Physical System (CPS). CPS takes both communication and computation in parallel
to provide better interaction with physical world. This feature of CPS reduces
system cost and makes it more energy efficient. This paper provides an
efficient query processing approach for multiple heterogeneous sensor networks
using cyber physical system.This approach results in reduction of communication
and computation cost as sensor network communicates using centroid of
respective grids which reduces cost of communication while involvement of CPS
reduces the computation cost.
