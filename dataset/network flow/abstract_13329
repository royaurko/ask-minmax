We study magnetohydrodynamics in a von K\'arm\'an flow driven by the rotation
of impellers made of material with varying electrical conductivity and magnetic
permeability. Gallium is the working fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers of
order unity are achieved. We find that specific induction effects arise when
the impeller's electric and magnetic characteristics differ from that of the
fluid. Implications in regards to the VKS dynamo are discussed.
