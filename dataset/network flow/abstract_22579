We study the effect of isospin degree of freedom on balance energy throughout
the mass range between 50 and 350 for two sets of isotopic systems with N/Z =
1.16 and 1.33 as well as isobaric systems with N/A = 1.0 and 1.4. Our findings
indicate that different values of balance energy for two isobaric systems may
be mainly due to the Coulomb repulsion. We also demonstrate clearly the
dominance of Coulomb repulsion over symmetry energy.
