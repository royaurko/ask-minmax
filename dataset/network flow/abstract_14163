We present new gas flow models for the Milky Way inside the solar circle.
Using a mass model derived from the COBE/DIRBE maps and clump giant star
counts, and using a parametric model for the spiral arm pattern in the disk, we
calculate the gas flow and compare with 12CO observations. We find that models
with 4 spiral arms fit the observations better then 2-armed models. We also
find that models with separate pattern speeds for the bar and spiral arms can
explain the gas flow in the bar corotation region better than single-pattern
speed models.
