We formulate adaptation of antenna tilt angle as a utility fair optimisation
task. This optimisation problem is non-convex, but in this paper we show that
under reasonable conditions it can be reformulated as a convex optimisation.
Using this insight, we develop a lightweight method for finding the optimal
antenna tilt angles, making use of measurements which are already available at
base stations, and suited to distributed implementation.
