We focus in this paper on the problem of configuring and managing network
security devices, such as Firewalls, Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels, and
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Our proposal is the following. First, we
formally specify the security requirements of a given system by using an
expressive access control model. As a result, we obtain an abstract security
policy, which is free of ambiguities, redundancies or unnecessary details.
Second, we deploy such an abstract policy through a set of automatic
compilations into the security devices of the system. This proposed deployment
process not only simplifies the security administrator's job, but also
guarantees a resulting configuration free of anomalies and/or inconsistencies.
