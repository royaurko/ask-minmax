The advance in RF energy transfer and harvesting technique over the past
decade has enabled wireless energy replenishment for electronic devices, which
is deemed as a promising alternative to address the energy bottleneck of
conventional battery-powered devices. In this paper, by using a stochastic
geometry approach, we aim to analyze the performance of an RF-powered wireless
sensor in a downlink simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT) system with ambient RF transmitters. Specifically, we consider the
point-to-point downlink SWIPT transmission from an access point to a wireless
sensor in a network, where ambient RF transmitters are distributed as a Ginibre
?$\alpha$-determinantal point process (DPP), which becomes the Poisson point
process when $\alpha$? approaches zero. In the considered network, we focus on
analyzing the performance of a sensor equipped with the power-splitting
architecture. Under this architecture, we characterize the expected RF energy
harvesting rate of the sensor. Moreover, we derive the upper bound of both
power and transmission outage probabilities. Numerical results show that our
upper bounds are accurate for different value of ?$\alpha$.
