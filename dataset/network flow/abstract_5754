We introduce a minimal model of small-world growing network generated by
attaching to edges. The produced network is a plane graph which exists in
real-life world. We obtain the analytic results of degree distribution decaying
exponentially with degree and average clustering coefficient
$C={3/2}ln3-1\approx 0.6479$, which are in good agreement with the numerical
simulations. We also prove that the increasing tendency of average path length
of the considered network is a little slower than the logarithm of the network
order $N$.
