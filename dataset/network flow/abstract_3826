We consider systems that are well modelled as a networks that evolve in time,
which we call {\it Moving Neighborhood Networks}. These models are relevant in
studying cooperative behavior of swarms and other phenomena where emergent
interactions arise from ad hoc networks. In a natural way, the time-averaged
degree distribution gives rise to a scale-free network. Simulations show that
although the network may have many noncommunicating components, the
time-averaged communication is sufficient to yield robust synchronization of
chaotic oscillators.
