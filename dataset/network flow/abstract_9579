In computer networking, the Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique
value associated with a network adapter. MAC addresses are also known as
hardware addresses or physical addresses. TCP/IP and other mainstream
networking architectures generally adopt the OSI model. MAC addresses function
at the data link layer (layer 2 in the OSI model). They allow computers to
uniquely identify themselves on a network at this relatively low level. In this
paper, suggested data encryption technique is presented by using the MAC
address as a key that is used to authenticate the receiver device like PC,
mobile phone, laptop or any other devices that is connected to the network.
This technique was tested on some data, visual and numerical measurements were
used to check the strength and performance of the technique. The experiments
showed that the suggested technique can be used easily to encrypt data that is
transmitted through networks.
