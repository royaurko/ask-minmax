The direct measurements of the meridional flow velocities on stars are
impossible today. To evaluate the meridional flow velocities on solar-like
stars with stable activity periods, we supposed that during the stellar Hale
cycle the matter on surfaces of stars passes the meridional way equivalent to
$2\pi R_\star$. We present here the dependence of the mean meridional flow
velocity on Rossby number, which is an effective parameter of the stellar
magnetic dynamo.
