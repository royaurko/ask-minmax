Computer systems are facing biggest threat in the form of malicious data
which causing denial of service, information theft, financial and credibility
loss etc. No defense technique has been proved successful in handling these
threats. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPSs) being best of
available solutions. These techniques are getting more and more attention.
Although Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) show a good level of success in
detecting and preventing intrusion attempts to networks, they show a visible
deficiency in their performance when they are employed on fast networks. In
this paper we have presented a design including quantitative and qualitative
methods to identify improvement areas in IPSs. Focus group is used for
qualitative analysis and experiment is used for quantitative analysis. This
paper also describes how to reduce the responding time for IPS when an
intrusion occurs on network, and how can IPS be made to perform its tasks
successfully without effecting network speed negatively.
