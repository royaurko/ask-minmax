A security policy specifies a security property as the maximal information
flow. A distributed system composed of interacting processes implicitly defines
an intransitive security policy by repudiating direct information flow between
processes that do not exchange messages directly. We show that implicitly
defined security policies in distributed systems are enforced, provided that
processes run in separation, and possible process communication on a technical
platform is restricted to specified message paths of the system. Furthermore,
we propose to further restrict the allowable information flow by adding filter
functions for controlling which messages may be transmitted between processes,
and we prove that locally checking filter functions is sufficient for ensuring
global security policies. Altogether, global intransitive security policies are
established by means of local verification conditions for the (trusted)
processes of the distributed system. Moreover, security policies may be
implemented securely on distributed integration platforms which ensure
partitioning. We illustrate our results with a smart grid case study, where we
use CTL model checking for discharging local verification conditions for each
process under consideration.
