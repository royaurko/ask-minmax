We examine the fixed points to first-order RG flow of a non-linear sigma
model with background metric, dilaton and tachyon fields. We show that on
compact target spaces, the existence of fixed points with non-zero tachyon is
linked to the sign of the second derivative of the tachyon potential $V''(T)$
(this is the analogue of a result of Bourguignon for the zero-tachyon case).
For a tachyon potential with only the leading term, such fixed points are
possible. On non-compact target spaces, we introduce a small non-zero tachyon
and compute the correction to the Euclidean 2d black hole (cigar) solution at
second order in perturbation theory with a tachyon potential containing a cubic
term as well. The corrections to the metric, tachyon and dilaton are
well-behaved at this order and tachyon `hair' persists. We also briefly discuss
solutions to the RG flow equations in the presence of a tachyon that suggest a
comparison to dynamical fixed point solutions obtained by Yang and Zwiebach.
