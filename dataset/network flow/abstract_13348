In this paper, we study an $\alpha$-flow for the Sack-Uhlenbeck functional on
Riemannian surfaces and prove that the limiting map by the $\alpha$-flows is a
weak solution to the harmonic map flow. By an application of the $\alpha$-flow,
we present a simple proof of an energy identity of a minimizing sequence in
each homotopy class.
