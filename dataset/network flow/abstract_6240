In this paper we study the resilience of peer-to-peer networks to
preferential attacks. We define a network model and experiment with three di
erent simple repairing algorithms, out of which the so called 2nd neighbor
rewiring algorithm is found to be e ective and plausible for keeping a large
connected component in the network, in spite of the continuous attacks. While
our motivation comes from peer-to-peer file sharing networks, we believe that
our results are more general and applicable in a wide range of networks. All
this work was done as a student project in the Complex Systems Summer School
2004, organized by the Santa Fe Institute in Santa Fe, NM, USA.
