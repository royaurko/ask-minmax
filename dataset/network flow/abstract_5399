Understanding design principles of complex cellular organization is one of
the major challenges in biology. Recent analysis of the large-scale cellular
organization has revealed the scale-free nature and robustness of metabolic and
protein networks. However, the underlying evolutional process that creates such
a cellular organization is not fully elucidated. To approach this problem, we
analyzed the metabolic networks of 126 organisms, whose draft or complete
genome sequences have been published. This analysis has revealed that the
evolutional process of metabolic networks follows the same and surprisingly
simple principles in Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes; where highly linked
metabolites change their chemical links more dynamically than less linked
metabolites. Here we demonstrate that this rich-travel-more mechanism rather
than the previously proposed rich-get-richer mechanism can generate the
observed scale-free organization of metabolic networks. These findings
illustrate universal principles in evolution of metabolic networks and suggest
marked flexibility of metabolic network throughout evolution.
