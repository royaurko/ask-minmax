The statistical properties of heavy particle trajectories in high Reynolds
numbers turbulent flows are analyzed. Dimensional analysis assuming Kolmogorov
scaling is compared with the result of numerical simulation using a synthetic
turbulence advecting field. The non-Markovian nature of the fluid velocity
statistics along the solid particle trajectories is put into evidence, and its
relevance in the derivation of Lagrangian transport models is discussed.
