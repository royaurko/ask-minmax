The aim of this paper is to show the influence of the atmospheric boundary
layer profile on the distribution of velocity in a building having two large
openings. The knowledge of the flow form inside a building is useful to define
a thermal environment favourable with thermal comfort and good air quality. In
computational fluid dynamics, several profiles of atmospheric boundary layer
can be used like logarithmic profiles or power profiles. This paper shows the
impact of these profiles on the indoor airflow. Non-ventilated or ventilated
parts of room are found. They show respectively ineffective ventilation and
effective ventilation. A qualitative and global approach allows to observe the
flows in a cubic building and to show the influence of each profile according
to the external ground roughness and the incidence angle of the wind. Some
zones, where occupants move, are named volumes of life. Ventilation is there
observed using traditional tools in order to analyze quantitatively the
ventilation of these zones.
