We construct a deformed Morse complex computing the equivariant cohomology of
a manifold M endowed with a smooth S^1-action. The deformation of the
coboundary operator is given by counting gradient flow lines of a Morse
function f that are allowed to "jump" along orbits of the S^1-action for finite
time intervalls.
