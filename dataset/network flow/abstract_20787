A distinct difference configuration is a set of points in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with
the property that the vectors (\emph{difference vectors}) connecting any two of
the points are all distinct. Many specific examples of these configurations
have been previously studied: the class of distinct difference configurations
includes both Costas arrays and sonar sequences, for example.
  Motivated by an application of these structures in key predistribution for
wireless sensor networks, we define the $k$-hop coverage of a distinct
difference configuration to be the number of distinct vectors that can be
expressed as the sum of $k$ or fewer difference vectors. This is an important
parameter when distinct difference configurations are used in the wireless
sensor application, as this parameter describes the density of nodes that can
be reached by a short secure path in the network. We provide upper and lower
bounds for the $k$-hop coverage of a distinct difference configuration with $m$
points, and exploit a connection with $B_{h}$ sequences to construct
configurations with maximal $k$-hop coverage. We also construct distinct
difference configurations that enable all small vectors to be expressed as the
sum of two of the difference vectors of the configuration, an important task
for local secure connectivity in the application.
