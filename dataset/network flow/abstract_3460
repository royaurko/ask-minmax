This paper studies real-world road networks from an algorithmic perspective,
focusing on empirical studies that yield useful properties of road networks
that can be exploited in the design of fast algorithms that deal with
geographic data. Unlike previous approaches, our study is not based on the
assumption that road networks are planar graphs. Indeed, based on the a number
of experiments we have performed on the road networks of the 50 United States
and District of Columbia, we provide strong empirical evidence that road
networks are quite non-planar. Our approach therefore instead is directed at
finding algorithmically-motivated properties of road networks as non-planar
geometric graphs, focusing on alternative properties of road networks that can
still lead to efficient algorithms for such problems as shortest paths and
Voronoi diagrams. In particular, we study road networks as multiscale-dispersed
graphs, which is a concept we formalize in terms of disk neighborhood systems.
This approach allows us to develop fast algorithms for road networks without
making any additional assumptions about the distribution of edge weights. In
fact, our algorithms can allow for non-metric weights.
