A wireless sensor network consists of light-weight, low power, small size
sensor nodes. Routing in wireless sensor networks is a demanding task. This
demand has led to a number of routing protocols which efficiently utilize the
limited resources available at the sensor nodes. Most of these protocols are
either based on single hop routing or multi hop routing and typically find the
minimum energy path without addressing other issues such as time delay in
delivering a packet, load balancing, and redundancy of data. Response time is
very critical in environment monitoring sensor networks where typically the
sensors are stationary and transmit data to a base station or a sink node. In
this paper a faster load balancing routing protocol based on location with a
hybrid approach is proposed.
