Here we uncover the load and fault-tolerant backbones of the trans-European
gas pipeline network. Combining topological data with information on
inter-country flows, we estimate the global load of the network and its
tolerance to failures. To do this, we apply two complementary methods
generalized from the betweenness centrality and the maximum flow. We find that
the gas pipeline network has grown to satisfy a dual-purpose: on one hand, the
major pipelines are crossed by a large number of shortest paths thereby
increasing the efficiency of the network; on the other hand, a non-operational
pipeline causes only a minimal impact on network capacity, implying that the
network is error-tolerant. These findings suggest that the trans-European gas
pipeline network is robust, i.e., error tolerant to failures of high load
links.
