Cyber security is one of the most significant technical challenges in current
times. Detecting adversarial activities, prevention of theft of intellectual
properties and customer data is a high priority for corporations and government
agencies around the world. Cyber defenders need to analyze massive-scale,
high-resolution network flows to identify, categorize, and mitigate attacks
involving networks spanning institutional and national boundaries. Many of the
cyber attacks can be described as subgraph patterns, with prominent examples
being insider infiltrations (path queries), denial of service (parallel paths)
and malicious spreads (tree queries). This motivates us to explore subgraph
matching on streaming graphs in a continuous setting. The novelty of our work
lies in using the subgraph distributional statistics collected from the
streaming graph to determine the query processing strategy. We introduce a
"Lazy Search" algorithm where the search strategy is decided on a
vertex-to-vertex basis depending on the likelihood of a match in the vertex
neighborhood. We also propose a metric named "Relative Selectivity" that is
used to select between different query processing strategies. Our experiments
performed on real online news, network traffic stream and a synthetic social
network benchmark demonstrate 10-100x speedups over selectivity agnostic
approaches.
