We study the structure of inter-industry relationships using networks of
money flows between industries in 20 national economies. We find these networks
vary around a typical structure characterized by a Weibull link weight
distribution, exponential industry size distribution, and a common community
structure. The community structure is hierarchical, with the top level of the
hierarchy comprising five industry communities: food industries, chemical
industries, manufacturing industries, service industries, and extraction
industries.
