We first formulate the problem of optimally scheduling air traffic low with
sector capacity constraints as a mixed integer linear program. We then use
semidefinite relaxation techniques to form a convex relaxation of that problem.
Finally, we present a randomization algorithm to further improve the quality of
the solution. Because of the specific structure of the air traffic flow
problem, the relaxation has a single semidefinite constraint of size dn where d
is the maximum delay and n the number of flights.
