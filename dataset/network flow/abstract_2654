The two-dimensional flow of viscous incompressible fluid in the domain
between two concentric circles is investigated numerically. To solve the
problem, the low-order Galerkin models are used. When the inner circle rotates
fast enough, two axially asymmetric flow regimes are observed. Both regimes are
the stationary flows precessing in azimuthal direction. First flow represents
the region of concentrated vorticity. Another flow is the jet-like structure
similar to one discovered earlier in Vladimirov's experiments.
