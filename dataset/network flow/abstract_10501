We introduce a new approach to constructing networks with realistic features.
Our method, in spite of its conceptual simplicity (it has only two parameters)
is capable of generating a wide variety of network types with prescribed
statistical properties, e.g., with degree- or clustering coefficient
distributions of various, very different forms. In turn, these graphs can be
used to test hypotheses, or, as models of actual data. The method is based on a
mapping between suitably chosen singular measures defined on the unit square
and sparse infinite networks. Such a mapping has the great potential of
allowing for graph theoretical results for a variety of network topologies. The
main idea of our approach is to go to the infinite limit of the singular
measure and the size of the corresponding graph simultaneously. A very unique
feature of this construction is that the complexity of the generated network is
increasing with the size. We present analytic expressions derived from the
parameters of the -- to be iterated-- initial generating measure for such major
characteristics of graphs as their degree, clustering coefficient and
assortativity coefficient distributions. The optimal parameters of the
generating measure are determined from a simple simulated annealing process.
Thus, the present work provides a tool for researchers from a variety of fields
(such as biology, computer science, biology, or complex systems) enabling them
to create a versatile model of their network data.
