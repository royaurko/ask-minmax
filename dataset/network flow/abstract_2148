We study localization of elastic waves in two-dimensional heterogeneous
solids with randomly distributed Lam\'e coefficients, as well as those with
long-range correlations with a power-law correlation function. The
Matin-Siggia-Rose method is used, and the one-loop renormalization group (RG)
equations for the the coupling constants are derived in the limit of long
wavelengths. The various phases of the coupling constants space, which depend
on the value $\rho$, the exponent that characterizes the power-law correlation
function, are determined and described. Qualitatively different behaviors
emerge for $\rho<1$ and $\rho>1$. The Gaussian fixed point (FP) is stable
(unstable) for $\rho<1$ ($\rho>1$). For $\rho<1$ there is a region of the
coupling constants space in which the RG flows are toward the Gaussian FP,
implying that the disorder is irrelevant and the waves are delocalized. In the
rest of the disorder space the elastic waves are localized. We compare the
results with those obtained previously for acoustic wave propagation in the
same type of heterogeneous media, and describe the similarities and differences
between the two phenomena.
