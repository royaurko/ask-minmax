We report experiments on hard sphere colloidal glasses that reveal a type of
shear banding hitherto unobserved in soft glasses. We present a scenario that
relates this to an instability arising from shear-concentration coupling, a
mechanism previously thought unimportant in this class of materials. Below a
characteristic shear rate $\dot\gamma_c$ we observe increasingly non-linear
velocity profiles and strongly localized flows. We attribute this trend to very
slight concentration gradients (likely to evade direct detection) arising in
the unstable flow regime. A simple model accounts for both the observed
increase of $\dot\gamma_c$ with concentration, and the fluctuations observed in
the flow.
