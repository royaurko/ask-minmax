Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) formally model chemistry in a well-mixed
solution. CRNs are widely used to describe information processing occurring in
natural cellular regulatory networks, and with upcoming advances in synthetic
biology, CRNs are a promising language for the design of artificial molecular
control circuitry. Nonetheless, despite the widespread use of CRNs in the
natural sciences, the range of computational behaviors exhibited by CRNs is not
well understood.
  CRNs have been shown to be efficiently Turing-universal when allowing for a
small probability of error. CRNs that are guaranteed to converge on a correct
answer, on the other hand, have been shown to decide only the semilinear
predicates. We introduce the notion of function, rather than predicate,
computation by representing the output of a function f:N^k --> N^l by a count
of some molecular species, i.e., if the CRN starts with n_1,...,n_k molecules
of some "input" species X1,...,Xk, the CRN is guaranteed to converge to having
f(n_1,...,n_k) molecules of the "output" species Y1,...,Yl. We show that a
function f:N^k --> N^l is deterministically computed by a CRN if and only if
its graph {(x,y) | f(x) = y} is a semilinear set. Furthermore, each semilinear
function f can be computed on input x in expected time O(polylog(|x|)).
