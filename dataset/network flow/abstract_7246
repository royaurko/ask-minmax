Most of the complex social, technological and biological networks have a
significant community structure. Therefore the community structure of complex
networks has to be considered as a universal property, together with the much
explored small-world and scale-free properties of these networks. Despite the
large interest in characterizing the community structures of real networks, not
enough attention has been devoted to the detection of universal mechanisms able
to spontaneously generate networks with communities. Triadic closure is a
natural mechanism to make new connections, especially in social networks. Here
we show that models of network growth based on simple triadic closure naturally
lead to the emergence of community structure, together with fat-tailed
distributions of node degree, high clustering coefficients. Communities emerge
from the initial stochastic heterogeneity in the concentration of links,
followed by a cycle of growth and fragmentation. Communities are the more
pronounced, the sparser the graph, and disappear for high values of link
density and randomness in the attachment procedure. By introducing a
fitness-based link attractivity for the nodes, we find a novel phase
transition, where communities disappear for high heterogeneity of the fitness
distribution, but a new mesoscopic organization of the nodes emerges, with
groups of nodes being shared between just a few superhubs, which attract most
of the links of the system.
