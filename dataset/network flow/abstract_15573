Barrage relays networks (BRNs) are ad hoc networks built on a rapid
cooperative flooding primitive as opposed to the traditional point-to-point
link abstraction. Controlled barrage regions (CBRs) can be used to contain this
flooding primitive for unicast and multicast, thereby enabling spatial reuse.
In this paper, the behavior of individual CBRs is described as a Markov process
that models the potential cooperative relay transmissions. The outage
probability for a CBR is found in closed form for a given topology, and the
probability takes into account fading and co-channel interference (CCI) between
adjacent CBRs. Having adopted this accurate analytical framework, this paper
proceeds to optimize a BRN by finding the optimal size of each CBR, the number
of relays contained within each CBR, the optimal relay locations when they are
constrained to lie on a straight line, and the code rate that maximizes the
transport capacity.
