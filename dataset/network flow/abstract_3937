A model based on self-organizing nature of the surfaces is represented to
capture the evolution of friction networks. Also, the curvatures of
displacement fields are determined and critical curvature profiles are
connected through links to form ridge-networks. To generate the ridge-networks,
we consider the interactions of pairs though a directed network framework,
namely, dilatancy (divergence) and deviotric components (vorticity) of local
maxima of curvature profiles. The correlation of the characteristics of
generated networks with synthetic acoustic signatures of frictional interface
is postulated while the interactions of critical pairs before and after
frictional sliding highlighted.
