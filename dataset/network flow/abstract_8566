We deal with the problem of automatically generating social networks by
analyzing and assessing smartphone usage and interaction data. We start by
assigning weights to the different types of interactions such as messaging,
email, phone calls, chat and physical proximity. Next, we propose a ranking
algorithm which recognizes the pattern of interaction taking into account the
changes in the collected data over time. Both algorithms are based on recent
findings from social network research.
