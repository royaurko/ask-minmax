Practical random network coding based schemes for multicast include a header
in each packet that records the transformation between the sources and the
terminal. The header introduces an overhead that can be significant in certain
scenarios. In previous work, parity check matrices of error control codes along
with error decoding were used to reduce this overhead. In this work we propose
novel packet formats that allow us to use erasure decoding and list decoding.
Both schemes have a smaller overhead compared to the error decoding based
scheme, when the number of sources combined in a packet is not too small.
