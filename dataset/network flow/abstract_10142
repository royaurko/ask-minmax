In this paper we report on the nonresonant conversion of convectively
unstable linear gravity modes into acoustic oscillation modes in shear flows.
The convectively unstable linear gravity modes can excite acoustic modes with
similar wave-numbers. The frequencies of the excited oscillations may be
qualitatively higher than the temporal variation scales of the source flow,
while the frequency spectra of the generated oscillations should be
intrinsically correlated to the velocity field of the source flow. We
anticipate that this nonresonant phenomenon can significantly contribute to the
production of sound waves in the solar convection zone.
