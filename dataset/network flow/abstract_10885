In this paper, we show that the spatio-temporal evolution of incompressible
flows in a long circular pipe can be described by vorticity dynamics. The
principal techniques to obtain solution are similar to those used for flows in
the whole space. As the consideration of the Navier-Stokes equations is given
in a cylindrical co-ordinates, two aspects of complication arise. One is the
interaction of the velocity components in the radial and azimuthal directions
due to the fictitious centrifugal force in the equations of motion. The rate of
the vorticity production at pipe wall depends on the initial data at entry and
hence is unknown a priori; it must be determined as part of the solution. The
vorticity solution obtained defines an intricate flow field of multitudinous
degrees of freedom. As the Reynolds number increases, the analytical solution
predicts vorticity-scale proliferations in succession. For sufficient large
initial data, pipe flows are of turbulent nature. The solution of the governing
equations is globally regular and does not bifurcate in space or in time. It is
asserted that laminar-turbulent transition is a dynamic process inbred in the
non-linearity. The presence of exogenous disturbances, due to imperfect test
environments or purpose-made artificial forcing, distorts the course of the
intrinsic transition. The flow structures observed by Reynolds (1883) and
others can be synthesised and elucidated in light of the current theory.
