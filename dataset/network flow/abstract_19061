The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to occupy a substantial component of
future Internet. The IoT connects sensors and devices that record physical
observations to applications and services of the Internet. As a successor to
technologies such as RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), the IoT has
stumbled into vertical silos of proprietary systems, providing little or no
interoperability with similar systems. As the IoT represents future state of
the Internet, an intelligent and scalable architecture is required to provide
connectivity between these silos, enabling discovery of physical sensors and
interpretation of messages between things. This paper proposes a gateway and
Semantic Web enabled IoT architecture to provide interoperability between
systems using established communication and data standards. The Semantic
Gateway as Service (SGS) allows translation between messaging protocols such as
XMPP, CoAP and MQTT via a multi-protocol proxy architecture. Utilization of
broadly accepted specifications such as W3C's Semantic Sensor Network (SSN)
ontology for semantic annotations of sensor data provide semantic
interoperability between messages and support semantic reasoning to obtain
higher-level actionable knowledge from low-level sensor data.
