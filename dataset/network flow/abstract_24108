The problem of joint transfer of information and energy for wireless links
has been recently investigated in light of emerging applications such as RFID
and body area networks. Specifically, recent work has shown that the additional
requirements of providing sufficient energy to the receiver significantly
affects the design of the optimal communication strategy. In contrast to most
previous works, this letter focuses on baseline multi-user systems, namely
multiple access and multi-hop channels, and demonstrates that energy transfer
constraints call for additional coordination among distributed nodes of a
wireless network. The analysis is carried out using information theoretic
tools, and specific examples are worked out to illustrate the main conclusions.
