We used a thermal model of an iron core to calculate magnetodynamo evolution
in Earth-mass rocky planets to determine the sensitivity of dynamo lifetime and
intensity to planets with different mantle tectonic regimes, surface
temperatures, and core properties. The heat flow at the core-mantle boundary
(CMB) is derived from numerical models of mantle convection with a
viscous/pseudo-plastic rheology that captures the phenomenology of plate-like
tectonics. Our thermal evolution models predict a long-lived (~8 Gyr) field for
Earth and similar dynamo evolution for Earth-mass exoplanets with plate
tectonics. Both elevated surface temperature and pressure-dependent mantle
viscosity reduce the CMB heat flow but produce only slightly longer-lived
dynamos (~8-9.5 Gyr). Single-plate ("stagnant lid") planets with relatively low
CMB heat flow produce long-lived (~10.5 Gyr) dynamos. These weaker dynamos can
cease for several billions of years and subsequently reactivate due to the
additional entropy production associated with inner core growth, a possible
explanation for the absence of a magnetic field on present-day Venus. We also
show that dynamo operation is sensitive to the initial temperature, size, and
solidus of a planet's core. These dependencies would severely challenge any
attempt to distinguish exoplanets with plate tectonics and stagnant lids based
on the presence or absence of a magnetic field.
