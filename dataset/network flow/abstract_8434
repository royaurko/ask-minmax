We show that the capacity of a complex network that models a city street grid
to support congested traffic can be optimized by using routes that collectively
minimize the maximum ratio of betweenness to capacity in any link. Networks
with a heterogeneous distribution of link capacities and with a heterogeneous
transport load are considered. We find that overall traffic congestion and
average travel times can be significantly reduced by a judicious use of slower,
smaller capacity links.
