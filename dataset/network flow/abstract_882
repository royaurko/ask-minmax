In this paper, a flexible optimization-based framework for intentional
islanding is presented. The decision is made of which transmission lines to
switch in order to split the network while minimizing disruption, the amount of
load shed, or grouping coherent generators. The approach uses a piecewise
linear model of AC power flow, which allows the voltage and reactive power to
be considered directly when designing the islands. Demonstrations on standard
test networks show that solution of the problem provides islands that are
balanced in real and reactive power, satisfy AC power flow laws, and have a
healthy voltage profile.
