We review the problem of heavy-quark diffusion in the Quark-Gluon Plasma and
its ramifications for heavy-quark spectra in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. In
particular, we attempt to reconcile underlying mechanisms of several seemingly
different approaches that have been put forward to explain the large
suppression and elliptic flow of non-photonic electron spectra. We also
emphasize the importance of a quantitative description of the bulk medium
evolution to extract reliable values for the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient.
