We study the reflection of Bloch wavepackets at the interface of optical
lattice possessing a shallow longitudinal out-of-phase refractive index
modulation in adjacent waveguides. We show that the relation between the
transmitted and reflected energy flows can be efficiently controlled by tuning
the frequency and the depth of the modulation. Thus, complete beam reflection
may be achieved for a set of resonant modulation frequencies at which light
tunneling between adjacent guides of modulated lattice is inhibited.
