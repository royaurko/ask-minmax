Features of anisotropic collective flow and spectral temperatures have been
determined for lambda hyperons emitted from C + C collisions, at incident
momentum of 4.2 AGeV/c, measured using the Propane Bubble Chamber of JINR at
Dubna. Moreover, characteristics of protons and of negative pions, emitted from
those collisions, have been determined and provided for comparison. The
directed and elliptic flows of lambdas both agree in sign with the
corresponding flows of protons. Parameters of the directed and elliptic flows
for lambdas agree further, within errors, with the corresponding parameters for
the co-produced protons. This contrasts an earlier finding by the E895
Collaboration of the directed flow being significantly weaker for lambdas than
protons, in the much heavier Au + Au system, at comparable incident momentum.
Particle spectral temperatures in the C + C collisions have been determined
focusing independently on either center-of-mass energy, transverse energy or
transverse momentum distributions. For either protons or negative pions, the
temperatures were found to be approximately the same, no matter whether the
emission of those particles was associated with lambda production or not.
Results of the measurements have been compared to the results of simulations
within the Quark-Gluon String Model.
