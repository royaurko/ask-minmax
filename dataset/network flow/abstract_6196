We prove that the Karoubi envelope of a shift --- defined as the Karoubi
envelope of the syntactic semigroup of the language of blocks of the shift ---
is, up to natural equivalence of categories, an invariant of flow equivalence.
More precisely, we show that the action of the Karoubi envelope on the Krieger
cover of the shift is a flow invariant. An analogous result concerning the
Fischer cover of a synchronizing shift is also obtained. From these main
results, several flow equivalence invariants --- some new and some old --- are
obtained. We also show that the Karoubi envelope is, in a natural sense, the
best possible syntactic invariant of flow equivalence of sofic shifts. Another
application concerns the classification of Markov-Dyck and Markov-Motzkin
shifts: it is shown that, under mild conditions, two graphs define flow
equivalent shifts if and only if they are isomorphic. Shifts with property (A)
and their associated semigroups, introduced by Wolfgang Krieger, are
interpreted in terms of the Karoubi envelope, yielding a proof of the flow
invariance of the associated semigroups in the cases usually considered (a
result recently announced by Krieger), and also a proof that property (A) is
decidable for sofic shifts.
