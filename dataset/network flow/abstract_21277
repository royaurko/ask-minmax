We describe interacting bosons at low temperature in spatially correlated
random potentials. By a Bogoliubov expansion around the deformed mean-field
condensate, the fundamental Hamiltonian for elementary excitations is derived,
achieving an analytical formulation in the case of weak disorder. From this, we
calculate the sound velocity and true zero-temperature condensate depletion in
correlated disorder and all dimensions.
