The discovery, representation and reconstruction of Business Networks (BN)
from Network Mining (NM) raw data is a difficult problem for enterprises. This
is due to huge amounts of complex business processes within and across
enterprise boundaries, heterogeneous technology stacks, and fragmented data. To
remain competitive, visibility into the enterprise and partner networks on
different, interrelated abstraction levels is desirable. We present a novel
data discovery, mining and network inference system, called Business Network
System (BNS), that reconstructs the BN--integration and business process
networks--from raw data, hidden in the enterprises' landscapes. BNS provides a
new, declarative foundation for gathering information, defining a network
model, inferring the network and check its conformance to the real-world
"as-is" network. The paper covers both the foundation and the key features of
BNS, including its underlying technologies, its overall system architecture,
and its most interesting capabilities.
