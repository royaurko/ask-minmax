A two-dimensional small-world type network, subject to spatial prisoners'
dilemma dynamics and containing an influential node defined as a special node
with a finite density of directed random links to the other nodes in the
network, is numerically investigated. It is shown that the degree of
cooperation does not remain at a steady state level but displays a punctuated
equilibrium type behavior manifested by the existence of sudden breakdowns of
cooperation. The breakdown of cooperation is linked to an imitation of a
successful selfish strategy of the influential node. It is also found that
while the breakdown of cooperation occurs suddenly, the recovery of it requires
longer time. This recovery time may, depending on the degree of steady state
cooperation, either increase or decrease with an increasing number of long
range connections.
