This paper presents a brief review of some existing correlation models which
attempt to map Quality of Service (QoS) to Quality of Experience (QoE) for
multimedia services. The term QoS refers to deterministic network behaviour, so
that data can be transported with a minimum of packet loss, delay and maximum
bandwidth. QoE is a subjective measure that involves human dimensions; it ties
together user perception, expectations, and experience of the application and
network performance. The Holy Grail of subjective measurement is to predict it
from the objective measurements; in other words predict QoE from a given set of
QoS parameters or vice versa. Whilst there are many quality models for
multimedia, most of them are only partial solutions to predicting QoE from a
given QoS. This contribution analyses a number of previous attempts and
optimisation techniquesthat can reliably compute the weighting coefficients for
the QoS/QoE mapping.
