A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model is used to predict the
oscillatory flow through a tapered cylindrical tube section (jet pump) placed
in a larger outer tube. Due to the shape of the jet pump, there will exist an
asymmetry in the hydrodynamic end effects which will cause a time-averaged
pressure drop to occur that can be used to cancel Gedeon streaming in a
closed-loop thermoacoustic device. The performance of two jet pump geometries
with different taper angles is investigated. A specific time-domain impedance
boundary condition is implemented in order to simulate traveling acoustic wave
conditions. It is shown that by scaling the acoustic displacement amplitude to
the jet pump dimensions, similar minor losses are observed independent of the
jet pump geometry. Four different flow regimes are distinguished and the
observed flow phenomena are related to the jet pump performance. The simulated
jet pump performance is compared to an existing quasi-steady approximation
which is shown to only be valid for small displacement amplitudes compared to
the jet pump length.
