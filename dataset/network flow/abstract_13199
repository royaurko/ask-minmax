What is time? Why does it "flow" and why are we sure that it flows from past
towards future? Why is there such a gigantic distinction between the Past of
our world, which we believe to be fixed, and the Future, which we consider
undetermined? And this is in spite of the fact that almost all physical laws
are time-symmetric! Why does previously undetermined "Future" acquire its
steadiness as it passes the moment called "the Present"? Perhaps, these
questions are partially answered in the considerations below.
