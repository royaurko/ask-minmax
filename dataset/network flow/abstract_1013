Human Mobility has attracted attentions from different fields of studies such
as epidemic modeling, traffic engineering, traffic prediction and urban
planning. In this survey we review major characteristics of human mobility
studies including from trajectory-based studies to studies using graph and
network theory. In trajectory-based studies statistical measures such as jump
length distribution and radius of gyration are analyzed in order to investigate
how people move in their daily life, and if it is possible to model this
individual movements and make prediction based on them. Using graph in mobility
studies, helps to investigate the dynamic behavior of the system, such as
diffusion and flow in the network and makes it easier to estimate how much one
part of the network influences another by using metrics like centrality
measures. We aim to study population flow in transportation networks using
mobility data to derive models and patterns, and to develop new applications in
predicting phenomena such as congestion. Human Mobility studies with the new
generation of mobility data provided by cellular phone networks, arise new
challenges such as data storing, data representation, data analysis and
computation complexity. A comparative review of different data types used in
current tools and applications of Human Mobility studies leads us to new
approaches for dealing with mentioned challenges.
