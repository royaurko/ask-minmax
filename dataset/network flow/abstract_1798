Living cells must control the reading out or "expression" of information
encoded in their genomes, and this regulation often is mediated by
transcription factors--proteins that bind to DNA and either enhance or repress
the expression of nearby genes. But the expression of transcription factor
proteins is itself regulated, and many transcription factors regulate their own
expression in addition to responding to other input signals. Here we analyze
the simplest of such self-regulatory circuits, asking how parameters can be
chosen to optimize information transmission from inputs to outputs in the
steady state. Some nonzero level of self-regulation is almost always optimal,
with self-activation dominant when transcription factor concentrations are low
and self-repression dominant when concentrations are high. In steady state the
optimal self-activation is never strong enough to induce bistability, although
there is a limit in which the optimal parameters are very close to the critical
point.
