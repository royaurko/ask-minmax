We calculate the theoretical expectation for the bulk motion of a large scale
survey of the type recently carried out by Lauer and Postman. Included are the
effects of survey geometry, errors in the distance measurements, clustering
properties of the sample, and different assumed power spectra. We consider the
power spectrum calculated from the IRAS--QDOT survey, as well as spectra from
hot $+$ cold and standard cold dark matter models. We find that sparse sampling
and clustering can lead to an unexpectedly large bulk flow, even in a very deep
survey. Our results suggest that the expected bulk motion is inconsistent with
that reported by Lauer and Postman at the $90-94\%$ confidence level.
