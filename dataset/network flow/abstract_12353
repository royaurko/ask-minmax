Syntactic features play an essential role in identifying relationship in a
sentence. Previous neural network models often suffer from irrelevant
information introduced when subjects and objects are in a long distance. In
this paper, we propose to learn more robust relation representations from the
shortest dependency path through a convolution neural network. We further
propose a straightforward negative sampling strategy to improve the assignment
of subjects and objects. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.
