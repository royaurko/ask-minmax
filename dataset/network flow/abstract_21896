We investigate the kinetic freeze out scenario of a nucleon gas through a
finite layer. The in-medium mass modification of nucleons and it's impact on
the freeze out process is studied. A considerable modification of the
thermodynamical parameters temperature, flow-velocity, energy density and
particle density has been found in comparison with evaluations which use a
constant vacuum nucleon mass.
