The Metropolitan Seoul Subway system, consisting of 380 stations, provides
the major transportation mode in the metropolitan Seoul area. Focusing on the
network structure, we analyze statistical properties and topological
consequences of the subway system. We further study the passenger flows on the
system, and find that the flow weight distribution exhibits a power-law
behavior. In addition, the degree distribution of the spanning tree of the
flows also follows a power law.
