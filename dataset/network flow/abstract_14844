Modelling sediment transport in environmental turbulent fluids is a
challenge. This article develops a sound model of the lateral transport of
suspended sediment in environmental fluid flows such as floods and tsunamis.
The model is systematically derived from a 3D turbulence model based on the
Smagorinski large eddy closure. Embedding the physical dynamics into a family
of problems and analysing linear dynamics of the system, centre manifold theory
indicates the existence of slow manifold parametrised by macroscale variables.
Computer algebra then constructs the slow manifold in terms of fluid depth,
depth-averaged lateral velocities, and suspended sediment concentration. The
model includes the effects of sediment erosion, advection, dispersion, and also
the interactions between the sediment and turbulent fluid flow. Vertical
distributions of the velocity and concentration in steady flow agree with the
established experimental data. Numerical simulations of the suspended sediment
under large waves show that the developed model predicts physically reasonable
phenomena.
