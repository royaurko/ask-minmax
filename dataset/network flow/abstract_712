Managing heterogeneous network systems is a difficult task because each of
these networks has its own curious management system. These networks usually
are constructed on independent management protocols which are not compatible
with each other. This results in the coexistence of many management systems
with different managing functions and services across enterprises.
Incompatibility of different management systems makes management of whole
system a very complex and often complicated job. Ideally, it is necessary to
implement centralized metalevel management across distributed heterogeneous
systems and their underlying supporting network systems where the information
flow and guidance is provided via a single console or single operating panels
which integrates all the management functions in spite of their individual
protocols and structures. This paper attempts to provide a novel network
management tool architecture which supports heterogeneous managements across
many different architectural platforms. Furthermore, an architectural approach
to integrate heterogeneous network is proposed. This architecture takes into
account both wireless fixed and mobile nodes.
