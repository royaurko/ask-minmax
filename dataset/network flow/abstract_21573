Molecules that only differ by their chirality, so called enantiomers, often
possess different properties with respect to their biological function.
Therefore, the separation of enantiomers presents a prominent challenge in
molecular biology and belongs to the ``Holy Grail'' of organic chemistry. We
suggest a new separation technique for chiral molecules that is based on the
transport properties in a microfluidic flow with spatially variable vorticity.
Because of their size the thermal fluctuating motion of the molecules must be
taken into account. These fluctuations play a decisive role in the proposed
separation mechanism.
