We investigate topologically biased failure in scale-free networks with
degree distribution $P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}$. The probability $p$ that an
edge remains intact is assumed to depend on the degree $k$ of adjacent nodes
$i$ and $j$ through $p_{ij}\propto(k_{i}k_{j})^{-\alpha}$. By varying the
exponent $\alpha$, we interpolate between random ($\alpha=0$) and systematic
failure. For $\alpha >0 $ ($<0$) the most (least) connected nodes are
depreciated first. This topological bias introduces a characteristic scale in
$P(k)$ of the depreciated network, marking a crossover between two distinct
power laws. The critical percolation threshold, at which global connectivity is
lost, depends both on $\gamma$ and on $\alpha$. As a consequence, network
robustness or fragility can be controlled through fine tuning of the
topological bias in the failure process.
