Despite the significance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to
market segmentation, there is a need of a comprehensive literature review and a
classification system for it towards identification of future trend of market
segmentation research. The present work is the first identifiable academic
literature review of the application of neural network based techniques to
segmentation. Our study has provided an academic database of literature between
the periods of 2000-2010 and proposed a classification scheme for the articles.
One thousands (1000) articles have been identified, and around 100 relevant
selected articles have been subsequently reviewed and classified based on the
major focus of each paper. Findings of this study indicated that the research
area of ANN based applications are receiving most research attention and self
organizing map based applications are second in position to be used in
segmentation. The commonly used models for market segmentation are data mining,
intelligent system etc. Our analysis furnishes a roadmap to guide future
research and aid knowledge accretion and establishment pertaining to the
application of ANN based techniques in market segmentation. Thus the present
work will significantly contribute to both the industry and academic research
in business and marketing as a sustainable valuable knowledge source of market
segmentation with the future trend of ANN application in segmentation.
