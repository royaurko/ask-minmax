We introduce a protocol with a reconfigurable filter system to create
non-overlapping single loops in the smart power grid for the realization of the
Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-(like)-Noise secure key distribution system. The protocol
is valid for one-dimensional radial networks (chain-like power line) which are
typical of the electricity distribution network between the utility and the
customer. The speed of the protocol (the number of steps needed) versus grid
size is analyzed. When properly generalized, such a system has the potential to
achieve unconditionally secure key distribution over the smart power grid of
arbitrary geometrical dimensions.
