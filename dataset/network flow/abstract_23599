In this paper we describe how to build a trusted reliable distributed service
across administrative domains in a peer-to-peer network. The application we use
to motivate our work is a public key time stamping service called Prokopius.
The service provides a secure, verifiable but distributable stable archive that
maintains time stamped snapshots of public keys over time. This in turn allows
clients to verify time stamped documents or certificates that rely on formerly
trusted public keys that are no longer in service or where the signer no longer
exists. We find that such a service can time stamp the snapshots of public keys
in a network of 148 nodes at the granularity of a couple of days, even in the
worst case where an adversary causes the maximal amount of damage allowable
within our fault model.
