We prove the existence of a smooth curve of periodic traveling wave solutions
for the Zakharov system. We also show that this type of solutions are nonlinear
stable by the periodic flow generated for the system mentioned before. An
improvement of the work of Ya Ping is made, we prove the stability of the
solitary wave solutions associated to the Zakharov system.
