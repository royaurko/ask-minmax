By the work of Hong and Tian it is known that given a holomorphic vector
bundle E over a compact Kahler manifold X, the Yang-Mills flow converges away
from an analytic singular set. If E is semi-stable, then the limiting metric is
Hermitian-Einstein and will decompose the limiting bundle into a direct sum of
stable bundles. Bando and Siu prove this limiting bundle can be extended to a
reflexive sheaf E' on all of X. In this paper, we construct an isomorphism
between E' and the double dual of the stable quotients of the graded Seshadri
filtration of E.
