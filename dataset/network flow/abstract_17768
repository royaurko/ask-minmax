We consider automorphism groups of some countably categorical structures and
their precompact expansions. We prove that automorphism groups of omega-stable
omega-categorical structures have metrizable universal minimal flows. We also
study amenability of these groups. This is a draft of a paper which will be
extended by some other results.
