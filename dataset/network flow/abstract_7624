We show that any generic non-adiabatic slow flow of ideal compressible fluid
develops a significant vorticity. As an example, an initially irrotational
conductive cooling flow is considered. A perturbation theory for the vorticity
generation is developed that employs, as a zero order solution, a novel
two-dimensional similarity solution. Full gasdynamic simulations of this CF
demonstrate the vorticity generation and support the theory. The relevance of
this problem to the experiments with the "hot channels" is discussed.
