In this contribution, we present an application of a novel perturbation
approach (denoted as an Overset approach) to a generic turbulent channel flow.
The derivation of the governing equations (the Non-Linear Perturbation
Equations extended with fluctuating viscous terms) is presented as well as
subgrid-scale modeling aspects which results in the Overset LES (OLES) method.
The application of the Overset method is illustrated with a generic fully
developed turbulent channel flow, the results of which show excellent agreement
with reference Direct Numerical Simulation data. The ability of the overset
method to correct for an imperfect background flow is furthermore shown.
