In order to make full use of geographic routing techniques developed for
large scale networks, nodes must be localized. However, localization and
virtual localization techniques in sensor networks are dependent either on
expensive and sometimes unavailable hardware (e.g. GPS) or on sophisticated
localization calculus (e.g. triangulation) which are both error-prone and with
a costly overhead.
  Instead of localizing nodes in a traditional 2-dimensional space, we use
directly the raw distance to a set of anchors to route messages in a
multi-dimensional space. This should enable us to use any geographic routing
protocol in a robust and efficient manner in a very large range of scenarios.
We test this technique for two different geographic routing algorithms, namely
GRIC and ROAM. The simulation results show that using the raw coordinates does
not decrease their efficiency.
