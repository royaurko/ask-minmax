Universal scaling of distances between vertices of Erdos-Renyi random graphs,
scale-free Barabasi-Albert models, science collaboration networks, biological
networks, Internet Autonomous Systems and public transport networks are
observed. A mean distance between two nodes of degrees k_i and k_j equals to
<l_{ij}>=A-B log(k_i k_j). The scaling is valid over several decades. A simple
theory for the appearance of this scaling is presented. Parameters A and B
depend on the mean value of a node degree <k>_nn calculated for the nearest
neighbors and on network clustering coefficients.
