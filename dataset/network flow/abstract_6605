We consider the problem of two-point resistance in a resistor network
previously studied by one of us [F. Y. Wu, J. Phys. A {\bf 37}, 6653 (2004)].
By formulating the problem differently, we obtain a new expression for the
two-point resistance between two arbitrary nodes which is simpler and can be
easier to use in practice. We apply the new formulation to the cobweb resistor
network to obtain the resistance between two nodes in the network.
Particularly, our results prove a recently proposed conjecture on the
resistance between the center node and a node on the network boundary. Our
analysis also solves the spanning tree problem on the cobweb network.
