We present an investment model integrated with trust-reputation mechanisms
where agents interact with each other to establish investment projects. We
investigate the establishment of investment projects, the influence of the
interaction between agents in the evolution of the distribution of wealth, as
well as the formation of common investment networks and some of their
properties. Simulation results show that the wealth distribution presents a
power law in its tail. Also, it is shown that the trust and reputation
mechanism presented leads to the establishment of networks among agents, which
present some of the typical characteristics of real-life networks like a high
clustering coefficient and short average path length.
