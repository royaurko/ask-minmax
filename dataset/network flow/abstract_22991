We propose a simple statistical model for the density of states for quarks
and gluons in a QGP droplet, making the Thomas-Fermi model of the atom and the
Bethe-model for the nucleons as templates for constructing the density of
states for the quarks and gluons with due modifications for the `hot'
relativistic QGP state as against the `cold' non-relativistic atom and
nucleons, which were the subject of the earlier `forebears' of the present
proposal.We introduce `flow-parameters' $\gamma_{q,g}$ for the quarks and the
gluons to take care of the hydrodynamical (plasma) flows in the QGP system as
was done earlier by Peshier in his thermal potential for the QGP. By varying
$\gamma_{g}$ about the `Peshier-Value' of $\gamma_{q} = 1/6$, we find that the
model allows a window in the parametric space in the range $8\gamma_{q} \leq
\gamma_{g} \leq 12\gamma_{q}$, with $\gamma_{q} =1/6$ (Peshier-Value), when
stable QGP droplets of radii $\sim$ $6 fm$ appear at transition temperatures
$100 MeV \leq T \leq 250 MeV$. The smooth cut at the phase boundary of the Free
energy vs. droplet radius suggests a First - Order phase transition .On the
whole the model offers a robust tool for studying QGP phenomenology as and when
data from various ongoing experiments are available .
