We study the invariants of spin networks embedded in a three-dimensional
manifold which are based on the path integral for SU(2) BF-Theory. These
invariants appear naturally in Loop Quantum Gravity, and have been defined as
spin-foam state sums. By using the Chain-Mail technique, we give a more general
definition of these invariants, and show that the state-sum definition is a
special case. This provides a rigorous proof that the state-sum invariants of
spin networks are topological invariants. We derive various results about the
BF-Theory spin network invariants, and we find a relation with the
corresponding invariants defined from Chern-Simons Theory, i.e. the
Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. We also prove that the BF-Theory spin
network invariants coincide with V. Turaev's definition of invariants of
coloured graphs embedded in 3-manifolds and thick surfaces, constructed by
using shadow-world evaluations. Our framework therefore provides a unified view
of these invariants.
