We introduce and solve a model which considers two coupled networks growing
simultaneously. The dynamics of the networks is governed by the new arrival of
network elements (nodes) making preferential attachments to pre-existing nodes
in both networks. The model segregates the links in the networks as
intra-links, cross-links and mix-links. The corresponding degree distributions
of these links are found to be power-laws with exponents having coupled
parameters for intra- and cross-links. In the weak coupling case the model
reduces to a simple citation network. As for the strong coupling, it mimics the
mechanism of \emph{the web of human sexual contacts}.
