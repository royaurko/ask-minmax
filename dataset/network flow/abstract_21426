We have carried out a survey to search for hidden blazars in a sample of
$z{\sim}2$ radio-loud quasars. The idea is based on our prediction that we
should be able to see large CIV line variability not associated with observed
continuum variations or most other emission lines in every radio-loud quasar.
Here we report the initial results including the discovery of large CIV line
variations in two quasars.
