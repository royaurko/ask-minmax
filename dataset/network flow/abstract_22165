The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of dark energy on dynamics
of the collapsing fluid within the framework of metric f(R) gravity. The fluid
distribution is assumed to be locally anisotropic and undergoing dissipation in
the form of heat flow, null radiations and shear viscosity. For this purpose,
we take general spherical symmetric spacetime. Dynamical equations are obtained
and also some special solutions are found by considering shearing expansionfree
evolution of the fluid. It is found that dark energy affects the mass of the
collapsing matter and rate of collapse but does not affect the hydrostatic
equilibrium.
