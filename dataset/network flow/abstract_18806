Finding an optimal sensing policy for a particular access policy and sensing
scheme is a laborious combinatorial problem that requires the system model
parameters to be known. In practise the parameters or the model itself may not
be completely known making reinforcement learning methods appealing. In this
paper a non-parametric reinforcement learning-based method is developed for
sensing and accessing multi-band radio spectrum in multi-user cognitive radio
networks. A suboptimal sensing policy search algorithm is proposed for a
particular multi-user multi-band access policy and the randomized
Chair-Varshney rule. The randomized Chair-Varshney rule is used to reduce the
probability of false alarms under a constraint on the probability of detection
that protects the primary user. The simulation results show that the proposed
method achieves a sum profit (e.g. data rate) close to the optimal sensing
policy while achieving the desired probability of detection.
