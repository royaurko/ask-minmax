The renormalization group flow is presented for the two-dimensional
sine-Gordon model within the framework of the functional renormalization group
method by including the wave-function renormalization constant. The
Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinski type phase structure is recovered as the
interpolating scaling law between two competing IR attractive area of the
global renormalization group flow.
