Inspired by the recent developments in modeling and analysis of reaction
networks, we provide a geometric formulation of the reversible reaction
networks under the influence of diffusion. Using the graph knowledge of the
underlying reaction network, the obtained reaction-diffusion system is a
distributed-parameter port-Hamiltonian system on a compact spatial domain.
Motivated by the need for computer based design, we offer a spatially
consistent discretization of the PDE system and, in a systematic manner,
recover a compartmental ODE model on a simplicial triangulation of the spatial
domain. Exploring the properties of a balanced weighted Laplacian matrix of the
reaction network and the Laplacian of the simplicial complex, we characterize
the space of equilibrium points and provide a simple stability analysis on the
state space modulo the space of equilibrium points. The paper rules out the
possibility of the persistence of spatial patterns for the compartmental
balanced reaction-diffusion networks.
