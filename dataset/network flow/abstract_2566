We consider Ising model on edge-dual of uncorrelated random networks with
arbitrary degree distribution. These networks have a finite clustering in the
thermodynamic limit. High and low temperature expansions of Ising model on the
edge-dual of random networks are derived. A detailed comparison of the critical
behavior of Ising model on scale free random networks and their edge-dual is
presented.
