We report the best figure-of-merit achieved for an internal nuclear polarized
hydrogen gas target and a Monte Carlo simulation of spin-exchange optical
pumping. The dimensions of the apparatus were optimized using the simulation
and the experimental results were in good agreement with the simulation. The
best result achieved for this target was 50.5% polarization with 58.2% degree
of dissociation of the sample beam exiting the storage cell at a hydrogen flow
rate of $1.1\times 10^{18}$ atoms/s.
