In dynamic wireless ad-hoc networks (DynWANs), autonomous computing devices
set up a network for the communication needs of the moment. These networks
require the implementation of a medium access control (MAC) layer. We consider
MAC protocols for DynWANs that need to be autonomous and robust as well as have
high bandwidth utilization, high predictability degree of bandwidth allocation,
and low communication delay in the presence of frequent topological changes to
the communication network. Recent studies have shown that existing
implementations cannot guarantee the necessary satisfaction of these timing
requirements. We propose a self-stabilizing MAC algorithm for DynWANs that
guarantees a short convergence period, and by that, it can facilitate the
satisfaction of severe timing requirements, such as the above. Besides the
contribution in the algorithmic front of research, we expect that our proposal
can enable quicker adoption by practitioners and faster deployment of DynWANs
that are subject changes in the network topology.
