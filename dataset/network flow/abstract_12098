A simpler neural-network approach is presented for the analysis of the top
quark non-leptonic decay channel in events of the D0 Collaboration. Results for
the top quark signal are comparable to those found by the D0 Collaboration by a
more elaborate handling of the event information used as input to the neural
network.
