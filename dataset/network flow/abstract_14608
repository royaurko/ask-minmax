In recent work [1] we uncovered intriguing connections between Otto's
characterisation of diffusion as entropic gradient flow [16] on one hand and
large-deviation principles describing the microscopic picture (Brownian motion)
on the other. In this paper, we sketch this connection, show how it generalises
to a wider class of systems, and comment on consequences and implications.
Specifically, we connect macroscopic gradient flows with large deviation
principles, and point out the potential of a bigger picture emerging: we
indicate that in some non- equilibrium situations, entropies and thermodynamic
free energies can be derived via large deviation principles. The approach
advocated here is different from the established hydrodynamic limit passage but
extends a link that is well known in the equilibrium situation.
