In this paper, a complete preprocessing methodology for discovering patterns
in web usage mining process to improve the quality of data by reducing the
quantity of data has been proposed. A dynamic ART1 neural network clustering
algorithm to group users according to their Web access patterns with its neat
architecture is also proposed. Several experiments are conducted and the
results show the proposed methodology reduces the size of Web log files down to
73-82% of the initial size and the proposed ART1 algorithm is dynamic and
learns relatively stable quality clusters.
