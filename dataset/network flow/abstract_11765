In many wireless networks, there is no fixed physical backbone nor
centralized network management. The nodes of such a network have to
self-organize in order to maintain a virtual backbone used to route messages.
Moreover, any node of the network can be a priori at the origin of a malicious
attack. Thus, in one hand the backbone must be fault-tolerant and in other hand
it can be useful to monitor all network communications to identify an attack as
soon as possible. We are interested in the minimum \emph{Connected Vertex
Cover} problem, a generalization of the classical minimum Vertex Cover problem,
which allows to obtain a connected backbone. Recently, Delbot et
al.~\cite{DelbotLP13} proposed a new centralized algorithm with a constant
approximation ratio of $2$ for this problem. In this paper, we propose a
distributed and self-stabilizing version of their algorithm with the same
approximation guarantee. To the best knowledge of the contributors, it is the first
distributed and fault-tolerant algorithm for this problem. The approach
followed to solve the considered problem is based on the construction of a
connected minimal clique partition. Therefore, we also design the first
distributed self-stabilizing algorithm for this problem, which is of
independent interest.
