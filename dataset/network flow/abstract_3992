As network size continues to grow exponentially, there has been a
proportionate increase in the number of nodes in the corresponding network.
With the advent of Internet of things (IOT), it is assumed that many more
devices will be connected to the existing network infrastructure. As a result,
monitoring is expected to get more complex for administrators as networks tend
to become more heterogeneous. Moreover, the addressing for IOTs would be more
complex given the scale at which devices will be added to the network and hence
monitoring is bound to become an uphill task due to management of larger range
of addresses. This paper will throw light on what kind of monitoring mechanisms
can be deployed in internet of things (IOTs) and their overall effectiveness.
