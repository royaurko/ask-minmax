We classify five dimensional Anosov flows with smooth decomposition which are
in addition transversely symplectic. Up to finite covers and a special time
change, we find exectly the suspensions of symplectic hyperbolic automorphisms
of four dimensional toris, and the geodesic flows of three dimensional
hyperbolic manifolds.
