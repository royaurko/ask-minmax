The paper is concerned with patchy vector fields, a class of discontinuous,
piecewise smooth vector fields that were introduced in AB to study feedback
stabilization problems. We prove the stability of the corresponding solution
set w.r.t. a wide class of impulsive perturbations. These results yield the
robusteness of patchy feedback controls in the presence of measurement errors
and external disturbances.
