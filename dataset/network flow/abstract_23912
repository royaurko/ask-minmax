In this paper, a global stability analysis is given for a rate-based
congestion control system modeled by a nonlinear delayed differential equation.
The model determines the dynamics of a single-source single-link network, with
a time-varying capacity of link and a fixed communication delay. We obtain a
sufficient delay-independent conditions on system parameters under which global
asymptotic stability of the system is guarantied. The proof is based on an
extension of Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem for a class of nonlinear time-delay
systems. The numerical simulations for a typical scenario justify the
theoretical results.
