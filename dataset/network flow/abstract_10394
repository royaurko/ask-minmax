We investigate flow properties of immiscible Bose-Einstein condensates
composed of two different Zeeman spin states of 87Rb. Spatially overlapping two
condensates in the optical trap are prepared by application of a resonant radio
frequency pulse, and then the magnetic field gradient is applied in order to
produce the atomic flow. We find that the spontaneous multiple domain formation
arising from the immiscible nature drastically changes the fluidity. The
homogeneously overlapping condensates readily separate under the magnetic field
gradient, and they form stable configuration composed of the two layers. In
contrast, the relative flow between two condensates are largely suppressed in
the case where the magnetic field gradient is applied after spontaneous domain
formation.
