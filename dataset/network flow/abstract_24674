We study the crack patterns developed on desiccating films of an aqueous
colloidal suspension of bentonite on a glass substrate. Varying the thickness
of the layer $h$ gives the following new and interesting results: (i)We
identify a critical thickness $h_{c}$, above which isolated cracks join each
other to form a fully connected network. A topological analysis of the crack
network shows that the Euler number falls to a minimum at $h_{c}$. (ii) We find
further, that the total vertical surface area of the clay $A_v$, which has
opened up due to cracking, is a constant independent of the layer thickness for
$h \geq h_c$. (iii) The total area of the glass substrate $A_s$, exposed by the
hierarchical sequence of cracks is also a constant for $h \geq h_c$. These
results are shown to be consistent with a simple energy conservation argument,
neglecting dissipative losses. (iv) Finally we show that if the crack pattern
is viewed at successively finer resolution, the total cumulative area of cracks
visible at a certain resolution, scales with the layer thickness. A suspension
of Laponite in methanol is found to exhibit similar salient features (i)-(iv),
though in this case the crack initiation process for very thin layers is quite
different.
