It is proven that, under mild physical assumptions, an isolated stationary
relativistic perfect fluid consists of a finite number of cells fibred by
invariant annuli or invariant tori. For axially symmetric circular flows it is
shown that the fluid consists of cells fibred by rigidly rotating annuli or
tori.
