We consider the flow of an upper convected Maxwell fluid in the limit of high
Weissenberg and Reynolds number. In this limit, the no-slip condition cannot be
imposed on the solutions. We derive equations for the resulting boundary layer
and prove the well-posedness of these equations. A transformation to Lagrangian
coordinates is crucial in the argument.
