A massively recurrent neural network responds on one side to input stimuli
and is autonomously active, on the other side, in the absence of sensory
inputs. Stimuli and information processing depends crucially on the qualia of
the autonomous-state dynamics of the ongoing neural activity. This default
neural activity may be dynamically structured in time and space, showing
regular, synchronized, bursting or chaotic activity patterns.
  We study the influence of non-synaptic plasticity on the default dynamical
state of recurrent neural networks. The non-synaptic adaption considered acts
on intrinsic neural parameters, such as the threshold and the gain, and is
driven by the optimization of the information entropy. We observe, in the
presence of the intrinsic adaptation processes, three distinct and globally
attracting dynamical regimes, a regular synchronized, an overall chaotic and an
intermittent bursting regime. The intermittent bursting regime is characterized
by intervals of regular flows, which are quite insensitive to external stimuli,
interseeded by chaotic bursts which respond sensitively to input signals. We
discuss these finding in the context of self-organized information processing
and critical brain dynamics.
