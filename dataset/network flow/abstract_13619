In this article, we study the knots realized by periodic orbits of R-covered
Anosov flows in compact 3-manifolds. We show that if two orbits are freely
homotopic then in fact they are isotopic. We show that lifts of periodic orbits
to the universal cover are unknotted. When the manifold is atoroidal, we deduce
some finer properties regarding the existence of embedded cylinders connecting
two given homotopic orbits.
