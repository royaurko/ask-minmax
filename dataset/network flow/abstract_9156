Active security is mainly concerned with performing one or more security
functions when a host in a communication network is subject to an attack. Such
security functions include appropriate actions against attackers. To properly
afford active security actions a set of software subsystems should be
integrated together so that they can automatically detect and appropriately
address any vulnerability in the underlying network. This work presents
integrated model for active security response model. The proposed model
introduces Active Response Mechanism (ARM) for tracing anonymous attacks in the
network back to their source. This work is motivated by the increased frequency
and sophistication of denial-of-service attacks and by the difficulty in
tracing packets with incorrect, or "spoofed", source addresses. This paper
presents within the proposed model two tracing approaches based on:
  1.Sleepy Watermark Tracing (SWT) for uncontributorized access attacks.
  2.Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM) in the network for Denial of Service
(DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. On the basis of the
proposed model a cooperative network security tools such as firewall, intrusion
detection system with IP tracing mechanism has been designed for taking a rapid
active response against real IPs for attackers. The proposed model is able to
detect network vulnerabilities, trace attack source IP and reconfigure the
attacked subnetworks.
