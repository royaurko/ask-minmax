We examine the interplay of surface and volume effects in systems undergoing
heat flow. In particular, we compute the thermal conductivity in the FPU
$\beta$ model as a function of temperature and lattice size, and scaling
arguments are used to provide analytic guidance. From this we show that
boundary temperature jumps can be quantitatively understood, and that they play
an important role in determining the dynamics of the system, relating soliton
dynamics, kinetic theory and Fourier transport.
