We design, characterize, and couple Boolean phase oscillators that include
state-dependent feedback delay. The state-dependent delay allows us to realize
an adjustable coupling strength, even though only Boolean signals are
exchanged. Specifically, increasing the coupling strength via the range of
state-dependent delay leads to larger locking ranges in uni- and bi-directional
coupling of oscillators in both experiment and numerical simulation with a
piecewise switching model. In the unidirectional coupling scheme, we unveil
asymmetric triangular-shaped locking regions (Arnold tongues) that appear at
multiples of the natural frequency of the oscillators. This extends
observations of a single locking region reported in previous studies. In the
bidirectional coupling scheme, we map out a symmetric locking region in the
parameter space of frequency detuning and coupling strength. Because of large
scalability of our setup, our observations constitute a first step towards
realizing large-scale networks of coupled oscillators to address fundamental
questions on the dynamical properties of networks in a new experimental
setting.
