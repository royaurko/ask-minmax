We study a problem of scheduling real-time traffic with hard delay
constraints in an unreliable wireless channel. Packets arrive at a constant
rate to the network and have to be delivered within a fixed number of slots in
a fading wireless channel. For an infrastructure mode of traffic with a
centralized scheduler, we are interested in the long time average throughput
achievable for the real time traffic. In [1], the contributors have stud- ied the
feasible throughput vectors by identifying the necessary and sufficient
conditions using work load characterization. In our work, we provide a
characterization of the feasible throughput vectors using the notion of the
rate region. We then discuss an extension to the network model studied in [1]
by allowing multiple access during contention and propose an enhancement to the
rate region of the wireless network. We characterize the feasible throughput
vectors with the multiple access technique and study throughput optimal and
utility maximizing strategies for the network scenario. Using simulations, we
evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy and discuss its advantages.
