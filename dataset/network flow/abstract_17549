We investigate the formation of singularities in the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations in $d\geq 2$ dimensions with a fractional Laplacian
$|\nabla |^\alpha$. We derive analytically a sufficient but not necessary
condition for solutions to remain always smooth and show that finite time
singularities cannot form for $\alpha\geq \alpha_c= 1+d/2$. Moreover, initial
singularities become unstable for $\alpha>\alpha_c$.
