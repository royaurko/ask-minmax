Influence systems form a large class of multiagent systems designed to model
how influence, broadly defined, spreads across a dynamic network. We build a
general analytical framework which we then use to prove that, while sometimes
chaotic, influence dynamics of the diffusive kind is almost always
asymptotically periodic. Besides resolving the dynamics of a popular family of
multiagent systems, the other contribution of this work is to introduce a new
type of renormalization-based bifurcation analysis for multiagent systems.
