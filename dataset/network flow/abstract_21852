We present a complete systematics (excitation functions and system-size
dependences) of global stopping and sideflow for heavy ion reactions in the
energy range between 0.09A GeV and 1.93A GeV. For the heaviest system, Au+Au,
we observe a plateau of maximal stopping extending from about 0.2A to 0.8A GeV
with a fast drop on both sides. The degree of stopping, which is shown to
remain significantly below the expectations of a full stopping scenario, is
found to be highly correlated to the amount of sideflow.
