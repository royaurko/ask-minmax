In this paper we describe a hands-on laboratory oriented instructional
package that we have developed for data communications and networking. The
package consists of a software tool, together with instructional material for a
laboratory based networking curriculum. The software is based on a simulation
environment that enables the student to experiment with various networking
protocols, on an easy to use graphical user interface (GUI). Data message
flows, packet losses, control/routing message flows, virtual circuit setups,
link failures, bit errors etc., are some of the features that can be visualized
in this environment. The student can also modify the networking components
provided, as well as add new components using the C programming language. The
instructional material consists of a set of laboratory exercises for flow and
error control (HDLC), IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD protocol, the token ring protocol,
interconnecting LANs via bridges, TCP congestion avoidance and control, IP
fragmentation and reassembly, ATM PNNI routing and ATM policing. The laboratory
exercises have facilitated the development of a networking curriculum based on
both the traditional computer networking principles, as well as the new
technologies in telecommunication networking. The laboratory environment has
been used in the networking curriculum at The Ohio State University, and is
being piloted at other universities. The entire package is freely available
over the Internet.
