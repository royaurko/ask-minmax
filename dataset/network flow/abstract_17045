It is a challenge for any Knowledge Base reasoning to manage ubiquitous
uncertain ontology as well as uncertain updating times, while achieving
acceptable service levels at minimum computational cost. This paper proposes an
application-independent merging ontologies for any open interaction system. A
solution that uses Multi-Entity Bayesan Networks with SWRL rules, and a Java
program is presented to dynamically monitor Exogenous and Endogenous temporal
evolution on updating merging ontologies on a probabilistic framework for the
Semantic Web.
