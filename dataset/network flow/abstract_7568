The pattern selection problem in binary-mixture convection in an extended
channel with a lateral through-flow is presented. The through-flow breaks
left--right parity and changes pattern dynamics dramatically. The problem is
studied based on computer simulation of the complete set of hydrodynamic
equations (Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation) in the two-dimensional
rectangular channel with aspect ratio $\Gamma = 12$ and convection-suppressing
lateral boundary conditions. A wide variety of new dynamical patterns is
obtained, discussed and classified.
