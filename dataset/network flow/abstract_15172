Bluetooth is developed for short range communication. Bluetooth Devices are
normally having low power and low cost. This is a wireless communication
technology designed to connect phones, laptops and PDAs. The greater
availability of portable devices with Bluetooth connectivity imposes wireless
connection between enabled devices. On an average the range of Bluetooth
devices is about 10 meters. The basic limitation of the Bluetooth communication
is this range limitation. In this paper I have studied the limitations of
Bluetooth communication and consider range constraint as the major limitation.
I propose a new expanded Blue tooth network to overcome the range constraint of
Bluetooth device. This creates a network of Bluetooth enabled devices that will
include laptops, set top devices and also mobile phones. The main purpose of
this proposal is to establish a network will enable the users to communicate
outside the range without any range constraint.
