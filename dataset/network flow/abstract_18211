The problem of real-time processing is one of the most challenging current
issues in computer sciences. Because of the large amount of data to be treated
in a limited period of time, parallel and distributed systems are required,
whose performance depends on a series of factors including the
interconnectivity of the processing elements, the application model and the
communication protocol. Given their flexibility for representing and modeling
natural and human-made systems (such as the Internet and WWW), complex networks
have become a primary choice in many research areas. The current work presents
how the concepts and methods of complex networks can be used to develop
realistic models and simulations of distributed real-time system while taking
into account two representative interconnection models: uniformly random and
scale free (Barabasi-Albert), including the presence of background traffic of
messages. The interesting obtained results include the identification of the
uniformly random interconnectivity scheme as being largely more efficient than
the scale-free counterpart.
