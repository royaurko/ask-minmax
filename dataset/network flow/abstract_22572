We present results from numerical simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence,
performed using a recently proposed lattice Boltzmann method able to describe
consistently a thermal compressible flow subject to an external forcing. The
method allowed us to study the system both in the nearly-Boussinesq and
strongly compressible regimes. Moreover, we show that when the stratification
is important, the presence of the adiabatic gradient causes the arrest of the
mixing process.
