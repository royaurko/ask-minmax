We investigate two dimensional steady Euler-Poisson system which describe the
motion of compressible self-gravitating flows. The unique existence and
stability of subsonic flows in a duct of finite length are obtained when
prescribing the entropy at the entrance and the pressure at the exit. After
introducing the stream function, the Euler-Poisson system can be decomposed
into several transport equations and a second order nonlinear elliptic system.
We discover an energy estimate for the associated elliptic system which is a
key ingredient to prove the unique existence and stability of subsonic flow.
