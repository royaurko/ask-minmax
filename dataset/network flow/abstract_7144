Atmospheric pressure capillary dielectric barrier oxygen discharge plasma jet
is developed to generate non-thermal plasma using unipolar positive pulse power
supply. Both optical and electrical techniques are used to investigate the
characteristics of the produced plasma as function of applied voltage and gas
flow rate. Analytical results obtained from the optical emission spectroscopic
data reveal the gas temperature, rotational temperature, excitation temperature
and electron density. Gas temperature and rotational temperature are found to
decrease with increasing oxygen flow rate but increase linearly with applied
voltage. It is exposed that the electron density is boosting up with enhanced
applied voltage and oxygen flow rate, while the electron excitation temperature
is reducing with rising oxygen flow rate. Electrical characterization
demonstrates that the discharge frequency is falling with flow rate but
increasing with voltage. The produced plasma is applied preliminarily to study
the inactivation yield of Fusarium oxysporum infected potato samples.
