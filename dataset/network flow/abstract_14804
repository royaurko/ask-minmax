Torque measurements in Taylor-Couette flow, with large radius ratio and large
aspect ratio, over a range of velocities up to a Reynolds number of 24 000 are
presented. Following a specific procedure, nine states with distinct number of
vortices along the axis were found and the aspect ratio of the vortices were
measured. The relationship between the speed and the torque for a given number
of vortices is reported. In the turbulent Taylor vortex flow regime, at
relatively high Reynolds number, a change in behaviour is observed
corresponding to intersections of the torque-speed curves for different states.
Before each intersection, the torque for a state with larger number of vortices
is higher. After each intersection, the torque for a state with larger number
of vortices is lower. The exponent, from the scaling laws of the torque, always
depends on the aspect ratio of the vortices. When the Reynolds number is
rescaled using the mean aspect ratio of the vortices, only a partial collapse
of the exponent data is found.
