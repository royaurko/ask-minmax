Neural cryptography is based on a competition between attractive and
repulsive stochastic forces. A feedback mechanism is added to neural
cryptography which increases the repulsive forces. Using numerical simulations
and an analytic approach, the probability of a successful attack is calculated
for different model parameters. Scaling laws are derived which show that
feedback improves the security of the system. In addition, a network with
feedback generates a pseudorandom bit sequence which can be used to encrypt and
decrypt a secret message.
