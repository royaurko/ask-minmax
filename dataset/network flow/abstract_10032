We present a systematic study of the energy of vanishing flow by considering
symmetric colliding nuclei (between $^{12}$C and $^{238}$U) at normalized
impact parameters using variety of equations of state (with and without
momentum dependent interactions) as well as different nucleon-nucleon cross
sections. A perfect power law mass dependence is obtained in all the cases
which passes through calculated points nicely. Further, the choice of impact
parameter affects the energy of vanishing flow drastically, demanding a very
accurate measurement of the impact parameter. However, the energy of vanishing
flow is less sensitive towards the equation of state as well as its momentum
dependence.
