It is known from both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations that
chemically patterning a solid surface has an effect on the flow of an adjacent
liquid. This fact is in stark contrast with predictions of classical fluid
mechanics where the no-slip boundary condition is insensitive to the chemistry
of the solid substrate. It has been shown that the influence on the flow caused
by a steep change in the wettability of the solid substrate can be described in
the framework of continuum mechanics using the interface formation theory. The
present work extends this study to the case of intermittent patterning. Results
show that variations in wettability of the substrate can significantly affect
the flow, especially of thin films, which may have applications to the design
of microfluidic devices.
