We reveal significant qualitative differences in the rigidity transition of
three types of disordered network materials: randomly diluted spring networks,
jammed sphere packings, and stress-relieved networks that are diluted using a
protocol that avoids the appearance of floppy regions. The marginal state of
jammed and stress-relieved networks are globally isostatic, while marginal
randomly diluted networks show both overconstrained and underconstrained
regions. When a single bond is added to or removed from these isostatic
systems, jammed networks become globally overconstrained or floppy, whereas the
effect on stress-relieved networks is more local and limited. These differences
are also reflected in the linear elastic properties and point to the highly
effective and unusual role of global self-organization in jammed sphere
packings.
