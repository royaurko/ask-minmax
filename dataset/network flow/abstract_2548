For sufficiently slow rates of strain, flowing foam can exhibit inhomogeneous
flows. The nature of these flows is an area of active study in both
two-dimensional model foams and three dimensional foam. Recent work in
three-dimensional foam has identified three distinct regimes of flow [S. Rodts,
J. C. Baudez, and P. Coussot, Europhys. Lett. {\bf 69}, 636 (2005)]. Two of
these regimes are identified with continuum behavior (full flow and
shear-banding), and the third regime is identified as a discrete regime
exhibiting extreme localization. In this paper, the discrete regime is studied
in more detail using a model two dimensional foam: a bubble raft. We
characterize the behavior of the bubble raft subjected to a constant rate of
strain as a function of time, system size, and applied rate of strain. We
observe localized flow that is consistent with the coexistence of a power-law
fluid with rigid body rotation. As a function of applied rate of strain, there
is a transition from a continuum description of the flow to discrete flow when
the thickness of the flow region is approximately 10 bubbles. This occurs at an
applied rotation rate of approximately $0.07 {\rm s^{-1}}$.
