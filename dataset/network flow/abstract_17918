We analytically study a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based network.
In the network, the nodes have their own average throughput demands for
transmission to a common base station. The CSMA is based on the request-to-send
(RTS)/clear-to-send (CTS) handshake mechanism. Each node individually chooses
its probability of transmitting an RTS packet, which specifies the length of
its requested data transmission period. The RTS packets transmitted by
different nodes in the same time slot interfere with one another, and compete
to be received by the base station. If a node's RTS has the received signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) higher than the capture ratio, it will be
successfully received. The node will then be granted the data transmission
period. The transmission probabilities of RTS packets of all nodes will
determine the average throughput and power consumption of each node. The set of
all possible throughput demands of nodes that can be supported by the network
is called the feasible throughput region. We characterize the feasible
throughput region and provide an upper bound on the total power consumption for
any throughput demands in the feasible throughput region. The upper bound
corresponds to one of three points in the feasible throughput region depending
on the fraction of time occupied by the RTS packets.
