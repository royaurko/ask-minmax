There is increasing evidence to suggest functional connectivity networks are
non-stationary. This has lead to the development of novel methodologies with
which to accurately estimate time-varying functional connectivity networks.
Many of these methods provide unprecedented temporal granularity by estimating
a functional connectivity network at each point in time; resulting in
high-dimensional output which can be studied in a variety of ways. One possible
method is to employ graph embedding algorithms. Such algorithms effectively map
estimated networks from high-dimensional spaces down to a low dimensional
vector space; thus facilitating visualization, interpretation and
classification. In this work, the dynamic properties of functional connectivity
are studied using working memory task data from the Human Connectome Project. A
recently proposed method is employed to estimate dynamic functional
connectivity networks. The results are subsequently analyzed using two graph
embedding methods based on linear projections. These methods are shown to
provide informative embeddings that can be directly interpreted as functional
connectivity networks.
