Using a microscopic phase-space model of the membrane system, the boundary
condition at a membrane is derived. According to the condition, the substance
flow across the membrane is proportional to the difference of the substance
concentrations at the opposite membrane surfaces. The Green's function of the
diffusion equation is found for the derived boundary condition and the exact
solution of the equation is given.
