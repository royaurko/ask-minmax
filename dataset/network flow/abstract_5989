We consider binary systematic network codes and investigate their capability
of decoding a source message either in full or in part. We carry out a
probability analysis, derive closed-form expressions for the decoding
probability and show that systematic network coding outperforms conventional
network coding. We also develop an algorithm based on Gaussian elimination that
allows progressive decoding of source packets. Simulation results show that the
proposed decoding algorithm can achieve the theoretical optimal performance.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that systematic network codes equipped with the
proposed algorithm are good candidates for progressive packet recovery owing to
their overall decoding delay characteristics.
