We present experimental results on hydrothermal waves in long and narrow 1D
channels. In a bounded channel, we describe the primary and secondary
instabilities leading to waves and modulated waves in terms of
convective/absolute transitions. Because of on the combined effect of finite
group velocity and of the presence of boundaries, the wave-patterns are
non-uniform in space. We also investigate non-uniform wave-patterns observed in
an annular channel in the presence of sources and sinks of hydrothermal waves.
We connect our observations with the complex Ginzburg-Landau model equation in
the very same way as in the first part of the paper (nlin.PS/0208029).
