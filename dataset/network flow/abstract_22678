The paper addresses the homogenization of a family of micro-models for the
flow of a slightly compressible fluid in a poroelastic matrix containing
periodically distibuted poroelastic inclusions, with low permeabilities and
with imperfect contact on the interface. The micro-models are based on Biot's
system for consolidation processes in each phase, with interfacial barrier
formulation. Using the two-scale convergence technique, it is shown that the
derived system is a general model of that proposed by Aifantis, plus an extra
memory term.
