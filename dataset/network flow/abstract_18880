We study balanced solutions for network bargaining games with general
capacities, where agents can participate in a fixed but arbitrary number of
contracts. We provide the first polynomial time algorithm for computing
balanced solutions for these games. In addition, we prove that an instance has
a balanced solution if and only if it has a stable one. Our methods use a new
idea of reducing an instance with general capacities to a network bargaining
game with unit capacities defined on an auxiliary graph. This represents a
departure from previous approaches, which rely on computing an allocation in
the intersection of the core and prekernel of a corresponding cooperative game,
and then proving that the solution corresponding to this allocation is
balanced. In fact, we show that such cooperative game methods do not extend to
general capacity games, since contrary to the case of unit capacities, there
exist allocations in the intersection of the core and prekernel with no
corresponding balanced solution. Finally, we identify two sufficient conditions
under which the set of balanced solutions corresponds to the intersection of
the core and prekernel, thereby extending the class of games for which this
result was previously known.
