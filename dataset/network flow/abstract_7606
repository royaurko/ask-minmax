Radial collective flow and thermalization are studied in gold on gold
collisions at 150, 250 and 400 A MeV bombarding energies with a
relativistically covariant formulation of a QMD code. We find that radial flow
and "thermal" energies calculated for all the charged fragments agree
reasonably with the experimental values. The experimental hardware filter at
small angles used in the FOPI experiments at higher energies selects mainly the
thermalized particles.
