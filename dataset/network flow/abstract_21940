First experimental measurements are presented for the kink instability in a
linear plasma column which is insulated from an axial boundary by finite sheath
resistivity. Instability threshold below the classical Kruskal-Shafranov
threshold, axially asymmetric mode structure and rotation are observed. These
are accurately reproduced by a recent kink theory, which includes axial plasma
flow and one end of the plasma column that is free to move due to a
non-line-tied boundary condition.
