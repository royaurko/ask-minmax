Caching data files directly on mobile user devices combined with
device-to-device (D2D) communications has recently been suggested to improve
the capacity of wireless net6works. We investigate the performance of
regenerating codes in terms of the total energy consumption of a cellular
network. We show that regenerating codes can offer large performance gains. It
turns out that using redundancy against storage node failures is only
beneficial if the popularity of the data is between certain thresholds. As our
major contribution, we investigate under which circumstances regenerating codes
with multiple redundant data fragments outdo uncoded caching.
