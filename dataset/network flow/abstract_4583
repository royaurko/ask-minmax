Mobile (cellular) networks enable innovation, but can also stifle it and lead
to user frustration when network performance falls below expectations. As
mobile networks become the predominant method of Internet access, developer,
research, network operator, and regulatory communities have taken an increased
interest in measuring end-to-end mobile network performance to, among other
goals, minimize negative impact on application responsiveness. In this survey
we examine current approaches to end-to-end mobile network performance
measurement, diagnosis, and application prototyping. We compare available tools
and their shortcomings with respect to the needs of researchers, developers,
regulators, and the public. We intend for this survey to provide a
comprehensive view of currently active efforts and some auspicious directions
for future work in mobile network measurement and mobile application
performance evaluation.
