The Washington Area Large-scale Time coincidence Array (WALTA) is placing
particle detector arrays in secondary schools in the Seattle area to build up a
large-scale ultra-high energy cosmic ray detector network, one of several such
projects around the world. Scintillation counters salvaged from the CASA
experiment in cooperation with the CROP group at the University of Nebraska at
Lincoln are refurbished by teachers and students, tested, calibrated, and
installed in four-fold arrays at high school sites. To identify time
coincidences, a GPS time synchronization system is employed. Data are acquired
using a custom lowcost data acquisition card. Here we will describe the
logistics of WALTA and show samples of data taken with a prototype array at the
University of Washington.
