A simple model for simulating tug of war game as varying the player number in
a team is discussed to identify the slow pace of fast change. This model shows
that a large number of information sources leads slow change for the system.
Also, we introduce an opinion diffusion model including the effect of a high
degree of clustering. This model shows that the de facto standard and lock-in
effect, well-known phenomena in economics and business management, can be
explained by the network clusters.
