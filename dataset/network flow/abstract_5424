We consider a dense, ad hoc wireless network, confined to a small region. The
wireless network is operated as a single cell, i.e., only one successful
transmission is supported at a time. Data packets are sent between
sourcedestination pairs by multihop relaying. We assume that nodes
self-organise into a multihop network such that all hops are of length d
meters, where d is a design parameter. There is a contention based multiaccess
scheme, and it is assumed that every node always has data to send, either
originated from it or a transit packet (saturation assumption). In this
scenario, we seek to maximize a measure of the transport capacity of the
network (measured in bit-meters per second) over power controls (in a fading
environment) and over the hop distance d, subject to an average power
constraint. We first argue that for a dense collection of nodes confined to a
small region, single cell operation is efficient for single user decoding
transceivers. Then, operating the dense ad hoc wireless network (described
above) as a single cell, we study the hop length and power control that
maximizes the transport capacity for a given network power constraint.
