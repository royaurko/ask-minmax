As an improvement of the combinatorial realization of totally positive
matrices via the essential positive weightings of certain planar network by
  S.Fomin and A.Zelevisky \cite{[4]}, in this paper, we give the test method of
positive definite matrices via the planar networks and the so-called cluster
subalgebra respectively, introduced here originally.
  This work firstly gives a combinatorial realization of all matrices through
planar network, and then sets up a test method for positive definite matrices
by $LDU$-decompositions and the horizontal weightings of all lines in their
planar networks. On the other hand, mainly the relationship is built between
positive definite matrices and cluster subalgebras.
