This paper explores the effectiveness of network attack when the attacker has
imperfect information about the network. For Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks, we
observe that dynamical importance and betweenness centrality-based attacks are
surprisingly robust to the presence of a moderate amount of imperfect
information and are more effective compared with simpler degree-based attacks
even at moderate levels of network information error. In contrast, for
scale-free networks the effectiveness of attack is much less degraded by a
moderate level of information error. Furthermore, in the Erd\H{o}os-R\'enyi
case the effectiveness of network attack is much more degraded by missing links
as compared with the same number of false links.
