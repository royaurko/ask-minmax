We consider the effect of surface roughness on solid-solid contact in a
Stokes flow. Various models for the roughness are considered, and a unified
methodology is given to derive the corresponding asymptotics of the drag force.
In this way, we recover and clarify the various expressions that can be found
in the litterature.
