Using a variant of the interpolating Hamiltonian technique, we show that
there exists, in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, an exact connection
between the sample-to-sample fluctuations of the free energy and bond chaos
involving 2- and 4-replica overlaps between replicas with different but
correlated bonds. This relation is used to derive an upper bound of the
fluctuations.
