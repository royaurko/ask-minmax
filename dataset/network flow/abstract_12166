A parameterisation of generalised network clustering, in the form of
four-motif prevalences, is presented. This involves three real parameters that
are conditional on one- two- and three-motif prevalences. Interpretations of
these real parameters are presented that motivate a set of rewiring schemes to
create appropriately clustered networks. Finally, the dynamical implications of
higher order structure, as parameterised, for a contact process are considered.
