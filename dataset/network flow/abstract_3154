The capability of nodes to broadcast their message to the entire wireless
network when nodes employ cooperation is considered. We employ an asymptotic
analysis using an extended random network setting and show that the broadcast
performance strongly depends on the path loss exponent of the medium. In
particular, as the size of the random network grows, the probability of
broadcast in a one-dimensional network goes to zero for path loss exponents
larger than one, and goes to a nonzero value for path loss exponents less than
one. In two-dimensional networks, the same behavior is observed for path loss
exponents above and below two, respectively.
