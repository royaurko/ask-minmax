Random graphs are useful tools to study social interactions. In particular,
the use of weighted random graphs allows to handle a high level of information
concerning which agents interact and in which degree the interactions take
place. Taking advantage of this representation, we recently defined a
magnitude, the Social Inertia, that measures the eagerness of agents to keep
ties with previous partners. To study this magnitude, we used collaboration
networks that are specially appropriate to obtain valid statistical results due
to the large size of publically available databases. In this work, I study the
Social Inertia in two of these empirical networks, IMDB movie database and
condmat. More specifically, I focus on how the Inertia relates to other
properties of the graphs, and show that the Inertia provides information on how
the weight of neighboring edges correlates. A social interpretation of this
effect is also offered.
