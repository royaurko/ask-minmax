We propose a framework for generating a signal control policy for a traffic
network of signalized intersections to accomplish control objectives
expressible using linear temporal logic. By applying techniques from model
checking and formal methods, we obtain a correct-by-construction controller
that is guaranteed to satisfy complex specifications. To apply these tools, we
identify and exploit structural properties particular to traffic networks that
allow for efficient computation of a finite state abstraction. In particular,
traffic networks exhibit a componentwise monotonicity property which allows
reach set computations that scale linearly with the dimension of the continuous
state space.
