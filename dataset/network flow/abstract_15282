The superconducting-insulator transition is simulated in disordered networks
of Josephson junctions with thermally activated Arrhenius-like resistive shunt.
By solving the conductance matrix of the network, the transition is reproduced
in different experimental conditions by tuning thickness, charge density and
disorder degree. In particular, on increasing fluctuations of the parameters
entering the Josephson coupling and the Coulomb energy of the junctions, the
transition occurs for decreasing values of the critical temperature Tc and
increasing values of the activation temperature To. The results of the
simulation compare well with recent experiments where the mesoscopic
fluctuations of the phase have been suggested as the mechanism underlying the
phenomenon of emergent granularity in otherwise homogeneous films. The proposed
approach is compared with the results obtained on TiN films and nanopatterned
arrays of weak-links, where the superconductor-insulator transition is directly
stimulated.
