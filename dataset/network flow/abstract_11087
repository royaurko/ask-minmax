This work calls into question a substantial body of past work on CSMA
wireless networks. In the majority of studies on CSMA wireless networks, a
contention graph is used to model the carrier sensing relationships (CS) among
links. This is a 0-1 model in which two links can either sense each other
completely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not
the case: the CS relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can
vary dynamically over time. This is the case even if the distance between the
links is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore,
this partial carrier sensing relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide
range of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with
the 0-1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn
from previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined. This paper
establishes a more accurate CS model with the objective of laying down a
foundation for future theoretical studies that reflect reality. Towards that
end, we set up detailed experiments to investigate the partial carrier sensing
phenomenon. We discuss the implications and the use of our partial carrier
sensing model in network analysis.
