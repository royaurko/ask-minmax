The level of air quality in urban centres is affected by emission of several
pollutants, mainly coming from the vehicles flowing in their road networks.
This is a well known phenomenon that influences the quality of life of people.
Despite the deep concern of researchers and technicians, we are far from a
total understanding of this phenomenon. On the contrary, the availability of
reliable forecasting models would constitute an important tool for
administrators in order of assessing suitable actions concerning the
transportation policies, public as well private. Referring to the situation of
the running fleet and the measured pollutant concentrations concerning the
Italian town of Palermo, a data-deduced traffic model is here derived, its
truthfulness being justified by a fuzzyfication of the phenomenon. A first
validation of the model is supplied by utilising the emissions characteristics
and the pollutant concentrations referring to a two years period of time. This
work could represent a first attempt in defining a new approach to the problem
of the pollution of the urban contexts, in order of providing administrators
with a reliable and easier tool.
