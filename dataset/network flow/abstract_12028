We discuss a simple method of constructing correlated random networks, which
was recently proposed by M. Bogu~n'a and R. Pastor-Satorras (cond-mat/0306072).
The result of this construction procedure is a sparse network whose
degree--degree distribution asymptotically approaches a given function at large
degrees. We argue that this convergence is possible if the desired function is
sufficiently slowly decreasing.
