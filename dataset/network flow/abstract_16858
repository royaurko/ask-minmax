In this paper, we present three amorphous GaN models obtained from the first
principles simulation. We find that a chemically ordered continuous random
network is the ideal structure for a-GaN. If we exclude the tail states, we
predict a 3.0eV optical gap for 64-atom model and 2.3eV for 250-atom models. We
observe a highly localized valence tail and a remarkably delocalized
exponential conduction tail which we associate with different hybridization in
the two tails. Based upon these results, we speculate on potential differences
in n and p type doping. The structural origin of tail and defect states is
discussed. The vibrational density of states and dielectric function are
computed, and are consistent with experiment.
