Nuclear matter under the conditions of a supernova explosion unfolds into a
rich variety of spatially structured phases, called nuclear pasta. We
investigate the role of periodic network-like structures with negatively curved
interfaces in nuclear pasta structures, by static and dynamic Hartree-Fock
simulations in periodic lattices. As the most prominent result, we identify for
the first time the {\it single gyroid} network structure of cubic chiral
$I4_123$ symmetry, a well known configuration in nanostructured soft-matter
systems, both as a dynamical state and as a cooled static solution. Single
gyroid structures form spontaneously in the course of the dynamical
simulations. Most of them are isomeric states. The very small energy
differences to the ground state indicate its relevance for structures in
nuclear pasta.
