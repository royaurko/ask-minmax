As the number of electronic components in the car increases, the requirement
for the higher data transmission scheme among them is on the sharp rise.
Controller area network (CAN) has been widely adopted to support the in-car
communications needs but the data rate is far below what other schemes such as
Ethernet and optical fibers can offer. A new scheme for enhancing the speed of
CAN network has been proposed, where carrier modulated signal is introduced on
top of the existing CAN signal whereby the data rate can be enhanced over
100Mbps. The proposed scheme is compatible with the existing CAN network and
accordingly enables seamless upgrade of the existing network to support high
speed demand using CAN protocol.
