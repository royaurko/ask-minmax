In this paper, we discuss one dimensional inelastic relativistic-collisions
in the framework of the relativistic kinetic theory. In particular, we focus on
the relativistic effects on time evolutions of the temperature and flow
velocity under the spatially homogeneous state. As a result of the relativistic
effects, we obtain the characteristic time evolutions of the temperature and
flow velocity, which are never obtained under the nonrelativistic limit.
