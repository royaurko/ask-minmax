In this paper we look for a correlations between intermediate $p_T$ particle
pairs and the $v_2$ of the remaining low $p_T$ particles. We find that the
shape of the flow vector distribution, which is calculated from all low $p_T$
tracks, depends in a non-trivial way on the angular separation between the high
$p_T$ particle pairs in the event. Our analysis is based on 200 GeV Au+Au
collision measured with the STAR detector.
