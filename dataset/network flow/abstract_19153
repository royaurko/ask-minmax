A strict interpretation of connectionism mandates complex networks of simple
components. The question here is, is this simplicity to be interpreted in
absolute terms? I conjecture that absolute simplicity might not be an essential
attribute of connectionism, and that it may be effectively exchanged with a
requirement for relative simplicity, namely simplicity with respect to the
current organizational level. In this paper I provide some elements to the
analysis of the above question. In particular I conjecture that fractally
organized connectionist networks may provide a convenient means to achive what
Leibniz calls an "art of complication", namely an effective way to encapsulate
complexity and practically extend the applicability of connectionism to domains
such as sociotechnical system modeling and design. Preliminary evidence to my
claim is brought by considering the design of the software architecture
designed for the telemonitoring service of Flemish project "Little Sister".
