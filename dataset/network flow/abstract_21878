A simple thermal model with single freeze-out and flow is used to analyze the
ratios of hadron yields and the hadron transverse-mass spectra measured in 130
GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC. An overall very good agreement between the model
predictions and the data is achieved for all measured hadron species, including
hyperons.
