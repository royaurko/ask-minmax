Mixed moving average processes appear in the ergodic decomposition of
stationary symmetric \alpha-stable (S\alpha S) processes. They correspond to
the dissipative part of "deterministic" flows generating S\alpha S processes
(Rosinski, 1995). Along these lines we study stationary increment and
self-similar S\alpha S processes. Since the classes of stationary increment and
self-similar processes can be embedded into the class of stationary processes
by the Masani and Lamperti transformations, respectively, we characterize these
classes of S\alpha S processes in terms of nonsingular flows and the related
cocycles. We illustrate this approach considering various examples of
self-similar mixed moving average S\alpha S processes introduced in (Surgailis,
Rosinski, Mandrekar and Cambanis, 1992).
