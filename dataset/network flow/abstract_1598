By using the glassy (helium-)fluid model and boundary perturbation method, we
can obtain the velocity fields (as well as the flow rate; up to the second
order) inside the wavy-rough cylindrical nanopores which are of the same size
as those samples prepared by Kim and Chan as well as Day {\it et al.} Our
results show that the velocities measured in porous Vycor samples could be
reproduced by carefully selecting relevant parameters but those in glass
capillaries are difficult to obtain.
