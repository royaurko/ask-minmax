Oscillatory flows are common in the environment, industrial applications and
rheological investigations. We experimentally characterise the response of the
alga {\it Dunaliella salina} to oscillatory shear and squeeze flows, and report
the surprising discovery that algal swimming trajectories orient perpendicular
to the flow-shear plane. The ordering has the characteristics of a resonance in
the driving parameter space, which is qualitatively reproduced by a model
accounting for helical swimming. Our discovery challenges current understanding
of swimmers in flows and provides the foundations for the oscillatory rheology
of active suspensions, of particular relevance to algal processing
applications.
