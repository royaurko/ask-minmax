The measurement of J/{psi} azimuthal anisotropy is presented as a function of
transverse momentum for different centralities in Au+Au collisions at
{sqrt{s_{NN}}} = 200 GeV. The measured J/{psi} elliptic flow is consistent with
zero within errors for transverse momentum between 2 and 10 GeV/c. Our
measurement suggests that J/{psi} with relatively large transverse momentum are
not dominantly produced by coalescence from thermalized charm quarks, when
comparing to model calculations.
