The impact of a wedge-shaped body on the free surface of a weightless
inviscid incompressible liquid is considered. Both symmetrical and
unsymmetrical entries at constant velocity are dealt with. The differential
problem corresponds to the physico-mathematical model of a distribution of
potential singularities and, in particular, the flow singularities at the ends
of the wetted regions are represented by sinks. A conformal transformation of
the flow field is adopted and the unknown intensities of the discontinuities
are found by an optimization procedure, together with the solution of the
nonlinear free-surface problem. The flow separation at a sideslip is also
considered.
