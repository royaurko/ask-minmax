We present transport calculations for heavy ion reactions in which the mean
field and the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section are consistently based on
the same effective interaction, i.e. the in-medium T-matrix from microscopic
Dirac-Brueckner calculations. Doing so, the stopping in central reactions in
terms of the recently proposed $var_{\rm tl}$ observable and the correlation to
the behavior of the directed flow is investigated. The relation to the nuclear
shear viscosity is discussed.
