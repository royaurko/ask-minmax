In this chapter we review observations and techniques for measuring both bulk
flows in prominences and prominence mass. Measuring these quantities is
essential to development and testing of models discussed throughout this book.
Prominence flows are complex and various, ranging from the relatively linear
flows along prominence spines to the complex, turbulent patterns exhibited by
hedgerow prominences. Techniques for measuring flows include time slice and
optical flow techniques used for motions in the plane of the sky and the use of
spectral line profiles to determine Doppler velocities along the line of sight.
Prominence mass measurement is chiefly done via continuum absorption
measurements, but mass has also been estimated using cloud modeling and white
light measurements.
