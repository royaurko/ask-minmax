KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) is a new combined VLBI array with KVN (Korean VLBI
Network) and VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry). First, we briefly
review the imaging capabilities of KaVA array which actually achieves more than
three times better dynamic range than that achieved by VERA alone. The KaVA
images clearly show detailed structures of extended radio jets in AGNs. Next,
we represent the key science program to be led by KaVA AGN sub working group.
We will conduct the monitoring observations of Sgr A* and M87 because of the
largeness of their central super-massive black hole angular sizes. The main
science goals of the program are (i) testing magnetically-driven-jet paradigm
by mapping velocity fields of the M87 jet, and (ii) obtaining tight constraints
on physical properties of radio emitting region in Sgr A*.
