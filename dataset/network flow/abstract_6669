We discuss the behavior of large ensembles of phase oscillators networking
via scale-free topologies in the presence of a positive correlation between the
oscillators' natural frequencies and network's degrees. In particular, we show
that the further presence of degree-degree correlation in the network structure
has important consequences on the nature of the phase transition characterizing
the passage from the phase-incoherent to the phase-coherent network's state.
While high levels of positive and negative mixing consistently induce a
second-order phase transition, moderate values of assortative mixing, such as
those ubiquitously characterizing social networks in the real world, greatly
enhance the irreversible nature of explosive synchronization in growing
scale-free networks. This latter effect corresponds to a maximization of the
area and of the width of the hysteretic loop that differentiates the forward
and backward transitions to synchronization.
