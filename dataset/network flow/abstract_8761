This paper reviews the concepts and assumptions of rigid flow in relativistic
fluid mech- anics, particularly the generalisation of the classical
Herglotz-Noether theorem, that are relevant to the fluid approximation of the
AdS-CFT dual of large rotating black-holes used by Bhattacharyya et al. We then
give a brief outline of the recently found proof the generalised theorem.
