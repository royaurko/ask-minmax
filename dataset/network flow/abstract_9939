We report the observation of dynamo action in the VKS experiment, i.e., the
generation of magnetic field by a strongly turbulent swirling flow of liquid
sodium. Both mean and fluctuating parts of the field are studied. The dynamo
threshold corresponds to a magnetic Reynolds number Rm \sim 30. A mean magnetic
field of order 40 G is observed 30% above threshold at the flow lateral
boundary. The rms fluctuations are larger than the corresponding mean value for
two of the components. The scaling of the mean square magnetic field is
compared to a prediction previously made for high Reynolds number flows.
