The multiplier representation of the generalized symmetry group of a
quasiperiodic flow on the n-torus defines, for each subgroup of the multiplier
group of the flow, a group invariant of the smooth conjugacy class of that
flow. This group invariant is the internal semidirect product of a subgroup
isomorphic to the n-torus by a subgroup isomorphic to that subgroup of the
multiplier group. Each subgroup of the multiplier group is a multiplicative
group of algebraic integers of degree at most n, which group is isomorphic to
an abelian group of n by n unimodular matrices.
