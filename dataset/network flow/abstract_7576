We present a mathematical formulation of kinetic boundary conditions for
Lattice Boltzmann schemes in terms of reflection, slip, and accommodation
coefficients. It is analytically and numerically shown that, in the presence of
a non-zero slip coefficient, the Lattice Boltzmann flow develops a physical
slip flow component at the wall. Moreover, it is shown that the slip
coefficient can be tuned in such a way to recover quantitative agreement with
analytical and experimental results up to second order in the Knudsen number.
