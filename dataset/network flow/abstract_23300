We present a fast and accurate algorithm for the Poisson equation in complex
geometries, using regular Cartesian grids. We consider a variety of
configurations, including Poisson equations with interfaces across which the
solution is discontinuous (of the type arising in multi-fluid flows). The
algorithm is based on a combination of the Correction Function Method (CFM) and
Boundary Integral Methods (BIM). Interface and boundary conditions can be
treated in a fast and accurate manner using boundary integral equations, and
the associated BIM. Unfortunately, BIM can be costly when the solution is
needed everywhere in a grid, e.g. fluid flow problems. We use the CFM to
circumvent this issue. The solution from the BIM is used to rewrite the problem
as a series of Poisson equations in rectangular domains --- which requires the
BIM solution at interfaces/boundaries only. These Poisson equations involve
discontinuities at interfaces, of the type that the CFM can handle. Hence we
use the CFM to solve them (to high order of accuracy) with finite differences
and a Fast Fourier Transform based fast Poisson solver. We present 2D examples
of the algorithm applied to problems involving boundary conditions over complex
geometries (with 4th order accuracy), and to a Poisson equation with interfaces
across which the solution is discontinuous (with 3rd order accuracy).
