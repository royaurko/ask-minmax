Let (F_t) be a smooth flow on a smooth manifold M and h:M-->M be a smooth
orbit preserving map. The following problem is studied: suppose that for every
point z of M there exists a germ of smooth function f_z at z such that near z
h(x)=F_{f_z(x)}(x). Can the functions (f_z) be glued together to give a smooth
function on all of M? This question is closely related to reparametrizations of
flows. We describe a large class of flows for which the above problem can be
resolved, and show that they have the following property: any smooth flow (G_t)
whose orbits coincides with the ones of (F_t) is obtained from (F_t) by smooth
reparametrization of time. The proof of our principal statement uses results of
D.Hoffman and L.N.Mann about diameters of effective actions of Lie grous of
Riemannian manifolds.
