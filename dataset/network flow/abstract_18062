For a model of DNA denaturation, exponents describing the distributions of
denaturated loops and unzipped end-segments are determined by exact enumeration
and by Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The loop
distributions are consistent with first order thermal denaturation in both
cases. Results for end-segments show a coexistence of two distinct power laws
in the relative distributions, which is not foreseen by a recent approach in
which DNA is treated as a homogeneous network of linear polymer segments. This
unexpected feature, and the discrepancies with such an approach, are explained
in terms of a refined scaling picture in which a precise distinction is made
between network branches representing single stranded and effective double
stranded segments.
