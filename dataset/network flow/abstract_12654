It is shown that magnetic bubble films behaviour can be described by using a
2D super-Ising hamiltonian. Calculated hysteresis curves and magnetic domain
patterns are successfully compared with experimental results taken in
literature. The reciprocal problem of finding paramaters of the super-Ising
model to reproduce computed or experimental magnetic domain pictures is solved
by using a perceptron neural network.
