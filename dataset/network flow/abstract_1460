We introduce the notion of globally updating evolution for a class of
weighted networks, in which the weight of a link is characterized by the amount
of data packet transport flowing through it. By noting that the packet
transport over the network is determined nonlocally, this approach can explain
the generic nonlinear scaling between the strength and the degree of a node. We
demonstrate by a simple model that the strength-driven evolution scheme
recently introduced can be generalized to a nonlinear preferential attachment
rule, generating the power-law behaviors in degree and in strength
simultaneously.
