In this paper we introduce the Generalized Virtual Networking (GVN) concept.
GVN provides a framework to influence the routing of packets based on service
level information that is carried in the packets. It is based on a protocol
header inserted between the Network and Transport layers, therefore it can be
seen as a layer 3.5 solution. Technically, GVN is proposed as a new transport
layer protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite. An IP router that is not GVN
capable will simply process the IP destination address as usual. Similar
concepts have been proposed in other works, and referred to as Service Oriented
Networking, Service Centric Networking, Application Delivery Networking, but
they are now generalized in the proposed GVN framework. In this respect, the
GVN header is a generic container that can be adapted to serve the needs of
arbitrary service level routing solutions. The GVN header can be managed by GVN
capable end-hosts and applications or can be pushed/popped at the edge of a GVN
capable network (like a VLAN tag). In this position paper, we show that
Generalized Virtual Networking is a powerful enabler for SCN (Service Centric
Networking) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) and how it couples with
the SDN (Software Defined Networking) paradigm.
