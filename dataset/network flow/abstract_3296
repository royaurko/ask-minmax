The non-modal kinetic theory of the kinetic drift instability of plasma shear
flows [Phys.Plasmas, 18, 062103 (2011)] is extended to the investigation of the
long-time evolution of the hydrodynamic ion temperature gradient and resistive
drift instabilities in plasma shear flow. We find, that these hydrodynamic
instabilities passed in their temporal evolution in shear flow through the
kinetic stage of the evolution. In linear theory, this evolution involves the
time dependent, due to flow shear, effects of the finite Larmor radius, which
resulted in the non-modal effect of the decrease with time the frequencies and
the growth rates of the instabilities.
