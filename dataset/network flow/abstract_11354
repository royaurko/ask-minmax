Irreversible aggregation is revisited in view of recent work on
renormalization of complex networks. Its scaling laws and phase transitions are
related to percolation transitions seen in the latter. We illustrate our points
by giving the complete solution for the probability to find any given state in
an aggregation process $(k+1)X\to X$, given a fixed number of unit mass
particles in the initial state. Exactly the same probability distributions and
scaling are found in one dimensional systems (a trivial network) and well-mixed
solutions. This reveals that scaling laws found in renormalization of complex
networks do not prove that they are self-similar.
