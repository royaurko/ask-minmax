Our study of a basic model for incompressible two-phase flows with phase
transitions consistent with thermodynamics in the case of constant but
non-equal densities of the phases, begun by the first two contributors is continued.
We extend our well-posedness result to general geometries, study the stability
of the equilibria of the problem, and show that a solution which does not
develop singularities exists globally. If its limit set contains a stable
equilibrium it converges to this equilibrium as time goes to infinity, in the
natural state manifold for the problem in an Lp-setting.
