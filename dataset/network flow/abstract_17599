This paper considers dynamo action in smooth helical flows in cylindrical
geometry, otherwise known as Ponomarenko dynamos, with periodic time
dependence. An asymptotic framework is developed that gives growth rates and
frequencies in the highly conducting limit of large magnetic Reynolds number,
when modes tend to be localized on resonant stream surfaces. This theory is
validated by means of numerical simulations.
