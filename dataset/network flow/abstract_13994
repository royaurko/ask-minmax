Superhydrophobic one-dimensional surfaces reduce drag and generate transverse
hydrodynamic phenomena by combining hydrophobicity and roughness to trap gas
bubbles in microscopic textures. Recent works in this area have focused on
specific cases of superhydrophobic stripes. Here we provide some theoretical
results to guide the optimization of the forward flow and transverse
hydrodynamic phenomena in a parallel-plate channel with a superhydrophobic
trapezoidal texture, varying on scales larger than the channel thickness. The
permeability of such a thin channel is shown to be equivalent to that of a
striped one with greater average slip. The maximization of a transverse flow
normally requires largest possible slip at the gas areas, similarly to a
striped channel. However, in case of trapezoidal textures with a very small
fraction of the solid phase this maximum occurs at a finite slip at the gas
areas. Exact numerical calculations show that our analysis, based on a
lubrication theory, can also be applied for a larger gap. However, in this case
it overestimates a permeability of the channel, and underestimates an
anisotropy of the flow. Our results provide a framework for the rational design
of superhydrophobic surfaces for microfluidic applications.
