We study the percolation properties of graph partitioning on random regular
graphs with N vertices of degree $k$. Optimal graph partitioning is directly
related to optimal attack and immunization of complex networks. We find that
for any partitioning process (even if non-optimal) that partitions the graph
into equal sized connected components (clusters), the system undergoes a
percolation phase transition at $f=f_c=1-2/k$ where $f$ is the fraction of
edges removed to partition the graph. For optimal partitioning, at the
percolation threshold, we find $S \sim N^{0.4}$ where $S$ is the size of the
clusters and $\ell\sim N^{0.25}$ where $\ell$ is their diameter. Additionally,
we find that $S$ undergoes multiple non-percolation transitions for $f<f_c$.
