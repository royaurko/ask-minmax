We establish an achievable rate region for discrete memoryless interference
relay channels that consist of two source-destination pairs and one or more
relays. We develop an achievable scheme combining Han-Kobayashi and noisy
network coding schemes. We apply our achievability to two cases. First, we
characterize the capacity region of a class of discrete memoryless interference
relay channels. This class naturally generalizes the injective deterministic
discrete memoryless interference channel by El Gamal and Costa and the
deterministic discrete memoryless relay channel with orthogonal receiver
components by Kim. Moreover, for the Gaussian interference relay channel with
orthogonal receiver components, we show that our scheme achieves a better sum
rate than that of noisy network coding.
