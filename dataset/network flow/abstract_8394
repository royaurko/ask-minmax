Koetter and Kschischang showed in [R. Koetter and F.R. Kschischang, "Coding
for Errors and Erasures in Random Network Coding," IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory,
{54(8), 2008] that the network coding counterpart of Gabidulin codes performs
asymptotically optimal with respect to the subspace distance. Recently, Silva
and Kschischang introduced in [D. Silva and F.R. Kschischang, "On Metrics for
Error Correction in Network Coding," To appear in IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory,
ArXiv: 0805.3824v4[cs.IT], 2009] the injection distance to give a detailed
picture of what happens in noncoherent network coding. We show that the above
codes are also asymptotically optimal with respect to this distance.
