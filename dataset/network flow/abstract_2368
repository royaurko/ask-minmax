Robust generation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) implies the formation of
outflows with very low baryon loads and highly relativistic velocities, but
more baryon-rich, slower outflows are also likely to occur in most GRB central
engine scenarios, either as ``circum-jet winds'' or ``failed GRBs''. Here we
study the possibility of nucleosynthesis within such baryon-rich outflows by
conducting detailed reaction network calculations in the framework of the basic
fireball model. It is shown that high baryon load fireballs attaining mildly
relativistic velocities can synthesize appreciable quantities of heavy neutron
capture elements with masses up to the platinum peak and beyond. Small but
interesting amounts of light elements such as deuterium and boron can also be
produced. Depending on the neutron excess and baryon load, the combination of
high entropy, rapid initial expansion and gradual expansion at later times can
cause the reaction flow to reach the fission regime, and its path can be
intermediate between those of the $r$- and $s$-processes (``$n$-process''). The
nucleosynthetic signature of these outflows may be observable in the companion
stars of black hole binary systems and in the most metal-poor stars,
potentially offering an important probe of the inner conditions of the GRB
source. Contribution to the solar abundances for some heavy elements may also
be possible. The prospects for further developments in various directions are
discussed.
