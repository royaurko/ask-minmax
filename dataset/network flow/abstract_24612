Broadcasting capabilities are one of the most promising features of upcoming
LTE-Advanced networks. However, the task of scheduling broadcasting sessions is
far from trivial, since it affects the available resources of several
contiguous cells as well as the amount of resources that can be devoted to
unicast traffic. In this paper, we present a compact, convenient model for
broadcasting in LTE, as well as a set of efficient algorithms to define
broadcasting areas and to actually perform content scheduling. We study the
performance of our algorithms in a realistic scenario, deriving interesting
insights on the possible trade-offs between effectiveness and computational
efficiency.
