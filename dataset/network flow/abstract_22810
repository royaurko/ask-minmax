In this paper we present a unified shell model for stably stratified and
convective turbulence. Numerical simulation of this model for stably stratified
flow shows Bolgiano-Obukhbov scaling in which the kinetic energy spectrum
varies as $k^{-11/5}$. We also observe a dual scaling ($k^{-11/5}$ and
$k^{-5/3}$) for a limited range of parameters. The shell model of convective
turbulence yields Kolmogorov's spectrum. These results are consistent with the
energy flux and energy feed due to buoyancy, and are in good agreement with
direct numerical simulations of Kumar {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 90},
023016 (2014)].
