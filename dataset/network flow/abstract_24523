Suppose that a graph is realized from a stochastic block model where one of
the blocks is of interest, but many or all of the vertices' block labels are
unobserved. The task is to order the vertices with unobserved block labels into
a "nomination list" such that, with high probability, vertices from the
interesting block are concentrated near the list's beginning. We propose
several vertex nomination schemes. Our basic---but principled---setting and
development yields a best nomination scheme (which is a Bayes-Optimal
analogue), and also a likelihood maximization nomination scheme that is
practical to implement when there are a thousand vertices, and which is
empirically near-optimal when the number of vertices is small enough to allow
comparison to the best nomination scheme. We then illustrate the robustness of
the likelihood maximization nomination scheme to the modeling challenges
inherent in real data, using examples which include a social network involving
human-trafficking, the Enron Graph, a worm brain connectome, and a political
blog network.
