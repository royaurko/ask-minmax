Radiatively-driven transfer flow perpendicular to a luminous disk is examined
in the subrelativistic regime of $(v/c)^1$, taking into account the gravity of
the central object. The flow is assumed to be vertical, and the gas pressure is
ignored, while internal heating is assumed to be proportional to the gas
density. The basic equations were numerically solved as a function of the
optical depth, and the flow velocity, the height, the radiative flux, and the
radiation pressure were obtained for a given radius, an initial optical depth,
and initial conditions at the flow base (disk ``inside''), whereas the
mass-loss rate was determined as an eigenvalue of the boundary condition at the
flow top (disk ``surface''). For sufficiently luminous cases, the flow
resembles the case without gravity. For less-luminous cases, however, the flow
velocity decreases, and the flow would be impossible due to the existence of
gravity in the case that the radiative flux is sufficiently small. Application
to a supercritical accretion disk with mass loss is briefly discussed.
