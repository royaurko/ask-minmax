Many biological networks have been labelled scale-free as their degree
distribution can be approximately described by a powerlaw distribution. While
the degree distribution does not summarize all aspects of a network it has
often been suggested that its functional form contains important clues as to
underlying evolutionary processes that have shaped the network. Generally
determining the appropriate functional form for the degree distribution has
been fitted in an ad-hoc fashion.
  Here we apply formal statistical model selection methods to determine which
functional form best describes degree distributions of protein interaction and
metabolic networks. We interpret the degree distribution as belonging to a
class of probability models and determine which of these models provides the
best description for the empirical data using maximum likelihood inference,
composite likelihood methods, the Akaike information criterion and
goodness-of-fit tests. The whole data is used in order to determine the
parameter that best explains the data under a given model (e.g. scale-free or
random graph). As we will show, present protein interaction and metabolic
network data from different organisms suggests that simple scale-free models do
not provide an adequate description of real network data.
