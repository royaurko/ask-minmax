Transient black hole candidates are interesting objects to study in X-rays as
these sources show rapid evolutions in their spectral and temporal properties.
In this paper, we study the spectral properties of the Galactic transient X-ray
binary MAXI~J1659-152 during its very first outburst after discovery with the
archival data of RXTE Proportional Counter Array instruments. We make a
detailed study of the evolution of accretion flow dynamics during its 2010
outburst through spectral analysis using the Chakrabarti-Titarchuk
two-component advective flow (TCAF) model as an additive table model in XSPEC.
Accretion flow parameters (Keplerian disk and sub-Keplerian halo rates, shock
location and shock strength) are extracted from our spectral fits with TCAF. We
studied variations of these fit parameters during the entire outburst as it
passed through three spectral classes: hard, hard-intermediate, and
soft-intermediate. We compared our TCAF fitted results with standard combined
disk black body (DBB) and power-law (PL) model fitted results and found that
variations of disk rate with DBB flux and halo rate with PL flux are generally
similar in nature. There appears to be an absence of the soft state unlike what
is seen in other similar sources.
