It is studied the bright spatial solitons in nonlocal defocusing Kerr media
with parity-time (PT) symmetric potentials. We find that these solitons can
exist and be stable over a different range of potential parameters. The
influence of the degree of nonlocality on the solitons and the transverse
energy flow within the stable solitons are also examined.
