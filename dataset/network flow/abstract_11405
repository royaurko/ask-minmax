The performance of a cellular network can be significantly improved by
employing many base stations (BSs), which shortens transmission distances.
However, there exist no known results on quantifying the performance gains from
deploying many BSs. To address this issue, we adopt a stochastic-geometry model
of the downlink cellular network and analyze the mobile outage probability.
Specifically, given Poisson distributed BSs, the outage probability is shown to
diminish inversely with the increasing ratio between the BS and mobile
densities. Furthermore, we analyze the optimal tradeoff between the performance
gain from increasing the BS density and the resultant network cost accounting
for energy consumption, BS hardware and backhaul cables. The optimal BS density
is proved to be proportional to the square root of the mobile density and the
inverse of the square root of the cost factors considered.
