We introduce a first order flow of $G_{2}$-structures and construct its
explicit solution in case of a cone over $S^3\!\times\! S^3$. Also we prove for
this situation that starting from certain initial datum the flow deforms
corresponding to $G_2$-structure metric to a conic metric up to homotheties.
