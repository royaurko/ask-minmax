This paper is concerned with a binary detection problem over a non-secure
network. To satisfy the communication rate constraint and against possible
cyber attacks, which are modeled as deceptive signals injected to the network,
a likelihood ratio based (LRB) scheduler is designed in the sensor side to
smartly select sensor measurements for transmission. By exploring the
scheduler, some sensor measurements are successfully retrieved from the
attacked data at the decision center. We show that even under a moderate
communication rate constraint of secure networks, an optimal LRB scheduler can
achieve a comparable asymptotic detection performance to the standard N-P test
using the full set of measurements, and is strictly better than the random
scheduler. For non-secure networks, the LRB scheduler can also maintain the
detection functionality but suffers graceful performance degradation under
different attack intensities. Finally, we perform simulations to validate our
theoretical results.
