(Abridged) By comparing the frequency of typical events with that of unusual
events, one can test whether the cosmological density distribution function is
consistent with the normally made assumption of Gaussianity. To this end, we
compare the consistency of the tail-inferred (from clusters) and measured
values (from large-scale flows) of the rms level of mass fluctuations for two
distribution functions: a Gaussian, and a texture (positively-skewed) PDF.
Averaging the recent large-scale flow measurements, we find that observations
of the rms and the tail at the 10 h^-1 Mpc scale disfavor a texture PDF at ~1.5
sigma in all cases. However, taking only the most recent measurement of the
rms, that from Willick et al. (1997b), the comparison disfavors textures for
low Omega_0=0.3, and disfavors Gaussian models if Omega_0=1 (again at ~1.5
sigma). Predictions for evolution of high temperature clusters can also be made
for the models considered, and strongly disfavor Omega_0=1 in Gaussian models
and marginally disfavor Omega_0=1 in texture models. Only Omega_0=0.3 Gaussian
models are consistent with all the data considered.
