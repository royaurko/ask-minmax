Ultracold atom magnetic field microscopy enables the probing of current flow
patterns in planar structures with unprecedented sensitivity. In
polycrystalline metal (gold) films we observe long-range correlations forming
organized patterns oriented at +/- 45 deg relative to the mean current flow,
even at room temperature and at length scales orders of magnitude larger than
the diffusion length or the grain size. The preference to form patterns at
these angles is a direct consequence of universal scattering properties at
defects. The observed amplitude of the current direction fluctuations scales
inversely to that expected from the relative thickness variations, the grain
size and the defect concentration, all determined independently by standard
methods. This indicates that ultracold atom magnetometry enables new insight
into the interplay between disorder and transport.
