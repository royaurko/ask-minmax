We define a family of functionals generalizing the Yang-Mills functional. We
study the corresponding gradient flows and prove long-time existence and
convergence results for subcritical dimensions as well as a bubbling criterion
for the critical dimensions. Consequently, we have an alternate proof of the
convergence of Yang-Mills flow in dimensions 2 and 3 given by Rade and the
bubbling criterion in dimension 4 of Struwe in the case where the initial flow
data is smooth.
