In this paper we consider input-to-state stability (ISS) of impulsive control
systems with and without time-delays. We prove that if the time-delay system
possesses an exponential Lyapunov-Razumikhin function or an exponential
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, then the system is uniformly ISS provided that
the average dwell-time condition is satisfied. Then, we consider large-scale
networks of impulsive systems with and without time-delays and we prove that
the whole network is uniformly ISS under a small-gain and a dwell-time
condition. Moreover, these theorems provide us with tools to construct a
Lyapunov function (for time-delay systems - a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional or
a Lyapunov-Razumikhin function) and the corresponding gains of the whole
system, using the Lyapunov functions of the subsystems and the internal gains,
which are linear and satisfy the small-gain condition. We illustrate the
application of the main results on examples.
