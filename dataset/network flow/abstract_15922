The criminal nature of narcotics complicates the direct assessment of a drug
community, while having a good understanding of the type of people drawn or
currently using drugs is vital for finding effective intervening strategies.
Especially for the Russian Federation this is of immediate concern given the
dramatic increase it has seen in drug abuse since the fall of the Soviet Union
in the early nineties. Using unique data from the Russian social network
'LiveJournal' with over 39 million registered users worldwide, we were able for
the first time to identify the on-line drug community by context sensitive text
mining of the users' blogs using a dictionary of known drug-related official
and 'slang' terminology. By comparing the interests of the users that most
actively spread information on narcotics over the network with the interests of
the individuals outside the on-line drug community, we found that the 'average'
drug user in the Russian Federation is generally mostly interested in topics
such as Russian rock, non-traditional medicine, UFOs, Buddhism, yoga and the
occult. We identify three distinct scale-free sub-networks of users which can
be uniquely classified as being either 'infectious', 'susceptible' or 'immune'.
