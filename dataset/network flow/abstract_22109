We assess the importance of the magneto-rotational instability in
core-collapse supernovae by an analysis of the growth rates of unstable modes
in typical post-collapse systems and by numerical simulations of simplified
models. The interplay of differential rotation and thermal stratification
defines different instability regimes which we confirm in our simulations. We
investigate the termination of the growth of the MRI by parasitic
instabilities, establish scaling laws characterising the termination amplitude,
and study the long-term evolution of the saturated turbulent state.
