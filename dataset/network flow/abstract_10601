This work considers the problem of secure and reliable information
transmission via relay cooperation in two-hop relay wireless networks without
the information of both eavesdropper channels and locations. While previous
work on this problem mainly studied infinite networks and their asymptotic
behavior and scaling law results, this papers focuses on a more practical
network with finite number of system nodes and explores the corresponding exact
result on the number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerant to ensure
desired secrecy and reliability. We first study the scenario where path-loss is
equal between all pairs of nodes and consider two transmission protocols there,
one adopts an optimal but complex relay selection process with less load
balance capacity while the other adopts a random but simple relay selection
process with good load balance capacity. Theoretical analysis is then provided
to determine the maximum number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate to
ensure a desired performance in terms of the secrecy outage probability and
transmission outage probability. We further extend our study to the more
general scenario where path-loss between each pair of nodes also depends the
distance between them, for which a new transmission protocol with both
preferable relay selection and good load balance as well as the corresponding
theoretical analysis are presented.
