We discuss recent developments in the modeling of negative autoregulated
genetic networks. In particular, we consider the temporal evolution of the
population of mRNA and proteins in simple networks using rate equations. In the
limit of low copy numbers, fluctuation effects become significant and more
adequate modeling is then achieved using the master equation formalism. The
analogy between regulatory gene networks and chemical reaction networks on dust
grains in the interstellar medium is discussed. The analysis and simulation of
complex reaction networks are also considered.
