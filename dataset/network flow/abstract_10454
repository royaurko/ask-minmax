A network of gravitational wave detectors is called redundant if, given the
direction to a source, the strain induced by a gravitational wave in one or
more of the detectors can be fully expressed in terms of the strain induced in
others in the network. Because gravitational waves have only two polarizations,
any network of three or more differently oriented interferometers with similar
observing bands is redundant. For LISA, this ``null'' output is known as the
Sagnac mode, and its use in discriminating between detector noise and a
cosmological gravitational wave background is well understood [1][2]. But the
usefulness of the null veto for ground-based detector networks has been ignored
until now. We show that it should make it possible to discriminate in a
model-independent way between real gravitational waves and accidentally
coincident non-Gaussian noise ``events'' in redundant networks of two or more
broadband detectors (e.g, three LIGO detectors and GEO). It has been shown that
with three detectors, the null output can be used to locate the direction to
the source, and then two other linear combinations of detector outputs give the
optimal ``coherent'' reconstruction of the two polarization components of the
signal. We discuss briefly the implementation of such a detection strategy in
realistic networks.
