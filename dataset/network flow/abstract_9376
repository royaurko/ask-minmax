Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) generate massive amount of live data and
events sensed through dispersedly deployed tiny sensors. This generated data
needed to be disseminate to the sink with slight consumption of network
resources. One of the ways to efficiently transmit this bulk data is gossiping.
An important consideration in gossip-based dissemination protocols is to keep
routing table up to date. Considering the inherent resource constrained nature
of adhoc wireless sensor networks, we propose a gossip based protocol that
consumes little resources. Our proposed scheme aims to keep the routing table
size R as low as possible yet it ensures that the diameter is small too. We
learned the performance of our proposed protocol through simulations. Results
show that our proposed protocol attains major improvement in network
reachability and connectivity.
