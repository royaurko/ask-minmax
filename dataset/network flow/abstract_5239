A theoretical model is developed for predicting dynamic polymer depletion
effects under the influence of fluid flow. The results are established by
combining the two-fluid model and the self-consistent field theory. We consider
a uniform fluid flow across a slit containing a solution with polymer chains.
The two parallel and infinitely long walls are permeable to solvent only and
the polymers do not adsorb to these walls. For a weak flow and a narrow slit in
Theta-solvent conditions, an analytic expression is derived to describe the
steady state polymer concentration profiles. In both Theta- and good-solvents,
we compute the time evolution of the concentration profiles for various flow
rates characterized by the Peclet number. The model reveals the interplay of
depletion, solvent condition, slit width, and relative strength of the fluid
flow.
