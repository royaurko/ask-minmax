Active galactic nuclei are clearly heating gas in `cooling flows'. The
effectiveness and spatial distribution of the heating are controversial. We use
three-dimensional simulations on adaptive grids to study the impact on a
cooling flow of weak, subrelativistic jets. The simulations show cavities and
vortex rings as in the observations. The cavities are fast-expanding dynamical
objects rather than buoyant bubbles as previously modelled, but shocks still
remain extremely hard to detect with X-rays. At late times the cavities turn
into overdensities that strongly excite the cluster's g-modes. These modes damp
on a long timescale. Radial mixing is shown to be an important phenomenon, but
the jets weaken the metallicity gradient only very near the centre. The central
entropy density is modestly increased by the jets. We use a novel algorithm to
impose the jets on the simulations.
