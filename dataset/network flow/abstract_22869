We approximate the level set solution for the motion of an embedded closed
curve in the plane with normal speed $\max(0, \kappa)^{\ga}$ where $\kappa$ is
the curvature of the curve and $\frac{1}{3}<\ga<1$ by the value functions of a
family of deterministic two person games. We show convergence of the value
functions to the viscosity solution of the level set equation and propose a
numerical scheme for the calculation of the value function.
