In this paper we prove two extensions of Hamilton's maximal principle for
systems pf parabolic equations which sould be useful for the study of the Ricci
flow and some other geometric evolution equations. One extension is a
time-dependent maximum principle and the other is a time-dependent maximum
principle subject to an avoidance set.
