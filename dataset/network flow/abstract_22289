We construct a solution of eleven dimensional supergravity corresponding to a
stack of M2 branes localized at the center of a particular eight dimensional
hyper-Kaehler manifold constructed by Gauntlett, Gibbons, Papadopoulos, and
Townsend, generalizing the earlier construction of Cherkis and Hashimoto. In
the decoupling limit, this solution is dual to a Chern-Simons/Yang-Mills/Matter
theory in 2+1 dimensions with N=3 supersymmetry, which flows in the infra red
to a superconformal Chern-Simons/Matter system preserving N=6,8 supersymmetry,
constructed recently by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena.
