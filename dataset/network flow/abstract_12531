In this paper, the question of expected time to convergence is addressed for
unbiased quantized consensus on undirected connected graphs, and some strong
results are obtained. The paper first provides a tight expression for the
expected convergence time of the unbiased quantized consensus over general but
fixed networks. It is shown that the maximum expected convergence time lies
within a constant factor of the maximum hitting time of an appropriate lazy
random walk, using the theory of harmonic functions for reversible Markov
chains. Following this, and using electric resistance analogy of the reversible
Markov chains, the paper provides a tight upper bound for the expected
convergence time to consensus based on the parameters of the network. Moreover,
the paper identifies a precise order of the maximum expected convergence time
for some simple graphs such as line graph and cycle. Finally, the results are
extended to bound the expected convergence time of the underlying dynamics in
time-varying networks. Modeling such dynamics as the evolution of a time
inhomogeneous Markov chain, the paper derives a tight upper bound for expected
convergence time of the dynamics using the spectral representation of the
networks. This upper bound is significantly better than earlier results for the
quantized consensus problem over time-varying graphs.
