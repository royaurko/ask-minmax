We perform three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a moving
substructure in a cluster of galaxies. We investigate dynamical evolution of
the intracluster medium (ICM) in and around the substructure moving radially in
the larger cluster's gravitational potential, and its observational
consequences. After the substructure passes the larger cluster's center, a bow
shock and clear contact discontinuity form in front of it. The contact
discontinuity looks like a sharp cold front in the X-ray image synthesized from
the simulation results. This agrees with a structure found in 1E 0657-56. The
flow structure remains laminar before the first turnaround because the
ram-pressure stripping is dominant over the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities on the boundary between the substructure and the ambient ICM.
 When a subcluster oscillates radially around the larger cluster's center, both
Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop well and the flow
structure becomes highly turbulent. Around the turnaround, the subcluster's
cold gas is pushed out of its potential well.
 Therefore, the cold gas component appears to be in front of the subcluster. A
relatively blunt cold front appears in the simulated
 X-ray image because the contact discontinuity is perturbed by Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities. This can explain the ICM structure found in A168.
