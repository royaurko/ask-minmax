The study of community networks has attracted considerable attention
recently. In this paper, we propose an evolving community network model based
on local processes, the addition of new nodes intra-community and new links
intra- or inter-community. Employing growth and preferential attachment
mechanisms, we generate networks with a generalized power-law distribution of
nodes' degrees.
