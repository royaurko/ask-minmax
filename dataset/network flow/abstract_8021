A necessary and sufficient condition ("exponential nonresonance") is
established for every signal obtained from a linear flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by
means of a linear observable to either vanish identically or else exhibit a
strong form of Benford's Law (logarithmic distribution of significant digits).
The result extends and unifies all previously known (sufficient) conditions.
Exponential nonresonance is shown to be typical for linear flows, both from a
topological and a measure-theoretical point of view.
