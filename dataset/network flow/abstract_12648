We discuss two aspects, the in vivo and in vitro difference and the modeling
of noise, of integrative modeling of network dynamics in biology, using phage
lambda as an example. We believe those two aspects have not been seriously
considered, and the including of them may be enough to solve the outstanding
stability and robustness puzzle of in gene regulatory network dynamics.
