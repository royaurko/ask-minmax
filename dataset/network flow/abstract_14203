In this paper we discuss a dynamic flux-transport dynamo model that includes
the feedback of the induced magnetic field on differential rotation and
meridional flow. We consider two different approaches for the feedback:
meanfield Lorentz force and quenching of transport coefficients such as
turbulent viscosity and heat conductivity. We find that even strong feedback on
the meridional flow does not change the character of the flux-transport dynamo
significantly; however it leads to a significant reduction of differential
rotation. To a large degree independent from the dynamo parameters, the
saturation takes place when the toroidal field at the base of the convection
zone reaches between 1.2 an 1.5 T, the energy converted intomagnetic energy
corresponds to about 0.1 to 0.2% of the solar luminosity. The torsional
oscillations produced through Lorentz force feedback on differential rotation
show a dominant poleward propagating branch with the correct phase relation to
the magnetic cycle. We show that incorporating enhanced surface cooling of the
active region belt (as proposed by Spruit) leads to an equatorward propagating
branch in good agreement with observations.
