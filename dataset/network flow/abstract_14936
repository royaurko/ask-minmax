A large network of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons is studied analytically
when the synaptic weights are independently randomly distributed according to a
gaussian distribution with arbitrary mean. The relevant order parameters are
identified, and it is shown that such network is statistically equivalent to an
ensemble of independent IF neurons with each input signal given by the sum of a
self-interaction deterministic term and a gaussian coloured noise. The model is
able to reproduce the quasi-synchronous oscillations, and the dropout of their
frequency, of the CNS neurons of the swimming Xenopus tadpole. The cause of the
instability of low firing-rate self-sustained activity is identified and
explained. Predictions from the model are proposed for future experiments.
