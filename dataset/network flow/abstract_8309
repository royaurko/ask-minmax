We introduce a novel method for identifying the modular structures of a
network based on the maximization of an objective function: the ratio
association. This cost function arises when the communities detection problem
is described in the probabilistic autoencoder frame. An analogy with kernel
k-means methods allows to develop an efficient optimization algorithm, based on
the deterministic annealing scheme. The performance of the proposed method is
shown on a real data set and on simulated networks.
