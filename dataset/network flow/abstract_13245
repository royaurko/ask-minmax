We show that, for two-dimensional space-periodic incompressible flow, the
solution can be evaluated numerically in Lagrangian coordinates with the same
accuracy achieved in standard Eulerian spectral methods. This allows the
determination of complex-space Lagrangian singularities. Lagrangian
singularities are found to be closer to the real domain than Eulerian
singularities and seem to correspond to fluid particles which escape to
(complex) infinity by the current time. Various mathematical conjectures
regarding Eulerian/Lagrangian singularities are presented.
