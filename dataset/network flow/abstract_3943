Network (as a general notion) is not a mathematical object - there is no even
any definition. However, there is a lot of good rigorous mathematics for
well-defined classes of networks. In sections 1-3 we give a short overview of
classes of networks which interested the contributors for some time. In section 4 we
consider in detail a new class of networks, related to markets with many
agents.
