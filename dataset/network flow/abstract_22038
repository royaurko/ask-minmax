We classified $v_2$ measurements according to their sensitivities w.r.t. to
two planes, namely, reaction plane and participant plane. Likewise, in
$v_2/\epsilon$ scaling, we showed that one needs to choose a $\epsilon$ that is
sensitive to the same plane as that $v_2$ is sensitive to. We presented our
$v_2/\epsilon$ as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. We studied
the ratio of $v_4/v_2^2$. We discussed the applicable range for hydrodynamics,
as well as implications to an incomplete thermalization.
