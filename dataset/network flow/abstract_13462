The particle detectors at the future linear colliders, like ILD and SiD, use
Particle Flow Algorithms (PFA)s to reach higher jet energy resolutions than the
classical pure calorimetry. During the past few years, the University of Iowa
group developed the Iowa PFA. This algorithm has been used to benchmark the
performance of the SiD detector for the Letter Of Intent of 2009. Recently, new
strategies and techniques are included in the different parts of this algorithm
in order to increase its performance. The latest improvements and results of
the Iowa PFA will be discussed.
