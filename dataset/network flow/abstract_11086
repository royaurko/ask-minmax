Network coding is a highly efficient data dissemination mechanism for
wireless networks. Since network coded information can only be recovered after
delivering a sufficient number of coded packets, the resulting decoding delay
can become problematic for delay-sensitive applications such as real-time media
streaming. Motivated by this observation, we consider several algorithms that
minimize the decoding delay and analyze their performance by means of
simulation. The algorithms differ both in the required information about the
state of the neighbors' buffers and in the way this knowledge is used to decide
which packets to combine through coding operations. Our results show that a
greedy algorithm, whose encodings maximize the number of nodes at which a coded
packet is immediately decodable significantly outperforms existing network
coding protocols.
