In this paper, we consider the inverse problem of determining the
permeability of the subsurface from hydraulic head measurements, within the
framework of a steady Darcy model of groundwater flow. We study geometrically
defined prior permeability fields, which admit layered, fault and channel
structures, in order to mimic realistic subsurface features; within each layer
we adopt either constant or continuous function representation of the
permeability. This prior model leads to a parameter identification problem for
a finite number of unknown parameters determining the geometry, together with
either a finite number of permeability values (in the constant case) or a
finite number of fields (in the continuous function case). We adopt a Bayesian
framework showing existence and well-posedness of the posterior distribution.
We also introduce novel Markov Chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which exploit
the different character of the geometric and permeability parameters, and build
on recent advances in function space MCMC. These algorithms provide rigorous
estimates of the permeability, as well as the uncertainty associated with it,
and only require forward model evaluations. No adjoint solvers are required and
hence the methodology is applicable to black-box forward models. We then use
these methods to explore the posterior and to illustrate the methodology with
numerical experiments.
