Exciton-polaritons can be created in semiconductor microcavities. These
quasiparticles act as weakly interacting bosons with very light mass, of the
order of $10^{-4}$ times the vacuum electron mass. Many experiments have shown
effects which can be viewed as due to a Bose-Einstein condensate, or
quasicondensate, of these particles. The lifetime of the particles in most of
those experiments has been of the order of a few picoseconds, leading to
significant nonequilibrium effects. By increasing the cavity quality, we have
made new samples with longer polariton lifetimes. With a photon lifetime on the
order of 100-200 ps, polaritons in these new structures can not only come
closer to reaching true thermal equilibrium, a desired feature for many
researchers working in this field, but they can also travel much longer
distances. We observe the polaritons to ballistically travel on the order of
one millimeter, and at higher densities we see transport of a coherent
condensate, or quasicondensate, over comparable distances. In this paper we
report a quantitative analysis of the flow of the polaritons both in a
low-density, classical regime, and in the coherent regime at higher density.
Our analysis gives us a measure of the intrinsic lifetime for photon decay from
the microcavity and a measure of the strength of interactions of the
polaritons.
