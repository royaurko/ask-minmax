Recent studies of black hole and neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs)
show a positive correlation between the X-ray flux at which the
low/hard(LH)-to-high/soft(HS) state transition occurs and the peak flux of the
following HS state. By analyzing the data from the All Sky Monitor (ASM)
onboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), we show that the HS state flux
after the source reaches its HS flux peak still correlates with the transition
flux during soft X-ray transient (SXT) outbursts. By studying large outbursts
or flares of GX 339-4, Aql X-1 and 4U 1705-44, we have found that the
correlation holds up to 250, 40, and 50 d after the LH-to-HS state transition,
respectively. These time scales correspond to the viscous time scale in a
standard accretion disk around a stellar mass black hole or a neutron star at a
radius of ~104-5 Rg, indicating that the mass accretion rates in the accretion
flow either correlate over a large range of radii at a given time or correlate
over a long period of time at a given radius. If the accretion geometry is a
two-flow geometry composed of a sub-Keplerian inflow or outflow and a disk flow
in the LH state, the disk flow with a radius up to ~105 Rg would have
contributed to the nearly instantaneous non-thermal radiation directly or
indirectly, and therefore affects the time when the state transition occurs.
