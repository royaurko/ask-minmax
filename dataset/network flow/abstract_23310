In this paper, four distinct approaches to Volume of Fluid (VOF)
computational method are compared. Two of the methods are the 'simplified' VOF
formulations, in that they do not require geometrical interface reconstruction.
The assessment is made possible by implementing all four approaches into the
same code as a switchable options. This allows to rule out possible influence
of other parts of numerical scheme, be it the discretisation of Navier-Stokes
equations or chosen approximation of curvature, so that we are left with
conclusive arguments because only one factor differs the compared methods. The
comparison is done in the framework of CLSVOF (Coupled Level Set Volume of
Fluid), so that all four methods are coupled with Level Set interface, which is
used to compute pressure jump via the GFM (Ghost-Fluid Method). Results
presented include static advections, full N-S solutions in laminar and
turbulent flows. The paper is aimed at research groups who are implementing VOF
methods in their computations or intend to do it, and might consider a
simplified approach as a preliminary measure, since the methods presented
differ greatly in complication level, or ease of implementation expressed e.g.
in number of code lines.
