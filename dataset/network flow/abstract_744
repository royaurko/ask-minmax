In this work, we propose online traffic engineering as a novel approach to
detect and mitigate an emerging class of stealthy Denial of Service (DoS)
link-flooding attacks. Our approach exploits the Software Defined Networking
(SDN) paradigm, which renders the management of network traffic more flexible
through centralised flow-level control and monitoring. We implement a full
prototype of our solution on an emulated SDN environment using OpenFlow to
interface with the network devices. We further discuss useful insights gained
from our preliminary experiments as well as a number of open research questions
which constitute work in progress.
