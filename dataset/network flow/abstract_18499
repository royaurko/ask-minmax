We consider the problem of source coding with receiver side information for
the simple network proposed by R. Gray and A. Wyner in 1974. In this network, a
transmitter must reliably transport the output of two correlated information
sources to two receivers using three noiseless channels: a public channel which
connects the transmitter to both receivers, and two private channels which
connect the transmitter directly to each receiver. We extend Gray and Wyner's
original problem by permitting side information to be present at each receiver.
We derive inner and outer bounds for the achievable rate region and, for three
special cases, we show that the outer bound is tight.
