Using an analytic model we show that the predictions of the cosmic string
model for the peculiar velocities and the microwave background (MBR) anisotropy
depend on similar combinations of string evolution parameters. Normalizing from
the COBE detection of MBR anisotropy, and for certain reasonable values of
string network evolution parameters, we find that the magnitude of predicted
velocity flows is in good agreement with observations on small scales but is
inconsistent with observations on large scales ($ > 50 h^{-1}$Mpc). The Cosmic
Mach Number obtained from the cosmic string scenario is found to depend on a
single network evolution parameter and is consistent with observations on
scales $5h^{-1}$Mpc to $20h^{-1}$Mpc.
