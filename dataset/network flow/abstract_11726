We address the problem of finding the capacity of noisy networks with either
independent point-to-point compound channels (CC) or arbitrarily varying
channels (AVC). These channels model the presence of a Byzantine adversary
which controls a subset of links or nodes in the network. We derive equivalence
results showing that these point-to-point channels with state can be replaced
by noiseless bit-pipes without changing the network capacity region. Exact
equivalence results are found for the CC model, and for some instances of the
AVC, including all nonsymmetrizable AVCs. These results show that a feedback
path between the output and input of a CC can increase the equivalent capacity,
and that if common randomness can be established between the terminals of an
AVC (either by feedback, a forward path, or via a third-party node), then again
the equivalent capacity can increase. This leads to an observation that
deleting an edge of arbitrarily small capacity can cause a significant change
in network capacity. We also analyze an example involving an AVC for which no
fixed-capacity bit-pipe is equivalent.
