This paper studies characteristic exponents of flows in relation with the
dynamics of flows on flag bundles. The starting point is a flow on a principal
bundle with semi-simple group $G$. Projection against the Iwasawa decomposition
$G = KAN$ defines an additive cocycle over the flow with values in $\frak{a} =
\log A$. Its Lyapunov exponents (limits along trajectories) and Morse exponents
(limits along chains) are studied. It is proved a symmetric property of these
spectral sets, namely invariance under the Weyl group. It is proved also that
these sets are located in certain Weyl chambers, defined from the dynamics on
the associated flag bundles. As a special case linear flows on vector bundles
are considered.
