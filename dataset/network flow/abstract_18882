This paper investigates a method of Handwritten English Character Recognition
using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This work has been done in offline
Environment for non correlated characters, which do not possess any linear
relationships among them. We test that whether the particular tested character
belongs to a cluster or not. The implementation is carried out in Matlab
environment and successfully tested. Fifty-two sets of English alphabets are
used to train the ANN and test the network. The algorithms are tested with 26
capital letters and 26 small letters. The testing result showed that the
proposed ANN based algorithm showed a maximum recognition rate of 85%.
