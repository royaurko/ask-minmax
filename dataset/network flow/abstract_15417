Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an attractive choice for a variety of
applications as no wired infrastructure is needed. Other wireless networks are
not as energy constrained as WSNs, because they may be plugged into the mains
supply or equipped with batteries that are rechargeable and replaceable. Among
others, one of the main sources of energy depletion in WSN is communications
controlled by the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. An extensive survey of
energy efficient MAC protocols is presented in this article. We categorise WSN
MAC protocols in the following categories: controlled access (CA), random
access (RA), slotted protocols (SP) and hybrid protocols (HP). We further
discuss how energy efficient MAC protocols have developed from fixed sleep/wake
cycles through adaptive to dynamic cycles, thus becoming more responsive to
traffic load variations. Finally we present open research questions on MAC
layer design for WSNs in terms of energy efficiency
