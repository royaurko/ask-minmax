In this paper, we propose a combination of pedestrian data collection and
analysis and modeling that may yield higher competitive advantage in the
business environment. The data collection is only based on simple inventory and
questionnaire surveys on a hypermarket to obtain trajectory path of pedestrian
movement. Though the data has limitation by using static trajectories, our
techniques showed that it is possible to obtain aggregation of flow pattern and
alley attractiveness similar to the result of aggregation using dynamic
trajectory. A case study of a real hypermarket demonstrates that daily
necessity products are closely related to higher flow pattern. Using the
proposed method, we are also able to quantify pedestrian behavior that shoppers
tend to walk about 7 times higher than the ideal shortest path
