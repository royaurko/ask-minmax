Random scale-free networks have the peculiar property of being prone to the
spreading of infections. Here we provide an exact result showing that a
scale-free connectivity distribution with diverging second moment is a
sufficient condition to have null epidemic threshold in unstructured networks
with either assortative or dissortative mixing. Connectivity correlations
result therefore ininfluential for the epidemic spreading picture in these
scale-free networks. The present result is related to the divergence of the
average nearest neighbors connectivity, enforced by the connectivity detailed
balance condition.
