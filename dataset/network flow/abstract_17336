The energy radiated by moving cracks in a discrete background is analyzed.
The energy flow through a given surface is expressed in terms of a generalized
Poynting vector. The velocity of the crack is determined by the radiation by
the crack tip. The radiation becomes more isotropic as the crack velocity
approaches the instability threshold.
