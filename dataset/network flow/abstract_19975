The ability to make electrical contact to single molecules creates
opportunities to examine fundamental processes governing electron flow on the
smallest possible length scales. We report experiments in which we controllably
stretch individual cobalt complexes having spin S = 1, while simultaneously
measuring current flow through the molecule. The molecule's spin states and
magnetic anisotropy were manipulated in the absence of a magnetic field by
modification of the molecular symmetry. This control enabled quantitative
studies of the underscreened Kondo effect, in which conduction electrons only
partially compensate the molecular spin. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism
of spin control in single-molecule devices and establish that they can serve as
model systems for making precision tests of correlated-electron theories.
