This paper presents results on the memory capacity of a generalized feedback
neural network using a circulant matrix. Children are capable of learning soon
after birth which indicates that the neural networks of the brain have prior
learnt capacity that is a consequence of the regular structures in the brain's
organization. Motivated by this idea, we consider the capacity of circulant
matrices as weight matrices in a feedback network.
