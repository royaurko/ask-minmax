Self-similarity is a property of fractal structures, a concept introduced by
Mandelbrot and one of the fundamental mathematical results of the 20th century.
The importance of fractal geometry stems from the fact that these structures
were recognized in numerous examples in Nature, from the coexistence of
liquid/gas at the critical point of evaporation of water, to snowflakes, to the
tortuous coastline of the Norwegian fjords, to the behavior of many complex
systems such as economic data, or the complex patterns of human agglomeration.
Here we review the recent advances in self-similarity of complex networks and
its relation to transport, diffusion, percolations and other topological
properties such us degree distribution, modularity, and degree-degree
correlations.
