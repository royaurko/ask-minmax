Individuals of different types, may it be genetic, cultural, or else, with
different levels of fitness often compete for reproduction and survival. A
fitter type generally has higher chances of disseminating their copies to other
individuals. The fixation probability of a single mutant type introduced in a
population of wild-type individuals quantifies how likely the mutant type
spreads. How much the excess fitness of the mutant type increases its fixation
probability, namely, the selection pressure, is important in assessing the
impact of the introduced mutant. Previous studies mostly based on undirected
and unweighted contact networks of individuals showed that the selection
pressure depends on the structure of networks and the rule of reproduction.
Real networks underlying ecological and social interactions are usually
directed or weighted. Here we examine how the selection pressure is modulated
by directionality of interactions under several update rules. Our conclusions
are twofold. First, directionality discounts the selection pressure for
different networks and update rules. Second, given a network, the update rules
in which death events precede reproduction events significantly decrease the
selection pressure than the other rules.
