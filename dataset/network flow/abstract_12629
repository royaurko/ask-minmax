We use the velocity-dependent one-scale model by Martins & Shellard to
investigate the evolution of a GUT long cosmic string network in arbitrary
Friedmann-Lemaitre models. Four representative models are used to show that in
general there is no scaling solution. The implications for structure formation
are briefly discussed.
