Using a dynamical model based on the $NN \to d\pi$, $NNN \to dN$, and $NN\pi
\to d\pi$ reactions and measured proton and pion transverse momentum spectra
and elliptic flows, we study the production of deuterons and their elliptic
flow in heavy ion collisions at RHIC. The results are compared with those from
the coalescence model. The deviation of deuteron elliptic flow from the
constituent nucleon number scaling expected from the coalescence model and the
comparison with the experimental data are discussed in connection to the
allowed nucleon phase space in these reactions.
