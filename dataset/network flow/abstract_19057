Datacenter networks and services are at risk in the face of disasters.
Existing fault-tolerant storage services cannot even achieve a nil recovery
point objective (RPO) as client-generated data may get lost before the
termination of their migration across geo-replicated datacenters. SDN has
proved instrumental in exploiting application-level information to optimise the
routing of information. In this paper, we propose Software Defined Edge (SDE)
or the implementation of SDN at the network edge to achieve nil RPO. We
illustrate our proposal with a fault-tolerant key-value store that
experimentally recovers from disaster within 30s. Although SDE is inherently
fault-tolerant and scalable, its deployment raises new challenges on the
partnership between ISPs and CDN providers. We conclude that failure detection
information at the SDN-level can effectively benefit applications to recover
from disaster.
