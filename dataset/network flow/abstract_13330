We revisit the vertical structure of neutrino-dominated accretion flows in
spherical coordinates. We stress that the flow should be geometrically thick
when advection becomes dominant. In our calculation, the luminosity of neutrino
annihilation is enhanced by one or two orders of magnitude. The empty funnel
along the rotation axis can naturally explain the neutrino annihilable
ejection.
