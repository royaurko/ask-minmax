We report the first experimental observation of strong multifractality in
wave functions at the Anderson localization transition in open
three-dimensional elastic networks. Our results confirm the recently predicted
symmetry of the multifractal exponents. We have discovered that the result of
multifractal analysis of the real data depends on the excitation scheme used in
the experiment.
