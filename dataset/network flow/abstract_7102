We show that the flow of granular material inside a 2-dimensional flat
bottomed hopper is altered significantly by having more than one exit orifice.
For the hoppers with small orifice widths, inter-mittent flow through one
orifice enables the resumption of flow through the adjacent jammed orifice,
thus displaying a sequence of jamming and unjamming events. Using discrete
element simulations, we show that the total amount of granular material (i.e.
avalanche size) emanating from all the orifices combined can be enhanced by
about an order of magnitude difference by simply adjusting the inter-orifice
distance. The unjamming is driven primarily by fluctuations alone when the
inter-orifice distance is large, but when the orifices are brought close
enough, the fluctuations along with the mean flow cause the flow unjamming.
