Analyzing nonlinear conformational relaxation dynamics in elastic networks
corresponding to two classical motor proteins, we find that they respond by
well-defined internal mechanical motions to various initial deformations and
that these motions are robust against external perturbations. We show that this
behavior is not characteristic for random elastic networks. However, special
network architectures with such properties can be designed by evolutionary
optimization methods. Using them, an example of an artificial elastic network,
operating as a cyclic machine powered by ligand binding, is constructed.
