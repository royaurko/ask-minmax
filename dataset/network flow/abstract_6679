In this paper, the network simulation framework OMNeT++ is used for
development and testing of automotive Ethernet-Networks. Therefore OMNeT++ is
extended by the INET framework. It is augmented by an implementation of the
protocol SOME/IP (-SD) and an connector to the middleware Gamma V. The
middleware is used to configure the network by initialization. Additionally
data, which is sent over the network, can be changed on the fly.
  The contribution of this work regards three main aspects: First, the use of
OMNeT++ for network development in automotive industry. Second, the employment
of an existing simulation model and using it as restbus simulation for Hardware
in the Loop (HiL) testing or rapid prototyping. Finally, the implementation of
SOME/IP(-SD) into OMNeT++.
