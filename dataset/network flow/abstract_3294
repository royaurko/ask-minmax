We report the measurements of elliptic flow $v_{2}$, as well as higher
harmonics triangular flow $v_{3}$ and quadrangular flow $v_{4}$, in
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} =$ 2.76 TeV Pb--Pb collisions, measured with the ALICE
detector. We show that the measured elliptic and triangular flow can be
understood from the initial spatial anisotropy and its event--by--event
fluctuations. The resulting fluctuations of $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ are also
discussed.
