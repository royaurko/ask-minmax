The overlap operator provides an elegant definition for the winding number of
lattice gauge field configurations. Only for a set of configurations of measure
zero is this procedure undefined. Without restrictions on the lattice fields,
however, the space of gauge fields is simply connected. I present a simple low
dimensional illustration of how the eigenvalues of a truncated overlap operator
flow as one travels between different topological sectors.
