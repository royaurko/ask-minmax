This article shows how the operational semantics of a language like ORC can
be instrumented so that the execution of a program produces information on the
causal dependencies between events. The concurrent semantics we obtain is based
on asymmetric labeled event structures. The approach is illustrated using a Web
service orchestration instance and the detection of race conditions.
