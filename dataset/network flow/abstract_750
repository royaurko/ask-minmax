The classical network configuration introduced by Braess in 1968 is of
fundamental significance because Valiant and Roughgarden showed in 2006 that
`the "global" behaviour of an equilibrium flow in a large random network is
similar to that in Braess' original four-node example'. In this paper, a
natural generalisation of Braess' network is introduced and conditions for the
occurrence of Braess' paradox are formulated for the generalised network.
  The Braess' paradox has been studied mainly in the context of the classical
problem introduced by Braess and his colleagues, assuming a certain type of
networks. Specifically, two pairs of links in those networks are assumed to
have the same volume-delay functions. The occurrence of Braess' paradox for
this specific case of network symmetry was investigated by Pas and Principio in
1997. Such a symmetry is not common in real-life networks because the
parameters of volume-delay functions are associated with roads physical and
functional characteristics, which typically differ from one link to another
(e.g. roads in networks are of different length). Our research provides an
extension of previous studies on Braess' paradox by considering arbitrary
volume-delay functions, i.e. symmetry properties are not assumed for any of the
network's links and the occurrence of Braess' paradox is studied for a general
configuration.
