The fundamental concept of applying the system methodology to network
analysis declares that network architecture should take into account services
and applications which this network provides and supports. This work introduces
a formal model of computer networks on the basis of the hierarchical multilayer
networks. In turn, individual layers are represented as multiplex networks. The
concept of layered networks provides conditions of top-down consistency of the
model. Next, we determined the necessary set of layers for network architecture
representation with regard to applying the system methodology to network
analysis.
