This study examined the effects of "tuning" the parameters of the incremental
function of MYCIN, the independent function of PROSPECTOR, a probability model
that assumes independence, and a simple additive linear equation. me parameters
of each of these models were optimized to provide solutions which most nearly
approximated those from a full probability model for a large set of simple
networks. Surprisingly, MYCIN, PROSPECTOR, and the linear equation performed
equivalently; the independence model was clearly more accurate on the networks
studied.
