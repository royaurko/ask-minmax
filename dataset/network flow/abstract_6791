My lecture is devoted to the analytical results available for a large class
of axisymmetric stationary flows in the vicinity of compact astrophysical
objects. First, the most general case is formulated corresponding to the
axisymmetric stationary MHD flow in the Kerr metric. Then, I discuss the
hydrodynamical version of the Grad-Shafranov equation. Although not so
well-known as the full MHD one, it allows us to clarify the nontrivial
structure of the Grad-Shafranov approach as well as to discuss the simplest
version of the 3+1-split language -- the most convenient one for the
description of ideal flows in the vicinity of rotating black holes. Finally, I
consider several examples that demonstrate how this approach can be used to
obtain the quantitative description of the real transonic flows in the vicinity
of rotating and moving black holes.
