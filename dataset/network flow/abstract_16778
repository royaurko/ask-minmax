An interference alignment example is constructed for the deterministic
channel model of the $K$ user interference channel. The deterministic channel
example is then translated into the Gaussian setting, creating the first known
example of a fully connected Gaussian $K$ user interference network with single
antenna nodes, real, non-zero and contant channel coefficients, and no
propagation delays where the degrees of freedom outerbound is achieved. An
analogy is drawn between the propagation delay based interference alignment
examples and the deterministic channel model which also allows similar
constructions for the 2 user $X$ channel as well.
