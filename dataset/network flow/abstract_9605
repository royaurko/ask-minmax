A robust worldwide air-transportation network (WAN) is one that minimizes the
number of stranded passengers under a sequence of airport closures. Building on
top of this realistic example, here we address how spatial network robustness
can profit from cooperation between local actors. We swap a series of links
within a certain distance, a cooperation range, while following typical
constraints of spatially embedded networks. We find that the network robustness
is only improved above a critical cooperation range. Such improvement can be
described in the framework of a continuum transition, where the critical
exponents depend on the spatial correlation of connected nodes. For the WAN we
show that, except for Australia, all continental networks fall into the same
universality class. Practical implications of this result are also discussed.
