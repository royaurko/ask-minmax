We present a simple and general approach to formulate the lattice BGK model
for high speed compressible flows. The main point consists of two parts: an
appropriate discrete equilibrium distribution function (DEDF) $\mathbf{f}^{eq}$
and a discrete velocity model with flexible velocity size. The DEDF is obtained
by $\mathbf{f}^{eq}=\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{M}$, where $\mathbf{M}$ is a set of
moment of the Maxwellian distribution function, and $\mathbf{C}$ is the matrix
connecting the DEDF and the moments. The numerical components of $\mathbf{C}$
are determined by the discrete velocity model. The calculation of
$\mathbf{C}^{-1}$ is based on the analytic solution which is a function of the
parameter controlling the sizes of discrete velocity. The choosing of discrete
velocity model has a high flexibility. The specific heat ratio of the system
can be flexible. The approach works for the one-, two- and three-dimensional
model constructions. As an example, we compose a new lattice BGK kinetic model
which works not only for recovering the Navier-Stokes equations in the
continuum limit but also for measuring the departure of system from its
thermodynamic equilibrium. Via adjusting the sizes of the discrete velocities
the stably simulated Mach number can be significantly increased up to 30 or
even higher. The model is verified and validated by well-known benchmark tests.
Some macroscopic behaviors of the system due to deviating from thermodynamic
equilibrium around the shock wave interfaces are shown.
