We present a way of tiling the plane with a regular hexagonal network of
defects. The network is stable and follows in consequence of the
three-junctions that appear in a model of two real scalar fields that presents
$Z_3$ symmetry. The $Z_3$ symmetry is effective in both the vacuum and defect
sectors, and no supersymmetry is required to build the network.
