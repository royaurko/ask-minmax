One of the more promising recent approaches to turbulence modelling is the
Variational Multiscale Large Eddy Simulation (VMS LES) method proposed by
Hughes et al. [Comp. Visual. Sci., vol. 3, pp. 47-59, 2000]. This method avoids
several conceptual issues of traditional filter-based LES by employing a priori
scale partitioning in the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations.
  Most applications of VMS LES reported to date have been based on hierarchical
bases, in particular global spectral methods, in which scale partitioning is
straightforward. In the present work we describe the implementation of the
methodology in a three-dimensional high-order spectral element method with a
nodal basis. We report results from coarse grid simulations of turbulent
channel flow at different Reynolds numbers to assess the performance of the
model.
