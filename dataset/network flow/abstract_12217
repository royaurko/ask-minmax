Hidden nodes in a wireless network refer to nodes that are out of range of
other nodes or a collection of nodes. We will discuss a few problems introduced
by the RTS/CTS mechanism of collision avoidance and focus on the virtual
jamming problem, which allows a malicious node to effectively jam a large
fragment of a wireless network at minimum expense of power. We have also
discussed WiCCP (Wireless Central Coordinated Protocol) which is a protocol
booster that also provides good solution to hidden nodes.
