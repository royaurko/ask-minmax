We have explored the structure of hot flow bathed in a general large-scale
magnetic field. The importance of outflow and thermal conduction on the
self-similar structure of a hot accretion flows has been investigated. We
consider the additional magnetic parameters $ \beta_{r,\varphi,z}\big[=
c^2_{r,\varphi,z}/(2 c^2_{s}) \big] $, where $ c^2_{r,\varphi,z} $ are the
Alfv$\acute{e}$n sound speeds in three direction of cylindrical coordinate. In
comparison to the accretion disk without winds, our results show that the
radial and rotational velocities of the disk become faster however it become
cooler because of the angular momentum and energy flux which are taking away by
the winds. but thermal conduction opposes the effect of winds not only decrease
the rotational velocity but also increase the radial velocity as well as the
sound speed of the disk. In addition we study the effect of global magnetic
field on the structure of the disk. Our numerical results show that all
components of magnetic field can be important and they have a considerable
effect on velocities and vertical structure of the disk.
