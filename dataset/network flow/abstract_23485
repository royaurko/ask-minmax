In the first part of the paper we show that the constraining potentials
introduced to mimic entanglement effects in Edwards' tube model and Flory's
constrained junction model are diagonal in the generalized Rouse modes of the
corresponding phantom network. As a consequence, both models can formally be
solved exactly for arbitrary connectivity using the recently introduced
constrained mode model. In the second part, we solve a double tube model for
the confinement of long paths in polymer networks which is partially due to
crosslinking and partially due to entanglements. Our model describes a
non-trivial crossover between the Warner-Edwards and the Heinrich-Straube tube
models. We present results for the macroscopic elastic properties as well as
for the microscopic deformations including structure factors.
