This is an extended version of a technical note accepted for publication in
IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. The note proposes an Input to State
practically Stable (ISpS) formulation of distributed nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) for formation control of constrained autonomous vehicles in
presence of communication bandwidth limitation and transmission delays. Planned
trajectories are compressed using neural networks resulting in considerable
reduction of data packet size, while being robust to propagation delays and
uncertainty in neighbors' trajectories. Collision avoidance is achieved by
means of spatially filtered potential field. Analytical results proving ISpS
and generalized small gain conditions are presented for both strongly- and
weakly-connected networks, and illustrated by simulations.
