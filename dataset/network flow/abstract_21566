We show that previously observed large disorder potentials in magnetic
microtraps for neutral atoms are reduced by about two orders of magnitude when
using atom chips with lithographically fabricated high quality gold layers.
Using one dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates, we probe the remaining
magnetic field variations at surface distances down to a few microns.
Measurements on a 100 um wide wire imply that residual variations of the
current flow result from local properties of the wire.
