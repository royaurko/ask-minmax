We show that FFE (Force-Free Electrodynamics) describes pulsar magnetospheres
-- even when radiation and particle wind power are comparable to the spin-down
power. At the same time, we show that FFE is insufficient for calculating
pulsar magnetospheres. This is because FFE admits a large family of stationary
solutions with different currents flowing in the closed line region. To choose
the actual solution one needs a model of current generation which goes beyond
pure FFE.
  We calculate several FFE magnetospheres for the aligned rotator. The Poynting
power of these solutions fills the range $c^{-3}\mu ^2\Omega^4~< ~L~ <~ 0.67
c^{-3}\mu ^2\Omega^4(c/\Omega R_s)^2$, for angular velocity $\Omega$ and
magnetic field which is a pure dipole $\mu$ on the surface of the star of
radius $R_s$.
  Anomalous braking indices of young pulsars might be explained by currents
flowing in the closed-line region.
