We have attempted to describe the rapidity and transverse momentum spectra,
simultaneously, of the hadrons produced in the Ultra-relativistic Nuclear
Collisions. This we have tried to achieve in a single statistical thermal
freeze-out model using single set of parameters. We assume the formation of a
hadronic gas in thermo-chemical equilibrium at the freeze-out. The model
incorporates a longitudinal as well as a transverse hydrodynamic flow. We have
also found that the role of heavier hadronic resonance decay is important in
explaining the particle spectra.
