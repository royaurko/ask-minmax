We provide an analytic expression for the quantity described in the title.
Namely, we perform a preferential attachment growth process to generate a
scale-free network. At each stage we add a new node with $m$ new links. Let $k$
denote the degree of a node, and $N$ the number of nodes in the network. The
degree distribution is assumed to converge to a power-law (for $k\geq m$) of
the form $k^{-\gamma}$ and we obtain an exact implicit relationship for
$\gamma$, $m$ and $N$. We verify this with numerical calculations over several
orders of magnitude. Although this expression is exact, it provides only an
implicit expression for $\gamma(m)$. Nonetheless, we provide a reasonable guess
as to the form of this curve and perform curve fitting to estimate the
parameters of that curve --- demonstrating excellent agreement between
numerical fit, theory, and simulation.
