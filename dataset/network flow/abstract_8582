In Mobile Ad-Hoc networks, broadcasting is a fundamental operation in the
network layer. A node transmits a rebroadcast message to any or all other nodes
whenever it receives for the first time. It will generate several redundant
transmissions and it ends up in a significant downside Broadcast Storm problem.
Within the literature, researchers have proposed 2-Hop Neighbour based protocol
like DP, TDP, PDP and APDP to reduce broadcast storm in MANETs by choosing the
minimum number of forwarding nodes from 1-Hop nodes to cover all 2-Hop nodes.
