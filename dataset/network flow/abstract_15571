In this paper, we introduce a model of a distributed storage system that is
locally recoverable from any single server failure. Unlike the usual local
recovery model of codes for distributed storage, this model accounts for the
fact that each server or storage node in a network is connectible to only some,
and not all other, nodes. This may happen for reasons such as physical
separation, inhomogeneity in storage platforms etc. We estimate the storage
capacity of both undirected and directed networks under this model and propose
some constructive schemes. From a coding theory point of view, we show that
this model is approximately dual of the well-studied index coding problem.
  Further in this paper, we extend the above model to handle multiple server
failures. Among other results, we provide an upper bound on the minimum
pairwise distance of a set of words that can be stored in a graph with the
local repair guarantee. The well-known impossibility bounds on the distance of
locally recoverable codes follow from our result.
