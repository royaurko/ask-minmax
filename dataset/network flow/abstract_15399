How different cultures evaluate a person? Is an important person in one
culture is also important in the other culture? We address these questions via
ranking of multilingual Wikipedia articles. With three ranking algorithms based
on network structure of Wikipedia, we assign ranking to all articles in 9
multilingual editions of Wikipedia and investigate general ranking structure of
PageRank, CheiRank and 2DRank. In particular, we focus on articles related to
persons, identify top 30 persons for each rank among different editions and
analyze distinctions of their distributions over activity fields such as
politics, art, science, religion, sport for each edition. We find that local
heroes are dominant but also global heroes exist and create an effective
network representing entanglement of cultures. The Google matrix analysis of
network of cultures shows signs of the Zipf law distribution. This approach
allows to examine diversity and shared characteristics of knowledge
organization between cultures. The developed computational, data driven
approach highlights cultural interconnections in a new perspective.
