Nowadays the number of available processing cores within computing nodes
which are used in recent clustered environments, are growing up with a rapid
rate. Despite this trend, the number of available network interfaces in such
computing nodes has almost been remained unchanged. This issue can lead to high
usage of network interface in many workloads, especially in heavy-communicating
workloads. As a result, network interface may raise as a performance bottleneck
and can drastically degrade the performance. The goal of this paper is to
introduce a new process mapping strategy in multi-core clusters aimed at
reducing network interface contention and improving inter-node communication
performance of parallel applications. Performance evaluation of the new mapping
algorithm in synthetic and real workloads indicates that the new strategy can
achieve 5% to 90% performance improvement in heavy communicating workloads,
compared to other well-known methods.
