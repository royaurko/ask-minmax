We present an evolutionary game theoretic approach to study node cooperation
behavior in wireless ad hoc networks. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) has been
used to study the conditions governing the growth of cooperation behavior in
biological and social networks. We propose a model of node cooperation behavior
in dynamic wireless networks such as vehicular networks. Our work is motivated
by the fact that, similar to existing EGT studies, node behavior in dynamic
wireless networks is characterized by decision making that only depends on the
immediate neighborhood. We adapt our model to study cooperation behavior in the
context of information dissemination in wireless networks. We obtain conditions
that determine whether a network evolves to a state of complete cooperation
from all nodes. Finally, we use our model to study the evolution of cooperation
behavior and its impact on content downloading in vehicular networks, taking
into consideration realistic network conditions.
