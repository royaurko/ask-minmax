We propose an identified heavy quark jet observable to discriminate between
weakly coupled pQCD and strongly coupled AdS/CFT models of quark gluon plasma
dynamics in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies.
These models are shown to predict qualitatively different associated hadron
correlations with respect to tagged heavy quark jets. While both models feature
similar far zone Mach and diffusion wakes, the far zone stress features are
shown to be too weak to survive thermal broadening at hadron freeze-out.
However, these models differ significantly in a near zone "Neck" region where
strong chromo-fields sourced by the heavy quark jet couple to the polarizable
plasma. Conical associated correlations, if any, are shown to be dominated by
the jet induced transverse flow in the Neck zone and unrelated to the weak far
zone wakes. Unlike in AdS/CFT, we show that the induced transverse flow in the
Neck zone is too weak in pQCD to produce conical correlations after Cooper-Frye
freeze-out. The observation of conical correlations violating Mach's law would
favor the strongly-coupled AdS/CFT string drag dynamics, while their absence
would favor weakly-coupled pQCD-based chromo-hydrodynamics.
