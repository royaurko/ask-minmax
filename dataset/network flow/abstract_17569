We study $C^1$-generic vector fields on closed manifolds without points
accumulated by periodic orbits of different indices and prove that they exhibit
finitely many sinks and sectional-hyperbolic transitive Lyapunov stable sets
with residual basin of attraction. This represents a partial positive answer to
conjectures in \cite{am}, the Palis conjecture \cite{pa} and extend the
Araujo's thesis to higher dimensions \cite{a}.
