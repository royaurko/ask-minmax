Data from a network of gravitational wave detectors can be analyzed in
coincidence to increase detection confidence and reduce non-stationarity of the
background. We propose and explore a geometric algorithm to combine the data
from a network of detectors. The algorithm makes optimal use of the variances
and covariances that exist amongst the different parameters of a signal in a
coincident detection of events. The new algorithm essentially associates with
each trigger ellipsoidal regions in parameter space defined by the covariance
matrix. Triggers from different detectors are deemed to be in coincidence if
their ellipsoids have a non-zero overlap. Compared to an algorithm that uses
uncorrelated windows separately for each of the signal parameters, the new
algorithm greatly reduces the background rate thereby increasing detection
efficiency at a given false alarm rate.
