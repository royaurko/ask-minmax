We analyze the Ginga LAC and Einstein SSS spectra of four cooling flow
clusters, A496, A1795, A2142 and A2199, each of which shows firm evidence of a
relatively cool component. The inclusion of such cool spectral components in
joint fits of SSS and LAC data leads to somewhat higher global temperatures
than are derived from the high energy LAC data alone. We find little evidence
of cool emission outside the SSS field of view. Metal abundances appear to be
centrally enhanced in all four cluster, with varying degrees of model
dependence and statistical significance: the evidence is statistically
strongest for A496 and A2142, somewhat weaker for A2199 and weakest for A1795.
We also explore the model-dependence in the amount of cold, X-ray absorbing
matter discovered in these clusters by White et al. (1991).
