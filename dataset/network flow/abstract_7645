In this work we present a technique of fast numerical computation for
solutions of Navier-Stokes equations in the case of flows of industrial
interest. At first the partial differential equations are translated into a set
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations using the geometrical shape of the
domain where the flow is developing, then these ODEs are numerically resolved
using a set of computations distributed among the available processors. We
present some results from simulations on a parallel hardware architecture using
native multithreads software and simulating a shared-memory or a
distributed-memory environment.
