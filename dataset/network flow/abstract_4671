We show that if M is a hyperbolic 3-manifold which admits a quasigeodesic
flow, then pi_1(M) acts faithfully on a universal circle by homeomorphisms, and
preserves a pair of invariant laminations of this circle. As a corollary, we
show that the Thurston norm can be characterized by quasigeodesic flows,
thereby generalizing a theorem of Mosher, and we give the first example of a
closed hyperbolic 3-manifold without a quasigeodesic flow, answering a
long-standing question of Thurston.
