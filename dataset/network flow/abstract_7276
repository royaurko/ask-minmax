We show how recent theoretical advances for data-propagation in Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be combined to improve gradient-based routing (GBR)
in Wireless Sensor Networks. We propose a mixed-strategy of direct transmission
and multi-hop propagation of data which improves the lifespan of WSNs by
reaching better energy-load-balancing amongst sensor nodes.
