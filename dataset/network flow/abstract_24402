The privacy of personal information is an important issue affecting the
confidence of internet users. The widespread adoption of online social networks
and access to these platforms using mobile devices has encouraged developers to
make the systems and interfaces acceptable to users who seek privacy. The aim
of this study is to test a wizard that allows users to control the sharing of
personal information with others. We also assess the concerns of users in terms
of such sharing such as whether to hide personal data in current online social
network accounts. Survey results showed the wizard worked very well and that
females concealed more personal information than did males. In addition, most
users who were concerned about misuse of personal information hid those items.
The results can be used to upgrade current privacy systems or to design new
systems that work on mobile internet devices. The system can also be used to
save time when setting personal privacy settings and makes users more aware of
items that will be shared with others.
