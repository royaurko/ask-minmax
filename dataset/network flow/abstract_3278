The fluid dynamics video shows three-dimensional experimental and numerical
investigations of open channel flows in microgravity. The dynamic reorientation
of the free surface from 1g to 0g environment can be observed in a wedge-shaped
channel for subcritical and for supercritical flow rate with a collapse of the
interface. In addition three-dimensional computations determine important
characteristics of the flow, such as the free surface shape, the velocity
field, the dynamics of the reorientation and the flow rate depended collapse of
the free surface. The good agreement validates the capabilities of the
numerical solver.
