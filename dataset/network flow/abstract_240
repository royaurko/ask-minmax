One can use transsonic Bose-Einstein condensates of alkali atoms to establish
the laboratory analog of the event horizon and to measure the acoustic version
of Hawking radiation. We determine the conditions for supersonic flow and the
Hawking temperature for realistic condensates on waveguides where an external
potential plays the role of a supersonic nozzle. The transition to supersonic
speed occurs at the potential maximum and the Hawking temperature is entirely
determined by the curvature of the potential.
