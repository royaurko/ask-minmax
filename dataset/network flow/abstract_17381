Two dimensional N=(4,4) gauge theories flow to interacting superconformal
field theories on their Higgs branch. We examine worldsheet instantons in these
theories through the eyes of a D-brane construction. The effective instanton
partition function is shown to reveal an emergent background AdS_3 x S^3
geometry.
