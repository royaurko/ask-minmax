Explosive events are small transition region phenomena characterised by broad
non-Gaussian wings in their line profiles. Images from the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) give a first view of the plasma dynamics at the sites of
explosive events seen in O VI spectra of a region of quiet Sun, taken with the
ultraviolet spectrometer SUMER/SOHO. Distinct event bursts were seen either at
the junction of supergranular network cells or near emerging flux. Three are
described in the context of their surrounding transition region (304 A) and
coronal (171 A) activity. One showed plasma ejected from one footpoint of a
small loop which resulted in a `splash' at the other footpoint. The second was
related to flux cancellation, inferred from SDO/HMI magnetograms, and a coronal
dimming surrounded by a ring of bright EUV emission with explosive events at
positions where the spectrometer slit crossed the bright ring. The third series
of events occurred at the base of a slow mini-CME. All events studied here
imply jet-like flows probably triggered by magnetic reconnection at
supergranular junctions. Events come from sites close to the footpoints of jets
seen in AIA images, and possibly from the landing site of induced high velocity
flows. They are not caused by rapid rotation in spicules.
