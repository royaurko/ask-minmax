Communities play a crucial role to describe and analyse modern networks.
However, the size of those networks has grown tremendously with the increase of
computational power and data storage. While various methods have been developed
to extract community structures, their computational cost or the difficulty to
parallelize existing algorithms make partitioning real networks into
communities a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to alter an
efficient algorithm, the Louvain method, such that communities are defined as
the connected components of a tree-like assignment graph. Within this
framework, we precisely describe the different steps of our algorithm and
demonstrate its highly parallelizable nature. We then show that despite its
simplicity, our algorithm has a partitioning quality similar to the original
method on benchmark graphs and even outperforms other algorithms. We also show
that, even on a single processor, our method is much faster and allows the
analysis of very large networks.
