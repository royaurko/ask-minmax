Significant effort has been invested recently to accelerate handover
operations in a next generation mobile Internet. Corresponding works for
developing efficient mobile multicast management are emergent. Both problems
simultaneously expose routing complexity between subsequent points of
attachment as a characteristic parameter for handover performance in access
networks.
  As continuous mobility handovers necessarily occur between access routers
located in geographic vicinity, this paper investigates on the hypothesis that
geographically adjacent edge networks attain a reduced network distances as
compared to arbitrary Internet nodes. We therefore evaluate and analyze edge
distance distributions in various regions for clustered IP ranges on their
geographic location such as a city. We use traceroute to collect packet
forwarding path and round-trip-time of each intermediate node to scan-wise
derive an upper bound of the node distances. Results of different scanning
origins are compared to obtain the best estimation of network distance of each
pair. Our results are compared with corresponding analysis of CAIDA Skitter
data, overall leading to fairly stable, reproducible edge distance
distributions. As a first conclusion on expected impact on handover performance
measures, our results indicate a general optimum for handover anticipation time
in 802.11 networks of 25 ms.
