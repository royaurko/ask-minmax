We consider the flow of a viscous, incompressible, Newtonian fluid in a
perforated domain in the plane. The domain is the exterior of a regular lattice
of rigid particles. We study the simultaneous limit of vanishing particle size
and distance, and of vanishing viscosity. Under suitable conditions on the
particle size, particle distance, and viscosity, we prove that solutions of the
Navier-Stokes system in the perforated domain converges to solutions of the
Euler system, modeling inviscid, incompressible flow, in the full plane. That
is, the flow is not disturbed by the porous medium and becomes inviscid in the
limit. Convergence is obtained in the energy norm with explicit rates of
convergence.
