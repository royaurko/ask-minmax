This work develops Monte Carlo Euler adaptive time stepping methods for the
weak approximation problem of jump diffusion driven stochastic differential
equations. The main result is the derivation of a new expansion for the
omputational error, with computable leading order term in a posteriori form,
based on stochastic flows and discrete dual backward problems which extends the
results in [STZ]. These expansions lead to efficient and accurate computation
of error estimates. Adaptive algorithms for either stochastic time steps or
quasi-deterministic time steps are described. Numerical examples show the
performance of the proposed error approximation and of the described adaptive
time-stepping methods.
