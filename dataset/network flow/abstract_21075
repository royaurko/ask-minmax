Using an exact mapping transformation method, magnetic properties of a
spin-1/2 and spin-1 doubly decorated Ising-Heisenberg model are investigated in
detail. By assuming that both interaction parameters are ferromagnetic, we
found in addition to an usual ferromagnetic phase another two phases with a
nontrivial long-range order.
