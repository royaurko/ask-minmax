The large-scale circulation of planetary atmospheres like that of the Earth
is traditionally thought of in a dynamical framework. Here, we apply the
statistical mechanics theory of turbulent flows to a simplified model of the
global atmosphere, the quasi-geostrophic model, leading to non-trivial
equilibria. Depending on a few global parameters, the structure of the flow may
be either a solid-body rotation (zonal flow) or a dipole. A second order phase
transition occurs between these two phases, with associated spontaneous
symmetry-breaking in the dipole phase. This model allows us to go beyond the
general theory of marginal ensemble equivalence through the notion of Goldstone
modes.
