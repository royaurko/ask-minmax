Recent advances in nanoscale science and technology provide possibilities to
directly self-assemble and integrate functional circuit elements within the
wiring scheme of devices with potentially unique architectures. Electroionic
resistive switching circuits comprising highly interconnected fractal
electrodes and metal-insulator-metal interfaces, known as atomic switch
networks, have been fabricated using simple benchtop techniques including
solution-phase electroless deposition. These devices are shown to activate
through a bias-induced forming step that produces the frequency dependent,
nonlinear hysteretic switching expected for gapless-type atomic switches and
memristors. By eliminating the need for complex lithographic methods, such an
approach toward device fabrication provides a more accessible platform for the
study of ionic resistive switches and memristive systems.
