It is currently accepted that cortical maps are dynamic constructions that
are altered in response to external input. Experience-dependent structural
changes in cortical microcurcuts lead to changes of activity, i.e. to changes
in information encoded. Specific patterns of external stimulation can lead to
creation of new synaptic connections between neurons. The calcium influxes
controlled by neuronal activity regulate the processes of neurotrophic factors
released by neurons, growth cones movement and synapse differentiation in
developing neural systems. We propose a model for description and investigation
of the activity dependent development of neural networks. The dynamics of the
network parameters (activity, diffusion of axon guidance chemicals, growth cone
position) is described by a closed set of differential equations. The model
presented here describes the development of neural networks under the
assumption of activity dependent axon guidance molecules. Numerical simulation
shows that morpholess neurons compromise the development of cortical
connectivity.
