We discuss the present collective flow signals for the phase transition to
the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the collective flow as a barometer for the
equation of state (EoS). We emphasize the importance of the flow excitation
function from 1 to $50 A$ GeV: here the hydrodynamic model has predicted the
collapse of the $v_1$-flow at $\sim 10 A$ GeV and of the $v_2$-flow at $\sim 40
A$ GeV. In the latter case, this has recently been observed by the NA49
collaboration. Since hadronic rescattering models predict much larger flow than
observed at this energy, we interpret this observation as potential evidence
for a first order phase transition at high baryon density $\rho_B$.
