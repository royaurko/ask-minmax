Efficient resource discovery and availability improvement are very important
issues in unstructured P2P networks. In this paper, a bio-inspired resource
discovery scheme inspired by the principle of elephants migration is proposed.
A replication scheme based on Q-learning and erasure codes is also introduced.
Simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly increases query
success rate and availability, and reduces the network traffic as the resources
are effectively distributed to well-performing nodes.
