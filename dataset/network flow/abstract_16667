We obtain the first term in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expansion of
the capacity of fading networks where the transmitters and receivers--while
fully cognizant of the fading \emph{law}--have no access to the fading
\emph{realization}. This term is an integer multiple of $\log \log
\textnormal{SNR}$ with the coefficient having a simple combinatorial
characterization.
