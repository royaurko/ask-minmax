In this paper, optimum decomposition of belief networks is discussed. Some
methods of decomposition are examined and a new method - the method of Minimum
Total Number of States (MTNS) - is proposed. The problem of optimum belief
network decomposition under our framework, as under all the other frameworks,
is shown to be NP-hard. According to the computational complexity analysis, an
algorithm of belief network decomposition is proposed in (Wee, 1990a) based on
simulated annealing.
