We investigate the evolution of hydromagnetic perturbations in a small
section of accretion disks. It is known that molecular viscosity is negligible
in accretion disks. Hence, it has been argued that a mechanism, known as
Magnetorotational Instability (MRI), is responsible for transporting matter in
the presence of weak magnetic field. However, there are some shortcomings,
which question effectiveness of MRI. Now the question arises, whether other
hydromagnetic effects, e.g. transient growth (TG), can play important role to
bring nonlinearity in the system, even at weak magnetic fields. Otherwise,
whether MRI or TG, which is primarily responsible to reveal nonlinearity to
make the flow turbulent? Our results prove explicitly that the flows with high
Reynolds number (Re), which is the case of realistic astrophysical accretion
disks, exhibit nonlinearity by TG of perturbation modes faster than that by
modes producing MRI. For a fixed wave vector, MRI dominates over transient
effects, only at low Re, lower than its value expected to be in astrophysical
accretion disks, and low magnetic fields. This seriously questions (overall)
persuasiveness of MRI in astrophysical accretion disks.
