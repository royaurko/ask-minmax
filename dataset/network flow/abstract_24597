When a large collection of objects (e.g., robots, sensors, etc.) has to be
deployed in a given environment, it is often required to plan a coordinated
motion of the objects from their initial position to a final configuration
enjoying some global property. In such a scenario, the problem of minimizing
some function of the distance travelled, and therefore energy consumption, is
of vital importance. In this paper we study several motion planning problems
that arise when the objects must be moved on a graph, in order to reach certain
goals which are of interest for several network applications. Among the others,
these goals include broadcasting messages and forming connected or
interference-free networks. We study these problems with the aim of minimizing
a number of natural measures such as the average/overall distance travelled,
the maximum distance travelled, or the number of objects that need to be moved.
To this respect, we provide several approximability and inapproximability
results, most of which are tight.
