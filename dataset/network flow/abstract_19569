Within the class of stochastic cellular automata models of traffic flows, we
look at the velocity dependent randomization variant (VDR-TCA) whose parameters
take on a specific set of extreme values. These initial conditions lead us to
the discovery of the emergence of four distinct phases. Studying the
transitions between these phases, allows us to establish a rigorous
classification based on their tempo-spatial behavioral characteristics. As a
result from the system's complex dynamics, its flow-density relation exhibits a
non-concave region in which forward propagating density waves are encountered.
All four phases furthermore share the common property that moving vehicles can
never increase their speed once the system has settled into an equilibrium.
