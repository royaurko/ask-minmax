We present femtoscopic results for proton and Lambda correlation functions
measured by ALICE in sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions. Femtoscopic radii
are extracted from pp, pbarpbar, and ppbar pairs. Comparisons of these radii
with those from pion and kaon analyses reveal an approximate transverse mass
scaling that is consistent with explanations of radial flow. Inelastic final
state interactions are explored in baryon-antibaryon correlations functions to
investigate their relationship with reduced proton yields at LHC energies.
