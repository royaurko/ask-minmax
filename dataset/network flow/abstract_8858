Constructions of metrics with special holonomy by methods of exterior
differential systems are reviewed and the interpretations of these construction
as `flows' on hypersurface geometries are considered.
  It is shown that these hypersurface 'flows' are not generally well-posed for
smooth initial data and counterexamples to existence are constructed.
