We study the elastic properties of phantom networks of Gaussian and
nearly-Gaussian springs. We show that the stress tensor of a Gaussian network
coincides with the conductivity tensor of an equivalent resistor network, while
its elastic constants vanish. We use a perturbation theory to analyze the
elastic behavior of networks of slightly non-Gaussian springs. We show that the
elastic constants of phantom percolation networks of nearly-Gaussian springs
have a power low dependence on the distance of the system from the percolation
threshold, and derive bounds on the exponents.
