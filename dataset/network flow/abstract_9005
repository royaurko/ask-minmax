This paper surveys and unifies a number of recent contributions that have
collectively developed a metric for decentralized wireless network analysis
known as transmission capacity. Although it is notoriously difficult to derive
general end-to-end capacity results for multi-terminal or \adhoc networks, the
transmission capacity (TC) framework allows for quantification of achievable
single-hop rates by focusing on a simplified physical/MAC-layer model. By using
stochastic geometry to quantify the multi-user interference in the network, the
relationship between the optimal spatial density and success probability of
transmissions in the network can be determined, and expressed -- often fairly
simply -- in terms of the key network parameters. The basic model and
analytical tools are first discussed and applied to a simple network with path
loss only and we present tight upper and lower bounds on transmission capacity
(via lower and upper bounds on outage probability). We then introduce random
channels (fading/shadowing) and give TC and outage approximations for an
arbitrary channel distribution, as well as exact results for the special cases
of Rayleigh and Nakagami fading. We then apply these results to show how TC can
be used to better understand scheduling, power control, and the deployment of
multiple antennas in a decentralized network. The paper closes by discussing
shortcomings in the model as well as future research directions.
