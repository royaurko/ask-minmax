A new scheme for testing nuclear matter equations of state (EsoS) at high
densities using constraints from neutron star phenomenology and a flow data
analysis of heavy-ion collisions is suggested. An acceptable EoS shall not
allow the direct Urca process to occur in neutron stars with masses below
$1.5~M_{\odot}$, and also shall not contradict flow and kaon production data of
heavy-ion collisions. Compact star constraints include the mass measurements of
2.1 +/- 0.2 M_sun (1 sigma level) for PSR J0751+1807, of 2.0 +/- 0.1 M_sun from
the innermost stable circular orbit for 4U 1636-536, the baryon mass -
gravitational mass relationships from Pulsar B in J0737-3039 and the
mass-radius relationships from quasiperiodic brightness oscillations in 4U
0614+09 and from the thermal emission of RX J1856-3754. This scheme is applied
to a set of relativistic EsoS constrained otherwise from nuclear matter
saturation properties with the result that no EoS can satisfy all constraints
simultaneously, but those with density-dependent masses and coupling constants
appear most promising.
