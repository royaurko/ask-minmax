Forwarding decisions in classical IP-based networks are determined by
routing. This is necessary to avoid loops, inhibiting opportunities to
implement an adaptive and intelligent forwarding plane. Therefore content
distribution efficiency is reduced due to a lack of inherent multi-path
transmission. In Named Data Networking (NDN) instead, routing shall hold a
supporting role to forwarding, providing sufficient potential to enhance
content dissemination at the forwarding plane. In this paper we design,
implement, and evaluate a novel probability-based forwarding strategy, called
Stochastic Adaptive Forwarding (SAF) for NDN. By extensive simulations we show
that our approach outperforms existing forwarding strategies in terms of the
request satisfaction ratio. This is achieved by extensive utilization of NDN's
multipath and content-lookup capabilities without relying on the routing plane.
SAF explores the local environment by redirecting requests that are likely to
be dropped. This allows to identify new paths to the content origin or cached
replicas to circumvent link failures and resource shortages.
