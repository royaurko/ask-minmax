We prove that the curvature flow of an embedded planar network of three
curves connected through a triple junction, with fixed endpoints on the
boundary of a given strictly convex domain, exists smooth until the lengths of
the three curves stay far from zero. If this is the case for all times, then
the evolution exists for all times and the network converges to the Steiner
minimal connection between the three endpoints.
