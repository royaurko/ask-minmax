Multihop ad hoc wireless networks consist of mobile nodes that communicate
with each other without any fixed infrastructure. The nodes in these networks
are power constrained, since they operate in limited battery energy.
Cooperative caching is an attractive solution for reducing network traffic and
bandwidth demands in mobile ad hoc networks. Deploying caches in mobile nodes
can reduce the overall traffic considerably.
  Cache hits eliminate the need to contact the data source frequently, which
avoids additional network overhead. In this paper we propose a cache discovery
policy for cooperative caching, which reduces the power usage, caching overhead
and delay. This is done by power control and transmission range adjustment. A
cache discovery process based on position coordinates of neighboring nodes is
developed for this. The simulation results gives a promising result based on
the metrics of studies.
