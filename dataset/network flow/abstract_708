The complex configurations of dynamic friction patterns-regarding real time
contact areas- are transformed into appropriate networks. With this
transformation of a system to network space, many properties can be inferred
about the structure and dynamics of the system. Here, we analyze the dynamics
of static friction, i.e. nucleation processes, with respect to "friction
networks". We show that networks can successfully capture the crack-like shear
ruptures and possible corresponding acoustic features. We found that the
fraction of triangles remarkably scales with the detachment fronts. There is a
universal power law between nodes' degree and motifs frequency (for triangles,
it reads T(k)\proptok{\beta} ({\beta} \approx2\pm0.4)). We confirmed the
obtained universality in aperture-based friction networks. Based on the
achieved results, we extracted a possible friction law in terms of network
parameters and compared it with the rate and state friction laws. In
particular, the evolutions of loops are scaled with power law, indicating the
aggregation of cycles around hub nodes. Also, the transition to slow rupture is
scaled with the fast variation of local heterogeneity. Furthermore, the motif
distributions and modularity space of networks -in terms of withinmodule degree
and participation coefficient-show non-uniform general trends, indicating a
universal aspect of energy flow in shear ruptures.
