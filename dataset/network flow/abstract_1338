Constitutive equations are developed for a polymer fluid, which is treated as
a permanent network of strands bridged by junctions. The junctions are assumed
to slide with respect to their reference positions under loading. Governing
equations are derived by using the laws of thermodynamics under the assumption
that the vorticity tensor for the flow of junctions is proportional to that for
macro-deformation. Explicit expressions are developed for the steady
elongational viscosity, as well as for the steady shear viscosity and normal
stress functions. To verify the constitutive relations, three sets of
experimental data are approximated on polystyrene solutions with various
molecular weights. It is demonstrated that the model can correctly describe
stress overshoot for the shear stress and first normal stress difference in
start-up tests with various strain rates. Adjustable parameters in the
governing equations change consistently with the strain rate, molecular weight
and concentration of entanglements. To validate the constitutive equations,
observations on low-density polyethylene melt in uniaxial extensional flow are
compared with the results of numerical analysis when the material constants are
found by matching experimental data in shear tests.
