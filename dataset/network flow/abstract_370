We introduce an optimum principle for a vehicular traffic network with road
bottlenecks. This network breakdown minimization (BM) principle states that the
network optimum is reached, when link flow rates are assigned in the network in
such a way that the probability for spontaneous occurrence of traffic breakdown
at one of the network bottlenecks during a given observation time reaches the
minimum possible value. Based on numerical simulations with a stochastic
three-phase traffic flow model, we show that in comparison to the well-known
Wardrop's principles the application of the BM principle permits considerably
greater network inflow rates at which no traffic breakdown occurs and,
therefore, free flow remains in the whole network.
