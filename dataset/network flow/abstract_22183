This is a fluid dynamics video submitted to the Gallery of Fluid Motion of
the 63rd Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Fluid
Dynamics.
  We examine the Landau-Levich flow of a suspension of neutrally buoyant
particles within a rotating glass cylinder. This differs from previously
investigated systems in that we deal with macroscopic particles which
immediately exceed the thickness of the deposited liquid film. Thus, the
presence of particles on the liquid-coated wall creates excess surface area,
leading to a capillary attraction between particles. In turn, this capillary
attraction induces phase separation of the suspension coating into regions of
either dense particle clustering or clear liquid.
