Type I X-ray Bursts (XRBs) are thermonuclear explosions of accreted material
on the surfaces of a neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries. Prior to the
ignition of a subsonic burning front, runaway burning at the base of the
accreted layer drives convection that mixes fuel and heavy-element ashes. In
this second paper in a series, we explore the behavior of this low Mach number
convection in mixed hydrogen/helium layers on the surface of a neutron star
using two-dimensional simulations with the Maestro code. Maestro takes
advantage of the highly subsonic flow field by filtering dynamically
unimportant sound waves while retaining local compressibility effects, such as
those due to stratification and energy release from nuclear reactions. In these
preliminary calculations, we find that the rp-process approximate network
creates a convective region that is split into two layers. While this splitting
appears artificial due to the approximations of the network regarding nuclear
flow out of the breakout reaction 18Ne(a,p)21Na, these calculations hint at
further simplifications and improvements of the burning treatment for use in
subsequent calculations in three dimensions for a future paper.
