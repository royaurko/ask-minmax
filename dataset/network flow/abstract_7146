The Holomorphic Embedding Load-Flow Method (HELM) was recently introduced as
a novel technique to constructively solve the power-flow equations in power
grids, based on advanced complex analysis. In this paper, the theoretical
foundations of the method are established in detail. Starting from a
fundamental projective invariance of the power-flow equations, it is shown how
to devise holomorphicity-preserving embeddings that ultimately allow regarding
the power-flow problem as essentially a study in algebraic curves.
Complementing this algebraic-geometric viewpoint, which lays the foundation of
the method, it is shown how to apply standard analytic techniques (power
series) for practical computation. Stahl's theorem on the maximality of the
analytic continuation provided by Pad\'e approximants then ensures the
completeness of the method. On the other hand, it is shown how to extend the
method to accommodate smooth controls, such as the ubiquitous
generator-controlled PV bus.
