The LCO/Palomar 10,000 km/sec (LP10K) Tully-Fisher (TF) data set is used to
test for bulk streaming motions on a ~150 Mpc scale. The sample consists of 172
cluster galaxies in the original target range of the survey, 9000-13,000
km/sec, plus an additional 72 galaxies with cz < 30,000 km/sec. A
maximum-likelihood analysis that is insensitive to Malmquist and selection bias
effects is used to constrain the bulk velocity parameters, and realistic
Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out to correct residual biases and
determine statistical errors. When the analysis is restricted to the original
target range, the bias-corrected bulk flow is v_B=720 +/- 280 km/sec toward
l=266, b=19. When all objects out to z=0.1 are included the result is virtually
unchanged, v_B=700 +/- 250 km/sec toward l=272, b=10. The hypothesis that the
Hubble flow has converged to the CMB frame at distances less than ~ 100 Mpc is
ruled out at the 97% confidence level. The data are inconsistent with the flow
vector found by Lauer & Postman. However, the LP10K bulk flow is consistent
with that obtained from the SMAC survey of elliptical galaxies recently
described by Hudson et al. If correct, the LP10K results indicate that the
convergence depth for the Hubble flow is >~ 150 Mpc.
