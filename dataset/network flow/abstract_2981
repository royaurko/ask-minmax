Employing XMM-Newton EPIC data we perform a detailed comparison between
different spectral models to test whether the gas in cooling-flows is
multi-phase or not. Our findings all point in the same direction, namely that
gas in cooling-flows does not show the wide distribution of temperatures
expected from standard multi-phase models. This result has profound
implications for cooling-flow models. Firstly, the large absorption column
depths inferred by previous analysis of cooling-flow spectra are most likely an
artifact following from the application of an incorrect spectral model to the
data. Secondly, the mass deposition and mass flow are likely to be much smaller
than previously thought. Last, but perhaps not least, the term "cooling-flow"
cluster is probably no longer appropriate, as it describes a phenomenon of
smaller entity and impact than previously thought. We propose to substitute it
with that of "cool-core" cluster. The latter definition is less ambitious than
the first, as it reflects only an observational fact rather than an inferred
physical property, the flow, but has the undeniable advantage of being firmer.
