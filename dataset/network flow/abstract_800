While many classical traffic models treat the spatial extension of streets
continuously or by discretization into cells of a certain length, we will
subdivide roads into comparatively long homogeneous road sections of constant
capacity with an inhomogeneity at the end. The related model is simple and
numerically efficient. It is inspired by models of dynamic queueing networks
and takes into account essential features of traffic flows. Instead of treating
single vehicles or velocity profiles, it focusses on flows at specific cross
sections and average travel times of vehicles.
