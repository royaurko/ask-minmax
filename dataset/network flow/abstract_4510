In this paper we introduce algorithms for the construction of scale-free
networks and for clustering around the nerve centers, nodes with a high
connectivity in a scale-free networks. We argue that such overlay networks
could support self-organization in a complex system like a cloud computing
infrastructure and allow the implementation of optimal resource management
policies.
