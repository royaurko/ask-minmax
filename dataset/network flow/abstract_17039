The problem of missing link prediction in complex networks has attracted much
attention recently. Two difficulties in link prediction are the sparsity and
huge size of the target networks. Therefore, the design of an efficient and
effective method is of both theoretical interests and practical significance.
In this Letter, we proposed a method based on local random walk, which can give
competitively good prediction or even better prediction than other
random-walk-based methods while has a lower computational complexity.
