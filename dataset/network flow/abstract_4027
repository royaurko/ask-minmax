This article studies the mean curvature flow of Lagrangian submanifolds. In
particular, we prove the following global existence and convergence theorem: if
the potential function of a Lagrangian graph in
 T^{2n} is convex, then the flow exists for all time and converges smoothly to
a flat Lagrangian submanifold.
