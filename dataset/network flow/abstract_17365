This paper is devoted to the construction of a family of linear sigma models
with $(0,4)$ supersymmetry which should flow in the infrared to the stringy
version of Yang-Mills instantons on ${\bf R}^4$. The family depends on the full
set of expected parameters and is obtained by using the data that appear in the
ADHM construction of instantons.
