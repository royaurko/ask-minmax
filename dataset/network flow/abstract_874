Cooperative decision making is a vision of future network management and
control. Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes
can make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic
flows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are
spatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network.
Hence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how
accurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes.
Connection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is
optimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is
computationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work
investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows
to preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop,
based on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed
algorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal
preemption decisions. We study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and
complexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the
distributed algorithm. The algorithm is validated by both analysis and
simulation.
