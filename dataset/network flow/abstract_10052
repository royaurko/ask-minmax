We present a concept and test results of an eddy-current flowmeter for liquid
metals. The flow rate is determined by applying a weak ac magnetic field to a
liquid metal flow and measuring the flow-induced phase disturbance in the
external electromagnetic field. The phase disturbance is found to be more
robust than that of the amplitude used in conventional eddy-current flowmeters.
The basic characteristics of this type of flowmeter are analysed using simple
theoretical models, where the flow is approximated by a solid body motion.
Design of such a flowmeter is presented and its test results reported.
