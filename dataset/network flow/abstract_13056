Contrary to the classical wisdom, processes with independent values (defined
properly) are much more diverse than white noise combined with Poisson point
processes, and product systems are much more diverse than Fock spaces.
  This text is a survey of recent progress in constructing and investigating
nonclassical stochastic flows and continuous products of probability spaces and
Hilbert spaces.
