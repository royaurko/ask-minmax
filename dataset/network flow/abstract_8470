We consider in-network computation of MAX in a structure-free random multihop
wireless network. Nodes do not know their relative or absolute locations and
use the Aloha MAC protocol. For one-shot computation, we describe a protocol in
which the MAX value becomes available at the origin in $O(\sqrt{n/\log n})$
slots with high probability. This is within a constant factor of that required
by the best coordinated protocol. A minimal structure (knowledge of
hop-distance from the sink) is imposed on the network and with this structure,
we describe a protocol for pipelined computation of MAX that achieves a rate of
$\Omega(1/(\log^2 n)).$
