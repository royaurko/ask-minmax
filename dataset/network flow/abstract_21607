So far all known singularity-free cosmological models are cylindrically
symmetric. Here we present a new family of spherically symmetric non-singular
models filled with imperfect fluid and radial heat flow, and satisfying the
weak and strong energy conditions. For large $t$ anisotropy in pressure and
heat flux tend to vanish leading to a perfect fluid. There is a free function
of time in the model, which can be suitably chosen for non-singular behaviour
and there exist multiplicity of such choices.
