We consider the localization problem of multiple wideband sources in a
multi-path environment by coherently taking into account the attenuation
characteristics and the time delays in the reception of the signal. Our
proposed method leaves the space for unavailability of an accurate signal
attenuation model in the environment by considering the model as an unknown
function with reasonable prior assumptions about its functional space. Such
approach is capable of enhancing the localization performance compared to only
utilizing the signal attenuation information or the time delays. In this paper,
the localization problem is modeled as a cost function in terms of the source
locations, attenuation model parameters and the multi-path parameters. To
globally perform the minimization, we propose a hybrid algorithm combining the
differential evolution algorithm with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
Besides the proposed combination of optimization schemes, supporting the
technical details such as closed forms of cost function sensitivity matrices
are provided. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is examined in
several localization scenarios, taking into account the noise in the
environment, the multi-path phenomenon and considering the sensors not being
synchronized.
