Applying a new method of rescattering which is based on the neural network
technique we study the influence of rescattering on the spectra of strange
particles produced in heavy ion reactions. In contradistinction to former
approaches the rescattering is done explicitly and not in a perturbative
fashion. We present a comparison of our calculations for the system
Ni(1.93AGeV)+Ni with recent data of the FOPI collaboration. We find that even
for this small system rescattering changes the observables considerably but
does not invalidate the role of the kaons as a messenger from the high density
zone. We cannot confirm the conjecture that the kaon flow can be of use for the
determination of the optical potential of the kaon.
