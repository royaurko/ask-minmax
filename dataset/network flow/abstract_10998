All crucial features of the recently observed real-world weighted networks
are obtained in a model where the weight of a link is defined with a single
non-linear parameter $\alpha$ as $w_{ij}=(s_is_j)^\alpha$, $s_i$ and $s_j$ are
the strengths of two end nodes of the link and $\alpha$ is a continuously
tunable positive parameter. In addition the definition of strength as $s_i=
\Sigma_j w_{ij}$ results a self-organizing link weight dynamics leading to a
self-consistent distribution of strengths and weights on the network. Using the
Barab\'asi-Albert growth dynamics all exponents of the weighted networks which
are continuously tunable with $\alpha$ are obtained. It is conjectured that the
weight distribution should be similar in any scale-free network.
