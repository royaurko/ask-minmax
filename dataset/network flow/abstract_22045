The effect of helicity (velocity-vorticity correlations) is studied in direct
numerical simulations of rotating turbulence down to Rossby numbers of 0.02.
The results suggest that the presence of net helicity plays an important role
in the dynamics of the flow. In particular, at small Rossby number, the energy
cascades to large scales, as expected, but helicity then can dominate the
cascade to small scales. A phenomenological interpretation in terms of a direct
cascade of helicity slowed down by wave-eddy interactions leads to the
prediction of new inertial indices for the small-scale energy and helicity
spectra.
