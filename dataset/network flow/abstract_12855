We investigate the accretion flows onto the supermassive binary black holes
(SMBBHs) from the circumbinary disk with the equal mass, eccentric binary on
the subparsec scale, using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find
that the material can be supplied from circumbinary disk, which leads to the
formation of two accretion disks around the SMBBHs. The mass accretion rates
significantly modulate with the binary orbital motion. These could provide the
observable diagnosis of the existence of the supermassive binary black holes
(e.g. OJ287) on the subparsec scale in merged galactic nuclei.
