We report experiments on the overall phase diagram of granular flows on an
incline with emphasis on high inclination angles where the mean layer velocity
approaches the terminal velocity of a single particle free falling in air. The
granular flow was characterized by measurements of the surface velocity, the
average layer height, and the mean density of the layer as functions of the
hopper opening, the plane inclination angle and the downstream distance x of
the flow. At high inclination angles the flow does not reach an x-invariant
steady state over the length of the inclined plane. For low volume flow rates,
a transition was detected between dense and very dilute (gas) flow regimes. We
show using a vacuum flow channel that air did not qualitatively change the
phase diagram and did not quantitatively modify mean flow velocities of the
granular layer except for small changes in the very dilute gas-like phase.
