In this paper we study the chain control sets of right-invariant control
systems on the flag manifolds of a non-compact semisimple Lie group. We prove
that each chain control set is partially (skew-) hyperbolic over the associated
control flow. Moreover, we characterize those chain control sets that are
uniformly (skew-) hyperbolic in terms of the flag type of the control flow.
