We study the time evolution and driven motion of thin liquid films lying on
top of chemical patterns on a substrate. Lattice-Boltzmann and molecular
dynamics methods are used for simulations of the flow of microscopic and
nanoscopic films, respectively. Minimization of fluid surface area is used to
examine the corresponding equilibrium free energy landscapes. The focus is on
motion across patterns containing diverging and converging flow junctions, with
an eye towards applications to lab-on-a-chip devices. Both open liquid-vapor
systems driven by body forces and confined liquid-liquid systems driven by
boundary motion are considered. As in earlier studies of flow on a linear
chemical channel, we observe continuous motion of a connected liquid film
across repeated copies of the pattern, despite the appearance of pearling
instabilities of the interface. Provided that the strength of the driving force
and the volume of liquid are not too large, the liquid is confined to the
chemical channels and its motion can be directed by small variations in the
geometry of the pattern.
