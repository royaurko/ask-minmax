An effect of a mean velocity shear on a turbulence and on the effective force
which is determined by the gradient of Reynolds stresses is studied. Generation
of a mean vorticity in a homogeneous incompressible turbulent flow with an
imposed mean velocity shear due to an excitation of a large-scale instability
is found. The instability is caused by a combined effect of the large-scale
shear motions (''skew-induced" deflection of equilibrium mean vorticity) and
''Reynolds stress-induced" generation of perturbations of mean vorticity.
Spatial characteristics, such as the minimum size of the growing perturbations
and the size of perturbations with the maximum growth rate, are determined.
This instability and the dynamics of the mean vorticity are associated with the
Prandtl's turbulent secondary flows. This instability is similar to the
mean-field magnetic dynamo instability. Astrophysical applications of the
obtained results are discussed.
