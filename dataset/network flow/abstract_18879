Patterns of topological arrangement are widely used for both animal and human
brains in the learning process. Nevertheless, automatic learning techniques
frequently overlook these patterns. In this paper, we apply a learning
technique based on the structural organization of the data in the attribute
space to the problem of discriminating the senses of 10 polysemous words. Using
two types of characterization of meanings, namely semantical and topological
approaches, we have observed significative accuracy rates in identifying the
suitable meanings in both techniques. Most importantly, we have found that the
characterization based on the deterministic tourist walk improves the
disambiguation process when one compares with the discrimination achieved with
traditional complex networks measurements such as assortativity and clustering
coefficient. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such deterministic
walk has been applied to such a kind of problem. Therefore, our finding
suggests that the tourist walk characterization may be useful in other related
applications.
