The inclusive one- and two-jet cross-sections are measured in collisions of
quasi-real photons at e+e- centre-of-mass energies of 130 and 136 GeV using the
OPAL detector at LEP. Jets are reconstructed with a cone jet finding algorithm.
The jet cross-sections are compared to next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative
QCD calculations. Transverse energy flows in jets are studied separately for
direct and resolved two-photon events.
