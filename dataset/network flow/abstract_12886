We study Umklapp couplings and their renormalisation group flow for electrons
in a two dimensional lattice. It is shown that the effective low energy
Hamiltonian involves not only forward scattering, but also considerable
nonforward umklapp scattering, when the electrons fill a substantial fraction
of the valence band. The behaviour of these couplings under renormalisation
group is studied. It is shown that they remain marginal. We conclude with the
possible consequences of this on properties of such electronic systems and
their Fermi liquid theory.
