Cool gas should be present in galaxy clusters due to stripping of galactic
gas, infall onto the cluster, and from cooling flows. We searched for this gas
through resonance absorption line observations from low-ionization metal line
gas toward six background quasars. Both cooling flow and non-cooling flow
clusters were observed, with lines of sight from the inner to outer parts of
the cluster (0.2 <= r_proj/R_cluster <= 0.7). The HST/FOS spectra failed to
detect Fe II or Mg II absorption at the cluster redshift, with 1-sigma upper
limits on the ion column densities of N <= 10^12 - 10^13 cm^-2. The failure to
detect absorption lines implies that the cool cluster gas either is more highly
ionized or it has a low covering factor.
