Adaptive-network models are typically studied using deterministic
differential equations which approximately describe their dynamics. In
simulations, however, the discrete nature of the network gives rise to
intrinsic noise which can radically alter the system's behaviour. In this
article we develop a method to predict the effects of stochasticity in adaptive
networks by making use of a pair-based proxy model. The technique is developed
in the context of an epidemiological model of a disease spreading over an
adaptive network of infectious contact. Our analysis reveals that in this model
the structure of the network exhibits stochastic oscillations in response to
fluctuations in the disease dynamic.
