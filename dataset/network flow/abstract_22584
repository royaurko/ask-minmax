We consider a boundary value problem for the system of equations describing
the stationary motion of a viscous nonhomogeneous asymmetric fluid in a bounded
planar domain having a $C^2$ boundary. We use a stream-function formulation
after the manner of N. N. Frolov [Math. Notes, \textbf{53}(5-6), 650--656,
1993] in which the fluid density depends on the stream-function by means of
another function determined by the boundary conditions. This allows for
dropping some of the equations, most notably the continuity equation. With a
fixed point argument we show the existence of solutions to the resulting
system.
