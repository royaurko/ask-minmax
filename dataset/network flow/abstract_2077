Mathematical programming is a branch of applied mathematics and has recently
been used to derive new decoding approaches, challenging established but often
heuristic algorithms based on iterative message passing. Concepts from
mathematical programming used in the context of decoding include linear,
integer, and nonlinear programming, network flows, notions of duality as well
as matroid and polyhedral theory. This survey article reviews and categorizes
decoding methods based on mathematical programming approaches for binary linear
codes over binary-input memoryless symmetric channels.
