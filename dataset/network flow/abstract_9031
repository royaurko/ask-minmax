One of the fundamental data transmission mechanisms in Ethernet LAN is
broadcasting. Flooding is a direct broadcasting technique used in these
networks. A significant drawback of this method is that it can lead to
broadcast storms. This phenomenon is more common in multivendor switch
environment. Broadcast storms usually results in dissension, collision and
redundancy leading to degradation of the network performance. Most of the
storms appear without much warning and it affects the efficiency of network
even in situations when the network is expected to work most efficiently. There
are several characteristic patterns by which storm can appear in a LAN, like
rate monotonic repetition, transient appearances with different types of growth
properties and decay profiles. In this paper we discuss the storm build up
pattern in an industry and present various reasons for storm in LAN. We have
identified a strategy for controlling network storms, using multiple static
agents. These agents inhibit storm packet regeneration in the network using the
knowledge of storm growth pattern. A model developed out of empirical studies
is used to differentiate normal packet growth from storm packet growth and used
in control mechanism of storms.
