Within the AMPT Monte Carlo model, hot spots in the initial transverse parton
density are shown to lead to harmonic flows which all contribute to dihadron
azimuthal correlation. The net back-to-back dihadron correlation after
subtraction of harmonic flows still has a double-peak that is independent of
the initial geometric triangularity at a fixed impact-parameter and unique to
the structure of jet-induced Mach cone and expanding hot spots dragged by
radial flow. The longitudinal structure of hot spots also leads to a near-side
ridge in dihadron correlation with a large rapidity gap. By successively
randomizing the azimuthal angle of the transverse momenta and positions of
initial partons, one can isolate the effects of jet-induced medium excitation
and expanding hot spots on the dihadron azimuthal correlation with both small
and large rapidity gap. The double-peak in the net dihadron correlation is
quantitatively different from that in $\gamma$-hadron that is free of the
contributions from harmonic flow and hot spots and caused only by jet-induced
Mach cone.
