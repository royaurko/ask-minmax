The retrieval abilities of spatially uniform attractor networks can be
measured by the average overlap between patterns and neural states. We found
that metric networks, with local connections, however, can carry information
structured in blocks without any global overlap. and blocks attractors. We
propose a way to measure the block information, related to the fluctuation of
the overlap. The phase-diagram with the transition from local to global
information, shows that the stability of blocks grows with dilution, but
decreases with the storage rate and disappears for random topologies.
