Recent work on exact renormalization group flow equations has pointed out the
possibility to study critical phenomena in continuous dimension D of space. In
an investigation of the O(N) model the dimension N of the fields may be seen as
a continuous parameter as well. One may conjecture that a variation of D or N
in the vicinity of a second order phase transition yields the same critical
exponents as a variation of the temperature. A numerical computation confirms
this.
