The goal of this paper is to unify the lookdown representation and the
stochastic flow of bridges, which are two approaches to construct the
$\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot process along with its genealogy. First we introduce the
stochastic flow of partitions and show that it provides a new formulation of
the lookdown representation. Second we study the asymptotic behaviour of the
$\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot process and we provide sufficient conditions for the
existence of an infinite sequence of Eves that generalise the primitive Eve of
Bertoin and Le Gall. Finally under the condition that this infinite sequence of
Eves does exist, we construct the lookdown representation pathwise from a flow
of bridges.
