The problem of efficiently delivering data within networks is very important
nowadays, especially in the context of the large volumes of data which are
being produced each year and of the increased data access needs of the users.
Efficient data delivery strategies must satisfy several types of Quality of
Service (QoS) constraints which are imposed by the data consumers. One
possibility of achieving this goal (particularly in the case of in-order data
transfers) is to choose a satisfactory network delivery path. In this paper we
present novel algorithmic approaches for computing optimal network paths which
satisfy several types of (QoS) constraints.
