In this paper, we consider the problem of remote vector Gaussian source
coding for a wireless acoustic sensor network. Each node receives messages from
multiple nodes in the network and decodes these messages using its own
measurement of the sound field as side information. The node's measurement and
the estimates of the source resulting from decoding the received messages are
then jointly encoded and transmitted to a neighboring node in the network. We
show that for this distributed source coding scenario, one can encode a
so-called conditional sufficient statistic of the sources instead of jointly
encoding multiple sources. We focus on the case where node measurements are in
form of noisy linearly mixed combinations of the sources and the acoustic
channel mixing matrices are invertible. For this problem, we derive the
rate-distortion function for vector Gaussian sources and under covariance
distortion constraints.
