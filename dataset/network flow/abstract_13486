A new method for solving relativistic ideal hydrodynamics in (1+3)D is
developed. Longitudinal and transverse radial flows are explicitly embedded and
the hydrodynamic equations are reduced to a single equation for the transverse
velocity field only, which is much more tractable. As an application we use the
method to find analytically all possible solutions with power dependence on
proper time and transverse radius. Possible application to the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collisions and possible generalizations of the method are discussed.
