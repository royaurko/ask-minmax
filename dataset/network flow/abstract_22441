We study the well-posedness of the Hele-Shaw-Cahn-Hilliard system modeling
binary fluid flow in porous media with arbitrary viscosity contrast but matched
density between the components. For initial data in $H^s, s>\frac{d}{2}+1$, the
existence and uniqueness of solution in $C([0, T]; H^s)\cap L^2(0, T; H^{s+2})$
that is global in time in the two dimensional case ($d=2$) and local in time in
the three dimensional case ($d=3$) are established. Several blow-up criterions
in the three dimensional case are provided as well. One of the tools that we
utilized is the Littlewood-Paley theory in order to establish certain key
commutator estimates.
