In this paper, the problem of distributed detection in tree networks in the
presence of Byzantines is considered. Closed form expressions for optimal
attacking strategies that minimize the miss detection error exponent at the
fusion center (FC) are obtained. We also look at the problem from the network
designer's (FC's) perspective. We study the problem of designing optimal
distributed detection parameters in a tree network in the presence of
Byzantines. Next, we model the strategic interaction between the FC and the
attacker as a Leader-Follower (Stackelberg) game. This formulation provides a
methodology for predicting attacker and defender (FC) equilibrium strategies,
which can be used to implement the optimal detector. Finally, a reputation
based scheme to identify Byzantines is proposed and its performance is
analytically evaluated. We also provide some numerical examples to gain
insights into the solution.
