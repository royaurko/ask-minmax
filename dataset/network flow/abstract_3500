We investigate two quantities of interest in a delay-tolerant mobile ad hoc
network: the network capacity region and the minimum energy function. The
network capacity region is defined as the set of all input rates that the
network can stably support considering all possible scheduling and routing
algorithms. Given any input rate vector in this region, the minimum energy
function establishes the minimum time average power required to support it. In
this work, we consider a cell-partitioned model of a delay-tolerant mobile ad
hoc network with general Markovian mobility. This simple model incorporates the
essential features of locality of wireless transmissions as well as node
mobility and enables us to exactly compute the corresponding network capacity
and minimum energy function. Further, we propose simple schemes that offer
performance guarantees that are arbitrarily close to these bounds at the cost
of an increased delay.
