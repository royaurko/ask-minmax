We investigate the properties of free bosons hopping on a star-comb network,
discussing the single-particle spectrum and the main thermodynamic equilibrium
properties: Bose-Einstein critical temperature, fraction of condensate, and
spatial boson distribution. We find an enhancement of the critical temperature
with respect to other inhomogeneous networks.
