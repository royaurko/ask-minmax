We present a framework for the analysis of transport processes resulting from
the mean-eddy interaction in a flow. The framework is based on the {\bf
T}ransport {\bf I}nduced by the {\bf M}ean-{\bf E}ddy {\bf I}nteraction (TIME)
method presented in a companion paper \cite{ide_wiggins_pd06a}. The TIME method
estimates the (Lagrangian) transport across stationary (Eulerian) boundaries
defined by chosen streamlines of the mean flow. Our framework proceeds after
first carrying out a sequence of preparatory steps that link the flow dynamics
to the transport processes. This includes the construction of the so-called
"instantaneous flux" as the Hovm\"{o}ller diagram. Transport processes are
studied by linking the signals of the instantaneous flux field to the dynamical
variability of the flow. This linkage also reveals how the variability of the
flow contributes to the transport. The spatio-temporal analysis of the flux
diagram can be used to assess the efficiency of the variability in transport
processes. We apply the method to the double-gyre ocean circulation model in
the situation where the Rossby-wave mode dominates the dynamic variability. The
spatio-temporal analysis shows that the inter-gyre transport is controlled by
the circulating eddy vortices in the fast eastward jet region, whereas the
basin-scale Rossby waves have very little impact.
