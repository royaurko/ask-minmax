Phylogenetic inference aims at reconstructing the evolutionary relationships
of different species given some data (e.g. DNA, RNA or proteins).
Traditionally, the relationships between species were assumed to be treelike,
so the most frequently used phylogenetic inference methods like e.g. Maximum
Parsimony or Maximum Likelihood were originally introduced to reconstruct
phylogenetic trees. However, it has been well-known that some evolutionary
events like hybridization or horizontal gene transfer cannot be represented by
a tree but rather require a phylogenetic network. Therefore, current research
seeks to adapt tree inference methods to networks. In the present paper, we
analyze Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood on networks for various
network definitions which have recently been introduced, and we investigate the
well-known Tuffley and Steel equivalence result concerning these methods under
the setting of a phylogenetic network.
