Properly locating sensor nodes is an important building block for a large
subset of wireless sensor networks (WSN) applications. As a result, the
performance of the WSN degrades significantly when misbehaving nodes report
false location and distance information in order to fake their actual location.
In this paper we propose a general distributed deterministic protocol for
accurate identification of faking sensors in a WSN. Our scheme does \emph{not}
rely on a subset of \emph{trusted} nodes that are not allowed to misbehave and
are known to every node in the network. Thus, any subset of nodes is allowed to
try faking its position. As in previous approaches, our protocol is based on
distance evaluation techniques developed for WSN. On the positive side, we show
that when the received signal strength (RSS) technique is used, our protocol
handles at most $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor-2$ faking sensors. Also, when the
time of flight (ToF) technique is used, our protocol manages at most $\lfloor
\frac{n}{2} \rfloor - 3$ misbehaving sensors. On the negative side, we prove
that no deterministic protocol can identify faking sensors if their number is
$\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil -1$. Thus our scheme is almost optimal with respect
to the number of faking sensors. We discuss application of our technique in the
trusted sensor model. More precisely our results can be used to minimize the
number of trusted sensors that are needed to defeat faking ones.
