Numerical investigation of the effects of junction geometry on the
performance of the flux-flow type Josephson oscillator has been done. Using
direct simulation of the sine-Gordon equation with account of RC load the
spectral and power properties for different current density distributions have
been calculated. With discussion of the fundamental differences in the dynamics
of the inline and overlap junctions the various behavior depending on the
junction length and noise intensity has been shown.
