Interaction between users in online social networks plays a key role in
social network analysis. One on important types of social group is full
connected relation between some users, which known as clique structure.
Therefore finding a maximum clique is essential for some analysis. In this
paper, we proposed a new method using ant colony optimization algorithm and
particle swarm optimization algorithm. In the proposed method, in order to
attain better results, it is improved process of pheromone update by particle
swarm optimization. Simulation results on popular standard social network
benchmarks in comparison standard ant colony optimization algorithm are shown a
relative enhancement of proposed algorithm.
