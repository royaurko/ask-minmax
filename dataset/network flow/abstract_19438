We investigate the extent to which correlated distortions of the luminosity
distance-redshift relation due to large-scale bulk flows limit the precision
with which cosmological parameters can be measured. In particular, peculiar
velocities of type 1a supernovae at low redshifts may prevent a sufficient
calibration of the Hubble diagram necessary to measure the dark energy equation
of state to better than 10%, and diminish the resolution of the equation of
state time-derivative projected for planned surveys. We consider similar
distortions of the angular-diameter distance, as well as the Hubble constant.
We show that the measurement of correlations in the large-scale bulk flow at
low redshifts using these distance indicators may be possible with a cumulative
signal-to-noise ratio of order 7 in a survey of 300 type 1a supernovae spread
over 20,000 square degrees.
