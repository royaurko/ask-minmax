The formation of zonal flows and vortices in the generalized
Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equation is studied. We focus on the regime when the size
of structures is comparable to or larger than the deformation (Rossby) radius.
Numerical simulations show the formation of anticyclonic vortices in unstable
shear flows and ring-like vortices with quiescent cores and vorticity
concentrated in a ring. Physical mechanisms that lead to these phenomena and
their relevance to turbulence in planetary atmospheres are discussed.
