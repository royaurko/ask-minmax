A photoacoustic (PA) sensor based on higher order acoustic modes is
demonstrated. The PA sensor is designed to enhance the gas-detection
performance and simultaneously suppress ambient noise sources (e.g. flow noise,
electrical noise and external acoustic noise). Two microphones are used and
positioned such that the PA signals are ($\pi$) out of phase. Ambient acoustic
noise are approximately in the same phase and will be subtracted and thus
improve the SNR. In addition, by placing the gas in- and outlets so that the
gas flows through the node of the first higher order membrane mode the coupling
of flow noise is approximately 20 dB lower compared with flow through the
fundamental mode at 5 L/min. The noise reduction and thus the increase in
sensitivity is demonstrated by measuring vibrational lines of methanol and
methane using a broadband interband cascade laser emitting radiation at 3.38
$\mu$m. A signal-to-noise improvement of 20 (26 dB) using higher order modes
are demonstrated compared with the fundamental mode. The maximum normalized
noise equivalent absorption coefficient is 1.1 $\times 10^{-6}$ W cm$^{-1}$
Hz$^{1/2}$ for a flow of 5 L/min. It is anticipated that the noise cancelation
strategy may find use in many practical industrial and environmental PA
sensors, where ambient noise sources plays a crucial role for the absolute
sensitive.
