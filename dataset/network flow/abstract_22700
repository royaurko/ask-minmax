Most plants and benthic organisms have evolved efficient reconfiguration
mechanisms to resist flow-induced loads. These mechanisms can be divided into
bending, in which plants reduce their sail area through elastic deformation,
and pruning, in which the loads are decreased through partial breakage of the
structure. In this work, we show by using idealized models that these two
mechanisms or, in fact, any combination of the two, are equally efficient to
reduce the drag experienced by terrestrial and aquatic vegetation.
