Although Pilch-Warner (PW) gravitational renormalization group flow
[arXiv:hep-th/0004063] passes a number of important consistency checks to be
identified as a holographic dual to a large-$N$ $SU(N)$ ${\cal N}=2^*$
supersymmetric gauge theory, it fails to reproduce the free energy of the
theory on $S^4$, computed with the localization techniques. This disagreement
points to the existence of a larger dual gravitational consistent truncation,
which in the gauge theory flat-space limit reduces to a PW flow. Such
truncation was recently identified by Bobev-Elvang-Freedman-Pufu (BEFP)
[arXiv:1311.1508]. Additional bulk scalars of the BEFP gravitation truncation
might lead to destabilization of the finite-temperature deformed PW flows, and
thus modify the low-temperature thermodynamics and hydrodynamics of ${\cal N}
=2^*$ plasma. We compute the quasinormal spectrum of these bulk scalar fields
in the thermal PW flows and demonstrate that these modes do not condense, as
long as the masses of the ${\cal N}=2^*$ hypermultiplet components are real.
