The network characteristics based on the phonological similarities in the
lexicons of several languages were examined. These languages differed widely in
their history and linguistic structure, but commonalities in the network
characteristics were observed. These networks were also found to be different
from other networks studied in the literature. The properties of these networks
suggest explanations for various aspects of linguistic processing and hint at
deeper organization within human language.
