We study social cost losses in Facility Location games, where $n$ selfish
agents install facilities over a network and connect to them, so as to forward
their local demand (expressed by a non-negative weight per agent). Agents using
the same facility share fairly its installation cost, but every agent pays
individually a (weighted) connection cost to the chosen location. We study the
Price of Stability (PoS) of pure Nash equilibria and the Price of Anarchy of
strong equilibria (SPoA), that generalize pure equilibria by being resilient to
coalitional deviations. A special case of recently studied network design
games, Facility Location merits separate study as a classic model with numerous
applications and individual characteristics: our analysis for unweighted agents
on metric networks reveals constant upper and lower bounds for the PoS, while
an $O(\ln n)$ upper bound implied by previous work is tight for non-metric
networks. Strong equilibria do not always exist, even for the unweighted metric
case. We show that $e$-approximate strong equilibria exist ($e=2.718...$). The
SPoA is generally upper bounded by $O(\ln W)$ ($W$ is the sum of agents'
weights), which becomes tight $\Theta(\ln n)$ for unweighted agents. For the
unweighted metric case we prove a constant upper bound. We point out several
challenging open questions that arise.
