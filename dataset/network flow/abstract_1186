We derive three fundamental decompositions on relevant information quantities
in feedback systems. The feedback systems considered in this paper are only
restricted to be causal in time domain and the channels are allowed to be
subject to arbitrary distribution. These decompositions comprise the well-known
mutual information and the directed information, and indicate a law of
conservation of information flows in the closed-loop network.
