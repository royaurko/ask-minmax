We show the existence of a global unique and analytic solution for the mean
curvature flow, the surface diffusion flow and the Willmore flow of entire
graphs for Lipschitz initial data with small Lipschitz norm. We also show the
existence of a global unique and analytic solution to the Ricci-DeTurck flow on
euclidean space for bounded initial metrics which are close to the euclidean
metric in $L^\infty$ and to the harmonic map flow for initial maps whose image
is contained in a small geodesic ball.
