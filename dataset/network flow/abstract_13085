In this paper it is proven that the volume entropy of a riemannian metric
evolving by the Ricci flow, if does not collapse, nondecreases. Therefore, it
provides a sufficient condition for a solution to collapse. Then, for the limit
solutions of type I or III, the limit entropy is the limit of the entropy as
$t$ approaches the singular (finite or not) time.
