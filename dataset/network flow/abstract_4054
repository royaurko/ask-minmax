The paper describes capabilities of numerical simulation of liquid flows with
solid and/or gas admixtures in centrifugal pumps using modern commercial CFD
software packages, with the purpose to predict performance curves of the pumps
treating such media. In particular, the approaches and multiphase flow models
available in the package CFX-5 are described; their advantages and
disadvantages are analyzed.
