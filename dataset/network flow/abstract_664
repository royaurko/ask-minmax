We investigate the problem of designing delay-aware joint flow control,
routing, and scheduling algorithms in general multi-hop networks for maximizing
network utilization. Since the end-to-end delay performance has a complex
dependence on the high-order statistics of cross-layer algorithms, earlier
optimization-based design methodologies that optimize the long term network
utilization are not immediately well-suited for delay-aware design. This
motivates us in this work to develop a novel design framework and alternative
methods that take advantage of several unexploited design choices in the
routing and the scheduling strategy spaces. In particular, we reveal and
exploit a crucial characteristic of back pressure-type controllers that enables
us to develop a novel link rate allocation strategy that not only optimizes
long-term network utilization, but also yields loop free multi-path routes}
between each source-destination pair. Moreover, we propose a regulated
scheduling strategy, based on a token-based service discipline, for shaping the
per-hop delay distribution to obtain highly desirable end-to-end delay
performance. We establish that our joint flow control, routing, and scheduling
algorithm achieves loop-free routes and optimal network utilization. Our
extensive numerical studies support our theoretical results, and further show
that our joint design leads to substantial end-to-end delay performance
improvements in multi-hop networks compared to earlier solutions.
