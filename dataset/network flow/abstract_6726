We show that solving a multiple-unicast network coding problem can be reduced
to solving a single-unicast network error correction problem, where an
adversary may jam at most a single edge in the network. Specifically, we
present an efficient reduction that maps a multiple-unicast network coding
instance to a network error correction instance while preserving feasibility.
The reduction holds for both the zero probability of error model and the
vanishing probability of error model. Previous reductions are restricted to the
zero-error case. As an application of the reduction, we present a constructive
example showing that the single-unicast network error correction capacity may
not be achievable, a result of separate interest.
