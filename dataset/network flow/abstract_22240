This review starts out with a brief history of the photino-gluino
phenomenology. Next, it describes difficulties encountered in the construction
of Feynman amplitudes when dealing with Majorana fermions and outlines a
procedure that circumvents this difficulty by means of a prescription based on
a well-defined fermion flow without explicit charge-conjugation matrices at the
vertex equations. Finally, as an illustration, it calculates the cross section
for the production of photinos and gluinos.
