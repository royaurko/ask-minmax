Cooperativity effects have been proposed to explain the non-local rheology in
the dynamics of soft jammed systems. Based on the analysis of the double well
free-energy model proposed by L. Bocquet, A. Colin \& A. Ajdari ({\em Phys.
Rev. Lett.} {\bf 103}, 036001 (2009)), we show that cooperativity effects
resulting from the non-local nature of the fluidity (inverse viscosity), are
intimately related to the emergence of shear-banding configurations. This
connection materializes through the onset of inhomogeneous compact solutions
(compactons), wherein the fluidity is confined to finite-support subregions of
the flow and strictly zero elsewhere. Compactons coexistence with regions of
zero fluidity ("non-flowing vacuum") is shown to be stabilized by the presence
of mechanical noise, which ultimately shapes up the equilibrium distribution of
the fluidity field, acting as an order parameter for the flow-noflow
transitions occurring in the material.
