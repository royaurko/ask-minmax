This paper presents measurements of the elliptic flow of charged particles as
a function of pseudorapidity and centrality from Cu-Cu collisions at 62.4 and
200 GeV using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC). The elliptic flow in Cu-Cu collisions is found to be significant even
for the most central events. For comparison with the Au-Au results, it is found
that the detailed way in which the collision geometry (eccentricity) is
estimated is of critical importance when scaling out system-size effects. A new
form of eccentricity, called the participant eccentricity, is introduced which
yields a scaled elliptic flow in the Cu-Cu system that has the same relative
magnitude and qualitative features as that in the Au-Au system.
