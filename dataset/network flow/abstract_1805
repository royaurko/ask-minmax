Scene parsing is a technique that consist on giving a label to all pixels in
an image according to the class they belong to. To ensure a good visual
coherence and a high class accuracy, it is essential for a scene parser to
capture image long range dependencies. In a feed-forward architecture, this can
be simply achieved by considering a sufficiently large input context patch,
around each pixel to be labeled. We propose an approach consisting of a
recurrent convolutional neural network which allows us to consider a large
input context, while limiting the capacity of the model. Contrary to most
standard approaches, our method does not rely on any segmentation methods, nor
any task-specific features. The system is trained in an end-to-end manner over
raw pixels, and models complex spatial dependencies with low inference cost. As
the context size increases with the built-in recurrence, the system identifies
and corrects its own errors. Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance
on both the Stanford Background Dataset and the SIFT Flow Dataset, while
remaining very fast at test time.
