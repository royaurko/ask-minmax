In recent years, we have seen scientists attempt to model and explain human
dynamics and, in particular, human movement. Many aspects of our complex life
are affected by human movements such as disease spread and epidemics modeling,
city planning, wireless network development, and disaster relief, to name a
few. Given the myriad of applications it is clear that a complete understanding
of how people move in space can lead to huge benefits to our society. In most
of the recent works, scientists have focused on the idea that people movements
are biased towards frequently-visited locations. According to them, human
movement is based on an exploration/exploitation dichotomy in which individuals
choose new locations (exploration) or return to frequently-visited locations
(exploitation). In this work, we focus on the concept of recency. We propose a
model in which exploitation in human movement also considers recently-visited
locations and not solely frequently-visited locations. We test our hypothesis
against different empirical data of human mobility and show that our proposed
model is able to better explain the human trajectories in these datasets.
