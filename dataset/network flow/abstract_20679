We propose Otiy, a node-centric location service that limits the impact of
location updates generate by mobile nodes in IEEE802.11-based wireless mesh
networks. Existing location services use node identifiers to determine the
locator (aka anchor) that is responsible for keeping track of a node's
location. Such a strategy can be inefficient because: (i) identifiers give no
clue on the node's mobility and (ii) locators can be far from the
source/destination shortest path, which increases both location delays and
bandwidth consumption. To solve these issues, Otiy introduces a new strategy
that identifies nodes to play the role of locators based on the likelihood of a
destination to be close to these nodes- i.e., locators are identified depending
on the mobility pattern of nodes. Otiy relies on the cyclic mobility patterns
of nodes and creates a slotted agenda composed of a set of predicted locations,
defined according to the past and present patterns of mobility. Correspondent
nodes fetch this agenda only once and use it as a reference for identifying
which locators are responsible for the node at different points in time. Over a
period of about one year, the weekly proportion of nodes having at least 50% of
exact location predictions is in average about 75%. This proportion increases
by 10% when nodes also consider their closeness to the locator from only what
they know about the network.
