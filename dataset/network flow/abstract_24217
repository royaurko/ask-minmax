In this article, we examine the Location Management costs in mobile
communication networks utilizing the timer-based method. From the study of the
probabilities that a mobile terminal changes a number of Location Areas between
two calls, we identify a threshold value of 0.7 for the Call-to-Mobility Ratio
(CMR) below which the application of the timer-based method is most
appropriate. We characterize the valley appearing in the evolution of the costs
with the timeout period, showing that the time interval required to reach 90%
of the stabilized costs grows with the mobility index, the paging cost per
Location Area and the movement dimension, in opposition to the behavior
presented by the time interval that achieves the minimum of the costs. The
results obtained for CMRs below the suggested 0.7 threshold show that the
valley appearing in the costs tends to disappear for CMRs within [0.001, 0.7]
in onedimensional movements and within [0.2, 0.7] in two-dimensional ones, and
when the normalized paging cost per Location Area is below 0.3.
