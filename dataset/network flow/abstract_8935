We prove that the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle to a hyperbolic
2-orbifold is left-handed if and only if the orbifold is a sphere with three
conic points. As a consequence, on the unit tangent bundle to a 3-conic sphere,
the lift of every finite collection of closed geodesics that is zero in
integral homology is the binding of an open book decomposition.
