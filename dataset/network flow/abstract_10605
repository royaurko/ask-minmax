Many studies that gather social network data use survey methods that lead to
censored, missing or otherwise incomplete information. For example, the popular
fixed rank nomination (FRN) scheme, often used in studies of schools and
businesses, asks study participants to nominate and rank at most a small number
of contacts or friends, leaving the existence other relations uncertain.
However, most statistical models are formulated in terms of completely observed
binary networks. Statistical analyses of FRN data with such models ignore the
censored and ranked nature of the data and could potentially result in
misleading statistical inference. To investigate this possibility, we compare
parameter estimates obtained from a likelihood for complete binary networks to
those from a likelihood that is derived from the FRN scheme, and therefore
recognizes the ranked and censored nature of the data. We show analytically and
via simulation that the binary likelihood can provide misleading inference, at
least for certain model parameters that relate network ties to characteristics
of individuals and pairs of individuals. We also compare these different
likelihoods in a data analysis of several adolescent social networks. For some
of these networks, the parameter estimates from the binary and FRN likelihoods
lead to different conclusions, indicating the importance of analyzing FRN data
with a method that accounts for the FRN survey design.
