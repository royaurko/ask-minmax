Many embedded real-time control systems suffer from resource constraints and
dynamic workload variations. Although optimal feedback scheduling schemes are
in principle capable of maximizing the overall control performance of
multitasking control systems, most of them induce excessively large
computational overheads associated with the mathematical optimization routines
involved and hence are not directly applicable to practical systems. To
optimize the overall control performance while minimizing the overhead of
feedback scheduling, this paper proposes an efficient feedback scheduling
scheme based on feedforward neural networks. Using the optimal solutions
obtained offline by mathematical optimization methods, a back-propagation (BP)
neural network is designed to adapt online the sampling periods of concurrent
control tasks with respect to changes in computing resource availability.
Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the
computational overhead significantly while delivering almost the same overall
control performance as compared to optimal feedback scheduling.
