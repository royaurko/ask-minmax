Many real life networks, such as the World Wide Web, transportation systems,
biological or social networks, achieve both a strong local clustering (nodes
have many mutual neighbors) and a small diameter (maximum distance between any
two nodes). These networks have been characterized as small-world networks and
modeled by the addition of randomness to regular structures. We show that
small-world networks can be constructed in a deterministic way. This exact
approach permits a direct calculation of relevant network parameters allowing
their immediate contrast with real-world networks and avoiding complex computer
simulations.
