In this paper, we study the behavior of Ricci flows on compact orbifolds with
finite singularities. We show that Perelman's pseudolocality theorem also holds
on orbifold Ricci flow. Using this property, we obtain a weak compactness
theorem of Ricci flows on orbifolds under some natural technical conditions.
This generalizes the corresponding theorem on manifolds. As an application, we
can use K\"ahler Ricci flow to find new K\"ahler Einstein metrics on some
orbifold Fano surfaces. For example, if $Y$ is a cubic surface with only one
ordinary double point or $Y$ is an orbifold Fano surface with degree 1 and
every singularity on it is a rational double point of type $\A_k (1 \leq k \leq
6)$, then we can find a KE metric of $Y$ by running K\"ahler Ricci flow.
