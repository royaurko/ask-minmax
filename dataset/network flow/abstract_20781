The MediaWise project aims to expand the scope of existing media delivery
systems with novel cloud, personalization and collaboration capabilities that
can serve the needs of more users, communities, and businesses. The project
develops a MediaWise Cloud platform that supports do-it-yourself creation,
search, management, and consumption of multimedia content. The MediaWise Cloud
supports pay-as-you-go models and elasticity that are similar to those offered
by commercially available cloud services. However, unlike existing commercial
CDN services providers such as Limelight Networks and Akamai the MediaWise
Cloud require no ownerships of computing infrastructure and instead rely on the
public Internet and public cloud services (e.g., commercial cloud storage to
store its content). In addition to integrating such public cloud services into
a public cloud-based Content Delivery Network, the MediaWise Cloud also
provides advanced Quality of Service (QoS) management as required for the
delivery of streamed and interactive high resolution multimedia content. In
this paper, we give a brief overview of MediaWise Cloud architecture and
present a comprehensive discussion on research objectives related to its
service components. Finally, we also compare the features supported by the
existing CDN services against the envisioned objectives of MediaWise Cloud.
