In the context of inter-jet energy flow, we present the first quantitative
result of the resummation of non-global logarithms at finite N_c. This is
achieved by refining Weigert's approach in which the problem is reduced to the
simulation of associated Langevin dynamics in the space of Wilson lines. We
find that, in e+e- annihilation, the exact result is rather close to the result
previously obtained in the large-N_c mean field approximation. However, we
observe enormous event-by-event fluctuations in the Langevin process which may
have significant consequences in hadron collisions.
