In this paper, we study the singularities of two extended Ricci flow systems
--- connection Ricci flow and Ricci harmonic flow using newly-defined curvature
quantities. Specifically, we give the definition of three types of
singularities and their corresponding singularity models, and then prove the
convergence. In addition, for Ricci harmonic flow, we use the monotonicity of
functional $\nu_\alpha$ to show the connection between finite-time singularity
and shrinking Ricci harmonic soliton. At last, we explore the property of
ancient solutions for Ricci harmonic flow.
