Fluid dynamics video: Snapping shrimp produce a snapping sound by an
extremely rapid closure of their snapper claw. Our high speed imaging of the
claw closure has revealed that the sound is generated by the collapse of a
cavitation bubble formed in a fast flowing water jet forced out from the claws
during claw closure. The produced sound originates from the cavitation collapse
of the bubble. At collapse a short flash of light is emitted, just as in single
bubble sonoluminescence. A model based on the Rayleigh-Plesset equation can
quantitatively account for the visual and acoustical observations.
