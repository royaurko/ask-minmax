Networks of interconnected nodes have long played a key role in Cognitive
Science, from artificial neural net- works to spreading activation models of
semantic mem- ory. Recently, however, a new Network Science has been developed,
providing insights into the emergence of global, system-scale properties in
contexts as diverse as the Internet, metabolic reactions, and collaborations
among scientists. Today, the inclusion of network theory into Cognitive
Sciences, and the expansion of complex- systems science, promises to
significantly change the way in which the organization and dynamics of
cognitive and behavioral processes are understood. In this paper, we review
recent contributions of network theory at different levels and domains within
the Cognitive Sciences.
