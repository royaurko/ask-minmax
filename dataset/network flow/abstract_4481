Bots, in recent times, have posed a major threat to enterprise networks. With
the distributed nature of the way in which botnets operate, the problems faced
by enterprises have become acute. A bot is a program that operates as an agent
for a user and runs automated tasks over the internet, at a much higher rate
than would be possible for a human alone. A collection of bots in a network,
used for malicious purposes, is referred to as a botnet. In this paper we
suggested a distributed, co-operative approach towards detecting botnets is a
given network which is inspired by the gossip protocol. Each node in a given
network runs a standalone agent that computes a suspicion value for that node
after regular intervals. Each node in the network exchanges its suspicion
values with every other node in the network at regular intervals. The use of
gossip protocol ensures that if a node in the network is compromised, all other
nodes in the network are informed about it as soon as possible. Each node also
ensures that at any instance, by means of the gossip protocol, it maintains the
latest suspicion values of all the other nodes in the network.
