Standard Random Boolean Networks display an order-disorder phase transition.
We add to the standard Random Boolean Networks a disconnection rule which
couples the control and order parameters. By this way, the system is driven to
the critical line transition. Under the influence of perturbations the system
point out self-organized critical behavior. Several numerical simulations have
been done and compared with a proposed analytical treatment.
