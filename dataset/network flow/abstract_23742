In their classical work (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1981, 78:6840-6844),
Goldbeter and Koshland mathematically analyzed a reversible covalent
modification system which is highly sensitive to the concentration of
effectors. Its signal-response curve appears sigmoidal, constituting a
biochemical switch. However, the switch behavior only emerges in the
"zero-order region", i.e. when the signal molecule concentration is much lower
than that of the substrate it modifies. In this work we showed that the
switching behavior can also occur under comparable concentrations of signals
and substrates, provided that the signal molecules catalyze the modification
reaction in cooperation. We also studied the effect of dynamic disorders on the
proposed biochemical switch, in which the enzymatic reaction rates, instead of
constant, appear as stochastic functions of time. We showed that the system is
robust to dynamic disorder at bulk concentration. But if the dynamic disorder
is quasi-static, large fluctuations of the switch response behavior may be
observed at low concentrations. Such fluctuation is relevant to many biological
functions. It can be reduced by either increasing the conformation
interconversion rate of the protein, or correlating the enzymatic reaction
rates in the network.
