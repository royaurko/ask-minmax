Inspired by a growing interest in analyzing network data, we study the
problem of node classification on graphs, focusing on approaches based on
kernel machines. Conventionally, kernel machines are linear classifiers in the
implicit feature space. We argue that linear classification in the feature
space of kernels commonly used for graphs is often not enough to produce good
results. When this is the case, one naturally considers nonlinear classifiers
in the feature space. We show that repeating this process produces something we
call "deep kernel machines." We provide some examples where deep kernel
machines can make a big difference in classification performance, and point out
some connections to various recent literature on deep architectures in
artificial intelligence and machine learning.
