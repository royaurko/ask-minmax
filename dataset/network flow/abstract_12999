We derive and solve flow equations for a general O(N)-symmetric effective
potential including wavefunction renormalization corrections combined with a
heat-kernel regularization. We investigate the model at finite temperature and
study the nature of the phase transition in detail. Beta functions, fixed
points and critical exponents \beta, \nu, \delta and \eta for various N are
independently calculated which allow for a verification of universal scaling
relations.
