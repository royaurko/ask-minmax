Energy harvesting has emerged as a powerful technology for complementing
current battery-powered communication systems in order to extend their
lifetime. In this paper a general framework is introduced for the optimization
of communication systems in which the transmitter is able to harvest energy
from its environment. Assuming that the energy arrival process is known
non-causally at the transmitter, the structure of the optimal transmission
scheme, which maximizes the amount of transmitted data by a given deadline, is
identified. Our framework includes models with continuous energy arrival as
well as battery constraints. A battery that suffers from energy leakage is
studied further, and the optimal transmission scheme is characterized for a
constant leakage rate.
