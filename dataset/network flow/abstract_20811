The instantaneous state of a neural network consists of both the degree of
excitation of each neuron, the network is composed of, and positions of
impulses in communication lines between neurons. In neurophysiological
experiments, the neuronal firing moments are registered, but not the state of
communication lines. But future spiking moments depend essentially on the past
positions of impulses in the lines. This suggests, that the sequence of
intervals between firing moments (interspike intervals, ISIs) in the network
could be non-Markovian. In this paper, we address this question for a simplest
possible neural "net", namely, a single neuron with delayed feedback. The
neuron receives excitatory input both from the driving Poisson stream and from
its own output through the feedback line. We obtain analytical expressions for
conditional probability density $P(t_{n+1} | t_n,...,t_1,t_0)$, which gives the
probability to get an output ISI of duration $t_{n+1}$ provided the previous
$(n+1)$ output ISIs had durations $t_n,...,t_1,t_0$. It is proven exactly, that
$P(t_{n+1} | t_n,...,t_1,t_0)$ does not reduce to $P(t_{n+1} | t_n,...,t_1)$
for any $n \geq 0$. This means that the output ISIs stream cannot be
represented as Markov chain of any finite order.
