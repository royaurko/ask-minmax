Recently, interest has developed in the distribution of interjet energy
flows, with for example the leading-log calculation of the highly non-trivial
colour structure of primary emissions in 4-jet systems. Here we point out
however that at leading-log level it is insufficient to consider only multiple
primary emission from the underlying hard antenna -- additionally, one must
take into account the coherent structure of emission from arbitrarily
complicated ensembles of large-angle soft gluons. Similar considerations apply
to certain definitions of rapidity gaps based on energy flow. We examine this
new class of terms in the simpler context of 2-jet events, and discover
features that point at novel aspects of the QCD dynamics.
