Epidemic spreading and cascading failure are two important dynamical
processes over complex networks. They have been investigated separately for a
long history. But in the real world, these two dynamics sometimes may interact
with each other. In this paper, we explore a model combined with SIR epidemic
spreading model and local loads sharing cascading failure model. There exists a
critical value of tolerance parameter that whether the epidemic with high
infection probability can spread out and infect a fraction of the network in
this model. When the tolerance parameter is smaller than the critical value,
cascading failure cuts off abundant of paths and blocks the spreading of
epidemic locally. While the tolerance parameter is larger than the critical
value, epidemic spreads out and infects a fraction of the network. A method for
estimating the critical value is proposed. In simulation, we verify the
effectiveness of this method in Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) networks.
