This paper presents a deep neural-network-based hierarchical graphical model
for individual and group activity recognition in surveillance scenes. Deep
networks are used to recognize the actions of individual people in a scene.
Next, a neural-network-based hierarchical graphical model refines the predicted
labels for each class by considering dependencies between the classes. This
refinement step mimics a message-passing step similar to inference in a
probabilistic graphical model. We show that this approach can be effective in
group activity recognition, with the deep graphical model improving recognition
rates over baseline methods.
