How can we uncover the natural communities in a real network that allows
insight into its underlying structure and also potential functions? In this
paper, we introduce a new community detection algorithm, called Attractor,
which automatically spots the communities or groups in a network over time via
local dynamic interaction. The basic idea is to envision a network as a
dynamical system, and each agent interacts with its local partners. Instead of
investigating the node dynamics, we actually examine the change of "distances"
among linked nodes. As time evolves, these distances will be shrunk or
stretched gradually based on their topological structures. Finally all
distances among linked nodes will converge into a stable pattern, and
communities can be intuitively identified. Thanks to the dynamic viewpoint of
community detection, Attractor has several potential attractive properties: (a)
Attractor provides an intuitive solution to analyze the community structure of
a network, and faithfully captures the natural communities (with high quality).
(b) Owing to its time complexity $O(|E|)$, Attractor allows finding communities
on large networks. (c) The small communities or anomalies, usually existing in
real-world networks, can be well pinpointed. (d) Attractor is easy to
parameterize, since there is no need to specify the number of clusters.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks further demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
