We have studied the two-dimensional flow of balls in a small angle funnel,
when either the side walls are rough or the balls are polydisperse. As in
earlier work on monodisperse flows in smooth funnels, we observe the formation
of kinematic shock waves/density waves. We find that for rough walls the flows
are more disordered than for smooth walls and that shock waves generally
propagate more slowly. For rough wall funnel flow, we show that the shock
velocity and frequency obey simple scaling laws. These scaling laws are
consistent with those found for smooth wall flow, but here they are cleaner
since there are fewer packing-site effects and we study a wider range of
parameters. For pipe flow (parallel side walls), rough walls support many shock
waves, while smooth walls exhibit fewer or no shock waves. For funnel flows of
balls with varying sizes, we find that flows with weak polydispersity behave
qualitatively similar to monodisperse flows. For strong polydispersity, scaling
breaks down and the shock waves consist of extended areas where the funnel is
blocked completely.
