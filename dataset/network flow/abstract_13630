We modify the Laplacian coflow of co-closed G2-structures - $\frac{d}{dt}\psi
=\Delta \psi $ where $\psi $ is the closed dual 4-form of a $G_{2}$-structure
$\varphi $. The modified flow is now parabolic in the direction of closed forms
upto diffeomorphisms. We then prove short time existence and uniqueness of
solutions to the modified flow.
