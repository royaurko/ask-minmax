We present an object-oriented geophysical and astrophysical spectral-element
adaptive refinement (GASpAR) code for application to turbulent flows. Like most
spectral-element codes, GASpAR combines finite-element efficiency with
spectral-method accuracy. It is also designed to be flexible enough for a range
of geophysics and astrophysics applications where turbulence or other complex
multiscale problems arise. For extensibility and flexibilty the code is
designed in an object-oriented manner. The computational core is based on
spectral-element operators, which are represented as objects. The formalism
accommodates both conforming and nonconforming elements and their associated
data structures for handling interelement communications in a parallel
environment. Many aspects of this code are a synthesis of existing methods;
however, we focus on a new formulation of dynamic adaptive refinement (DARe) of
nonconforming h-type. This paper presents the code and its algorithms; we do
not consider parallel efficiency metrics or performance. As a demonstration of
the code we offer several two-dimensional test cases that we propose as
standard test problems for comparable DARe codes. The suitability of these test
problems for turbulent flow simulation is considered.
