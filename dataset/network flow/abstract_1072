In millimeterWave wireless networks the rapidly varying wireless channels
demand fast and dynamic resource allocation mechanisms. This challenge is
hereby addressed by a distributed approach that optimally solves the
fundamental resource allocation problem of joint client association and
relaying. The problem is posed as a multi assignment optimization, for which a
novel solution method is established by a series of transformations that lead
to a tractable minimum cost flow problem. The method allows to design
distributed auction solution algorithms where the clients and relays act
asynchronously. The computational complexity of the new algorithms is much
better than centralized general-purpose solvers. It is shown that the
algorithms always converge to a solution that maximizes the total network
throughput within a desired bound. Both theoretical and numerical results
evince numerous useful properties in comparison to standard approaches and the
potential applications to forthcoming millimeterWave wireless access networks.
