Some pressure and pressure-velocity correlation in a direct numerical
simulations of a three-dimensional turbulent flow at moderate Reynolds numbers
have been analyzed. We have identified a set of pressure-velocity correlations
which posseses a good scaling behaviour. Such a class of pressure-velocity
correlations are determined by looking at the energy-balance across any
sub-volume of the flow. According to our analysis, pressure scaling is
determined by the dimensional assumption that pressure behaves as a ``velocity
squared'', unless finite-Reynolds effects are overwhelming. The SO(3)
decompositions of pressure structure functions has also been applied in order
to investigate anisotropic effects on the pressure scaling.
