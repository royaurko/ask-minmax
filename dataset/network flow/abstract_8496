This paper describes a domain-specific knowledge acquisition tool for
intelligent automated troubleshooters based on Bayesian networks. No Bayesian
network knowledge is required to use the tool, and troubleshooting information
can be specified as natural and intuitive as possible. Probabilities can be
specified in the direction that is most natural to the domain expert. Thus, the
knowledge acquisition efficiently removes the traditional knowledge acquisition
bottleneck of Bayesian networks.
