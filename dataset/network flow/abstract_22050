In this thesis, we present the measurements of $D^{0}\to K\pi$ at low $p_T$
($p_T\leq2$ GeV/$c$) and non-photonic electron spectra ($0.9\leq p_T\leq5$
GeV/$c$) from $D^0$ semi-leptonic decay. In addition, we use a newly proposed
technique to identify muons from charm decays at low $p_T$. The combination of
all these three measurements stringently constrains the total charm production
cross-section at mid-rapidity at RHIC. They also allow the extraction of the
charmed hadron spectral shape and a study of possible charm radial flow in
Au+Au collisions.
