A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, with a potential of the form $V(\phi) =
\Lambda^4[1 \pm \cos(\phi/f)], naturally gives rise to inflation if $f \sim
M_{Pl}$ and $\Lambda \sim M_{GUT}$. We show how this can arise in
technicolor-like and superstring models, and work out an explicit string
example in the context of multiple gaugino condensation models. We study the
cosmology of this model in detail, and find that sufficient reheating to ensure
that baryogenesis can take place requires $f > 0.3 M_{Pl}$. The primordial
density fluctuation spectrum generated is a non-scale-invariant power law,
$P(k) \propto k^{n_s}$, with $n_s \simeq 1 - (M^2_{Pl}/8\pi f^2)$, leading to
more power on large length scales than the $n_s = 1$ Harrison-Zeldovich
spectrum. The standard CDM model with $0 \la n_s \la 0.6-0.7$ could in
principle explain the large-scale clustering observed in the APM and IRAS
galaxy surveys as well as large-scale flows, but the COBE microwave anisotropy
implies such low amplitudes (or high bias factors, $b>2$) for these CDM models
that galaxy formation occurs too late to be viable; combining COBE with
sufficiently early galaxy formation or the large-scale flows leads to $n_s
>0.6$, or $f > 0.3 M_{Pl}$ as well. For extended and power law inflation
models, this constraint is even tighter, $n_s > 0.7$; combined with other
bounds on large bubbles in extended inflation, this leaves little room for most
extended models.
