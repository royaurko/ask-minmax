Recent studies have shown the classification and prediction power of the
Neural Networks. It has been demonstrated that a NN can approximate any
continuous function. Neural networks have been successfully used for
forecasting of financial data series. The classical methods used for time
series prediction like Box-Jenkins or ARIMA assumes that there is a linear
relationship between inputs and outputs. Neural Networks have the advantage
that can approximate nonlinear functions. In this paper we compared the
performances of different feed forward and recurrent neural networks and
training algorithms for predicting the exchange rate EUR/RON and USD/RON. We
used data series with daily exchange rates starting from 2005 until 2013.
