Mean-field theory is a powerful tool for studying large neural networks.
However, when the system is composed of a few neurons, macroscopic differences
between the mean-field approximation and the real behavior of the network can
arise. Here we introduce a study of the dynamics of a small firing-rate network
with excitatory and inhibitory populations, in terms of local and global
bifurcations of the neural activity. Our approach is analytically tractable in
many respects, and sheds new light on the finite-size effects of the system. In
particular, we focus on the formation of multiple branching solutions of the
neural equations through spontaneous symmetry-breaking, since this phenomenon
increases considerably the complexity of the dynamical behavior of the network.
For these reasons, branching points may reveal important mechanisms through
which neurons interact and process information, which are not accounted for by
the mean-field approximation.
