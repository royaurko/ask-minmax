The paper is devoted to the numerical solution of an elastoplastic
constitutive initial value problems containing the Mohr-Coulomb yield
criterion, a nonassociative plastic flow rule and a nonlinear isotropic
hardening. The plastic flow rule is formulated in a subdifferential form to
keep just one plastic multiplier. It is shown that such a formulation is
suitable also for numerical purposes. Namely, it leads to simplification of the
implicit return-mapping scheme and the consistent tangent operator. This paper
is a free continuation of arXiv:1503.03605.
