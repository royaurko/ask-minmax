Studies of <p_{T}>, transverse momentum spectra and anisotropy flow from
nuclear collisions at RHIC indicate early thermalization and strong collective
expansion. We propose a systematic study of the anisotropy parameter $v_2$ and
the transverse momentum distributions of $\phi, \Omega, D^0, \Lambda_C$ and $J
/ \psi$ in order to extract information on partonic collective flow.
