In intrusion detection systems, classifiers still suffer from several
drawbacks such as data dimensionality and dominance, different network feature
types, and data impact on the classification. In this paper two significant
enhancements are presented to solve these drawbacks. The first enhancement is
an improved feature selection using sequential backward search and information
gain. This, in turn, extracts valuable features that enhance positively the
detection rate and reduce the false positive rate. The second enhancement is
transferring nominal network features to numeric ones by exploiting the
discrete random variable and the probability mass function to solve the problem
of different feature types, the problem of data dominance, and data impact on
the classification. The latter is combined to known normalization methods to
achieve a significant hybrid normalization approach. Finally, an intensive and
comparative study approves the efficiency of these enhancements and shows
better performance comparing to other proposed methods.
