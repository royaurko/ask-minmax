In this letter, we investigate the problem of self-organizing spectrum access
for small cell networks, using a graphical game approach. Compared with
existing studies, we take the features of different cell loads and local
interference relationship into account. It is proved that the formulated
spectrum access game is an exact potential game with the aggregate interference
level as the potential function, and Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game
corresponds to the global or local optima of the original optimization problem.
A lower bound of the achievable aggregate interference level is rigorously
derived. Finally, we propose a gateway-assisted best response learning
algorithm to converge towards NE of the game. It is shown that the proposed
game-theoretic solution converges rapidly and its achievable performance is
close to the optimum solution.
