It is expected that energetic solar flares releasing large amount of energy
at the photosphere may be able to excite the acoustic ($p$-) modes of
oscillations. We have determined the characteristic properties of mode
parameters by applying the ring diagram technique to 3-D power spectra obtained
for solar active region NOAA 10486 during the long duration energetic X17.2/4B
flare of October 28, 2003. Strong evidence of substantial increase in mode
amplitude and systematic variations in sub-surface flows, i.e., meridional and
zonal components of velocity, kinetic helicity, vorticity, is found from
comparison of the pre- to the post-flare phases.
