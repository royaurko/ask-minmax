We outline the global control architecture of genomes. A theory of genomic
control information is presented. The concept of a developmental control
network called a cene (for control gene) is introduced. We distinguish
parts-genes from control genes or cenes. Cenes are interpreted and executed by
the cell and, thereby, direct cell actions including communication, growth,
division, differentiation and multi-cellular development. The cenome is the
global developmental control network in the genome. The cenome is also a cene
that consists of interlinked sub-cenes that guide the ontogeny of the organism.
The complexity of organisms is linked to the complexity of the cenome. The
relevance to ontogeny and evolution is mentioned. We introduce the concept of a
universal cell and a universal genome.
