We identify and study new nonlinear axisymmetric equilibria with
incompressible flow of arbitrary direction satisfying a generalized Grad
Shafranov equation by extending the symmetry analysis presented in [G. Cicogna
and F. Pegoraro, Phys. Plasmas Vol. 22, 022520 (2015)]. In particular, we
construct a typical tokamak D-shaped equilibrium with peaked toroidal current
density, monotonically varying safety factor and sheared electric field.
