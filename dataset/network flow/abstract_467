BitTorrent is undoubtedly the most popular P2P file sharing application on
today's Internet. The widespread popularity of BitTorrent has attracted a great
deal of attention from networking researchers who conducted various performance
studies on it. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of analytical
performance modeling techniques for BitTorrent networks. The performance models
examined in this study include deterministic models, Markov chain models, fluid
flow models, and queuing network models. These models evaluate the performance
metrics of BitTorrent networks at different regimes with various realistic
factors considered. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted on those
modeling techniques in the aspects of complexity, accuracy, extensibility, and
scalability.
