We develop a stochastic target representation for Ricci flow and normalized
Ricci flow on smooth, compact surfaces, analogous to Soner and Touzi's
representation of mean curvature flow. We prove a verification/uniqueness
theorem, and then consider geometric consequences of this stochastic
representation.
  Based on this stochastic approach we give a proof that, for surfaces of
non-positive Euler characteristic, the normalized Ricci flow converges to a
constant curvature metric exponentially quickly in every $C^k$-norm. In the
case of $C^{0}$ and $C^{1}$-convergence, we achieve this by coupling two
particles. To get $C^{2}$-convergence (in particular, convergence of the
curvature), we use a coupling of three particles. This triple coupling is
developed here only for the case of constant curvature metrics on surfaces,
though we suspect that some variants of this idea are applicable in other cases
too. At any rate, this triple coupling provides a purely probabilistic approach
to getting second-order derivative estimates for second-order PDEs. Finally,
for $k\ge3$, the $C^{k}$-convergence follows relatively easily using induction
and coupling of two particles.
