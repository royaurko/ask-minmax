We present the results of molecular dynamic simulations of a two-dimensional
vortex array driven by a uniform current through random pinning centers at zero
temperature. We identify two types of flow of the driven array near the
depinning threshold. For weak disorder the flux array contains few dislocation
and moves via correlated displacements of patches of vortices in a {\it
crinkle} motion. As the disorder strength increases, we observe a crossover to
a spatially inhomogeneous regime of {\it plastic} flow, with a very defective
vortex array and a channel-like structure of the flowing regions. The two
regimes are characterized by qualitatively different spatial distribution of
vortex velocities. In the crinkle regime the distribution of vortex velocities
near threshold has a single maximum that shifts to larger velocities as the
driving force is increased. In the plastic regime the distribution of vortex
velocities near threshold has a clear bimodal structure that persists upon
time-averaging the individual velocities. The bimodal structure of the velocity
distribution reflects the coexistence of pinned and flowing regions and is
proposed as a quantitative signature of plastic flow.
