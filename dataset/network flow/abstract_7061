We establish the short-time existence of the Ricci flow on surfaces with a
finite number of conic points, all with cone angle between 0 and $2\pi$, where
the cone angles remain fixed or change in some smooth prescribed way. For the
angle-preserving flow we prove long-time existence and convergence. When the
Troyanov angle condition is satisfied (equivalently, when the data is
logarithmically K-stable), the flow converges to the unique constant curvature
metric with the given cone angles; if this condition is not satisfied, the flow
converges subsequentially to a soliton. This is the one-dimensional version of
the Hamilton--Tian conjecture.
