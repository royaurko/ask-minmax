We construct a family of holomorphic $\beta$-functions whose RG flow
preserves the $\Gamma(2)$ modular symmetry and reproduces the observed
stability of the Hall plateaus. The semi-circle law relating the longitudinal
and Hall conductivities that has been observed experimentally is obtained from
the integration of the RG equations for any permitted transition which can be
identified from the selection rules encoded in the flow diagram. The generic
scale dependance of the conductivities is found to agree qualitatively with the
present experimental data. The existence of a crossing point occuring in the
crossover of the permitted transitions is discussed.
