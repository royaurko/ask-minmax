The self-organized dopant percolative filamentary model, entirely orbital in
character (no fictive spins), explains the evolution with doping of Fermi arcs
observed by ARPES, including the previously unexplained abrupt transitions in
quasiparticle strength observed near optimal doping in cuprate high temperature
superconductors. Similarly abrupt transitions are also observed in
time-resolved picosecond relaxation spectroscopy at 1.5 eV, and these are
explained as well, using no new assumptions and no adjustable parameters.
