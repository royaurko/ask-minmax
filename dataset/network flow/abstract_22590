The magnetic noise spectra induced by direct-current (dc) current flowing
through a micron-scale ferromagnetic wire have been investigated. We have
observed the noise spectra with a resonance frequency. Under the application of
the magnetic field in the plane, the magnetic field dependences of the
resonance frequency and amplitude were well interpreted by the analytical
calculation based on the stochastic model. The noise spectra are attributable
to the resistance oscillation reflecting the uniform magnetization precession
which is produced by the Joule heating due to the dc current.
