We present the first numerical application of a method that we have recently
proposed to solve the Non Perturbative Renormalization Group equations and
obtain the n-point functions for arbitrary external momenta. This method leads
to flow equations for the n-point functions which are also differential
equations with respect to a constant background field. This makes them, a
priori, difficult to solve. However, we demonstrate in this paper that, within
a simple approximation which turns out to be quite accurate, the solution of
these flow equations is not more complicated than that of the flow equations
obtained in the derivative expansion. Thus, with a numerical effort comparable
to that involved in the derivative expansion, we can get the full momentum
dependence of the n-point functions. The method is applied, in its leading
order, to the calculation of the self-energy in a 3-dimensional scalar field
theory, at criticality. Accurate results are obtained over the entire range of
momenta.
