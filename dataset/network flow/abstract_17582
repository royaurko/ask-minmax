We consider the Navier-Stokes system describing the motion of a compressible
barotropic fluid driven by stochastic external forces. Our approach is
semi-deterministic, based on solving the system for each fixed representative
of the random variable and applying an abstract result on measurability of
multi-valued maps. The class of admissible driving forces includes the
(temporal) white noise and the random kicks, considered recently in the context
of incompressible fluid models.
