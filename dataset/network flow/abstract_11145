Nowadays, It has been shown that spectrum scarcity increased due to
tremendous growth of new players in wireless base system by the evolution of
the radio communication. Resent survey found that there are many areas of the
radio spectrum that are occupied by contributorized user/primary user (PU), which
are not fully utilized. Cognitive radios (CR) prove to next generation wireless
communication system that proposed as a way to reuse this under-utilised
spectrum in an opportunistic and non-interfering basis. A CR is a self-directed
entity in a wireless communications environment that senses its environment,
tracks changes, and reacts upon its findings and frequently exchanges
information with the networks for secondary user (SU). However, CR facing
collision problem with tracks changes i.e. reallocating of other empty channels
for SU while PU arrives. In this paper, channels reallocation technique based
on DNA sequence alignment algorithm for CR networks has been proposed.
