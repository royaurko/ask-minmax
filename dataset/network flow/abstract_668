Networks form the backbone of many complex systems, ranging from the Internet
to human societies. Accordingly, not only is the range of our interactions
limited and thus best described and modeled by networks, it is also a fact that
the networks that are an integral part of such models are often interdependent
or even interconnected. Networks of networks or multilayer networks are
therefore a more apt description of social systems. This colloquium is devoted
to evolutionary games on multilayer networks, and in particular to the
evolution of cooperation as one of the main pillars of modern human societies.
We first give an overview of the most significant conceptual differences
between single-layer and multilayer networks, and we provide basic definitions
and a classification of the most commonly used terms. Subsequently, we review
fascinating and counterintuitive evolutionary outcomes that emerge due to
different types of interdependencies between otherwise independent populations.
The focus is on coupling through the utilities of players, through the flow of
information, as well as through the popularity of different strategies on
different network layers. The colloquium highlights the importance of pattern
formation and collective behavior for the promotion of cooperation under
adverse conditions, as well as the synergies between network science and
evolutionary game theory.
