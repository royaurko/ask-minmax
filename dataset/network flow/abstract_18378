One approach to studying the system-wide organization of biochemistry is to
use statistical graph theory. Even in such a heavily simplified method, which
disregards most of the dynamic aspects of biochemistry, one is faced with
fundamental questions, such as how the chemical reaction systems should be
reduced to a graph retaining as much functional information as possible from
the original reaction system. In such graph representations, should the edges
go between substrates and products, or substrates and substrates, or both?
Should vertices represent substances or reactions? Different definitions encode
different information about the reaction system. In this paper we evaluate four
different graph representations of metabolism, applied to data from different
organisms and databases. The graph representations are evaluated by comparing
the overlap between clusters (network modules) and annotated functions, and
also by comparing the set of identified currency metabolites with those that
other contributors have identified using qualitative biological arguments. We find
that a "substance network," where all metabolites participating in a reaction
are connected, is relatively better than others, evaluated both with respect to
the functional overlap between modules and functions and to the number and
identity of identified currency metabolites.
