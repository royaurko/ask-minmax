In this paper we model pedestrian flows evacuating a narrow corridor through
an exit by a one-dimensional hyperbolic conservation law with a non-local
constraint. Existence and stability results for the Cauchy problem with
Lipschitz constraint are achieved by a procedure that combines the wave-front
tracking algorithm with the operator splitting method. The Riemann problem with
piecewise constant constraint is discussed in details, stressing the possible
lack of uniqueness, self-similarity and $\Lloc1$-continuity. One explicit
example of application is provided.
