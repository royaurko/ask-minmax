We have analyzed {\it Rossi} X-ray timing explorer (RXTE) pointed
observations of the outbursts of black hole and neutron star soft X-ray
transients in which an initial low/hard state or `island' state, followed by a
transition to a softer state, was observed. In three sources, the black hole
transient XTE J1550-564, the neutron star transient Aquila X-1 and a
quasi-persistent neutron star low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4U 1705-44, two such
outbursts were found. We find that the flux of the soft X-ray peak, which lags
the hard X-ray peak by a few days to several weeks, scales with the flux of the
hard X-ray peak. We conclude that we are able to predict the soft X-ray
outburst peak flux based on the `preceding' hard X-ray peak flux, implying an
early set up of the outbursts. We also find that the X-ray luminosity
corresponding to the peak of the hard X-ray flux, which corresponds to the
X-ray luminosity of the start of the hard-to-soft state transition, varies by a
factor of about 2. If the accretion geometry early in the outburst rise is
composed of two flows (e.g. a hot sub-Keplerian halo flow and a Keplerian disk
flow, or an outflow and a Keplerian disk flow), the correlation indicates that
the two flows are initially related, probably due to processes in the outer
part of the accretion disk. We discuss constraints on a single flow model and a
disk-jet model from these observations.
