This paper presents the intrinsic geometric model for the solution of power
system planning and its operation. This problem is large-scale and nonlinear,
in general. Thus, we have developed the intrinsic geometric model for the
network reliability and voltage stability, and examined it for the IEEE 5 bus
system. The robustness of the proposed model is illustrated by introducing
variations of the network parameters. Exact analytical results show the
accuracy as well as the efficiency of the proposed solution technique.
