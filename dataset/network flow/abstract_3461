By allowing intermediate nodes to perform non-trivial operations on packets,
such as mixing data from multiple streams, network coding breaks with the
ruling store and forward networking paradigm and opens a myriad of challenging
security questions. Following a brief overview of emerging network coding
protocols, we provide a taxonomy of their security vulnerabilities, which
highlights the differences between attack scenarios in which network coding is
particularly vulnerable and other relevant cases in which the intrinsic
properties of network coding allow for stronger and more efficient security
solutions than classical routing. Furthermore, we give practical examples where
network coding can be combined with classical cryptography both for secure
communication and secret key distribution. Throughout the paper we identify a
number of research challenges deemed relevant towards the applicability of
secure network coding in practical networks.
