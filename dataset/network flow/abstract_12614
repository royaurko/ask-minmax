In this paper we are concerned with the problem of data forwarding from a
wireless body area network (WBAN) to a gateway when body shadowing affects the
ability of WBAN nodes to communicate with the gateway. To solve this problem we
present a new WBAN architecture that uses two communication technologies. One
network is formed between on-body nodes, and is realized with capacitive
body-coupled communication (BCC), while an IEEE 802.15.4 radio frequency (RF)
network is used for forwarding data to the gateway. WBAN nodes that have
blocked RF links due to body shadowing forward their data through the BCC link
to a node that acts as a relay and has an active RF connection. For this
architecture we design a network layer protocol that manages the two
communication technologies and is responsible for relay selection and data
forwarding. Next, we develop analytical performance models of the medium access
control (MAC) protocols of the two independent communication links in order to
be used for driving the decisions of the previous algorithms. Finally, the
analytical models are used for further optimizing energy and delay efficiency.
We test our system under different configurations first by performing
simulations and next by using real RF traces.
