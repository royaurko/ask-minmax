We analyze a slow-fading interference network with MN non-cooperating
single-antenna sources and M non-cooperating single-antenna destinations. In
particular, we assume that the sources are divided into M mutually exclusive
groups of N sources each, every group is dedicated to transmit a common message
to a unique destination, all transmissions occur concurrently and in the same
frequency band and a dedicated 1-bit broadcast feedback channel from each
destination to its corresponding group of sources exists. We provide a
feedback-based iterative distributed (multi-user) beamforming algorithm, which
"learns" the channels between each group of sources and its assigned
destination. This algorithm is a straightforward generalization, to the
multi-user case, of the feedback-based iterative distributed beamforming
algorithm proposed recently by Mudumbai et al., in IEEE Trans. Inf. Th.
(submitted) for networks with a single group of sources and a single
destination. Putting the algorithm into a Markov chain context, we provide a
simple convergence proof. We then show that, for M finite and N approaching
infinity, spatial multiplexing based on the beamforming weights produced by the
algorithm achieves full spatial multiplexing gain of M and full per-stream
array gain of N, provided the time spent "learning'' the channels scales
linearly in N. The network is furthermore shown to "crystallize''. Finally, we
characterize the corresponding crystallization rate.
