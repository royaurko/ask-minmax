Data-flow analyses usually associate information with control flow regions.
Informally, if these regions are too small, like a point between two
consecutive statements, we call the analysis dense. On the other hand, if these
regions include many such points, then we call it sparse. This paper presents a
systematic method to build program representations that support sparse
analyses. To pave the way to this framework we clarify the bibliography about
well-known intermediate program representations. We show that our approach, up
to parameter choice, subsumes many of these representations, such as the SSA,
SSI and e-SSA forms. In particular, our algorithms are faster, simpler and more
frugal than the previous techniques used to construct SSI - Static Single
Information - form programs. We produce intermediate representations isomorphic
to Choi et al.'s Sparse Evaluation Graphs (SEG) for the family of data-flow
problems that can be partitioned per variables. However, contrary to SEGs, we
can handle - sparsely - problems that are not in this family.
