We classify generalised Camassa-Holm type equations which possess infinite
hierarchies of higher symmetries. We show that the obtained equations can be
treated as negative flows of integrable quasi-linear scalar evolution equations
of orders 2, 3 and 5. We present the corresponding Lax representations or
linearisation transformations for these equations. Some of the obtained
equations seem to be new.
