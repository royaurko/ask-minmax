  System reliability evaluation for flow networks is an important issue in our modern society. This paper studies the system reliability that a given amount of multicommodity can be transmitted through a stochastic-flow network, in which each are has several capacities, under the cost constraint. A simple algorithm is proposed to generate all ( d 1 , d 2 ,…, d p ; C )-MPs where d i is the demand of commodity i . The system reliability can then be calculated in terms of ( d 1 , d 2 ,…, d p ; C )-MPs. Keywords System reliability ; Multicommodity ; Stochastic-flow networks ; Cost constraint ; Minimalpaths 1.
