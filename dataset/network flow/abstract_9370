We review mathematically tractable models for connected networks on random
points in the plane, emphasizing the class of proximity graphs which deserves
to be better known to applied probabilists and statisticians. We introduce and
motivate a particular statistic $R$ measuring shortness of routes in a network.
We illustrate, via Monte Carlo in part, the trade-off between normalized
network length and $R$ in a one-parameter family of proximity graphs. How close
this family comes to the optimal trade-off over all possible networks remains
an intriguing open question. The paper is a write-up of a talk developed by the
first contributor during 2007--2009.
