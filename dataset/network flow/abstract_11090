In this paper we study the capacity region of the multi-pair bidirectional
(or two-way) wireless relay network, in which a relay node facilitates the
communication between multiple pairs of users. This network is a generalization
of the well known bidirectional relay channel, where we have only one pair of
users. We examine this problem in the context of the deterministic channel
interaction model, which eliminates the channel noise and allows us to focus on
the interaction between signals. We characterize the capacity region of this
network when the relay is operating at either full-duplex mode or half-duplex
mode (with non adaptive listen-transmit scheduling). In both cases we show that
the cut-set upper bound is tight and, quite interestingly, the capacity region
is achieved by a simple equation-forwarding strategy.
