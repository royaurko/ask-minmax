It is often stated in papers tackling the task of inferring Bayesian network
structures from data that there are these two distinct approaches: (i) Apply
conditional independence tests when testing for the presence or otherwise of
edges; (ii) Search the model space using a scoring metric. Here I argue that
for complete data and a given node ordering this division is a myth, by showing
that cross entropy methods for checking conditional independence are
mathematically identical to methods based upon discriminating between models by
their overall goodness-of-fit logarithmic scores.
