The process industry implements many techniques with certain parameters in
its operations to control the working of several actuators on field. Amongst
these actuators, DC motor is a very common machine. The angular position of DC
motor can be controlled to drive many processes such as the arm of a robot. The
most famous and well known controller for such applications is PID controller.
It uses proportional, integral and derivative functions to control the input
signal before sending it to the plant unit. In this paper, another controller
based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) control is examined to replace the PID
controller for controlling the angular position of a DC motor to drive a robot
arm. Simulation is performed in MATLAB after training the neural network
(supervised learning) and it is shown that results are acceptable and
applicable in process industry for reference control applications. The paper
also indicates that the ANN controller can be less complicated and less costly
to implement in industrial control applications as compared to some other
proposed schemes.
