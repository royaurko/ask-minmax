Firewalls use a rule database to decide which packets will be allowed from
one network onto another thereby implementing a security policy. In high-speed
networks as the inter-arrival rate of packets decreases, the latency incurred
by a firewall increases. In such a scenario, a single firewall become a
bottleneck and reduces the overall throughput of the network.A firewall with
heavy load, which is supposed to be a first line of defense against attacks,
becomes susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Many works are being
done to optimize firewalls.This paper presents our implementation of different
parallel firewall models on General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU).
We implemented the parallel firewall architecture proposed in and introduced a
new model that can effectively exploit the massively parallel computing
capabilities of GPGPU.
