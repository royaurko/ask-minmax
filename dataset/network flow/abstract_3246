This work proposes a model for granular deformation that predicts the stress
and velocity profiles in well-developed dense granular flows. Recent models for
granular elasticity (Jiang and Liu 2003) and rate-sensitive plastic flow (Jop
et al. 2006) are reformulated and combined into one universal granular
continuum law, capable of predicting flowing regions and stagnant zones
simultaneously in any arbitrary 3D flow geometry. The unification is performed
by justifying and implementing a Kroner-Lee elasto-plastic decomposition, with
care taken to ensure certain continuum physical principles are necessarily
upheld. The model is then numerically implemented in multiple geometries and
results are compared to experiments and discrete simulations.
