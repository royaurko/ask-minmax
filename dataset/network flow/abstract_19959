Enchanting ripple pattern exist on interface, and manifest them self in it's
fluctuation profile as well. These ripples apparently flow as the interface
struck with inhomogeneous externally driven field interface, moves fluctuating
about it on a rectangular 3D Ising system. Ripple structure and flow have
temporal periodicity, eventually with some modulation, and have signature of
geometry of field interface. Dramatic transitions occur in fluctuation profile
as a function of dynamics and geometry of the force field interface and is
divided into two spatial regions : rippled and smooth. For the velocity we are
concerned with, the interface is pinned with field interface, and for arbitrary
orientations of the field profile local slope of the rippled part of the
interface gets locked in to a combination of few rational values (Devil's
staircase) which most closely approximate the profile, thereby generating
specular pattern of patches.
