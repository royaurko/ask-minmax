This paper proposes entitymetrics to measure the impact of knowledge units.
Entitymetrics highlight the importance of entities embedded in scientific
literature for further knowledge discovery. In this paper, we use Metformin, a
drug for diabetes, as an example to form an entity-entity citation network
based on literature related to Metformin. We then calculate the network
features and compare the centrality ranks of biological entities with results
from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). The comparison demonstrates the
usefulness of entitymetrics to detect most of the outstanding interactions
manually curated in CTD.
