We study the self-avoiding walk on complex fractal networks called the
(u,v)-flower by mapping it to the N-vector model in a generating function
formalism. First, we analytically calculate the critical exponent {\nu} and the
connective constant by a renormalization-group analysis in arbitrary fractal
dimensions. We find that the exponent {\nu} is equal to the displacement
exponent, which describes the speed of diffusion in terms of the shortest
distance. Second, by obtaining an exact solution for the (u,u)-flower, we
provide an example which supports the conjecture that the universality class of
the self-avoiding walk on graphs is not determined only by the fractal
dimension.
