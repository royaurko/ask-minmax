In this technical report we analyse the performance of diffusion strategies
applied to the Least-Mean-Square adaptive filter. We configure a network of
cooperative agents running adaptive filters and discuss their behaviour when
compared with a non-cooperative agent which represents the average of the
network. The analysis provides conditions under which diversity in the filter
parameters is beneficial in terms of convergence and stability. Simulations
drive and support the analysis.
