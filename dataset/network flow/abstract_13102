We present a new and simple approach to the theory of multiple operator
integrals that applies to unbounded operators affiliated with general von
Neumann algebras. For semifinite von Neumann algebras we give applications to
the Fr\'echet differentiation of operator functions that sharpen existing
results, and establish the Birman-Solomyak representation of the spectral shift
function of M.G. Krein in terms of an average of spectral measures in the type
II setting. We also exhibit a surprising connection between the spectral shift
function and spectral flow.
