Nowadays, social networks became essential in information exchange between
individuals. Indeed, as users of these networks, we can send messages to other
people according to the links connecting us. Moreover, given the large volume
of exchanged messages, detecting the true nature of the received message
becomes a challenge. For this purpose, it is interesting to consider this new
tendency with reasoning under uncertainty by using the theory of belief
functions. In this paper, we tried to model a social network as being a network
of fusion of information and determine the true nature of the received message
in a well-defined node by proposing a new model: the belief social network.
