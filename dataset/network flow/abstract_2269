This is the second paper of our series of papers on one dimensional conformal
metric flows. In this paper we continue our studies of the one dimensional
conformal metric flows, which were introduced in math.AP/0611254. We prove the
global existence and convergence of the one dimensional Yamabe and affine
flows. Furthermore, we obtain exponential convergence of the metrics under
these flows.
