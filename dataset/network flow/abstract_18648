Social media users have finite attention which limits the number of incoming
messages from friends they can process. Moreover, they pay more attention to
opinions and recommendations of some friends more than others. In this paper,
we propose LA-LDA, a latent topic model which incorporates limited,
non-uniformly divided attention in the diffusion process by which opinions and
information spread on the social network. We show that our proposed model is
able to learn more accurate user models from users' social network and item
adoption behavior than models which do not take limited attention into account.
We analyze voting on news items on the social news aggregator Digg and show
that our proposed model is better able to predict held out votes than
alternative models. Our study demonstrates that psycho-socially motivated
models have better ability to describe and predict observed behavior than
models which only consider topics.
