A detailed characterization of avalanche dynamics of wet granular media in a
rotating drum apparatus is presented. The results confirm the existence of the
three wetness regimes observed previously: the granular, the correlated and the
viscoplastic regime. These regimes show qualitatively different dynamic
behaviors which are reflected in all the investigated quantities. We discuss
the effect of interstitial liquid on the characteristic angles of the material
and on the avalanche size distribution. These data also reveal logarithmic
aging and allow us to map out the phase diagram of the dynamical behavior as a
function of liquid content and flow rate. Via quantitative measurements of the
flow velocity and the granular flux during avalanches, we characterize novel
avalanche types unique to wet media. We also explore the details of
viscoplastic flow (observed at the highest liquid contents) in which there are
lasting contacts during flow, leading to coherence across the entire sample.
This coherence leads to a velocity independent flow depth at high rotation
rates and novel robust pattern formation in the granular surface.
