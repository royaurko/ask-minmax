Wireless systems, which include cellular phones, have become an essential
part of the modern life. However the mounting evidence that cellular radiation
might adversely affect the health of its users, leads to a growing concern
among contributorities and the general public. Radiating antennas in the proximity
of the user, such as antennas of mobile phones are of special interest for this
matter. In this paper we suggest a new architecture for wireless networks,
aiming at minimal emission from mobile stations, without any additional
radiation sources. The new architecture, dubbed Green Cellular, abandons the
classical transceiver base station design and suggests the augmentation of
transceiver base stations with receive only devices. These devices, dubbed
Green Antennas, are not aiming at coverage extension but rather at minimizing
the emission from mobile stations. We discuss the implications of the Green
Cellular architecture on 3G and 4G cellular technologies. We conclude by
showing that employing the Green Cellular approach may lead to a significant
decrease in the emission from mobile stations, especially in indoor scenarios.
This is achieved without exposing the user to any additional radiation source.
