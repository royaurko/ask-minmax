We study resonances of surfaces of revolution obtained by removing a disk
from a cone and attaching a hyperbolic cusp in its place. These surfaces
include ones with nontrapping geodesic flow (every maximally extended
non-reflected geodesic is unbounded) and yet infinitely many long living
resonances (resonances with uniformly bounded imaginary part, i.e. decay rate).
