HIV/AIDs Regimen specification one of many problems for which
bioinformaticians have implemented and trained machine learning methods such as
neural networks. Predicting HIV resistance would be much easier, but
unfortunately we rarely have enough structural information available to train a
neural network. To network model designed to predict how long the HIV patient
can prolong his/her life time with certain regimen specification. To learn this
model 300 patient's details have taken as a training set to train the network
and 100 patients medical history has taken to test this model. This network
model is trained using MAT lab implementation.
