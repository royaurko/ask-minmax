One of the most recent architectures of networks is Software-Defined Networks
(SDNs) using a con- troller appliance to control the set of switches on the
network. The controlling process includes installing or uninstalling
packet-processing rules on flow tables of switches. This paper presents a
high-level imperative network programming language, called ImNet, to facilitate
writing efficient, yet simple, programs executed by controller to manage
switches. ImNet is simply-structured, expressive, compositional, and
imperative. This paper also introduces an operational semantics to ImNet.
Detailed examples of programs (with their operational semantics) constructed in
ImNet are illustrated in the paper as well.
