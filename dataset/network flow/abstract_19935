Deposition patterns of particles suspended in evaporating colloidal drops are
determined by the flow fields within the drops. Using analytically determined
velocities, particle motions are then tracked in a Lagrangian sense. It is
found that the majority of particles intersect the free surface as it recedes.
Such "capture" of particles by the free surface is found to be the major
mechanism in establishing the deposition pattern. Patterns are calculated for
wetting and non-wetting drops whose contact lines are either pinned or freely
moving during evaporation. The distribution of evaporative flux which drives
the flows is taken to be that engendered by gas-phase diffusion. The
theoretical results are found to agree favorably with available experimental
data.
