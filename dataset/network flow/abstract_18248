Uncoordinated individuals in human society pursuing their personally optimal
strategies do not always achieve the social optimum, the most beneficial state
to the society as a whole. Instead, strategies form Nash equilibria which are
often socially suboptimal. Society, therefore, has to pay a price of anarchy
for the lack of coordination among its members. Here we assess this price of
anarchy by analyzing the travel times in road networks of several major cities.
Our simulation shows that uncoordinated drivers possibly waste a considerable
amount of their travel time. Counterintuitively,simply blocking certain streets
can partially improve the traffic conditions. We analyze various complex
networks and discuss the possibility of similar paradoxes in physics.
