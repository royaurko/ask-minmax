We consider here the morphogenesis (pattern formation) problem for some
genetic network models. First, we show that any given spatio-temporal pattern
can be generated by a genetic network involving a sufficiently large number of
genes. Moreover, patterning process can be performed by an effective algorithm.
We also show that Turing's or Meinhardt's type reaction-diffusion models can be
approximated by genetic networks. These results exploit the fundamental fact
that the genes form functional units and are organised in blocks (modular
principle). Due to this modular organisation, the genes always are capable to
construct any new patterns and even any time sequences of new patterns from old
patterns. Computer simulations illustrate analytical results.
