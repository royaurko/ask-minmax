The international trade network (ITN) has received renewed multidisciplinary
interest due to recent advances in network theory. However, it is still unclear
whether a network approach conveys additional, nontrivial information with
respect to traditional international-economics analyses that describe world
trade only in terms of local (first-order) properties. In this and in a
companion paper, we employ a recently proposed randomization method to assess
in detail the role that local properties have in shaping higher-order patterns
of the ITN in all its possible representations (binary/weighted,
directed/undirected, aggregated/disaggregated by commodity) and across several
years. Here we show that, remarkably, the properties of all binary projections
of the network can be completely traced back to the degree sequence, which is
therefore maximally informative. Our results imply that explaining the observed
degree sequence of the ITN, which has not received particular attention in
economic theory, should instead become one the main focuses of models of trade.
