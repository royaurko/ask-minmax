We consider multiclass feedforward queueing networks with first in first out
and priority service disciplines at the nodes, and class dependent
deterministic routing between nodes. The random behavior of the network is
constructed from cumulative arrival and service time processes which are
assumed to satisfy an appropriate sample path large deviation principle. We
establish logarithmic asymptotics of large deviations for waiting time, idle
time, queue length, departure and sojourn-time processes in critical loading.
This transfers similar results from Puhalskii about single class queueing
networks with feedback to multiclass feedforward queueing networks, and
complements diffusion approximation results from Peterson. An example with
renewal inter arrival and service time processes yields the rate function of a
reflected Brownian motion. The model directly captures stationary situations.
