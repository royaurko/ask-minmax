We present faster approximation algorithms for generalized network flow
problems. A generalized flow is one in which the flow out of an edge differs
from the flow into the edge by a constant factor. We limit ourselves to the
lossy case, when these factors are at most 1.
  Our algorithm uses a standard interior-point algorithm to solve a linear
program formulation of the network flow problem. The system of linear equations
that arises at each step of the interior-point algorithm takes the form of a
symmetric M-matrix. We present an algorithm for solving such systems in nearly
linear time. The algorithm relies on the Spielman-Teng nearly linear time
algorithm for solving linear systems in diagonally-dominant matrices.
  For a graph with m edges, our algorithm obtains an additive epsilon
approximation of the maximum generalized flow and minimum cost generalized flow
in time tildeO(m^(3/2) * log(1/epsilon)). In many parameter ranges, this
improves over previous algorithms by a factor of approximately m^(1/2). We also
obtain a similar improvement for exactly solving the standard min-cost flow
problem.
