Recently, stochastic, as opposed to deterministic, parameterizations are
being investigated to model the effects of unresolved subgrid scales (SGS) in
large eddy simulations (LES) of geophysical flows. We analyse such a stochastic
approach in the barotropic vorticity equation to show that (i) if the
stochastic parameterization approximates the actual SGS stresses, then the
solution of the stochastic LES approximates the "true" solution at appropriate
scale sizes; and that (ii) when the filter scale size approaches zero, the
solution of the stochastic LES approaches the true solution.
