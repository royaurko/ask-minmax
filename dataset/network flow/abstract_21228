In this paper we prove that random $d$--regular graphs with $d\geq 3$ have
traffic congestion of the order $O(n\log_{d-1}^{3}(n))$ where $n$ is the number
of nodes and geodesic routing is used. We also show that these graphs are not
asymptotically $\delta$--hyperbolic for any non--negative $\delta$ almost
surely as $n\to\infty$.
