A sensitivity analysis of general stoichiometric networks is considered. The
results are presented as a generalization of Metabolic Control Analysis, which
has been concerned primarily with system sensitivities at steady state. An
expression for time-varying sensitivity coefficients is given, and the
Summation and Connectivity Theorems are generalized. The results are compared
to previous treatments. The analysis is accompanied by a discussion of the
computation of the sensitivity coefficients and an application to a model of
phototransduction.
