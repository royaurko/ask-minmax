We study the melting temperature of heavy mesons in the hot medium of light
quarks. By solving the covariant Schr\"odinger equations at finite temperature
for mesons $D$, $\phi$ and $J/\psi$, we obtained the temperature dependence of
their masses, binding energies and averaged sizes and found the flavor
dependence of the melting temperature: $T_D \simeq T_\phi < T_{J/\psi}$. The
sequential melting temperature can explain the difference in meson elliptic
flow observed in heavy ion collisions.
