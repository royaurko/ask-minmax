We construct noncompact solutions to the affine normal flow of hypersurfaces,
and show that all ancient solutions must be either ellipsoids (shrinking
solitons) or paraboloids (translating solitons). We also provide a new proof of
the existence of a hyperbolic affine sphere asymptotic to the boundary of a
convex cone containing no lines, which is originally due to Cheng-Yau. The main
techniques are local second-derivative estimates for a parabolic Monge-Ampere
equation modeled on those of Ben Andrews and Gutierrez-Huang, a decay estimate
for the cubic form under the affine normal flow due to Ben Andrews, and a
hypersurface barrier due to Calabi.
