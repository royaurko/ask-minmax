Reliable spectrum sensing is a key functionality of a cognitive radio
network. Cooperative spectrum sensing improves the detection reliability of a
cognitive radio system but also increases the system energy consumption which
is a critical factor particularly for low-power wireless technologies. A
censored truncated sequential spectrum sensing technique is considered as an
energy-saving approach. To design the underlying sensing parameters, the
maximum energy consumption per sensor is minimized subject to a lower bounded
global probability of detection and an upper bounded false alarm rate. This way
both the interference to the primary user due to miss detection and the network
throughput as a result of a low false alarm rate is controlled. We compare the
performance of the proposed scheme with a fixed sample size censoring scheme
under different scenarios. It is shown that as the sensing cost of the
cognitive radios increases, the energy efficiency of the censored truncated
sequential approach grows significantly.
