We have carried out shear-deformation simulations on amorphous Mg-Cu systems
at zero temperature and pressure, containing 2048-131072 atoms. At the largest
size a smooth stress-strain curve is obtained with a well-defined flow stress.
In the smallest system there are severe discontinuities in the stress-strain
curve caused by localized plastic events. We show that the events can be
characterized by a slip volume and a critical stress and we determine the
distribution of these quantities from the ensemble of all events occurring in
the small system. The distribution of critical stresses at which the enthalpy
barriers for the individual events vanish is spread between 200 MPa and 500 MPa
with a mean of 316 MPa, close to the flow stress observed in the largest
system.
