We show that convexity of the effective action follows from its functional
flow equation. Our analysis is based on a new, spectral representation. The
results are relevant for the study of physical instabilities. We also derive
constraints for convexity-preserving regulators within general truncation
schemes including proper-time flows, and bounds for infrared anomalous
dimensions of propagators.
