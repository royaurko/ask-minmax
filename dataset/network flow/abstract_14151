We present dynamically consistent solutions for hot accretion onto
unmagnetized, rotating white dwarfs (WDs) in five quiescent dwarf novae. The
measured WD rotation rates (and other system parameters) in RX And, SS Cyg, U
Gem, VW Hyi and WZ Sge imply spindown of the WD by an extended hot flow
emitting most of its X-rays in the vicinity of the stellar surface. In general,
energy advection is absent and the flow is stable to convection and
hydrodynamical outflows. In rapidly rotating systems, the X-ray luminosity
provides only an upper limit on the quiescent accretion rate because of
substantial stellar spindown luminosity. We suggest that the presence of hot
flows in quiescent dwarf novae may limit the long-term WD rotation rates to
significantly sub-Keplerian values.
