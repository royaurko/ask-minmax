The slow-to-start models are a classical cellular automata model in
simulating vehicle traffic. However, to our knowledge, the slow-to-start effect
has not considered in modeling pedestrian dynamic. We verify the similar
behavior between pedestrian and vehicle, and propose an new lattice gas (LG)
model called the slow reaction (SR) model to describe the pedestrian's delayed
reaction in single-file movement. We simulate and reproduce the Seyfried's
field experiments at the research centre Julich, and use its empirical data to
validate our SR model. We compare the SR model with the standard LG model. We
test different probability of slow reaction ps in SR model and found the
simulation data of ps=0.3 fit the empirical data best. The RMS error of mean
velocity of SR model is smaller than that of standard LG model. In the range of
ps=0.1~0.3, our fundamental diagram between velocity and density by simulation
coincides with field experiments. The distribution of individual velocity in
fundamental diagram in SR model agrees with the empirical data better than that
of standard LG model. In addition, we observe the stop-and-go waves and phase
separation in pedestrian flow by simulation. We reproduced the phenomena of
uneven distribution of interspaces by SR model while the standard LG model did
not implement. The SR model can reproduce the evolution of spatio-temporal
structures of pedestrian flow with higher fidelity to Seyfried's experiments
than the standard LG model.
