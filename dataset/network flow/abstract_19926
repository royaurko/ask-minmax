The NA60 experiment at the CERN SPS has studied low-mass dimuon production in
158A GeV In-In collisions. A significant excess of pairs is observed above the
yield expected from neutral meson decays, consistent with a dominant
contribution from $\pi\pi\to\rho\to\mu\mu$. This paper presents precision
results on the mass and transverse momentum spectra of the excess pairs. The
space-time averaged rho spectral function associated to the measured mass
distribution shows a significant broadening, but essentially no mass shift. The
slope parameter $T_{eff}$ extracted from the spectra rises with dimuon mass up
to the $\rho$, followed by a sudden decline above. While the initial rise is
consistent with the expectations for radial flow of a hadronic decay source,
the decline indicates a transition to an emission source with much smaller
flow, possibly of partonic origin.
