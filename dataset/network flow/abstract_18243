We consider the discrete surface growth process with relaxation to the
minimum [F. Family, J. Phys. A {\bf 19} L441, (1986).] as a possible
synchronization mechanism on scale-free networks, characterized by a degree
distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}$, where $k$ is the degree of a node and
$\lambda$ his broadness, and compare it with the usually applied
Edward-Wilkinson process [S. F. Edwards and D. R. Wilkinson, Proc. R. Soc.
London Ser. A {\bf 381},17 (1982) ]. In spite of both processes belong to the
same universality class for Euclidean lattices, in this work we demonstrate
that for scale-free networks with exponents $\lambda<3$ this is not true.
Moreover, we show that for these ubiquitous cases the Edward-Wilkinson process
enhances spontaneously the synchronization when the system size is increased,
which is a non-physical result. Contrarily, the discrete surface growth process
do not present this flaw and is applicable for every $\lambda$.
