Space and time resolved concentrations of helium metastable atoms in an
atmospheric pressure radio-frequency micro-plasma jet were measured using
tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. Spatial profiles as well as
lifetime measurements show significant influences of air entering the discharge
from the front nozzle and of impurities originating from the gas supply system.
Quenching of metastables was used to deduce quantitative concentrations of
intruding impurities. The impurity profile along the jet axis was determined
from optical emission spectroscopy as well as their dependance on the feed gas
flow through the jet.
