In order to describe behavior of various liquid-like materials at high
pressures, incompressible fluid models with pressure dependent viscosity seem
to be a suitable choice. In the context of implicit constitutive relations
involving the Cauchy stress and the velocity gradient these models are
consistent with standard procedures of continuum mechanics. Understanding
mathematical properties of governing equations is connected with various types
of idealization, some of them lead to studies in unbounded domains. In this
paper, we first bring up several characteristic features concerning fluids with
pressure dependent viscosity. Then we study three-dimensional flows of a class
of fluids with the viscosity depending on the pressure and the shear rate. By
means of higher differentiability methods we establish large data existence of
a weak solution for the Cauchy problem. This seems to be a first result that
analyzes flows of considered fluids in unbounded domains. Even in the context
of purely shear rate dependent fluids of a power-law type the result presented
here improves some of earlier works.
