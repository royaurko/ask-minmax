The Bluetooth protocol can be used for intervehicle communication equipped
with Bluetooth devices. This work investigates the challenges and feasibility
of developing intelligent driving system providing timesensitive information
about traffic conditions and roadside facilities. The architecture for
collaborative vehicle communication system is presented using the concepts of
wireless networks and Bluetooth protocol. We discuss how vehicles can form
mobile ad-hoc networks and exchange data by the on-board Bluetooth sensors. The
key design concepts of the intelligent driving service infrastructure are
analyzed showing collaborative fusion of multiple positional data could give a
better understanding of the surrounding traffic conditions for collaborative
driving. The technical feasibility of using Bluetooth for data exchange among
moving vehicles is evaluated.
