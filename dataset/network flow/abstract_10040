There is no known model in holography exhibiting a $c$-theorem where the
central charges of the dual CFT are distinct. We examine a holographic model of
RG flows in a framework where the bulk gravity theory contains higher curvature
terms. The latter allows us to distinguish the flow of the central charges $a$
and $c$ in the dual field theories in four dimensions. One finds that the flow
of $a$ is naturally monotonic but that of $c$ is not. Extending the analysis of
holographic RG flows to higher dimensions, we are led to formulate a novel
c-theorem in arbitrary dimensions for a universal coefficient appearing in the
entanglement entropy of the fixed point CFT's.
