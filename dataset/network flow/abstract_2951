We introduce network $L$-cloning, a technique for creating ensembles of
random networks from any given real-world or artificial network. Each member of
the ensemble is an $L$-cloned network constructed from $L$ copies of the
original network. The degree distribution of an $L$-cloned network and, more
importantly, the degree-degree correlation between and beyond nearest neighbors
are identical to those of the original network. The density of triangles in an
\LC network, and hence its clustering coefficient, is reduced by a factor of
$L$ compared to those of the original network. Furthermore, the density of
loops of any fixed length approaches zero for sufficiently large values of $L$.
Other variants of $L$-cloning allow us to keep intact the short loops of
certain lengths. As an application, we employ these network cloning methods to
investigate the effect of short loops on dynamical processes running on
networks and to inspect the accuracy of corresponding tree-based theories. We
demonstrate that dynamics on $L$-cloned networks (with sufficiently large $L$)
are accurately described by the so-called adjacency tree-based theories,
examples of which include the message passing technique, some pair
approximation methods, and the belief propagation algorithm used respectively
to study bond percolation, SI epidemics, and the Ising model.
