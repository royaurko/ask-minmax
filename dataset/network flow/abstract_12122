Based on our physical and biological studies we have recently developed a
mathematical framework for the analysis of nonlnear dynamics. We call this
framework the dynamical structure analysis. It has four dynamical elements:
potential landscape, transverse matrix, descendant matrix, and stochastic
drive. In particular, the importance and the existence of the potential
landscape is emphasized.
  The dynamical structure analysis is illustrated in detail by the study of
stability, robustness, and efficiency of the simplest gene regulatory network
of phage lambda.
