Large scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on two-phase immiscible flows
show that associated with the moving contact line, there is a very large $1/x$
partial-slip region where $x$ denotes the distance from the contact line. This
power-law partial-slip region is verified in large-scale adaptive continuum
simulations based on a local, continuum hydrodynamic formulation, which has
proved successful in reproducing MD results at the nanoscale. Both MD and
continuum simulations indicate the existence of a universal slip profile in the
Stokes-flow regime, well described by $v^{slip}(x)/V_w=1/(1+{x}/{al_s})$, where
$v^{slip}$ is the slip velocity, $V_w$ the speed of moving wall, $l_s$ the slip
length, and $a$ is a numerical constant. Implications for the contact-line
dissipation are discussed.
