We investigate numerically the influence of an homogeneous shear flow on the
spinodal decomposition of a binary mixture by solving the Cahn-Hilliard
equation in a two-dimensional geometry. Several aspects of this much studied
problem are clarified. Our numerical data show unambiguously that, in the shear
flow, the domains have on average an elliptic shape. The time evolution of the
three parameters describing this ellipse are obtained for a wide range of shear
rates. For the lowest shear rates investigated, we find the growth laws for the
two principal axis $R_\perp (t) \sim constant$, $R_\parallel(t) \sim t$, while
the mean orientation of the domains with respect to the flow is inversely
proportional to the strain. This implies that when hydrodynamics is neglected a
shear flow does not stop the domain growth process. We investigate also the
possibility of dynamic scaling, and show that only a non trivial form of
scaling holds, as predicted by a recent analytical approach to the case of a
non-conserved order parameter. We show that a simple physical argument may
account for these results.
