Network-level Redundancy Elimination (RE) techniques have been proposed to
reduce the amount of traffic in the Internet. and the costs of the WAN access
in the Internet. RE middleboxes are usually placed in the network access
gateways and strip off the repeated data from the packets. More recently,
generic network-level caching architectures have been proposed as alternative
to reduce the redundant data traffic in the network, presenting benefits and
drawbacks compared to RE. In this paper, we compare a generic in-network
caching architecture against state-of-the-art redundancy elimination (RE)
solutions on real network topologies, presenting the advantages of each
technique. Our results show that in-network caching architectures outperform
state-of-the-art RE solutions across a wide range of traffic characteristics
and parameters.
