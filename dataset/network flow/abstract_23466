At low temperatures, dynamics in amorphous silicon occurs through a sequence
of discrete activated events that locally reorganize the topological network.
Using the activation-relaxation technique, a data base containing over 8000
such events is generated, and the events are analyzed with respect to their
energy barrier and asymmetry, displacement and volume expansion/contraction.
Special attention is paid to those events corresponding to diffusing
coordination defects. The energetics is not clearly correlated with the
displacement, nor with the defect density in well relaxed configurations. We
find however some correlation with the local volume expansion: it tends to
increase by about 4 eV/\AA$^3$. The topological properties of these events are
also studied; they show an unexpectedly rich diversity.
