We report the discovery of nearly a dozen collimated outflows from young
stellar objects embedded in the molecular filament that extends north of the
Orion Nebula towards the H II region NGC 1977. The large number of nearly
co-eval outflows and embedded class-0 young stellar objects indicates that the
OMC-2/3 region is one of the most active sites of on-going low to intermediate
mass star formation known. These outflows were identified in the 2.12 microns
v=1-0 S(1) H_2 line during a survey of a 6 arcmin X 16 arcmin region containing
the OMC-2 and OMC-3 cloud cores and over a dozen recently discovered class-0
protostars. We also observe filamentary emission that is likely to trace
possible fluorescent H_2 in photo-dissociation regions associated with M 43 and
NGC 1977. Neither the suspected outflows nor the fluorescent emission are seen
at the continuum wavelength of 2.14 microns which confirms their emission line
nature. Several of the new H_2 flows are associated with recently discovered
bipolar molecular outflows. However, the most prominent bipolar CO outflow from
the region (the MMS 8 flow) has no clear H_2 counterpart. Several H_2 flows
consist of chains of knots and compact bow shocks that likely trace highly
collimated protostellar jets. Our discovery of more than 80 individual H_2
emitting shocks demonstrate that outflows from young stars are churning this
molecular cloud.
