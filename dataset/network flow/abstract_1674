A one-dimensional driven lattice gas with disorder in the particle hopping
probabilities is considered. It has previously been shown that in the version
of the model with random sequential updating, a phase transition occurs from a
low density inhomogeneous phase to a high density congested phase. Here the
steady states for both parallel (fully synchronous) updating and ordered
sequential updating are solved exactly and the phase transition shown to
persist in both cases. For parallel dynamics and forward ordered sequential
dynamics the phase transition occurs at the same density but for backward
ordered sequential dynamics it occurs at a higher density. In both cases the
critical density is higher than that for random sequential dynamics. In all the
models studied the steady state velocity is related to the fugacity of a Bose
system suggesting a principle of minimisation of velocity. A generalisation of
the dynamics where the hopping probabilities depend on the number of empty
sites in front of the particles, is also solved exactly in the case of parallel
updating. The models have natural interpretations as simplistic descriptions of
traffic flow. The relation to more sophisticated traffic flow models is
discussed.
