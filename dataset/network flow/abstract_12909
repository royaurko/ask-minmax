We performed numerical simulations and experiments on Josephson vortex flow
transistors based on parallel arrays of YBa2Cu3O(7-x) grain boundary junctions
with a cross gate-line allowing to operate the same devices in two different
modes named Josephson fluxon transistor (JFT) and Josephson fluxon-antifluxon
transistor (JFAT). The simulations yield a general expression for the current
gain vs. number of junctions and normalized loop inductance and predict higher
current gain for the JFAT. The experiments are in good agreement with
simulations and show improved coupling between gate line and junctions for the
JFAT as compared to the JFT.
