A model for advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in a global magnetic
field is proposed. In contrast to the well known ADAF models in which the
viscosity of a fluid determines both angular momentum transfer and energy
dissipation in the flow, the magnetic field and the electric resistivity,
respectively, control them in this model. A manageable set of analytic
solutions for the flow and the magnetic field is obtained to vertically
non-integrated basic equations. This set describes mathematically a fully
advective accretion flow and, in physically plausible situations for most AGNs,
it is also confirmed that the radiation cooling estimated on this solution is
really negligible compared with the internal energy of the flow.
