Within the framework of liquid crystal flows, the Qian & Sheng (QS) model for
Q-tensor dynamics is compared to the Volovik & Kats (VK) theory of biaxial
nematics by using Hamilton's variational principle. Under the assumption of
rotational dynamics for the $Q-$tensor, the two approaches are shown to be
equivalent in their conservative limit and therefore the VK model emerges a
special case of QS dynamics. Also, after presenting a micropolar variant of the
VK model, Rayleigh dissipation is included in the treatment. Finally, the
treatment is extended to account for nontrivial eigenvalue dynamics
(non-isospectral flows) in the VK model and this is done by considering the
effect of scaling factors in the evolution of the $Q-$tensor.
