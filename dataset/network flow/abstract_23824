We discuss a non-equilibrium statistical system on a graph or network.
Identical particles are injected, interact with each other, traverse, and leave
the graph in a stochastic manner described in terms of Poisson rates, possibly
dependent on time and instantaneous occupation numbers at the nodes of the
graph. We show that under the assumption of constancy of the relative rates,
the system demonstrates a profound statistical symmetry, resulting in geometric
universality of the statistics of the particle currents. This phenomenon
applies broadly to many man-made and natural open stochastic systems, such as
queuing of packages over the internet, transport of electrons and
quasi-particles in mesoscopic systems, and chains of reactions in bio-chemical
networks. We illustrate the utility of our general approach using two enabling
examples from the two latter disciplines.
