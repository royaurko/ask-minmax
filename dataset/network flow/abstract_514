In this paper, a cooperative transmission design for a general multi-node
half-duplex wireless relay network is presented. It is assumed that the nodes
operate in half-duplex mode and that channel information is available at the
nodes. The proposed design involves solving a convex flow optimization problem
on a graph that models the relay network. A much simpler generalized-link
selection protocol based on the above design is also presented. Both the
proposed flow-optimized protocol and the generalized-link selection protocol
are shown to achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for the
relay network. Moreover, simulation results are presented to quantify the gap
between the performances of the proposed protocols and that of a
max-flow-min-cut type bound, in terms of outage probability.
