This paper develops the first class of algorithms that enables unbiased
estimation of steady-state expectations for multidimensional reflected Brownian
motion. In order to explain our ideas we first consider the case of compound
Poisson input. In this case, we analyze the complexity of our procedure as the
dimension of the network increases and show that under certain assumptions the
algorithm has polynomial expected termination time as the dimension increases.
Our methodology includes procedures that are of interest beyond steady-state
simulation and reflected processes. For instance, we use wavelets to construct
a piece-wise linear function that can be guaranteed to be within $\varepsilon$
distance (deterministic) in the uniform norm to Brownian motion in any compact
time interval.
