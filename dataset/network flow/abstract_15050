We describe our plan to develop a large-scale cluster system with a peak
speed of 14.3Tflops for lattice QCD at the Center for Computational Sciences,
University of Tsukuba, as a successor to the current 0.6Tflops CP-PACS
computer. The system consist of 2560 nodes connected by a 16x16x10
three-dimensional hyper crossbar network. Each node has a single low-voltage
2.8GHz Xeon processor and 2GBytes of memory with 6.4GBytes/sec bandwidth, and
160 GBytes of disk in RAID1 mode. The network link in each of the three
directions is made of dual Gigabit Ethernet with the peak throughput of
250MByte/sec. Hence each node has an aggregate network bandwidth of
750MByte/sec. The system will run under Linux and SCore, and an extension of
the PM driver is developed for the network. The system will be developed
jointly with Hitachi Limited. The installation is scheduled in the first
quarter of Japanese Fiscal 2006 (April-June 2006) and the start of operation is
expected in July 2006.
