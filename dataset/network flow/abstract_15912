This paper analyzes the outage performance in finite wireless networks.
Unlike most prior works, which either assumed a specific network shape or
considered a special location of the reference receiver, we propose two general
frameworks for analytically computing the outage probability at any arbitrary
location of an arbitrarily-shaped finite wireless network: (i) a moment
generating function-based framework which is based on the numerical inversion
of the Laplace transform of a cumulative distribution and (ii) a reference link
power gain-based framework which exploits the distribution of the fading power
gain between the reference transmitter and receiver. The outage probability is
spatially averaged over both the fading distribution and the possible locations
of the interferers. The boundary effects are accurately accounted for using the
probability distribution function of the distance of a random node from the
reference receiver. For the case of the node locations modeled by a Binomial
point process and Nakagami-$m$ fading channel, we demonstrate the use of the
proposed frameworks to evaluate the outage probability at any location inside
either a disk or polygon region. The analysis illustrates the location
dependent performance in finite wireless networks and highlights the importance
of accurately modeling the boundary effects.
