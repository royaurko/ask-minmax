A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such as remote
environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled by the
availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller,
cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces
with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design
of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors
such as the environment, the applications design objectives, cost, hardware,
and system constraints. The goal of survey is to present a comprehensive review
of the recent literature in wireless sensor network. This paper reviews the
major development and new research challenges in this area.
