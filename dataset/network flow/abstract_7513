We study N=1 domain wall solutions of type IIB supergravity compactified on a
Calabi-Yau manifold in the presence of RR and NS electric and magnetic fluxes.
We show that the dynamics of the scalar fields along the direction transverse
to the domain wall is described by gradient flow equations controlled by a
superpotential W. We then provide a geometrical interpretation of the gradient
flow equations in terms of the mirror symmetric compactification of type IIA.
They correspond to a set of generalized Hitchin flow equations of a manifold
with SU(3)xSU(3)structure which is fibered over the direction transverse to the
domain wall.
