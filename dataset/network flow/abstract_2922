Within the framework of a two-fluid description possible pathways for the
generation of fast flows (dynamical as well as steady) in the lower solar
atmosphere is established. It is shown that a primary plasma flow (locally
sub-Alfv\'enic) is accelerated when interacting with emerging/ambient
arcade--like closed field structures. The acceleration implies a conversion of
thermal and field energies to kinetic energy of the flow. The time-scale for
creating reasonably fast flows ($\gtrsim 100$ km/s) is dictated by the initial
ion skin depth while the amplification of the flow depends on local $\beta $.
It is shown, for the first time, that distances over which the flows become
"fast" are $\sim 0.01 R_s$ from the interaction surface; later the fast flow
localizes (with dimensions $\lesssim 0.05 R_S$) in the upper central region of
the original arcade. For fixed initial temperature the final speed ($\gtrsim
500 km/s$) of the accelerated flow, and the modification of the field structure
are independent of the time-duration (life-time) of the initial flow. In the
presence of dissipation, these flows are likely to play a fundamental role in
the heating of the finely structured Solar atmosphere.
