We prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak Kahler-Ricci flow on
projective varieties with log terminal singularities. It is also shown that the
weak Kahler-Ricci flow can be uniquely continued through divisorial
contractions and flips if they exist. We then propose an analytic version of
the Minimal Model Program with Ricci flow.
