The personalized PageRank diffusion is a fundamental tool in network analysis
tasks like community detection and link prediction. This tool models the spread
of a quantity from a small, initial set of seed nodes, and has long been
observed to stay localized near this seed set. We derive a sublinear
upper-bound on the number of nonzeros necessary to approximate a personalized
PageRank vector on a power-law graph. Our experimental results on power-law
graphs with a wide variety of parameter settings demonstrate that the bound is
loose, and instead supports a new conjectured bound.
