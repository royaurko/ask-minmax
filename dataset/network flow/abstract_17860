In this paper, We propose a effective routing strategy on the basis of the
so-called nearest neighbor search strategy by introducing a preferential
delivering exponent alpha. we assume that the handling capacity of one vertex
is proportional to its degree when the degree is smaller than a cut-off value
$K$, and is infinite otherwise. It is found that by tuning the parameter alpha,
the scale-free network capacity measured by the order parameter is considerably
enhanced compared to the normal nearest-neighbor strategy. Traffic dynamics
both near and far away from the critical generating rate R_c are discussed. We
also investigate R_c as functions of m (connectivity density), K (cutoff
value). Due to the low cost of acquiring nearest-neighbor information and the
strongly improved network capacity, our strategy may be useful and reasonable
for the protocol designing of modern communication networks.
