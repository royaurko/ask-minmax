I show the assumed Bilayer structure of cell membranes is Topologically
falsified by known aminophospholipid dynamics in metabolically-active, Far from
Equilibrium cells. The sensitivity of lipid and cytoplasmic flows to
temperature, surfactants, viscosity and the gravity vector are used to suggest
that rather than being random viscous fluids as currently assumed, both are
actually spatially-organised by convective and shear driven mechanisms in vivo.
I show how protein-lipid feedback provokes a Gestalt Shift in Cell Mechanics by
demonstrating that the primary forces involved in shape changes are generated
by bifurcations in fluid flow Topology, which induce affine deformations of the
cytoskeletal lattice. The feedback model allows the transduction of
Gravitational information into biological form, is universally applicable, and
provides a rationale for Homeoviscous Adaptation, and the extensive lipid
polymorphism observed in Nature.
