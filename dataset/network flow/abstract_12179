In this paper the problem of scheduling with power control in wireless
networks is studied: given a set of communication requests, one needs to assign
the powers of the network nodes, and schedule the transmissions so that they
can be done in a minimum time, taking into account the signal interference of
concurrently transmitting nodes. The signal interference is modeled by SINR
constraints. Approximation algorithms are given for this problem, which use the
mean power assignment. The problem of schduling with fixed mean power
assignment is also considered, and approximation guarantees are proven.
