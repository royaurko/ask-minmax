Conficker is a computer worm that erupted on the Internet in 2008. It is
unique in combining three different spreading strategies: local probing,
neighbourhood probing, and global probing. We propose a mathematical model that
combines three modes of spreading, local, neighbourhood and global to capture
the worm's spreading behaviour. The parameters of the model are inferred
directly from network data obtained during the first day of the Conifcker
epidemic. The model is then used to explore the trade-off between spreading
modes in determining the worm's effectiveness. Our results show that the
Conficker epidemic is an example of a critically hybrid epidemic, in which the
different modes of spreading in isolation do not lead to successful epidemics.
Such hybrid spreading strategies may be used beneficially to provide the most
effective strategies for promulgating information across a large population.
When used maliciously, however, they can present a dangerous challenge to
current internet security protocols.
