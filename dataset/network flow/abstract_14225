We present a study of intermittency in a turbulent channel flow. Scaling
exponents of longitudinal streamwise structure functions, $\zeta_p /\zeta_3$,
are used as quantitative indicators of intermittency.
  We find that, near the center of the channel the values of $\zeta_p /\zeta_3$
up to $p=7$ are consistent with the assumption of homogeneous/isotropic
turbulence. Moving towards the boundaries, we observe a growth of intermittency
which appears to be related to an intensified presence of ordered vortical
structures. In fact, the behaviour along the normal-to-wall direction of
suitably normalized scaling exponents shows a remarkable correlation with the
local strength of the Reynolds stress and with the \rms value of helicity
density fluctuations. We argue that the clear transition in the nature of
intermittency appearing in the region close to the wall, is related to a new
length scale which becomes the relevant one for scaling in high shear flows.
