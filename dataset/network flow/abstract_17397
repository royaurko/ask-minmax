This paper is concerned with index pairs in the sense of Conley index theory
for flows relative to pseudo-gradient vector fields for $C^1$-functions
satisfying Palais-Smale condition. We prove a deformation theorem for such
index pairs to obtain a Lusternik-Schnirelmann type result in Conley index
theory.
