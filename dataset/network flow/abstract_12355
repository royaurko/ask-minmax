In this work, we are interested on the analysis of competing marketing
campaigns between an incumbent who dominates the market and a challenger who
wants to enter the market. We are interested in (a) the simultaneous decision
of how many resources to allocate to their potential customers to advertise
their products for both marketing campaigns, and (b) the optimal allocation on
the situation in which the incumbent knows the entrance of the challenger and
thus can predict its response. Applying results from game theory, we
characterize these optimal strategic resource allocations for the voter model
of social networks.
