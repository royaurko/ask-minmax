This work was conducted to design, implement, and evaluate a new model of
measuring Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) performance of real time network.
The proposed model Biological Kurd Messenger (BIOKM) has two main goals: First
is to run the model efficiently, second is to obtain high TCP performance via
real time network using bio-computing technique, especially molecular
calculation because it provides wisdom results and it can exploit all
facilities of phylogentic analysis. To measure TCP performance two protocols
were selected Internet Relay Chat Daemon (IRCD) and File Transfer Protocol
(FTP), the BIOKM model consists of two applications Kurd Messenger Server Side
(KMSS) and Kurd Messenger Client Side (KMCS) written in Java programming
language by implementing algorithms of BIOKM Server and Client application. The
paper also includes the implementation of hybridized model algorithm based on
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method to measure TCP performance, then implementing
algorithm of Little law (steady state) for single server queue as a comparison
with bio-computing algorithm. The results obtained by using bio-computing and
little law techniques show very good performance and the two techniques result
are very close to each other this is because of local implementation. The main
tools which have been used in this work can be divided into software and
hardware tools.
