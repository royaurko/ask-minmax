The clearing up of a wave nature of the energy and mass transfer phenomena in
classical expressions of the molecular-kinetic theory has allowed to find a
quantitative measure of intensity of processes of a thermal conductivity,
viscosity and diffusion in conditions of a thermally nonequilibrium and
heterogeneous composition continuum. It is rotined that the appearance of a
temperature drop in fluid stipulates the appearance of the continuum
stratification and formation of the flowing bodies interacting among
themselves. It is rotined that the known expressions for a thermal
conductivity, viscosity, diffusion and heat convection had been obtained for a
thermally equilibrium and homogeneous continuum and produce a maximum quantity
of intensity of the transfer processes. The introduced expression is usable for
a quantitative estimation of intensity of the transfer processes in fluid and
its streams in conditions of the non-stationary heat exchange in natural
conditions and technical problems.
