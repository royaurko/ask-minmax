In this paper we formulate and test numerically a fully-coupled discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) method for incompressible two-phase flow with discontinuous
capillary pressure. The spatial discretization uses the symmetric interior
penalty DG formulation with weighted averages and is based on a wetting-phase
potential / capillary potential formulation of the two-phase flow system. After
discretizing in time with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta schemes the resulting
systems of nonlinear algebraic equations are solved with Newton's method and
the arising systems of linear equations are solved efficiently and in parallel
with an algebraic multigrid method. The new scheme is investigated for various
test problems from the literature and is also compared to a cell-centered
finite volume scheme in terms of accuracy and time to solution. We find that
the method is accurate, robust and efficient. In particular no post-processing
of the DG velocity field is necessary in contrast to results reported by
several contributors for decoupled schemes. Moreover, the solver scales well in
parallel and three-dimensional problems with up to nearly 100 million degrees
of freedom per time step have been computed on 1000 processors.
