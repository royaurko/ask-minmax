Battery-free sensor networks have emerged as a promising solution to conquer
the lifetime limitation of battery-powered systems. In this paper, we study a
sensor network built from battery-free sensor nodes which harvest energy from
radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by RF-based chargers, e.g., radio
frequency identification (RFID) readers. Due to the insufficiency of harvested
energy, the sensor nodes have to work in duty cycles to harvest enough energy
before turning active and performing tasks. One fundamental issue in this kind
of network design is how to deploy the chargers to ensure that the battery-free
nodes can maintain a designated duty cycle for continuous operation. Based on a
new wireless recharge model, we formulate the charger placement problem for
node's duty cycle guarantee as a constrained optimization problem. We develop
both greedy and efficient heuristics for solving the problem and validate our
solutions through extensive simulations. The simulation results show that the
proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based divide-and-conquer approach
can effectively reduce the number of chargers compared with the greedy
approach.
