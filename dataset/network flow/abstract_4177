We study the Chern-Ricci flow, an evolution equation of Hermitian metrics, on
a family of Oeljeklaus-Toma (OT-) manifolds which are non-K\"{a}hler compact
complex manifolds with negative Kodaira dimension. We prove that, after an
initial conformal change, the flow converges, in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, to
a torus with a flat Riemannian metric determined by the OT-manifolds
themselves.
