We calculated the expected microlens light curves for several accretion-flow
models and compared the results to find what aspects of distinct flow
structures can be extracted from the microlens light curves. As for the flow
models, we considered the standard disk, optically thin advection-dominated
flow, and the disk-corona model by Kawaguchi et al., which can nicely reproduce
the observed quasar spectra. The calculated microlens light curves of the
disk-corona model exhibit rapid soft X-ray and slow hard X-ray variations. This
is because the former is generated by Compton up-scattering of soft (optical --
UV) photons from the innermost part of the disk body, while the latter is
emitted via bremsstrahlung within the corona at relatively large radii.
Furthermore, an inhomogeneous emissivity distribution over the disk produces
humps in the microlens light curves because of enhanced microlens amplification
of the bright areas. It is hoped that black-hole accretion theory coupled with
future multi-wavelength microlens observations will be able to reveal such
spatial and temporal behaviors of flows in the vicinity of black holes.
