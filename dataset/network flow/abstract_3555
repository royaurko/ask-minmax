Network tomography means to estimate internal link states from end-to-end
path measurements. In conventional network tomography, to make packets
transmissively penetrate a network, a cooperation between transmitter and
receiver nodes is required, which are located at different places in the
network. In this paper, we propose a reflective network tomography, which can
totally avoid such a cooperation, since a single transceiver node transmits
packets and receives them after traversing back from the network. Furthermore,
we are interested in identification of a limited number of bottleneck links, so
we naturally introduce compressed sensing technique into it. Allowing two kinds
of paths such as (fully) loopy path and folded path, we propose a
computationally-efficient algorithm for constructing reflective paths for a
given network. In the performance evaluation by computer simulation, we confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed reflective network tomography scheme.
