In this paper we prove that the moduli space of metrics with positive scalar
curvature of an orientable compact 3-manifold is path-connected. The proof uses
the Ricci flow with surgery, the conformal method, and the connected sum
construction of Gromov and Lawson. The work of Perelman on Hamilton's Ricci
flow is fundamental. As one of the applications we prove the path-connectedness
of the space of trace-free asymptotically flat solutions to the vacuum Einstein
constraint equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$.
