The directed and elliptic flow of protons and charged pions has been observed
from the semi-central collisions of a 158 GeV/nucleon Pb beam with a Pb target.
The rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the flow has been measured.
The directed flow of the pions is opposite to that of the protons but both
exhibit negative flow at low pt. The elliptic flow of both is fairly
independent of rapidity but rises with pt.
