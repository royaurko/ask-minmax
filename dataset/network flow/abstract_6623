The discovery, representation and reconstruction of Business Networks (BN)
from Network Mining (NM) raw data is a difficult problem for enterprises. This
is due to huge amounts of e.g. complex business processes within and across
enterprise boundaries, heterogeneous technology stacks, and fragmented data. To
remain competitive, visibility into the enterprise and partner networks on
different, interrelated abstraction levels is desirable.
  We show the query and data processing capabilities of a novel data discovery,
mining and network inference system, called Business Network System (BNS) that
reconstructs the BN--integration and business process networks - from raw data,
hidden in the enterprises' landscapes. The paper covers both the foundation and
the key data processing characteristics features of BNS, including its
underlying technologies, its overall system architecture, and data provenance
approach.
