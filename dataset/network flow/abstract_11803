Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a recent advancement in communication
networks where the current research is mainly focusing on routing & cache
management strategies of CCN. Nonetheless, other perspectives such as network
level security and service quality are also of prime importance; areas which
have not been covered deeply so far. This paper introduces an interest
forwarding mechanism to process the requests of consumers at a CCN router.
Interest packets are forwarded with respect to the priorities of addressed
content while the priority level settings are done by content publishers during
an initialization phase using a collaborative mechanism of exchanging messages
to agree to the priority levels of all content according to the content-nature.
Interests with higher priority content are recorded in Pending Interest Table
(PIT) as well as forwarded to content publishers prior to those with lower
priority content. A simulation study is also conducted to show the
effectiveness of proposed scheme and we observe that the interests with higher
priority content are satisfied earlier than the interests with lower priority
content.
