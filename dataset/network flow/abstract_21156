Present paper endeavors to forecast the population of India through
Artificial Neural Network. A non-linear Artificial Neural Net model has been
developed and the prediction has been found to be sufficiently accurate. It has
been found that the model is performing more efficiently in predicting female
population than the male population. Results have been presented graphically.
