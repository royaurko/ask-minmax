This paper applies the recently developed theory of discrete nonholonomic
mechanics to the study of discrete nonholonomic left-invariant dynamics on Lie
groups. The theory is illustrated with the discrete versions of two classical
nonholonomic systems, the Suslov top and the Chaplygin sleigh. The preservation
of the reduced energy by the discrete flow is observed and the discrete
momentum conservation is discussed.
