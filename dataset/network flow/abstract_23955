\ \ We have recently developed methods for obtaining exact two-point
resistance of the complete graph minus $N$ edges. We use these methods to
obtain closed formulas of certain trigonometrical sums that arise in connection
with one-dimensional lattice, in proving the Scott's conjecture on permanent of
Cauchy matrix, and in the perturbative chiral Potts model. The generalized
trigonometrical sums of the chiral Potts model are shown to satisfy recursion
formulas that are transparent and direct, and differ from those of Gervois and
Mehta. By making a change of variables in these recursion formulas, the
dimension of the space of conformal blocks of $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ WZW models
may be computed recursively. Our methods are then extended to compute the
corner-to-corner resistance, and the Kirchhoff index of the first non-trivial
two-dimensional resistor network, $2\times N$. Finally, we obtain new closed
formulas for variant of trigonometrical sums, some of which appear in
connection with number theory.
