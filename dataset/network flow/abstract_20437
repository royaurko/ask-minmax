Previous studies on magnetic flux expulsion as a function of cooling details
have been performed for superconducting niobium cavities with the cavity beam
axis placed parallel respect to the helium cooling flow, and findings showed
that for sufficient cooling thermogradients all magnetic flux could be expelled
and very low residual resistance could be achieved. In this paper we
investigate the flux trapping and its impact on radio frequency surface
resistance when the resonators are positioned perpendicularly to the helium
cooling flow, which is representative of how superconducting radio-frequency
(SRF) cavities are cooled in an accelerator. We also extend the studies to
different directions of applied magnetic field surrounding the resonator.
Results show that in the cavity horizontal configuration there is a different
impact of the various field components on the final surface resistance, and
that several parameters have to be considered to understand flux dynamics. A
newly discovered phenomenon of concentration of flux lines at the cavity top
leading to cavity equator temperature rise is presented.
