Using experiments and theory, we show that light scattering by
inhomogeneities in the index of refraction of a fluid can drive a large-scale
flow. The experiment uses a near-critical, phase-separated liquid, which
experiences large fluctuations in its index of refraction. A laser beam
traversing the liquid produces a large-scale deformation of the interface and
can cause a liquid jet to form. We demonstrate that the deformation is produced
by a scattering-induced flow by obtaining good agreements between the measured
deformations and those calculated assuming this mechanism.
