OPNET Modeler accelerates network R&D and improves product quality through
high-fidelity modeling and scalable simulation. It provides a virtual
environment for designing protocols and devices, and for testing and
demonstrating designs in realistic scenarios prior to production. OPNET Modeler
supports 802.15.4 standard and has been used to make a model of PAN. Iterations
have been performed by changing the Power of the transmitter and the throughput
will has been analyzed to arrive at optimal values.An energy-efficient wireless
home network based on IEEE 802.15.4, a novel architecture has been proposed. In
this architecture, all nodes are classified into stationary nodes and mobile
nodes according to the functionality of each node. Mobile nodes are usually
battery-powered, and therefore need low-power operation. In order to improve
power consumption of mobile nodes, effective handover sequence based on MAC
broadcast and transmission power control based on LQ (link quality) are
employed. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the proposed
architecture, communication time and power consumption of mobile nodes can be
reduced by 1.2 seconds and 42.8%, respectively.
