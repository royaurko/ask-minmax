Shearing stresses can change the volume of a material via a nonlinear effect
known as shear dilatancy. We calculate the elastic dilatancy coefficient of
soft sphere packings and random spring networks, two canonical models of
marginal solids close to their rigidity transition. We predict a dramatic
enhancement of dilatancy near rigidity loss in both materials, with a
surprising distinction: while packings expand under shear, networks contract.
We show that contraction in networks is due to the destabilizing influence of
increasing hydrostatic or uniaxial loads, which is counteracted in packings by
the formation of new contacts.
