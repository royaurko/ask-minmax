We study the linear stability of planar shear banded flow with respect to
perturbations with wavevector in the plane of the banding interface, within the
non local Johnson Segalman model. We find that perturbations grow in time, over
a range of wavevectors, rendering the interface linearly unstable. Results for
the unstable eigenfunction are used to discuss the nature of the instability.
We also comment on the stability of phase separated domains to shear flow in
model H.
