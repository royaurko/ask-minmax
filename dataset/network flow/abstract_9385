In this paper, we analyze the coding delay and the average coding delay of
Chunked network Codes (CC) over line networks with Bernoulli losses and
deterministic regular or Poisson transmissions. Chunked codes are an attractive
alternative to random linear network codes due to their lower complexity. Our
results, which include upper bounds on the delay and the average delay, are the
first of their kind for CC over networks with such probabilistic traffics.
These results demonstrate that a stand-alone CC or a precoded CC provides a
better tradeoff between the computational complexity and the convergence speed
to the network capacity over the probabilistic traffics compared to arbitrary
deterministic traffics. The performance of CC over the latter traffics has
already been studied in the literature.
