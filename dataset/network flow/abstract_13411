To an ergodic, essentially free and measure-preserving action of a
non-amenable Baumslag-Solitar group on a standard probability space, a flow is
associated. The isomorphism class of the flow is shown to be an invariant of
such actions of Baumslag-Solitar groups under weak orbit equivalence. Results
on groups which are measure equivalent to Baumslag-Solitar groups are also
provided.
