This paper investigates the dynamics of infectious diseases with a
non-exponentially distributed infectious period. This is achieved by
considering a multi-stage infection model on networks. Using pairwise
approximation with a standard closure, a number of important characteristics of
disease dynamics are derived analytically, including the final size of an
epidemic and a threshold for epidemic outbreaks. Stochastic simulations of
dynamics on networks are performed and compared to the results of pairwise
models for several realistic examples of infectious diseases to illustrate the
role played by the number of stages in the disease dynamics. The agreement
between the pairwise and simulation methods is excellent in the cases we
consider.
