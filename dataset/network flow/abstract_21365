We present two stateless algorithms that guarantee to deliver the message to
every device in a designated geographic area: flooding and planar geocasting.
Due to the algorithms' statelessness, intermediate devices do not have to keep
message data between message transmissions. We formally prove the algorithms
correct, estimate their message complexity and evaluate their performance
through simulation.
