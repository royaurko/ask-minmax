We introduce a model for innovation-, evolution- and opinion dynamics whose
spreading is dictated by unanimity rules, i.e. a node will change its (binary)
state only if all of its neighbours have the same corresponding state. It is
shown that a transition takes place depending on the initial condition of the
problem. In particular, a critical number of initially activated nodes is
needed so that the whole system gets activated in the long-time limit. The
influence of the degree distribution of the nodes is naturally taken into
account. For simple network topologies we solve the model analytically, the
cases of random, small-world and scale-free are studied in detail.
