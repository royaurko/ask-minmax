With the growing interest on Network Analysis, Relational Data Mining is
becoming an emphasized domain of Data Mining. This paper addresses the problem
of extracting representative elements from a relational dataset. After defining
the notion of degree of representativeness, computed using the Borda
aggregation procedure, we present the extraction of exemplars which are the
representative elements of the dataset. We use these concepts to build a
network on the dataset. We expose the main properties of these notions and we
propose two typical applications of our framework. The first application
consists in resuming and structuring a set of binary images and the second in
mining co-contributoring relation in a research team.
