We define a q-chromatic function on graphs, list some of its properties and
provide some formulas in the class of general chordal graphs. Then we relate
the q-chromatic function to the colored Jones function of knots. This leads to
a curious expression of the colored Jones function of a knot diagram as a
'defected chromatic operator' applied to a power series whose coefficients are
linear combinations of chord diagrams constructed from 'flows' on the reduced
knot diagram.
