Information theoretic Broadcast Channels (BC) and Multiple Access Channels
(MAC) enable a single node to transmit data simultaneously to multiple nodes,
and multiple nodes to transmit data simultaneously to a single node
respectively. In this paper, we address the problem of link scheduling in
multihop wireless networks containing nodes with BC and MAC capabilities. We
first propose an interference model that extends protocol interference models,
originally designed for point to point channels, to include the possibility of
BC and MAC. Due to the high complexity of optimal link schedulers, we introduce
the Multiuser Greedy Maximum Weight algorithm for link scheduling in multihop
wireless networks containing BCs and MACs. Given a network graph, we develop
new local pooling conditions and show that the performance of our algorithm can
be fully characterized using the associated parameter, the multiuser local
pooling factor. We provide examples of some network graphs, on which we apply
local pooling conditions and derive the multiuser local pooling factor. We
prove optimality of our algorithm in tree networks and show that the
exploitation of BCs and MACs improve the throughput performance considerably in
multihop wireless networks.
