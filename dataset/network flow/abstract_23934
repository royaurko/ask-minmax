Mobile gaming presents a number of main issues which remain open. These are
concerned mainly with connectivity, computational capacities, memory and
battery constraints. In this paper, we discuss the design of a fully
distributed approach for the support of mobile Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs).
In mobile environments, several features might be exploited to enable resource
sharing among multiple devices / game consoles owned by different mobile users.
We show the advantages of trading computing / networking facilities among
mobile players. This operation mode opens a wide number of interesting sharing
scenarios, thus promoting the deployment of novel mobile online games. In
particular, once mobile nodes make their resource available for the community,
it becomes possible to distribute the software modules that compose the game
engine. This allows to distribute the workload for the game advancement
management. We claim that resource sharing is in unison with the idea of ludic
activity that is behind MOGs. Hence, such schemes can be profitably employed in
these contexts.
