We propose a coarse-grained model for polymer chains and polymer networks
based on the meso-scale dynamics. The model takes the internal degrees of
freedom of the constituent polymer chains into account using memory functions
and colored noises. We apply our model to dilute polymer solutions and polymer
networks. A numerical simulation on a dilute polymer solution demonstrates the
validity of the assumptions on the dynamics of our model. By applying this
model to polymer networks, we find a transition in the dynamical behavior from
an isolated chain state to a network state.
