Broadcasting concerns the dissemination of a message originating at one node
of a network to all other nodes. This task is accomplished by placing a series
of calls over the communication lines of the network between neighboring
nodes, where each call requires a unit of time and a call can involve only two
nodes. We show that for bounded-degree networks determining the minimum
broadcast time from an originating node remains NP-complete.
