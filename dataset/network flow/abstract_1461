The three-state Ising neural network with synchronous updating and variable
dilution is discussed starting from the appropriate Hamiltonians. The
thermodynamic and retrieval properties are examined using replica mean-field
theory. Capacity-temperature phase diagrams are derived for several values of
the pattern activity and different gradations of dilution, and the information
content is calculated. The results are compared with those for sequential
updating. The effect of self-coupling is established. Also the dynamics is
studied using the generating function technique for both synchronous and
sequential updating. Typical flow diagrams for the overlap order parameter are
presented. The differences with the signal-to-noise approach are outlined.
