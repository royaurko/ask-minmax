The site percolation threshold for the random Voronoi network is determined
numerically for the first time, with the result p_c = 0.71410 +/- 0.00002,
using Monte-Carlo simulation on periodic systems of up to 40000 sites. The
result is very close to the recent theoretical estimate p_c = 0.7151 of Neher,
Mecke, and Wagner. For the bond threshold on the Voronoi network, we find p_c =
0.666931 +/- 0.000005, implying that for its dual, the Delaunay triangulation,
p_c = 0.333069 +/- 0.000005. These results rule out the conjecture by Hsu and
Huang that the bond thresholds are 2/3 and 1/3 respectively, but support the
conjecture of Wierman that for fully triangulated lattices other than the
regular triangular lattice, the bond threshold is less than 2 sin pi/18 =
0.3473.
