We show that the generalized fluctuation theorem with entropy reduction is
fulfilled only for the enzymatic molecular machines with the stochastic
dynamics that offers a possibility of choice of the work performance in variety
of ways. The particular model of such a dynamics is investigated, described by
the network displaying, like networks of the systems biology, a transition from
the fractal organization on a small length-scale to the small-world
organization on the large length-scale. For this model the output operating
flux of the machine can surpass in a natural way the input flux. The main
conclusion of the study is that the energy processing has to be distinguished
from the organization processing. From a broader biological perspective, three
suppositions could be of especial importance: (i) a possibility of the choice
is characteristic for many intrinsically disordered proteins, (ii) the tight
coupling between both fluxes results not from the lack of slippage, but from
the compensation of the entropy production by the information creation, and
(iii) this is the reason for most protein machines to operate as dimers or
higher organized structures.
