In this paper, a semi-Lagrangian gas-kinetic scheme is developed for smooth
flows based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation. As a finite-volume
scheme, the evolution of the average flow variables in a control volume is
under the Eulerian framework, whereas the construction of the numerical flux
across the cell interface comes from the Lagrangian perspective. The adoption
of the Lagrangian aspect makes the collision and the transport mechanisms
intrinsically coupled together in the flux evaluation. As a result, the time
step is independent of the particle collision time and solely determined by the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions. A set of simulations are carried out
to validate the performance of the new scheme. The results show that with
second-order spatial accuracy, the scheme exhibits low numerical dissipation,
and can accurately capture the Navier-Stokers solutions for the smooth flows
with viscous heat dissipation from the low-speed incompressible to hypersonic
compressible regimes.
