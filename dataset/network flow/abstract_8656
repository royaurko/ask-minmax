We constructed a product network based on the sales data collected and
provided by a Fortune 500 speciality retailer. The structure of the network is
dominated by small isolated components, dense clique-based communities, and
sparse stars and linear chains and pendants. We used the identified structural
elements (tiles) to organize products into mini-categories -- compact
collections of potentially complementary and substitute items. The
mini-categories extend the traditional hierarchy of retail products (group -
class - subcategory) and may serve as building blocks towards exploration of
consumer projects and long-term customer behavior.
