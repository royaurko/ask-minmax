We study synchronization of $N$ oscillators indirectly coupled through a
medium which is inhomogeneous and has its own dynamics. The system is
formalized in terms of a multilayer network, where the top layer is made of
disconnected oscillators and the bottom one, modeling the medium, consists of
oscillators coupled according to a given topology. The different dynamics of
the medium and the top layer is accounted by including a frequency mismatch
between them. We show a novel regime of synchronization as intra-layer
coherence does not necessarily require inter-layer coherence. This regime
appears under mild conditions on the bottom layer: arbitrary topologies may be
considered, provided that they support synchronization of the oscillators of
the medium. The existence of a density-dependent threshold as in quorum-sensing
phenomena is also demonstrated.
