Using a trace of address references, we compared the efficiency of several
different hashing functions, such as cyclic redundancy checking (CRC)
polynomials, Fletcher checksum, folding of address octets using the
exclusive-or operation and bit extraction from the address. Guidelines are
provided for determining the size of the hashmark required to achieve a
specified level of performance.
