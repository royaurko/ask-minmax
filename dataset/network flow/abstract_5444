We study the dynamics of the Naming Game [Baronchelli et al., (2006) J. Stat.
Mech.: Theory Exp. P06014] in empirical social networks. This stylized
agent-based model captures essential features of agreement dynamics in a
network of autonomous agents, corresponding to the development of shared
classification schemes in a network of artificial agents or opinion spreading
and social dynamics in social networks. Our study focuses on the impact that
communities in the underlying social graphs have on the outcome of the
agreement process. We find that networks with strong community structure hinder
the system from reaching global agreement; the evolution of the Naming Game in
these networks maintains clusters of coexisting opinions indefinitely. Further,
we investigate agent-based network strategies to facilitate convergence to
global consensus.
