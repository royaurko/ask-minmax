We study a family of fermionic extensions of the Camassa-Holm equation.
Within this family we identify three interesting classes: (a) equations, which
are inherently hamiltonian, describing geodesic flow with respect to an H^1
metric on the group of superconformal transformations in two dimensions, (b)
equations which are hamiltonian with respect to a different hamiltonian
structure and (c) supersymmetric flow equations. Classes (a) and (b) have no
intersection, but the intersection of classes (a) and (c) gives a candidate for
a new supersymmetric integrable system. We demonstrate the Painlev\'e property
for some simple but nontrivial reductions of this system.
