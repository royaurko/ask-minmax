We consider the problem of reconstructing wideband frequency spectra from
distributed, compressive measurements. The measurements are made by a network
of nodes, each independently mixing the ambient spectra with low frequency,
random signals. The reconstruction takes place via local transmissions between
nodes, each performing simple statistical operations such as ridge regression
and shrinkage.
