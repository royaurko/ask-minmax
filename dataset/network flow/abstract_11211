Distributed aggregation allows the derivation of a given global aggregate
property from many individual local values in nodes of an interconnected
network system. Simple aggregates such as minima/maxima, counts, sums and
averages have been thoroughly studied in the past and are important tools for
distributed algorithms and network coordination. Nonetheless, this kind of
aggregates may not be comprehensive enough to characterize biased data
distributions or when in presence of outliers, making the case for richer
estimates of the values on the network. This work presents Spectra, a
distributed algorithm for the estimation of distribution functions over large
scale networks. The estimate is available at all nodes and the technique
depicts important properties, namely: robust when exposed to high levels of
message loss, fast convergence speed and fine precision in the estimate. It can
also dynamically cope with changes of the sampled local property, not requiring
algorithm restarts, and is highly resilient to node churn. The proposed
approach is experimentally evaluated and contrasted to a competing state of the
art distribution aggregation technique.
