We study the effects of gravity waves, or g-modes, on hot extrasolar planets.
These planets are expected to possess stably-stratified atmospheres, which
support gravity waves. In this paper, we review the derivation of the equation
that governs the linear dynamics of gravity waves and describe its application
to a hot extrasolar planet, using HD209458 b as a generic example. We find that
gravity waves can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, even for a single
atmospheric profile. The waves can significantly accelerate or decelerate the
background mean flow, depending on the difference between the wave phase and
mean flow speeds. In addition, the waves can provide significant heating (~100
to ~1000 K per planetary rotation), especially to the region of the atmosphere
above about 10 scale heights from the excitation region. Furthermore, by
propagating horizontally, gravity waves provide a mechanism for transporting
momentum and heat from the dayside of a tidally locked planet to its nightside.
We discuss work that needs to be undertaken to incorporate these effects in
current atmosphere models of extrasolar planets.
