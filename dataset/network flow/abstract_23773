Recent work by Zymnis et al. proposes an efficient primal-dual interior-point
method, using a truncated Newton method, for solving the network utility
maximization (NUM) problem. This method has shown superior performance relative
to the traditional dual-decomposition approach. Other recent work by Bickson et
al. shows how to compute efficiently and distributively the Newton step, which
is the main computational bottleneck of the Newton method, utilizing the
Gaussian belief propagation algorithm.
  In the current work, we combine both approaches to create an efficient
distributed algorithm for solving the NUM problem. Unlike the work of Zymnis,
which uses a centralized approach, our new algorithm is easily distributed.
Using an empirical evaluation we show that our new method outperforms previous
approaches, including the truncated Newton method and dual-decomposition
methods. As an additional contribution, this is the first work that evaluates
the performance of the Gaussian belief propagation algorithm vs. the
preconditioned conjugate gradient method, for a large scale problem.
