Erasure resilient FEC codes in off-line packetized streaming rely on time
diversity. This requires unrestricted buffering time at the receiver. In
real-time streaming the playback buffering time must be very short. Path
diversity is an orthogonal strategy. However, the large number of long paths
increases the number of underlying links and consecutively the overall link
failure rate. This may increase the overall requirement in redundant FEC
packets for combating the link failures. We introduce the Redundancy Overall
Requirement (ROR) metric, a routing coefficient specifying the total number of
FEC packets required for compensation of all underlying link failures. We
present a capillary routing algorithm for constructing layer by layer steadily
diversifying multi-path routing patterns. By measuring the ROR coefficients of
a dozen of routing layers on hundreds of network samples, we show that the
number of required FEC packets decreases substantially when the path diversity
is increased by the capillary routing construction algorithm.
