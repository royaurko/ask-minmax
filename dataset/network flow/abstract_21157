We consider small network models for mutually delay-coupled systems which
typically do not exhibit stable isochronally synchronized solutions. We show
that for certain coupling architectures which involve delayed self feedback to
the nodes, the oscillators become isochronally synchronized. Applications are
shown for both incoherent pump coupled lasers and spatio-temporal coupled fiber
ring lasers.
