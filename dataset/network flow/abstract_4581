In previous work I examined an information based complexity measure of
networks with weighted links. The measure was compared with that obtained from
by randomly shuffling the original network, forming an Erdos-Renyi random
network preserving the original link weight distribution. It was found that
real world networks almost invariably had higher complexity than their shuffled
counterparts, whereas networks mechanically generated via preferential
attachment did not. The same experiment was performed on foodwebs generated by
an artificial life system, Tierra, and a couple of evolutionary ecology
systems, EcoLab and WebWorld. These latter systems often exhibited the same
complexity excess shown by real world networks, suggesting that the complexity
surplus indicates the presence of evolutionary dynamics.
  In this paper, I report on a mechanical network generation system that does
produce this complexity surplus. The heart of the idea is to construct the
network of state transitions of a chaotic dynamical system, such as the Lorenz
equation. This indicates that complexity surplus is a more fundamental trait
than that of being an evolutionary system.
