We study the dynamics of a single polymer subject to thermal fluctuations in
a linear shear flow. The polymer is modeled as a finitely extendable nonlinear
elastic FENE dumbbell. Both orientation and elongation dynamics are
investigated numerically as a function of the shear strength, by means of a new
efficient integration algorithm. The results are in agreement with recent
experiments.
