We study the evolution of a localized perturbation in a chemical system with
multiple homogeneous steady states, in the presence of stirring by a fluid
flow. Two distinct regimes are found as the rate of stirring is varied relative
to the rate of the chemical reaction. When the stirring is fast localized
perturbations decay towards a spatially homogeneous state. When the stirring is
slow (or fast reaction) localized perturbations propagate by advection in form
of a filament with a roughly constant width and exponentially increasing
length. The width of the filament depends on the stirring rate and reaction
rate but is independent of the initial perturbation. We investigate this
problem numerically in both closed and open flow systems and explain the
results using a one-dimensional "mean-strain" model for the transverse profile
of the filament that captures the interplay between the propagation of the
reaction-diffusion front and the stretching due to chaotic advection.
