We investigate how correlations between the diversity of the connectivity of
networks and the dynamics at their nodes affect the macroscopic behavior. In
particular, we study the synchronization transition of coupled stochastic phase
oscillators that represent the node dynamics. Crucially in our work, the
variability in the number of connections of the nodes is correlated with the
width of the frequency distribution of the oscillators. By numerical
simulations on Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks, where the frequencies of the
oscillators are Gaussian distributed, we make the counterintuitive observation
that an increase in the strength of the correlation is accompanied by an
increase in the critical coupling strength for the onset of synchronization. We
further observe that the critical coupling can solely depend on the average
number of connections or even completely lose its dependence on the network
connectivity. Only beyond this state, a weighted mean-field approximation
breaks down. If noise is present, the correlations have to be stronger to yield
similar observations.
