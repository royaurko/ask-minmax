The existence of cooling flows in the center of galaxy clusters has always
been a puzzle, and in particular the fate of the cooling gas, since the
presence of cold gas has never been proven directly. X-ray data from the
satellites Chandra and XMM-Newton have constrained the amount of cooling, and
it was realized that feedback and heating from a central AGN and its jets could
reduce the amount of cold gas.
 Recently, a few central galaxies of cooling flow clusters have been detected
in the CO lines. For the first time, we show IRAM interferometer maps of
CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission in a cooling flow, showing a clear association of
the cold gas (at about 20K) with the cooling flow. This shows that although the
AGN provides a feedback heating, the cooling phenomenon does occur, with about
the expected rate.
