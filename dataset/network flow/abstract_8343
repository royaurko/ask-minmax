As a model of evolving networks, we study coupled logistic maps on scale free
networks. For small coupling strengths nodes show turbulent behavior but form
phase synchronized clusters as coupling increases. We identify two different
ways of cluster formation. For small coupling strengths we get {\it
self-organized clusters} which have mostly intra-cluster couplings and for
large coupling strengths there is a crossover and reorganization to {\it driven
clusters} which have mostly inter-cluster couplings. In the novel driven
synchronization the nodes of one cluster are driven by those of the others.
