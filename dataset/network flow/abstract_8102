The onset mechanism of superfluidity is examined by taking the case of the
capillary flow of liquid helium 4. In the capillary flow, a substantial fall of
the shear viscosity has been observed in the normal phase (lambda
point<T<3.7K). In this temperature region, under the strong influence of Bose
statistics, the coherent many-body wave function grows to an intermediate size
between a macroscopic and a microscopic one, which is different from thermal
fluctuation. We consider such a capillary flow by including it to a general
picture that includes the flow of rotating helium 4 as well. Using the
Kramers-Kronig relation, we express the inverse of the shear viscosity in terms
of the generalized susceptibility of the system, and obtain a formula for the
shear viscosity in the vicinity of the lambda point. Regarding bosons without
the condensate as a non-perturbative state, we make a perturbation calculation
of the susceptibility with respect to the repulsive interaction. With
decreasing temperature from 3.7K, the growth of the coherent wave function
gradually suppresses the shear viscosity, and makes the superfluid flow stable.
Comparing formulas obtained to the experimental data, we estimate that the
ratio of the superfluid density defined in the mechanical sense reaches
1/100000 just above the lambda point.
