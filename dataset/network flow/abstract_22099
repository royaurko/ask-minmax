Using a hydrodynamic theory that incorporates a momentum decay mechanism, we
calculate the drag coefficient of a circular liquid domain of finite viscosity
moving in a two-dimensional membrane. We derive an analytical expression for
the drag coefficient which covers the whole range of domain sizes. Several
limiting expressions are discussed. The obtained drag coefficient decreases as
the domain viscosity becomes smaller with respect to the outer membrane
viscosity. This is because the flow induced in the domain acts to transport the
fluid in the surrounding matrix more efficiently.
