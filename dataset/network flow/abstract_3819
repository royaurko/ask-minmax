We investigate several variants of a network creation model: a group of
agents builds up a network between them while trying to keep the costs of this
network small. The cost function consists of two addends, namely (i) a constant
amount for each edge an agent buys and (ii) the minimum number of hops it takes
sending messages to other agents. Despite the simplicity of this model, various
complex network structures emerge depending on the weight between the two
addends of the cost function and on the selfish or unselfish behaviour of the
agents.
