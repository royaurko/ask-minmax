The Faulkes Telescope (FT) Project is an educational and research arm of the
Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGTN). As well as producing
spectacular images of galaxies, nebulae, supernovae remnants, star clusters,
etc., the FT team is involved in several projects pursuing scientific goals.
Many of these projects also incorporate data collected and analysed by schools
and amateur astronomers.
