We present computer-assisted methods for analyzing stochastic models of gene
regulatory networks. The main idea that underlies this equation-free analysis
is the design and execution of appropriately-initialized short bursts of
stochastic simulations; the results of these are processed to estimate
coarse-grained quantities of interest, such as mesoscopic transport
coefficients. In particular, using a simple model of a genetic toggle switch,
we illustrate the computation of an effective free energy and of a
state-dependent effective diffusion coefficient that characterize an
unavailable effective Fokker-Planck equation. Additionally we illustrate the
linking of equation-free techniques with continuation methods for performing a
form of stochastic "bifurcation analysis"; estimation of mean switching times
in the case of a bistable switch is also implemented in this equation-free
context. The accuracy of our methods is tested by direct comparison with
long-time stochastic simulations. This type of equation-free analysis appears
to be a promising approach to computing features of the long-time,
coarse-grained behavior of certain classes of complex stochastic models of gene
regulatory networks, circumventing the need for long Monte Carlo simulations.
