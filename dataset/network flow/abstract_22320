When a population inhabits an inhomogeneous environment, the fitness value of
traits can vary with the position in the environment. Gene flow caused by
random mating can nevertheless prevent that a sexually reproducing population
splits into different species under such circumstances. This is the problem of
sympatric speciation. However, mating need not be entirely random. Here, we
present a model where the individually advantageous preference for partners of
high fitness can lead to genetic clustering as a precondition for speciation.
In simulations, in appropriate parameter regimes, our model leads to the rapid
fixation of the corresponding alleles.
