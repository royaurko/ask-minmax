We consider the Ising model on a small-world network, where the long-range
interaction strength $J_2$ is in general different from the local interaction
strength $J_1$, and examine its relaxation behaviors as well as phase
transitions. As $J_2/J_1$ is raised from zero, the critical temperature also
increases, manifesting contributions of long-range interactions to ordering.
However, it becomes saturated eventually at large values of $J_2/J_1$ and the
system is found to display very slow relaxation, revealing that ordering
dynamics is inhibited rather than facilitated by strong long-range
interactions. To circumvent this problem, we propose a modified updating
algorithm in Monte Carlo simulations, assisting the system to reach equilibrium
quickly.
