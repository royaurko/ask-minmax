Self-regulation of living tissue as an example of self-organization phenomena
in hierarchical systems of biological, ecological, and social nature is under
consideration. The characteristic feature of these systems is the absence of
any governing center and, thereby, their self-regulation is based on a
cooperative interaction of all the elements. The work develops a mathematical
theory of a vascular network response to local effects on scales of individual
units of peripheral circulation.
