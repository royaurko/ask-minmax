The transmission of electric signals on a coupled line with distributed
RLC-parameters is considered as a propagation of a dissipative quasi particle.
A calculation technique is developed, alternative to the one, accepted for
lumped lines. The relativistic wave equation for the transient response is
deduced following the common Ohm-low-type considerations. The exact expressions
for the Green function, for information transfer velocity and for time delay
are obtained on this base. The fundamental restrictions on the measurement
accuracy of the time delay are pointed out. The obtained results are naturally
generalized for the multilevel networks of the arbitrary dimension.
