Microstrip-like antenna (MLA) which was developed nearly a decade ago, is a
powerful radiating element. The primary challenge in designing a MLA is to
provide an optimized matching network such that the overall input reflection is
kept as low as possible within the required bandwidth. In this paper, the
necessity and procedure of applying genetic algorithm to MLA problems has been
presented. Comparison with the existing literature shows good agreement in the
overall input reflection.
