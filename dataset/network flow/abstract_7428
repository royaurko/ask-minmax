We report on experimental measurements of the flow behavior of a wet,
two-dimensional foam under conditions of slow, steady shear. The initial
response of the foam is elastic. Above the yield strain, the foam begins to
flow. The flow consists of irregular intervals of elastic stretch followed by
sudden reductions of the stress, i.e. stress drops. We report on the
distribution of the stress drops as a function of the applied shear rate. We
also comment on our results in the context of various two-dimensional models of
foams.
