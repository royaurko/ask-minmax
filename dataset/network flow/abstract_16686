The notion of 'presentation', as used in combinatorial group theory, is
applied to coded character sets(CCSs) - sets which facilitate the interchange
of messages in a digital computer network(DCN) . By grouping each element of
the set into two portions and using the idea of group presentation(whereby a
group is specified by its set of generators and its set of relators), the
presentation of a CCS is described. This is illustrated using the Extended
Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code(EBCDIC) which is one of the most popular
CCSs in DCNs.
