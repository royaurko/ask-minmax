We investigate HBT radii based on the numerical solutions of the
hydrodynamical model which are so tuned as to reproduce the recent experimental
data at the CERN SPS. Comparing the sizes of freeze-out hypersurface with HBT
radii, we discuss dynamical effect of the systematic flow on the apparent HBT
radii. Finally we compare HBT radii of the QGP phase transition model with
those of the hadron gas model without phase transition.
