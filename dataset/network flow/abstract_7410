Within the formalism of martix product ansatz, we study a two-species
asymmetric exclusion process with backward and forward site-ordered sequential
update. This model describes a two-way traffic flow with a dynamical impurity
and shows a phase transition between the free flow and the traffic jam. We
investigate characteristics of this jamming and examine similarities and
differences between our results and those with random sequential update.
