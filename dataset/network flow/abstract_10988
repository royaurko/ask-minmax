The Penna bit-string model successfully encompasses many phenomena of
population evolution, including inheritance, mutation, evolution and ageing. If
we consider social interactions among individuals in the Penna model, the
population will form a complex network. In this paper, we first modify the
Verhulst factor to control only the birth rate, and introduce activity-based
preferential reproduction of offspring in the Penna model. The social
interactions among individuals are generated by both inheritance and
activity-based preferential increase. Then we study the properties of the
complex network generated by the modified Penna model. We find that the
resulting complex network has a small-world effect and the assortative mixing
property.
