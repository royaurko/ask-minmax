We examine the compatibility between the one scale model with friction for
the evolution of cosmic string networks with the Kibble mechanism for string
network formation during a second order phase transition. We find a regime
which connects (in a dramatically short time $\sim .1 t_c$) the dense string
network (small network scale $L\sim 1/T_c$) created by the Kibble
{\it{mechanism}} to the (dilute) Kibble {\it{regime}}(L\sim t^{3/4} in which
friction dominated strings remain till times $t_*\sim (M_P/T_c)^2t_c$. The
enormous loss of string length implied by this result is due to the continued
dissipative motion of the string network which follows from the one scale
model's identification of the typical curvature radius with the network scale
and the fact that the cosmological phase transition time $t_c\sim
M_{Planck}/T_c^2$ is much larger than the damping time scale $l_f\sim
T_c^2/T^3$. The significant implications for string mediated Baryogenisis are
also discussed briefly.
