This article presents a novel visualization approach for dynamic graphs, the
versinus method, specially useful for real world networks exhibiting free-scale
properties. With a simple and fixed layout, and a small set of visual markups,
the method has been useful for understanding network dynamics. Local community
often suggests that it be reported, which motivated this article. Online
resources deliver videos and computer scripts for rendering new animations.
This article has a concise description of the method.
