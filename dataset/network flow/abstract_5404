We investigated the topological properties of stock networks through a
comparison of the original stock network with the estimated stock network from
the correlation matrix created by the random matrix theory (RMT). We used
individual stocks traded on the market indices of Korea, Japan, Canada, the
USA, Italy, and the UK. The results are as follows. As the correlation matrix
reflects the more eigenvalue property, the estimated stock network from the
correlation matrix gradually increases the degree of consistency with the
original stock network. Each stock with a different number of links to other
stocks in the original stock network shows a different response. In particular,
the largest eigenvalue is a significant deterministic factor in terms of the
formation of a stock network.
