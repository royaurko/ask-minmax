We present a simple model reproducing the long-range autocorrelations and the
power spectrum of the web traffic. The model assumes the traffic as Poisson
flow of files with size distributed according to the power-law. In this model
the long-range autocorrelations are independent of the network properties as
well as of inter-packet time distribution.
