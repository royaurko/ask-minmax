In the first part of the paper, comprising section 1 through 6, we introduce
a sequence of functions in the tangent bundle TM of any smooth two-dimensional
manifold M with smooth Riemannian metric g that correspond to the higher order
Schwarzians of the linearized geodesic flow. With these functions and a
classical theorem of Loewner on analytic continuation we are able to
characterize the existence of the adapted complex structure induced by g on the
set T^RM of vectors in TM of length up to R, equivalently for M compact, to the
existence of a Grauert tube of radius R in terms of infinite Hankel matrices
involving these Schwarzian functions. The basic characterization so obtained
can be expressed as a sequence of differential inequalities of increasing order
polynomial in the covariant derivatives of the Gauss curvature on M and in
{\pi}/R that should be regarded as the higher order versions of a curvature
inequality by L. Lempert and R. Sz\"oke. The second part of the paper, sections
7 through 11, includes a discussion of the rank of the infinite Hankel matrix
of the Schwarzians from part 1 and of new Schwarzians defined now for purely
imaginary radius, as well as some computations and examples. A characterization
of the existence of the adapted structure on T^RM in terms of moment sequences
with parameters R and v in TM is also noted.
