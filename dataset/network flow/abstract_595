In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting uncontributorized network
intrusions, based on a traffic flow model and Cisco NetFlow protocol
application. The method developed allows us not only to detect the most common
types of network attack (DDoS and port scanning), but also to make a list of
trespassers' IP-addresses. Therefore, this method can be applied in intrusion
detection systems, and in those systems which lock these IP-addresses.
