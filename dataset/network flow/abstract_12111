We study a network of logistic maps with two types of global coupling,
inertial and dissipative. Features of the clusterization process are revealed
and compared, which are associated with presence of each type of couplings. For
the parameter region near the onset of chaos we outline scaling properties in
dynamical behavior of the network and illustrate them on the Kaneko phase
diagrams.
