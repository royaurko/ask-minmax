We consider arbitrary dense wireless networks, in which $n$ nodes are placed
in an arbitrary (deterministic) manner on a square region of unit area and
communicate with each other over Gaussian fading channels. We provide inner and
outer bounds for the $n\times n$-dimensional unicast and the $n\times
2^n$-dimensional multicast capacity regions of such a wireless network. These
inner and outer bounds differ only by a factor $O(\log(n))$, yielding a fairly
tight scaling characterization of the entire regions. The communication schemes
achieving the inner bounds use interference alignment as a central technique
and are, at least conceptually, surprisingly simple.
