In this paper, a lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is presented for axisymmetric
multiphase flows. Source terms are added to a two-dimensional standard lattice
Boltzmann equation (LBE) for multiphase flows such that the emergent dynamics
can be transformed into the axisymmetric cylindrical coordinate system. The
source terms are temporally and spatially dependent and represent the
axisymmetric contribution of the order parameter of fluid phases and inertial,
viscous and surface tension forces. A model which is effectively explicit and
second order is obtained. This is achieved by taking into account the discrete
lattice effects in the Chapman-Enskog multiscale analysis, so that the
macroscopic axisymmetric mass and momentum equations for multiphase flows are
recovered self-consistently. The model is extended to incorporate reduced
compressibility effects. Axisymmetric equilibrium drop formation and
oscillations, breakup and formation of satellite droplets from viscous liquid
cylindrical jets through Rayleigh capillary instability and drop collisions are
presented. Comparisons of the computed results with available data show
satisfactory agreement.
