We present a systematic hydrodynamic study of the evolution of hadron spectra
and their azimuthal anisotropy from the lowest collision energy studied at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), sqrt(s) = 7.7 A GeV, to the highest
energy reachable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), sqrt(s) = 5500 A GeV. The
energy dependence of the flow observables are quantitatively studied for both
the Monte-Carlo Glauber and Monte-Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models.
For MC-Glauber model initial conditions with {\eta}/s = 0.08, the differential
charged hadron elliptic flow v_2^{ch}(p_T, sqrt(s)) is found to exhibit a very
broad maximum in the region 39 < sqrt(s) < 2760 A GeV. For MC-KLN initial
conditions with {\eta}/s = 0.2, a similar "saturation" is not observed up to
LHC energies. We emphasize that this "saturation" of elliptic flow arises from
the interplay between radial flow and elliptic flow which shifts with sqrt(s)
depending on the fluid's viscosity. By generalizing the definition of spatial
eccentricity to isothermal hyper-surface, we also calculate {\epsilon}_x on the
kinetic freeze-out surface at different collision energies.
