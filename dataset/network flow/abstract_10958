We study the response of an ensemble of synchronized phase oscillators to an
external harmonic perturbation applied to one of the oscillators. Our main goal
is to relate the propagation of the perturbation signal to the structure of the
interaction network underlying the ensemble. The overall response of the system
is resonant, exhibiting a maximum when the perturbation frequency coincides
with the natural frequency of the phase oscillators. The individual response,
on the other hand, can strongly depend on the distance to the place where the
perturbation is applied. For small distances on a random network, the system
behaves as a linear dissipative medium: the perturbation propagates at constant
speed, while its amplitude decreases exponentially with the distance. For
larger distances, the response saturates to an almost constant level. These
different regimes can be analytically explained in terms of the length
distribution of the paths that propagate the perturbation signal. We study the
extension of these results to other interaction patterns, and show that
essentially the same phenomena are observed in networks of chaotic oscillators.
