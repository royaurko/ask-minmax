The role of perception in conscious behavior and decision-making is examined.
The effect of spatial and temporal stochasticity in the acquisition of beliefs
is discussed. The idea of an agent as a locally strongly coupled group of
states leads to the creation of energy minima in an interaction potential
landscape. The interaction of such agent states and environment states acting
at different levels of complexity and scale, subject to stochastically
expressed interaction interfaces, may lead to asymmetry in perceptions. Agents
possessing different perception related beliefs are then connected in a social
network.
