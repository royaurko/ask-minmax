Label propagation has proven to be a fast method for detecting communities in
large complex networks. Recent developments have also improved the accuracy of
the approach, however, a general algorithm is still an open issue. We present
an advanced label propagation algorithm that combines two unique strategies of
community formation, namely, defensive preservation and offensive expansion of
communities. Two strategies are combined in a hierarchical manner, to
recursively extract the core of the network, and to identify whisker
communities. The algorithm was evaluated on two classes of benchmark networks
with planted partition and on almost 25 real-world networks ranging from
networks with tens of nodes to networks with several tens of millions of edges.
It is shown to be comparable to the current state-of-the-art community
detection algorithms and superior to all previous label propagation algorithms,
with comparable time complexity. In particular, analysis on real-world networks
has proven that the algorithm has almost linear complexity,
$\mathcal{O}(m^{1.19})$, and scales even better than basic label propagation
algorithm ($m$ is the number of edges in the network).
