Device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks is
expected to bring significant benefits for utilizing resources, improving user
throughput and extending battery life of user equipments. However, the
allocation of radio and power resources to D2D communication needs elaborate
coordination, as D2D communication can cause interference to cellular
communication. In this paper, we study joint channel and power allocation to
improve the energy efficiency of user equipments. To solve the problem
efficiently, we introduce an iterative combinatorial auction algorithm, where
the D2D users are considered as bidders that compete for channel resources, and
the cellular network is treated as the auctioneer. We also analyze important
properties of D2D underlay communication, and present numerical simulations to
verify the proposed algorithm.
