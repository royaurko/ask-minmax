We present preliminary results of the gradient flow running coupling with
Dirichlet boundary condition in the SU(2) gauge theory with 8 fermion flavours.
Improvements to the gradient flow measurement allow us to obtain a robust
continuum limit. The results are consistent with perturbative running in the
weak coupling region.
