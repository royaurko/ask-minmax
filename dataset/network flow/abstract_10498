Futures trading is the core of futures business, and it is considered as one
of the typical complex systems. To investigate the complexity of futures
trading, we employ the analytical method of complex networks. First, we use
real trading records from the Shanghai Futures Exchange to construct futures
trading networks, in which nodes are trading participants, and two nodes have a
common edge if the two corresponding investors appear simultaneously in at
least one trading record as a purchaser and a seller respectively. Then, we
conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis on the constructed futures trading
networks. Empirical results show that the futures trading networks exhibit
features such as scale-free behavior with interesting odd-even-degree
divergence in low-degree regions, small-world effect, hierarchical
organization, power-law betweenness distribution, disassortative mixing, and
shrinkage of both the average path length and the diameter as network size
increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses real
data to study futures trading networks, and we argue that the research results
can shed light on the nature of real futures business.
