We study the role of impact parameter on the collective flow and its
disappearance for different mass asymmetric reactions. The mass asymmetry is
varied from 0 to 0.7 keeping the total mass of the system fixed. Our results
clearly indicate a significant role of impact parameter on the collective flow
and its disappearance for the mass asymmetric reactions. The impact parameter
dependence is also found to vary with mass asymmetry of the reaction.
