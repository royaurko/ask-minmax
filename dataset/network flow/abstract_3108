Large software projects are among most sophisticated human-made systems
consisting of a network of interdependent parts. Past studies of software
systems from the perspective of complex networks have already led to notable
discoveries with different applications. Nevertheless, our comprehension of the
structure of software networks remains to be only partial. We here investigate
correlations or mixing between linked nodes and show that software networks
reveal dichotomous node degree mixing similar to that recently observed in
biological networks. We further show that software networks also reveal
characteristic clustering profiles and mixing. Hence, node mixing in software
networks significantly differs from that in, e.g., the Internet or social
networks. We explain the observed mixing through the presence of groups of
nodes with common linking pattern. More precisely, besides densely linked
groups known as communities, software networks also consist of disconnected
groups denoted modules, core/periphery structures and other. Moreover, groups
coincide with the intrinsic properties of the underlying software projects,
which promotes practical applications in software engineering.
