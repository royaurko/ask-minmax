It has been pointed out by Bekenstein and Mayo that the behavior of the Black
hole's entropy or information flow is similar to that through one-dimensional
channel. Here I analyse the same issue with the use of gravitational anomalies.
The rate of the entropy change ($\dot{S}$) and the power ($P$) of the Hawking
emission are calculated from the relevant components of the anomalous
stress-tensor under the Unruh vacuum condition. I show that the dependence of
$\dot{S}$ on power is $\dot{S}\propto P^{1/2}$ which is identical to that for
the information flow in one dimensional system. This is established by using
the ($1+1$) dimensional gravitational anomalies first. Then the fact is further
bolstered by considering the ($1+3$) dimensional gravitational anomalies. It is
found that in the former case, the proportionality constant is exactly
identical to one dimensional situation, known as Pendry's formula, while in
later situation its value decreases.
