We study the contraction of a convex immersed plane curve with speed
(1/{\alpha})k^{{\alpha}}, where {\alpha}in(0,1] is a constant and show that, if
the blow-up rate of the curvature is of type one, it will converge to a
homothetic self-similar solution. We also discuss a special symmetric case of
type two blow-up and show that it converges to a translational self-similar
solution. In the case of curve shortening flow (i.e., when {\alpha}=1), this
translational self-similar solution is the familiar "Grim Reaper" (a
terminology due to M. Grayson [GR]).
