Advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) are known to be convectively
unstable for low values of the viscosity parameter alpha. Two-dimensional
axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of such flows reveal a radial density
profile which is significantly flatter than the rho~r^{-3/2} expected for a
canonical ADAF. The modified density profile is the result of inward transport
of angular momentum by axisymmetric convective eddies. We present
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of convective ADAFs which are free
of the assumption of axisymmetry. We find that the results are qualitatively
and quantitatively similar to those obtained with two-dimensional simulations.
In particular, the convective eddies are nearly axisymmetric and transport
angular momentum inward.
