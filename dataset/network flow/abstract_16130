We present far-UV spectroscopy of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1399,
obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. Of all quiescent
ellipticals, NGC 1399 has the strongest known ``UV upturn'' -- a sharp spectral
rise shortward of 2500 A. It is now well-established that this emission comes
from hot horizontal branch (HB) stars and their progeny; however, the chemical
composition of these stars has been the subject of a long-standing debate. For
the first time in observations of any elliptical galaxy, our spectra clearly
show photospheric metallic absorption lines within the UV upturn. The abundance
of N is at 45% solar, Si is at 13% solar, and C is at 2% solar. Such abundance
anomalies are a natural consequence of gravitational diffusion. These
photospheric abundances fall in the range observed for subdwarf B stars of the
Galactic field.
  Although NGC1399 is at the center of the Fornax cluster, we find no evidence
for O VI cooling flow emission. The upper limit to 1032,1038 emission is
3.9E-15 erg/s/cm2, equivalent to 0.14 M_sun/yr, and less than that predicted by
simple cooling flow models of the NGC 1399 X-ray luminosity.
