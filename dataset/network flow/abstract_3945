In this paper, we investigate the joint design of channel and network coding
in bi-directional relaying systems and propose a combined low complexity
physical network coding and LDPC decoding scheme. For the same LDPC codes
employed at both source nodes, we show that the relay can decodes the network
coded codewords from the superimposed signal received from the BPSK-modulated
multiple-access channel. Simulation results shown that this novel joint
physical network coding and LDPC decoding method outperforms the existing MMSE
network coding and LDPC decoding method over AWGN and complex MAC channel.
