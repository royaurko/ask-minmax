We investigate unimodular random networks. Our motivations include their
characterization via reversibility of an associated random walk and their
similarities to unimodular quasi-transitive graphs. We extend various theorems
concerning random walks, percolation, spanning forests, and amenability from
the known context of unimodular quasi-transitive graphs to the more general
context of unimodular random networks. We give properties of a trace associated
to unimodular random networks with applications to stochastic comparison of
continuous-time random walk.
