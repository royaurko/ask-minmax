We extend our recent work on ``two-metric'' theories of gravity by showing
how in such models cosmic defects can produce a spectrum of primordial Gaussian
density perturbations. This will happen when the speed characterising the decay
products of the defect network is much larger than the speed characterising
gravity and all standard model particles. This model will exactly mimic all the
standard predictions of inflationary models, and the only way of distinguishing
the two will be via the detection of the decay products of the network.
