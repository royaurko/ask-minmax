We present a large sample of H- and K-band spectra of 32 optically line
luminous central cluster galaxies. We find significant rovibrational H_2
emission in 23 of these galaxies as well as H recombination and/or [FeII]
emission in another 5. This represents a fourfold increase in the number of
molecular line detections known. A number of the detections are of extended
emission (5-20 kpc). In several objects we find significant [SiVI] emission
that appears to correlate with the strength of high ionization lines in the
optical (e.g. [OIII]). This comprehensive sample builds on previous work and
confirms that warm (1000-2500K) molecular hydrogen is present wherever there is
ionized material in the cores of cooling flows and in most cases it also
coincides with CO molecular line emission.
