Higher order clustering coefficients $C(x)$ are introduced for random
networks. The coefficients express probabilities that the shortest distance
between any two nearest neighbours of a certain vertex $i$ equals $x$, when one
neglects all paths crossing the node $i$. Using $C(x)$ we found that in the
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model the average shortest path length in a node's
neighbourhood is smaller than the equivalent quantity of the whole network and
the remainder depends only on the network parameter $m$. Our results show that
small values of the standard clustering coefficient in large BA networks are
due to random character of the nearest neighbourhood of vertices in such
networks.
