We analyze the shock-in-jet models for the gamma-ray flaring blazars
0420-014, OJ 287, and 1156+295 presented in Aller et al. (2014, Paper I),
quantifying how well the modeling constrains internal properties of the flow
(low energy spectral cutoff, partition between random and ordered magnetic
field), the flow dynamics (quiescent flow speed and orientation), and the
number and strength of the shocks responsible for radio-band flaring. We
conclude that well-sampled, multifrequency polarized flux light curves are
crucial for defining source properties. We argue for few, if any, low energy
particles in these flows, suggesting no entrainment and efficient energization
of jet material, and for approximate energy equipartition between the random
and ordered magnetic field components, suggesting that ordered field is built
by non-trivial dynamo action from the random component, or that the latter
arises from a jet instability that preserves the larger-scale, ordered flow. We
present evidence that the difference between orphan radio-band (no gamma-ray
counterpart) and non-orphan flares is due to more complex shock interactions in
the latter case.
