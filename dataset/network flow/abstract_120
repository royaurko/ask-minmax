Using a Maximum Entropy Production Principle (MEPP), we derive a new type of
relaxation equations for two-dimensional turbulent flows in the case where a
prior vorticity distribution is prescribed instead of the Casimir constraints
[Ellis, Haven, Turkington, Nonlin., 15, 239 (2002)]. The particular case of a
Gaussian prior is specifically treated in connection to minimum enstrophy
states and Fofonoff flows. These relaxation equations are compared with other
relaxation equations proposed by Robert and Sommeria [Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 2776
(1992)] and Chavanis [Physica D, 237, 1998 (2008)]. They can provide a
small-scale parametrization of 2D turbulence or serve as numerical algorithms
to compute maximum entropy states with appropriate constraints. We perform
numerical simulations of these relaxation equations in order to illustrate
geometry induced phase transitions in geophysical flows.
