A continuum theory of partially fluidized granular flows is developed. The
theory is based on a combination of the equations for the flow velocity and
shear stresses coupled with the order parameter equation which describes the
transition between flowing and static components of the granular system. We
apply this theory to several important granular problems: avalanche flow in
deep and shallow inclined layers, rotating drums and shear granular flows
between two plates. We carry out quantitative comparisons between the theory
and experiment.
