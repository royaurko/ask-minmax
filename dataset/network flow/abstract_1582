The research is important for a molecular theory of liquid and has a wide
interest as an example solving the problem when dynamic parameters of systems
can be indirectly connected with their equilibrium properties. In frameworks of
the reptation model the power law with the 3.4-exponent for the melt viscosity
relation to the molecular weight of linear flexible-chain polymer is predicted
as distinct from the value 3 expected for a melt of ring macromolecules. To
find the exponent close to experimental values it should be taken into account
the rotation vibration precession motion of chain ends about the polymer melt
flow direction.
