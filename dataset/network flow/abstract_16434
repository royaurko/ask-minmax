Sunspots harboring umbrae of both magnetic polarities within a common
penumbra (delta-spots) are often but not always related to flares. We present
first near-infrared (NIR) observations (Fe I 1078.3 nm and Si I 1078.6 nm
spectra) obtained with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP) at the Vacuum
Tower Telescope (VTT) in Tenerife on 2012 June 17, which afford accurate and
sensitive diagnostics to scrutinize the complex fields along the magnetic
neutral line of a delta-spot within active region NOAA 11504. We examine the
vector magnetic field, line-of-sight (LOS) velocities, and horizontal proper
motions of this rather inactive delta-spot. We find a smooth transition of the
magnetic vector field from the main umbra to that of opposite polarity
(delta-umbra), but a discontinuity of the horizontal magnetic field at some
distance from the delta-umbra on the polarity inversion line. The magnetic
field decreases faster with height by a factor of two above the delta-umbra.
The latter is surrounded by its own Evershed flow. The Evershed flow coming
from the main umbra ends at a line dividing the spot into two parts. This line
is marked by the occurrence of central emission in the Ca II 854.2 nm line.
Along this line, high chromospheric LOS-velocities of both signs appear. We
detect a shear flow within the horizontal flux transport velocities parallel to
the dividing line.
