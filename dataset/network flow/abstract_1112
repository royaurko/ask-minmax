It is difficult to develop quantitative hypotheses to describe the diffusion
of information among users, because, in theory, information resources can have
an infinite number of copies. And this theoretical possibility has become a
reality in an age of information explosion, when a Twitter meme may spread
rapidly to millions of users in a few hours. To address this issue, we propose
to study the transportation of users' attention between information resources.
We use clicks as a proxy of attention and construct attention networks using
the browsing log files from 1,000 Web forums. Our previous research discovered
the scaling relationship between clicks and users with an exponent $\theta$
that characterizes the efficiency of forums in spreading information. In this
paper we propose a geometric model to explain this scaling property. We view
attention networks as $d$-dimensional flow-balls that satisfy $\theta=(d+1)/d$
and we find that the time-invariant parameter $d$ can be estimated from the
spatial distribution of flow dissipation in the balls. In other words, we are
able to predict the temporal dynamics of Web forums ($\theta$) by analyzing the
structure of attention networks.
