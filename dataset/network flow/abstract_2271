We investigate the fully developed flow between two parallel plates and the
film flow over a plate in an electrically conducting fluid under the action of
a parallel Lorentz force. Exact analytical solutions are derived for velocity,
flow rate and wall shear stress at the plates. The velocity results are
presented in figures. All these flows are new and are presented for the first
time in the literature.
