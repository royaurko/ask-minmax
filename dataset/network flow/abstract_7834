An original packaging method suitable for integrated thermal mass flow
sensors is presented. The method consists in the application of a plastic
transparent adapter to the chip surface. The adapter is sealed to the chip
surface by means of a thermal procedure. By this approach it is possible to
selectively convey the fluid flow to reduced chip areas, avoiding contact with
the pads. Fabrication and testing of a very compact flow sensor is described.
