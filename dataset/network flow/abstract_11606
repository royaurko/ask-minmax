This paper considers a device-to-device (D2D) underlaid cellular network
where an uplink cellular user communicates with the base station while multiple
direct D2D links share the uplink spectrum. This paper proposes a random
network model based on stochastic geometry and develops centralized and
distributed power control algorithms. The goal of the proposed power control
algorithms is two-fold: ensure the cellular users have sufficient coverage
probability by limiting the interference created by underlaid D2D users, while
also attempting to support as many D2D links as possible. For the distributed
power control method, expressions for the coverage probabilities of cellular
and D2D links are derived and a lower bound on the sum rate of the D2D links is
provided. The analysis reveals the impact of key system parameters on the
network performance. For example, the bottleneck of D2D underlaid cellular
networks is the cross-tier interference between D2D links and the cellular
user, not the D2D intra-tier interference. Numerical results show the gains of
the proposed power control algorithms and accuracy of the analysis.
