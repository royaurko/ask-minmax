The existence of an Almeida-Thouless (AT) instability surface below the upper
critical dimension 6 is demonstrated in the generic replica symmetric field
theory. Renormalization flows from around the zero-field fixed point are
investigated. By introducing the temperature and magnetic field dependence of
the bare parameters, the fate of the AT line can be followed from mean field
(infinite dimensions) down to d<6.
