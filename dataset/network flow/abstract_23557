Clustering is well-known to play a prominent role in the description and
understanding of complex networks, and a large spectrum of tools and ideas have
been introduced to this end. In particular, it has been recognized that the
abundance of small subgraphs is important. Here, we study the arrangement of
triangles in a model for scale-free random graphs and determine the asymptotic
behavior of the clustering coefficient, the average number of triangles, as
well as the number of triangles attached to the vertex of maximum degree. We
prove that triangles are power-law distributed among vertices and characterized
by both vertex and edge coagulation when the degree exponent satisfies
$2<\beta<2.5$; furthermore, a finite density of triangles appears as
$\beta=2+1/3$.
