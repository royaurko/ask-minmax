We make some remarks on Sokhan and Quirke's [{\it Phys. Rev. E} 78, 015301(R)
(2008)] paper (arXiv:0805.1666). Sokhan and Quirke mentioned that, considering
their main result, {the slip coefficient is independent of the external force
(flux)} which is not consistent with previous measurements and approaches. We
also discuss the sudden changes of the slip coefficient for larger Knudsen
numbers or smaller nanopores.
