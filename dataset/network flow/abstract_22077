The global existence of weak solutions for the three-dimensional axisymmetric
Euler-$\alpha$ (also known as Lagrangian-averaged Euler-$\alpha$) equations,
without swirl, is established, whenever the initial unfiltered velocity $v_0$
satisfies $\frac{\nabla \times v_0}{r}$ is a finite Randon measure with compact
support. Furthermore, the global existence and uniqueness, is also established
in this case provided $\frac{\nabla \times v_0}{r} \in L^p_c(\mathbb{R}^3)$
with $p>{3/2}$. It is worth mention that no such results are known to be
available, so far, for the three-dimensional Euler equations of ideal
incompressible flows.
