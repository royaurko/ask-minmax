The microstructure of a strongly coupled liquid undergoing a shear flow was
studied experimentally. The liquid was a shear melted two-dimensional plasma
crystal, i.e., a single-layer suspension of micrometer-size particles in a rf
discharge plasma. Trajectories of particles were measured using video
microscopy. The resulting microstructure was anisotropic, with compressional
and extensional axes at around $\pm 45^{\circ}$ to the flow direction.
Corresponding ellipticity of the pair correlation function $g({\bf r})$ or
static structure factor $S(\bf{k})$ gives the (normalized) shear rate of the
flow.
