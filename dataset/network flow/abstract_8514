We consider one typical system of oscillators coupled through disordered link
configurations in networks, i.e., a finite population of coupled phase
oscillators with distributed intrinsic frequencies on a random network. We
investigate collective synchronization behavior, paying particular attention to
link-disorder fluctuation effects on the synchronization transition and its
finite-size scaling (FSS). Extensive numerical simulations as well as the
mean-field analysis have been performed. We find that link-disorder
fluctuations effectively induce {\em uncorrelated random} fluctuations in
frequency, resulting in the FSS exponent $\bar\nu=5/2$, which is identical to
that in the globally coupled case (no link disorder) with frequency-disorder
fluctuations.
