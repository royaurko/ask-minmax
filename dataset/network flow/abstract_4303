Hierarchical models of scale free networks are introduced where numbers of
nodes in clusters of a given hierarchy are stochastic variables. Our models
show periodic oscillations of degree distribution P(k) in the log-log scale.
Periods and amplitudes of such oscillations depend on network parameters.
Numerical simulations are in a good agreement to analytical calculations.
