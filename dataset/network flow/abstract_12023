A simple model to encapsulate the essential growth properties of \emph{the
web of human sexual contacts} is presented. In the model only heterosexual
connection is considered and represented by a random growing bipartite graph
where both male-female contact networks grow simultaneously. The time evolution
of the model is analysed by a rate equation approach leading to confirm that
male and female sexual contact distributions decay as power laws with exponents
depending on influx and charisma of the sexes.
