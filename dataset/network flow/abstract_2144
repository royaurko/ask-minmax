Internet is composed of numbers of independent autonomous systems. BGP is
used to disseminate reachability information and establishing path between
autonomous systems. Each autonomous system is allowed to select a single route
to a destination and then export the selected route to its neighbors. The
selection of single best route imposes restrictions on the use of alternative
paths during interdomain link failure and thus, incurred packet loss. Packet
loss still occurs even when multiple paths exist between source and destination
but these paths have not been utilized. To minimize the packet loss, when
multiple paths exist, multipath routing techniques are introduced. Multipath
routing techniques ensure the use of alternative paths on link failure. It
computes set of paths which can be used when primary path is not available and
it also provides a way to transit domains to have control over the traffic
flow. This can be achieved by little modification to current BGP. This paper
highlights different multipath routing techniques and also discusses the
overhead incurred by each of them.
