There is a simple and general experimental protocol to generate slow granular
flows that exhibit wide shear zones, qualitatively different from the narrow
shear bands that are usually observed in granular materials . The essence is to
drive the granular medium not from the sidewalls, but to split the bottom of
the container that supports the grains in two parts and slide these parts past
each other. Here we review the main features of granular flows in such
split-bottom geometries.
