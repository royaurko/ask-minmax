Community detection has attracted increasing attention during the past
decade, and many algorithms have been proposed to find the underlying community
structure in a given network. Many of these algorithms are based on modularity
maximization, and these methods suffer from the resolution limit. In order to
detect the underlying cluster structure, we propose a new convex formulation to
decompose a partially observed adjacency matrix of a network into low-rank and
sparse components. In such decomposition, the low-rank component encodes the
cluster structure under certain assumptions. We also devise an alternating
direction method of multipliers with increasing penalty sequence to solve this
problem; and compare it with Louvain method, which maximizes the modularity, on
some synthetic randomly generated networks. Numerical results show that our
method outperforms Louvain method on the randomly generated networks when
variance among cluster sizes increases. Moreover, empirical results also
demonstrate that our formulation is indeed tighter than the robust PCA
formulation, and is able to find the true clustering when the robust PCA
formulation fails.
