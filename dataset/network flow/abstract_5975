We provide an axiomatic characterization of information fusion, on the basis
of which we define an information fusion network. Our construction is
reminiscent of tangle diagrams in low dimensional topology. Information fusion
networks come equipped with a natural notion of equivalence. Equivalent
networks `contain the same information', but differ locally. When fusing
streams of information, an information fusion network may adaptively optimize
itself inside its equivalence class. This provides a fault tolerance mechanism
for such networks.
