This paper considers a multiuser cellular two-way relay network (cTWRN) where
multiple users exchange information with a base station (BS) via a relay
station (RS). Each user is equipped with a single antenna, while both the BS
and the RS are equipped with a very large antenna array. We investigate the
performance of the cTWRN with amplify-and-forward (AF) based physical-layer
network coding, and derive closed-form expression for the asymptotic spectral
efficiency when both the number of antennas at the BS and the RS grow large. It
is shown that the noise propagation of the non-regenerative relaying protocol
can be greatly suppressed, and the AF relaying scheme can approach the cut-set
bound under certain conditions. We also investigate the performance of the AF
relaying scheme under two power-scaling cases, and show that the transmit power
of the BS and each user can be made inversely proportional to the number of
relay antennas while maintaining a given quality-of-service. Numerical results
are presented to verify the analytical results.
