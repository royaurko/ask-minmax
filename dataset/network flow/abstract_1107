In this paper we propose a LWR-like model for traffic flow on networks which
allows one to track several groups of drivers, each of them being characterized
only by their destination in the network. The path actually followed to reach
the destination is not assigned a priori, and can be chosen by the drivers
during the journey, taking decisions at junctions.
  The model is then used to describe three possible behaviors of drivers,
associated to three different ways to solve the route choice problem: 1.
Drivers ignore the presence of the other vehicles; 2. Drivers react to the
current distribution of traffic, but they do not forecast what will happen at
later times; 3. Drivers take into account the current and future distribution
of vehicles. Notice that, in the latter case, we enter the field of
differential games, and, if a solution exists, it likely represents a global
equilibrium among drivers.
  Numerical simulations highlight the differences between the three behaviors
and suggest the existence of multiple Wardrop equilibria.
