This paper addresses handover decision instability which impacts negatively
on both user perception and network performances. To this aim, a new technique
called The HandOver Decision STAbility Technique (HODSTAT) is proposed for
horizontal handover in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) based on IEEE
802.11standard. HODSTAT is based on a hysteresis margin analysis that, combined
with a utilitybased function, evaluates the need for the handover and
determines if the handover is needed or avoided. Indeed, if a Mobile Terminal
(MT) only transiently hands over to a better network, the gain from using this
new network may be diminished by the handover overhead and short usage
duration. The approach that we adopt throughout this article aims at reducing
the minimum handover occurrence that leads to the interruption of network
connectivity (this is due to the nature of handover in WLAN which is a break
before make which causes additional delay and packet loss). To this end, MT
rather performs a handover only if the connectivity of the current network is
threatened or if the performance of a neighboring network is really better
comparing the current one with a hysteresis margin. This hysteresis should make
a tradeoff between handover occurrence and the necessity to change the current
network of attachment. Our extensive simulation results show that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other decision stability approaches for handover decision
algorithm.
