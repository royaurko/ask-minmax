In the present work the generation of zonal flows in collisionless trapped
electron mode (TEM) turbulence is studied analytically. A reduced model for TEM
turbulence is utilized based on an advanced fluid model for reactive drift
waves. An analytical expression for the zonal flow growth rate is derived and
compared with the linear TEM growth, and its scaling with plasma parameters is
examined for typical tokamak parameter values.
