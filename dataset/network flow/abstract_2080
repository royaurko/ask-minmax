We introduce an event-driven simulation scheme for overdamped dynamics of
frictionless hard spheres subjected to external forces, neglecting hydrodynamic
interactions. Our event-driven approach is based on an exact equation of motion
which relates the driving force to the resulting velocities through the
geometric information characterizing the underlying network of contacts between
the hard spheres. Our method allows for a robust extraction of the
instantaneous coordination of the particles as well as contact force statistics
and dynamics, under any chosen driving force, in addition to shear flow and
compression. It can also be used for generating high-precision jammed packings
under shear, compression, or both. We present a number of additional
applications of our method.
