As the discovery of non-Poissonian statistics of human mobility trajectories,
more attention has been paid to understanding the role of these patterns in
different dynamics. In this study, we first introduce the heterogeneous
mobility of mobile agents into dynamical networks, and then investigate the
forwarding strategy on the heterogeneous dynamical networks. We find that the
faster speed and the higher proportion of high-speed agents can enhance the
network throughput and reduce the mean traveling time in the case of random
forwarding. A hierarchical structure in the dependence of high-speed is
observed: the network throughput remains unchanged in small and large
high-speed value. It is interesting to find that the slightly preferential
forwarding to high-speed agents can maximize the network capacity. Through
theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the optimal
forwarding ratio stems from local structural heterogeneity of low-speed agents.
