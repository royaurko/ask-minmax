Situational awareness is crucial for effective disaster management. However,
obtaining information about the actual situation is usually difficult and
time-consuming. While there has been some effort in terms of incorporating the
affected population as a source of information, the issue of obtaining
trustworthy information has not yet received much attention. Therefore, we
introduce the concept of witness-based report verification, which enables users
from the affected population to evaluate reports issued by other users. We
present an extensive overview of the objectives to be fulfilled by such a
scheme and provide a first approach considering security and privacy. Finally,
we evaluate the performance of our approach in a simulation study. Our results
highlight synergetic effects of group mobility patterns that are likely in
disaster situations.
