The future smart grid is envisioned as a large-scale cyber-physical system
encompassing advanced power, communications, control, and computing
technologies. In order to accommodate these technologies, it will have to build
on solid mathematical tools that can ensure an efficient and robust operation
of such heterogeneous and large-scale cyber-physical systems. In this context,
this paper is an overview on the potential of applying game theory for
addressing relevant and timely open problems in three emerging areas that
pertain to the smart grid: micro-grid systems, demand-side management, and
communications. In each area, the state-of-the-art contributions are gathered
and a systematic treatment, using game theory, of some of the most relevant
problems for future power systems is provided. Future opportunities for
adopting game theoretic methodologies in the transition from legacy systems
toward smart and intelligent grids are also discussed. In a nutshell, this
article provides a comprehensive account of the application of game theory in
smart grid systems tailored to the interdisciplinary characteristics of these
systems that integrate components from power systems, networking,
communications, and control.
