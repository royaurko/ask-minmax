In this article, we introduce the notion of stochastic symmetry of a
differential equation. It consists in a stochastic flow that acts over a
solution of a differential equation and produces another solution of the same
equation. In the ordinary case, we give necessary conditions in order to obtain
such symmetries. These conditions involve the infinitesimal generator of the
flow and the coefficients of the equation.
  Moreover, we show how to obtain necessary conditions in order to find an
application that transforms a stochastic differential equation that one would
like to solve into a target equation that one previously know how to solve.
