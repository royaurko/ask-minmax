We consider diffusion processes on power-law small-world networks in
different dimensions. In one dimension, we find a rich phase diagram, with
different transient and recurrent phases, including a critical line with
continuously varying exponents. The results were obtained using self-consistent
perturbation theory and can also be understood in terms of a scaling theory,
which provides a general framework for understanding processes on small-world
networks with different distributions of long-range links.
