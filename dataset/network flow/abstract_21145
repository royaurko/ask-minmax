Some methods for the numerical computation of two-loop non-infrared vertices
are reviewed. A new method is also proposed and compared to the old ones.
Finally, some preliminary results are presented, concerning the evaluation of
the fermionic corrections to $\sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^{\rm lept}$ through the
described techniques.
