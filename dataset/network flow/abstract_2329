In a hydrodynamic model, with fluctuating initial conditions, the correlation
between triangular flow and initial spatial triangularity is studied. The
triangular flow, even in ideal fluid, is only weakly correlated with the
initial triangularity. The correlation is largely reduced in viscous fluid.
Elliptic flow on the other hand appears to be strongly correlated with initial
eccentricity. Weak correlation between triangular flow and initial
triangularity indicate that a part of triangular flow is unrelated to initial
triangularity. Triangularity acquired during the fluid evolution also
contributes to the triangular flow.
