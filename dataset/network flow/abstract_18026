The examination of Osteoarthritis disease through X-ray by rheumatology can
be classified into four grade of severity. This paper discusses about the
application of artificial neural network backpropagation method for measuring
the severity of the disease, where the observed X-ray range from wrist to
fingers. The main procedures of system in this paper is divided into three,
which are image processing, feature extraction, and artificial neural network
process. First, an X-ray image digital (200x150 pixels and greyscale) will be
thresholded, then extracted features based on probabilistic values of the color
intensity of seven bit quantization result, and statistical textures. That
feature values then will be normalizing to interval [0.1, 0.9], and then the
result would be processing on backpropagation artificial neural network system
as input to determine the severity of disease from an X-ray had input before
it. From testing with learning rate 0.3, momentum 0.4, hidden units five pieces
and about 132 feature vectors, this system had had a level of accuracy of 100%
for learning data, 80% for learning and non-learning data, and 66.6% for
non-learning data
