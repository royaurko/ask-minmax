The network flow optimization approach is offered for Bayesian segmentation
of gray-scale and color images. It is supposed image pixels are characterized
by a feature function taking finite number of arbitrary rational values (it can
be either intensity values or other characteristics of images). The clusters of
homogeneous pixels are described by labels with values in another set of
rational numbers. They are assumed to be dependent and distributed according to
either the exponential or the Gaussian Gibbs law. Instead traditionally used
local neighborhoods of nearest pixels the completely connected graph of
dependence of all pixels is employed for the Gibbs prior distributions.
  The methods developed reduce the problem of segmentation to the problem of
determination of the minimum network cuts.
