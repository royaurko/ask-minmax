The effects of dissipation on the space time evolution of matter formed in
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collision is discussed. The thermal photon spectra
for RHIC and LHC energies with viscous flow is considered. The effects of
viscosity in the thermal single photon spectra is seen to be important in QGP
phase as compared to the hadronic phase. Recently available data from WA80
group at SPS energies for $S+Au$ collision are compared with theoretical
calculations. The experimental data do not appear to be compatible with the
formation of matter in the pure hadronic phase.
