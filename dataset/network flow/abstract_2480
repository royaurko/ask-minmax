The rheology and molecular structure of a model bitumen (Cooee bitumen) under
shear are investigated in the non-Newtonian regime using non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations. The shear viscosity, normal stress differences
and pressure of the bitumen mixture are computed at different shear rates and
different temperatures. The model bitumen is shown to be a shear-thinning fluid
at all temperatures. In addition, the Cooee model is able to reproduce
experimental results showing the formation of nanoaggregates composed of stacks
of flat aromatic molecules in bitumen. These nanoaggregates are immersed in a
solvent of saturated hydrocarbon molecules. At a fixed temperature, the
shear-shinning behavior is related to the inter- and intramolecular alignment
of the solvent molecules, but also to the decrease of the average size of the
nanoaggregates at high shear rates. The variation of the viscosity with
temperature at different shear rates is also related to the size and relative
composition of the nanoaggregates. The slight anisotropy of the whole sample
due to the nanoaggregates is considered and quantified. Finally, the position
of bitumen mixtures in the broad literature of complex systems such as
colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions and associating polymer networks is
discussed.
