We study the problem of body-force driven shear flows in a plane channel of
width l with free-slip boundaries. A mini-max variational problem for upper
bounds on the bulk time averaged energy dissipation rate epsilon is derived
from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with no secondary assumptions.
This produces rigorous limits on the power consumption that are valid for
laminar or turbulent solutions. The mini-max problem is solved exactly at high
Reynolds numbers Re = U*l/nu, where U is the rms velocity and nu is the
kinematic viscosity, yielding an explicit bound on the dimensionless asymptotic
dissipation factor beta=epsilon*l/U^3 that depends only on the ``shape'' of the
shearing body force. For a simple half-cosine force profile, for example, the
high Reynolds number bound is beta <= pi^2/sqrt{216} = .6715... . We also
report extensive direct numerical simulations for this particular force shape
up to Re approximately 400; the observed dissipation rates are about a factor
of three below the rigorous high-Re bound. Interestingly, the high-Re optimal
solution of the variational problem bears some qualitative resemblence to the
observed mean flow profiles in the simulations. These results extend and refine
the recent analysis for body-forced turbulence in J. Fluid Mech. 467, 289-306
(2002).
