Granular surface flows are common in industrial practice and natural systems,
however, theoretical description of such flows is at present incomplete. Two
prototype systems involving surface flow are compared: heap formation by
pouring at a point and rotating cylinders. Continuum models for analysis of
these flows are reviewed, and experimental results for quasi-2d systems are
presented. Experimental results in both systems are well described by continuum
models.
