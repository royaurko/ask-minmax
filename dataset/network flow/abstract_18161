The structure of the Internet at the Autonomous System (AS) level has been
studied by both the Physics and Computer Science communities. We extend this
work to include features of the core and the periphery, taking a radial
perspective on AS network structure. New methods for plotting AS data are
described, and they are used to analyze data sets that have been extended to
contain edges missing from earlier collections. In particular, the average
distance from one vertex to the rest of the network is used as the baseline
metric for investigating radial structure. Common vertex-specific quantities
are plotted against this metric to reveal distinctive characteristics of
central and peripheral vertices. Two data sets are analyzed using these
measures as well as two common generative models (Barabasi-Albert and Inet). We
find a clear distinction between the highly connected core and a sparse
periphery. We also find that the periphery has a more complex structure than
that predicted by degree distribution or the two generative models.
