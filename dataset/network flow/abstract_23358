We find and thoroughly study new supergravity domain wall solutions which are
holographic realizations of supersymmetry breaking strongly coupled gauge
theories. We set ourselves in an N=2 gauged supergravity with a minimal content
in order to reproduce a dual N=1 effective SCFT which has a U(1)_R symmetry, a
chiral operator whose components are responsible for triggering the RG flow,
and an additional U(1)_F symmetry. We present a full three dimensional
parameter space of solutions, which generically break supersymmetry. Some known
solutions are recovered for specific sets of values of the parameters, with the
new solutions interpolating between them. The generic backgrounds being
singular, we provide a stability test of their dual theories by showing that
there are no tachyonic resonances in the two point correlators. We compute the
latter by holographic renormalization. We also carefully analyze the appearance
of massless modes, such as the dilaton and the R axion, when the respective
symmetries are spontaneously broken, and their lifting when the breaking is
explicit. We further comment on the application of such class of backgrounds as
archetypes of strongly coupled hidden sectors for gauge mediation of
supersymmetry breaking. In particular, we show that it is possible to model in
this way all types of hierarchies between the visible sector gaugino and
sfermion masses.
