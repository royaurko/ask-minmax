Gamma-ray burst counterpart studies require small, prompt error boxes. Today,
there are several missions which can provide them: BeppoSAX, the Rossi X-Ray
Timing Explorer, and the 3rd Interplanetary Network. In the near future,
HETE-II, a possible extended Interplanetary Network, and INTEGRAL will operate
in this capacity. In the longer term future, a dedicated gamma-ray burst MIDEX
mission may fly. The capabilities of these missions are reviewed, comparing the
number of bursts, the rapidity of the localizations, and the error box sizes.
