Differently from theoretical scale-free networks, most of real networks
present multi-scale behavior with nodes structured in different types of
functional groups and communities. While the majority of approaches for
classification of nodes in a complex network has relied on local measurements
of the topology/connectivity around each node, valuable information about node
functionality can be obtained by Concentric (or Hierarchical) Measurements. In
this paper we explore the possibility of using a set of Concentric Measurements
and agglomerative clustering methods in order to obtain a set of functional
groups of nodes. Concentric clustering coefficient and convergence ratio are
chosen as segregation parameters for the analysis of a institutional
collaboration network including various known communities (departments of the
University of S\~ao Paulo). A dendogram is obtained and the results are
analyzed and discussed. Among the interesting obtained findings, we emphasize
the scale-free nature of the obtained network, as well as the identification of
different patterns of contributorship emerging from different areas (e.g. human and
exact sciences). Another interesting result concerns the relatively uniform
distribution of hubs along the concentric levels, contrariwise to the
non-uniform pattern found in theoretical scale free networks such as the BA
model.
