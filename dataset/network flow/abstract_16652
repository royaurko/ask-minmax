Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a 100 megabits per second fiber
optic local area network (LAN) standard being developed by the American
National Standard Institute (ANSI).
  We analyze the impact of various design decisions on the error detection
capability of the protocol. In particular, we quantify frame error rate, token
loss rate, and undetected error rate. Several characteristics of the 32-bit
frame check sequence (FCS) polynomial, which is also used in IEEE 802 LAN
protocols, are discussed.
