This work reports a quantitative analysis to predicting the efficiency of
distributed computing running in three models of complex networks:
Barab\'asi-Albert, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Watts-Strogatz. A master/slave
computing model is simulated. A node is selected as master and distributes
tasks among the other nodes (the clients). Topological measurements associated
with the master node (e.g. its degree or betwenness centrality) are extracted
and considered as predictors of the total execution time. It is found that the
closeness centrality provides the best alternative. The effect of network size
was also investigated.
