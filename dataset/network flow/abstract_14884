This paper generalizes existing approaches for free-surface wave damping via
momentum sinks for flow simulations based on the Navier-Stokes equations. It is
shown in 2D flow simulations that, to obtain reliable wave damping, the
coefficients in the damping functions must be adjusted to the wave parameters.
A scaling law for selecting these damping coefficients is presented, which
enables similarity of the damping in model- and full-scale. The influence of
the thickness of the damping layer, the wave steepness, the mesh fineness and
the choice of the damping coefficients are examined. An efficient approach for
estimating the optimal damping setup is presented. Results of 3D ship
resistance computations show that the scaling laws apply to such simulations as
well, so the damping coefficients should be adjusted for every simulation to
ensure convergence of the solution in both model and full scale. Finally,
practical recommendations for the setup of reliable damping in flow simulations
with regular and irregular free surface waves are given.
