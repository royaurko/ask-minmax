Call Detail Records (CDRs) are data recorded by telecommunications companies,
consisting of basic informations related to several dimensions of the calls
made through the network: the source, destination, date and time of calls. CDRs
data analysis has received much attention in the recent years since it might
reveal valuable information about human behavior. It has shown high added value
in many application domains like e.g., communities analysis or network
planning. In this paper, we suggest a generic methodology for summarizing
information contained in CDRs data. The method is based on a parameter-free
estimation of the joint distribution of the variables that describe the calls.
We also suggest several well-founded criteria that allows one to browse the
summary at various granularities and to explore the summary by means of
insightful visualizations. The method handles network graph data, temporal
sequence data as well as user mobility data stemming from original CDRs data.
We show the relevance of our methodology for various case studies on real-world
CDRs data from Ivory Coast.
