Currently the area of VANET lacks in having some better designed algorithms
to handle dynamic change and frequent disruption due to the high mobility of
the vehicles. There are many techniques to disseminate messages across the
moving vehicles but they are all highly dependent on some conditions involving
flow, density and speed. The two techniques that are commonly used are AODV (Ad
Hoc on Demand Distance Vector) and DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication).
This work presents a detailed analysis of AODV. This study is focused on the
use of AODV in Intelligent Transportation System. The limitations in the
working of AODV routing protocol has been identified and proved. These
limitations can be removed to some extent in order to increase the performance
of vehicular networks and make the driving more safe and easy for a normal user
as well as the implementation complications will be removed and an efficient
system implementation will be possible.
