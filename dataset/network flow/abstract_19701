Particle production of identified charged hadrons, $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$,
$p$, and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt(snn) =$ 200 GeV has been
studied as a function of transverse momentum and collision centrality at $y=0$
and $y\sim1$ by the BRAHMS experiment at RHIC. Significant collective
transverse flow at kinetic freeze-out has been observed in the collisions. The
magnitude of the flow rises with the collision centrality. Proton and kaon
yields relative to the pion production increase strongly as the transverse
momentum increases and also increase with centrality. Particle yields per
participant nucleon show a weak dependence on the centrality for all particle
species. Hadron production remains relatively constant within one unit around
midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt(snn) =$ 200 GeV.
