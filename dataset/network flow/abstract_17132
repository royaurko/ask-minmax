We demonstrate how a genetic ring oscillator network with quorum sensing
feedback can operate as a robust logic gate. Specifically we show how a range
of logic functions, namely AND/NAND, OR/NOR and XOR/XNOR, can be realized by
the system, thus yielding a versatile unit that can morph between different
logic operations. We further demonstrate the capacity of this system to yield
complementary logic operations in parallel. Our results then indicate the
computing potential of this biological system, and may lead to bio-inspired
computing devices.
