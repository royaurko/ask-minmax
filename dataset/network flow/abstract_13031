The present paper is a review of counterexamples to the ``Hamiltonian Seifert
conjecture'' or, more generally, of examples of Hamiltonian systems having no
periodic orbits on a compact energy level. We begin with the discussion of the
``classical'' and volume--preserving Seifert conjectures. Then a construction
of counterexamples to the Hamiltonian Seifert conjecture in dimensions greater
than or equal to six is outlined, mainly following the method introduced by the
contributor of the paper. The Hamiltonian version of Seifert's theorem is also
stated. A list of all known at this moment examples and constructions of
Hamiltonian flows without periodic flows concludes the review.
