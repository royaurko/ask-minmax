We study the subsonic flows governed by full Euler equations in the half
plane bounded below by a piecewise smooth curve asymptotically approaching
x1-axis. Nonconstant conditions in the far field are prescribed to ensure the
real Euler flows. The Euler system is reduced to a single elliptic equation for
the stream function. The existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviors of the
solutions for the reduced equation are established by Schauder fixed point
argument and some delicate estimates. The existence of subsonic flows for the
original Euler system is proved based on the results for the reduced equation,
and their asymptotic behaviors in the far field are also obtained.
