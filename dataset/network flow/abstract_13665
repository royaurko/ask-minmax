Let C be the class of compact 2n-dimensional symplectic manifolds M for which
the first or (n-1) Chern class vanish. We point out an integer optimization
problem to find a lower bound B(n) on the number of equilibrium points of
non-Hamiltonian symplectic periodic flows on manifolds M in C. As a
consequence, we confirm in dimensions 2n in {8,10,12,14,18,20, 22} a conjecture
for unitary manifolds made by Kosniowski in 1979 for the subclass C.
