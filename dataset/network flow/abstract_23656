Customers arrive at rate N times alpha on a network of N single server
infinite buffer queues, choose L queues uniformly, join the shortest one, and
are served there in turn at rate beta. We let N go to infinity.We prove a
functional central limit theorem (CLT) for the tails of the empirical measures
of the queue occupations,in a Hilbert space with the weak topology, with limit
given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The a priori assumption is that the
initial data converge.This completes a recent functional CLT in equilibrium
result for which convergence for the initial data was not known in advance, but
was deduced a posteriori from the functional CLT.
