Influence maximization is the task of finding a set of seed nodes in a social
network such that the influence spread of these seed nodes based on certain
influence diffusion model is maximized. Topic-aware influence diffusion models
have been recently proposed to address the issue that influence between a pair
of users are often topic-dependent and information, ideas, innovations etc.
being propagated in networks (referred collectively as items in this paper) are
typically mixtures of topics. In this paper, we focus on the topic-aware
influence maximization task. In particular, we study preprocessing methods for
these topics to avoid redoing influence maximization for each item from
scratch. We explore two preprocessing algorithms with theoretical
justifications. Our empirical results on data obtained in a couple of existing
studies demonstrate that one of our algorithms stands out as a strong candidate
providing microsecond online response time and competitive influence spread,
with reasonable preprocessing effort.
