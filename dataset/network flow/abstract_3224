Using the method of prolongation we generate new solutions from a simple
particular solution for relativistic transverse flow with cylindrical symmetry
in 1+3 dimensions. This is an extension of the longitudinal Bjorken flow ansatz
and can be applied among others during first order phase transition in an
expanding system. The prolongated solution allows for tracing back the flow
profile from a transverse flow conjectured at the end of phase transition at
CERN SPS heavy ion collisons.
