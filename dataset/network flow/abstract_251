Basic physical principles are considered that are responsible for the origin
of dynamic air flow upon condensation of water vapor, the partial pressure of
which represents a store of potential energy in the atmosphere of Earth.
Quantitative characteristics of such flow are presented for several spatial
scales. It is shown that maximum condensation-induced velocities reach 160 m/s
and are realized in compact circulation patterns like tornadoes.
