Directional antennas and beamforming can significantly improve point-to-point
wireless links when perfectly aligned. In this letter we investigate the
extreme opposite where antenna orientations and positions are chosen at random
in the presence of Rayleigh fading. We show that while the 1-hop network
connectivity is deteriorated, the multihop routes improve, especially in the
dense regime. We derive closed form expressions for the expectation of the
$1$-hop and $2$-hop degree which are verified through computer simulations. We
conclude that node density does not greatly affect the number of hops required
between stations whilst simple random beamforming schemes do, thus returning
substantial network performance benefits due to the existence of shorter
multi-hop paths.
