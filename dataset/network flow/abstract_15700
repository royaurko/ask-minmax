Deep Neural nets (NNs) with millions of parameters are at the heart of many
state-of-the-art computer vision systems today. However, recent works have
shown that much smaller models can achieve similar levels of performance. In
this work, we address the problem of pruning parameters in a trained NN model.
Instead of removing individual weights one at a time as done in previous works,
we remove one neuron at a time. We show how similar neurons are redundant, and
propose a systematic way to remove them. Our experiments in pruning the densely
connected layers show that we can remove upto 85\% of the total parameters in
an MNIST-trained network, and about 35\% for AlexNet without significantly
affecting performance. Our method can be applied on top of most networks with a
fully connected layer to give a smaller network.
