The precise adjustment of the polariton condensate flow under incoherent
excitation conditions is an indispensable prerequisite for polariton-based
logic gate operations. In this report, an all-optical approach for steering the
motion of a polariton condensate using only non-resonant excitation is
demonstrated. We create arbitrarily shaped functional potentials by means of a
spatial light modulator, which allow for tailoring the condensate state and
guiding a propagating condensate along reconfigurable pathways. Additional
numerical simulations confirm the experimental observations and elucidate the
interaction effects between background carriers and polariton condensates.
