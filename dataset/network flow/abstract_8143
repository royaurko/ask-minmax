In this paper, the finite element method is combined with the Brownian
Configuration Field (BFC) method to simulate the fibre suspension flow in
axisymmetric contraction and expansion passages. In order to solve for the high
stress at high concentration, the Discrete Adaptive Viscoelastic Stress
Splitting (DAVSS) method is employed. For the axisymmetric contraction and
expansion passages with different geometry ratios, the results obtained are
compared to available constitutive models and experiments. The predicted vortex
length for dilute suspensions agrees well with experimental data in literature.
Our numerical results show clearly the effect on vortex enhancement with
increase of the volume fractions and the aspect ratios. Effect of aspect ratio
of fibres on the vortex length is also studied. It is found that for the lower
expansion ratio flows the vortex dimension in the corner region is fairly
independent of fibre concentration and aspect ratio of fibres while the said
vortex dimension increases with the increase of fibre concentration for
contraction flows. The finding suggests that the aligned fibre approximation
traditionally employed in previous work does not exactly describe the effect of
fibre motion, and the present BFC method is deemed more suitable for the flow
of dilute fibre suspensions. In terms of numerics, the employment of DAVSS
enhances numerical stability in the presence of high concentration of fibre in
the flow.
