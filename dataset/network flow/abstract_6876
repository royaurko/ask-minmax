The equilibrium of an axisymmetric magnetically confined plasma with
anisotropic resistivity and toroidal flow is investigated in the framework of
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The stationary states are determined by an elliptic
differential equation for the poloidal magnetic flux function, a Bernoulli
equation for the pressure and two relations for the resistivity components
parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. The equilibrium
characteristics of a tokamak with rectangular cross-section are studied by
means of eigenfunctions in connection with exact solutions for the cases of
"compressible" flows with constant temperature, but varying density on magnetic
surfaces and incompressible ones with constant density, but varying temperature
thereon. Those eigenfunctions can describe either single or multiple toroidal
configurations. In the former case the equilibrium has the following
characteristics: (i) the profiles of the resistivity's components on the
poloidal cross-section are roughly collisional (ii) the electric field
perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces possesses two local extrema within the
plasma and vanishes on the boundary and (iii) the toroidal current density is
peaked close to the magnetic axis and vanishes on the boundary. The impact of
the flow and the aspect ratio on the aforementioned quantities is evaluated for
both "compressible" and incompressible flows.
