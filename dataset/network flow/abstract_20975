Motivation: Models of discrete concurrent systems often lead to huge and
complex state transition graphs that represent their dynamics. This makes
difficult to analyse dynamical properties. In particular, for logical models of
biological regulatory networks, it is of real interest to study attractors and
their reachability from specific initial conditions, i.e. to assess the
potential asymptotical behaviours of the system. Beyond the identification of
the reachable attractors, we propose to quantify this reachability.
  Results: Relying on the structure of the state transition graph, we estimate
the probability of each attractor reachable from a given initial condition or
from a portion of the state space. First, we present a quasi-exact solution
with an original algorithm called Firefront, based on the exhaustive
exploration of the reachable state space. Then, we introduce an adapted version
of Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, termed Avatar, better suited to larger
models. Firefront and Avatar methods are validated and compared to other
related approaches, using as test cases logical models of synthetic and
biological networks.
  Availability: Both algorithms are implemented as Perl scripts that can be
