When an object moves smoothly across a field of view, the identify of the
object is unchanged, but the activation pattern of the photoreceptors on the
retina changes drastically. One of the major computational roles of our visual
system is to manage selectivity for different objects and tolerance to such
identity-preserving transformations as translations or rotations. This study
demonstrates that a hierarchical neural network, whose synaptic connectivities
are learned competitively with Hebbian plasticity operating within a local
spatiotemporal pooling range, is capable of gradually achieving feature
selectivity and transformation tolerance, so that the top level neurons carry
higher mutual information about object categories than a single-level neural
network. Furthermore, when genetic algorithm is applied to search for a network
architecture that maximizes transformation-invariant object recognition
performance, in conjunction with the associative learning algorithm, it is
found that deep networks outperform shallower ones.
