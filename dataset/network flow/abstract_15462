In this paper we make the first steps to bridge the gap between classic
control theory and modern, network-based epidemic models. In particular, we
apply nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to a pairwise ODE model which
we use to model a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) epidemic on
non-trivial contact structures. While classic control of epidemics concentrates
on aspects such as vaccination, quarantine and fast diagnosis, our novel setup
allows us to deliver control by altering the contact network within the
population. Moreover, the ideal outcome of control is to eradicate the disease
while keeping the network well connected. The paper gives a thorough and
detailed numerical investigation of the impact and interaction of system and
control parameters on the controllability of the system. The analysis reveals,
that for certain set parameters it is possible to identify critical control
bounds above which the system is controllable. We foresee, that our approach
can be extended to even more realistic or simulation-based models with the aim
to apply these to real-world situations.
