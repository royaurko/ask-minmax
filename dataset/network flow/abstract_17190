By using a distributed P2P system where the agents reside in in
microprocessors already present in most radio nodes like Wi-Fi access points,
base stations, TVs connected to Internet etc, these agents can discover other
agents over the back-haul network. As a result, client node lists (similar to
neighbor lists used in 3GPP) are created. An alternative is to use a
centralized database. Why this best is done by distributed agents is discussed
in this paper along with security considerations. Examples of other
applications which will benefit from this system is also presented.
