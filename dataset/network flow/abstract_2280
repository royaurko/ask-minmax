We study graphical mean curvature flow of complete solutions defined on
subsets of Euclidean space. We obtain smooth long time existence. The
projections of the evolving graphs also solve mean curvature flow. Hence this
approach allows to smoothly flow through singularities by studying graphical
mean curvature flow with one additional dimension.
