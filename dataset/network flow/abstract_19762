Superconduction manifests when a steady-state current flows through a
material without an electric field being present. It is argued here that the
absence of scattering of the charge-carriers, although absolutely necessary, is
not sufficient to explain why an electric field is zero when a current flows
between two contacts to a superconducting material. It is concluded that an
electric field, and thus a resistance, must manifest unless (i) the
charge-carriers form part of an array of dielectric charge centres, and (ii)
the charge-carriers can increase their velocities without increasing their
kinetic energies. A model is propoased which allows these requirements to
manifest. The model is fitted to selected experimental results which have been
published for low temperature metals, YBCO, and highly-doped p-type diamond. In
each case a satisfactory description of the experimental results is
demonstrated.
