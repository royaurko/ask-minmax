Galled networks, directed acyclic graphs that model evolutionary histories
with reticulation cycles containing only tree nodes, have become very popular
due to both their biological significance and the existence of polynomial time
algorithms for their reconstruction. In this paper we prove that Nakhleh's $m$
measure is a metric for this class of phylogenetic networks and hence it can be
safely used to evaluate galled network reconstruction methods.
