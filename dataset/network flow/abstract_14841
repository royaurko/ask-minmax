The non-collisional interaction between conducting obstacles and magnetized
plasma winds can be found in different scenarios, from the interaction
occurring between regions inside galaxy clusters to the interaction between the
solar wind and Mars, Venus, active comets or even the interaction between Titan
and the Saturnian's magnetospheric flow. These objects generate, through
several current systems, perturbations in the streaming magnetic field leading
to its draping around the obstacle's effective conducting surface. Recent
observational results suggest that several properties associated with the
magnetic field draping, such as the location of the polarity reversal layer of
the induced magnetotail, are affected by variations in the conditions of the
streaming magnetic field. To improve our understanding of these phenomena, we
perform a characterization of several magnetic field draping signatures by
analytically solving an ideal problem in which a perfectly conducting
magnetized plasma (with frozen-in magnetic field conditions) flows around a
spherical body for various orientations of the streaming magnetic field. In
particular, we compute the shift of the inverse polarity reversal layer as the
orientation of the background magnetic field is changed.
