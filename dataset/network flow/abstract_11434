Many systems can be described using graphs, or networks. Detecting
communities in these networks can provide information about the underlying
structure and functioning of the original systems. Yet this detection is a
complex task and a large amount of work was dedicated to it in the past decade.
One important feature is that communities can be found at several scales, or
levels of resolution, indicating several levels of organisations. Therefore
solutions to the community structure may not be unique. Also networks tend to
be large and hence require efficient processing. In this work, we present a new
algorithm for the fast detection of communities across scales using a local
criterion. We exploit the local aspect of the criterion to enable parallel
computation and improve the algorithm's efficiency further. The algorithm is
tested against large generated multi-scale networks and experiments demonstrate
its efficiency and accuracy.
