We calculate the weak interaction rates of selected light nuclei during the
epoch of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and we assess the impact of these
rates on nuclear abundance flow histories and on final light element abundance
yields. We consider electron and electron antineutrino captures on 3He and 7Be,
and the reverse processes of positron capture and electron neutrino capture on
3H and 7Li. We also compute the rates of positron and electron neutrino capture
on 6He. We calculate beta and positron decay transitions where appropriate. As
expected, the final standard BBN abundance yields are little affected by
addition of these weak processes, though there can be slight alterations of
nuclear flow histories. However, non-standard BBN scenarios, e.g., those
involving out of equilibrium particle decay with energetic final state
neutrinos, may be affected by these processes.
