This paper presents a model for the simulation of liquid-gas-solid flows by
means of the lattice Boltzmann method. The approach is built upon previous
works for the simulation of liquid-solid particle suspensions on the one hand,
and on a liquid-gas free surface model on the other. We show how the two
approaches can be unified by a novel set of dynamic cell conversion rules. For
evaluation, we concentrate on the rotational stability of non-spherical rigid
bodies floating on a plane water surface - a classical hydrostatic problem
known from naval architecture. We show the consistency of our method in this
kind of flows and obtain convergence towards the ideal solution for the
measured heeling stability of a floating box.
