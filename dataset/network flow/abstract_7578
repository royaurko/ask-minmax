We present a numerical study of mixing and reaction efficiency in closed
domains. In particular we focus our attention on laminar flows. In the case of
inert transport the mixing properties of the flows strongly depend on the
details of the Lagrangian transport. We also study the reaction efficiency.
Starting with a little spot of product we compute the time needed to complete
the reaction in the container. We found that the reaction efficiency is not
strictly related to the mixing properties of the flow. In particular, reaction
acts as a "dynamical regulator".
