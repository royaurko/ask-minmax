Using methods from random matrix theory researchers have recently calculated
the full spectra of random networks with arbitrary degrees and with community
structure. Both reveal interesting spectral features, including deviations from
the Wigner semicircle distribution and phase transitions in the spectra of
community structured networks. In this paper we generalize both calculations,
giving a prescription for calculating the spectrum of a network with both
community structure and an arbitrary degree distribution. In general the
spectrum has two parts, a continuous spectral band, which can depart strongly
from the classic semicircle form, and a set of outlying eigenvalues that
indicate the presence of communities.
