The network of international co-contributorship relations has been dominated by
certain European nations and the USA, but this network is rapidly expanding at
the global level. Between 40 and 50 countries appear in the center of the
international network in 2011, and almost all (201) nations are nowadays
involved in international collaboration. In this brief communication, we
present both a global map with the functionality of a Google Map (zooming,
etc.) and network maps based on normalized relations. These maps reveal
complementary aspects of the network. International collaboration in the
generation of knowledge claims (that is, the context of discovery) changes the
structural layering of the sciences. Previously, validation was at the global
level and discovery more dependent on local contexts. This changing
relationship between the geographical and intellectual dimensions of the
sciences also has implications for national science policies.
