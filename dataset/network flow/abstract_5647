Networks are a powerful abstraction with applicability to a variety of
scientific fields. Models explaining their morphology and growth processes
permit a wide range of phenomena to be more systematically analysed and
understood. At the same time, creating such models is often challenging and
requires insights that may be counter-intuitive. Yet there currently exists no
general method to arrive at better models. We have developed an approach to
automatically detect realistic decentralised network growth models from
empirical data, employing a machine learning technique inspired by natural
selection and defining a unified formalism to describe such models as computer
programs. As the proposed method is completely general and does not assume any
pre-existing models, it can be applied "out of the box" to any given network.
To validate our approach empirically, we systematically rediscover pre-defined
growth laws underlying several canonical network generation models and credible
laws for diverse real-world networks. We were able to find programs that are
simple enough to lead to an actual understanding of the mechanisms proposed,
namely for a simple brain and a social network.
