This paper presents an experimentally grounded model on the relevance of
partner selection for the emergence of trust and cooperation among individuals.
By combining experimental evidence and network simulation, our model
investigates the link of interaction outcome and social structure formation and
shows that dynamic networks lead to positive outcomes when cooperators have the
capability of creating more links and isolating free-riders. By emphasizing the
self-reinforcing dynamics of interaction outcome and structure formation, our
results cast the argument about the relevance of interaction continuity for
cooperation in new light and provide insights to guide the design of new lab
experiments.
