Deterministic sandpile models are studied on a cost optimized
Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) scale-free network whose nodes are the sites of a square
lattice. For the optimized BA network, the sandpile model has the same critical
behaviour as the BTW sandpile, whereas for the un-optimized BA network the
critical behaviour is mean-field like.
