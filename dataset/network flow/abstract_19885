Identified particle spectra of pions, kaons and (anti)protons, and elliptic
flow and azimuthal dependence of Bose-Einstein or HBT correlations of
identified pions in sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions is analyzed
simultaneously using an ellipsoidally symmetric generalization of the Buda-Lund
hydrodynamical model. The transverse flow is found to be faster in the reaction
plane than out of plane, which results in a reaction zone that gets slightly
more elongated in-plane than out of plane.
