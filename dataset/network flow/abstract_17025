Understanding large molecular networks consisting of entities such as genes,
proteins or RNAs that interact in complex ways to drive the cellular machinery
has been an active focus of systems biology. Computational approaches have
played a key role in systems biology by complementing theoretical and
experimental approaches. Here we roadmap some key contributions of
computational methods developed over the last decade in the reconstruction of
biological pathways. We position these contributions in a 'systems biology
perspective' to reemphasize their roles in unraveling cellular mechanisms and
to understand 'systems biology diseases' including cancer.
