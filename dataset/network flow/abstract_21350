In this work we show analytically and numerically that wave transport through
random waveguides can be modeled as a diffusion with an inhomogeneous diffusion
coefficient (IDC). In localized regime, IDC retains the memory of the source
position. In an absorbing random medium, IDC becomes independent of the source.
