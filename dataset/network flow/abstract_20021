Using a nonequilibrium functional renormalization group (FRG) approach we
calculate the time evolution of the momentum distribution of a magnon gas in
contact with a thermal phonon bath. As a cutoff for the FRG procedure we use a
hybridization parameter {\Lambda} giving rise to an artificial damping of the
phonons. Within our truncation of the FRG flow equations the time evolution of
the magnon distribution is obtained from a rate equation involving
cutoff-dependent nonequilibrium self-energies, which in turn satisfy FRG flow
equations depending on cutoff-dependent transition rates. Our approach goes
beyond the Born collision approximation and takes the feedback of the magnons
on the phonons into account. We use our method to calculate the thermalization
of a quasi two-dimensional magnon gas in the magnetic insulator yttrium-iron
garnet after a highly excited initial state has been generated by an external
microwave field. We obtain good agreement with recent experiments.
