We consider compact convex hypersurfaces contracting by functions of their
curvature. Under the mean curvature flow, uniformly convex smooth initial
hypersurfaces evolve to remain smooth and uniformly convex, and contract to
points after finite time. The same holds if the initial data is only weakly
convex or non-smooth, and the limiting shape at the final time is spherical. We
provide a surprisingly large family of flows for which such results fail, by a
variety of mechanisms: Uniformly convex hypersurfaces may become non-convex,
and smooth ones may develop curvature singularities; even where this does not
occur, non-uniformly convex regions and singular parts in the initial
hypersurface may persist, including flat sides, ridges of infinite curvature,
or `cylindrical' regions where some of the principal curvatures vanish; such
cylindrical regions may persist even if the speed is positive, and in such
cases the hypersurface may even collapse to a line segment or
higher-dimensional disc rather than to a point. We provide sufficient
conditions for these various disasters to occur, and by avoiding these arrive
at a class of flows for which arbitrary weakly convex initial hypersurfaces
immediately become smooth and uniformly convex and contract to points.
