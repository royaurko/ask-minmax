We present a discretization for Darcy's problem using the recently developed
Mimetic Spectral Element Method. The gist lies in the exact discrete
representation of integral relations. In this paper, an anisotropic flow
through a porous medium is considered and a discretization of a full
permeability tensor is presented. The performance of the method is evaluated on
standard test problems, converging at the same rate as the best possible
approximation.
