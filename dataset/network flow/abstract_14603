The problem of a quasi 1D {\it repulsive} BEC flow past through a nonlinear
barrier is investigated. Two types of nonlinear barriers are considered, wide
and short range ones. Steady state solutions for the BEC moving through a wide
repulsive barrier and critical velocities have been found using hydrodynamical
approach to the 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation. It is shown that in contrast to
the linear barrier case, for a wide {\it nonlinear} barrier an interval of
velocities $0 < v < v_-$ {\it always} exists, where the flow is superfluid
regardless of the barrier potential strength. For the case of the $\delta$
function-like barrier, below a critical velocity two steady solutions exist,
stable and unstable one. An unstable solution is shown to decay into a gray
soliton moving upstream and a stable solution. The decay is accompanied by a
dispersive shock wave propagating downstream in front of the barrier.
