This work extends the set of works which deal with the popular problem of
sentiment analysis in Twitter. It investigates the most popular document
("tweet") representation methods which feed sentiment evaluation mechanisms. In
particular, we study the bag-of-words, n-grams and n-gram graphs approaches and
for each of them we evaluate the performance of a lexicon-based and 7
learning-based classification algorithms (namely SVM, Na\"ive Bayesian
Networks, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptrons, Best-First Trees,
Functional Trees and C4.5) as well as their combinations, using a set of 4451
manually annotated tweets. The results demonstrate the superiority of
learning-based methods and in particular of n-gram graphs approaches for
predicting the sentiment of tweets. They also show that the combinatory
approach has impressive effects on n-grams, raising the confidence up to 83.15%
on the 5-Grams, using majority vote and a balanced dataset (equal number of
positive, negative and neutral tweets for training). In the n-gram graph cases
the improvement was small to none, reaching 94.52% on the 4-gram graphs, using
Orthodromic distance and a threshold of 0.001.
