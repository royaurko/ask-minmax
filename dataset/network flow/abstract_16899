The Minimum Weight Steiner Tree (MST) is an important combinatorial
optimization problem over networks that has applications in a wide range of
fields. Here we discuss a general technique to translate the imposed global
connectivity constrain into many local ones that can be analyzed with cavity
equation techniques. This approach leads to a new optimization algorithm for
MST and allows to analyze the statistical mechanics properties of MST on random
graphs of various types.
