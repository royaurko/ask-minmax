This paper explores textual production in interaction networks, with special
emphasis on its relation to topological measures. Four email lists were
selected, in which measures were taken from the texts participants wrote.
Peripheral, intermediary and hub sectors of these networks were observed to
have discrepant linguistic elaborations. For completeness of exposition,
correlation of textual and topological measures were observed for the entire
network and for each connective sector. The formation of principal components
is used for further insights of how measures are related.
