Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality can provide to a Human Operator (HO) a
real help to complete complex tasks, such as robot teleoperation and
cooperative teleassistance. Using appropriate augmentations, the HO can
interact faster, safer and easier with the remote real world. In this paper, we
present an extension of an existing distributed software and network
architecture for collaborative teleoperation based on networked human-scaled
mixed reality and mobile platform. The first teleoperation system was composed
by a VR application and a Web application. However the 2 systems cannot be used
together and it is impossible to control a distant robot simultaneously. Our
goal is to update the teleoperation system to permit a heterogeneous
collaborative teleoperation between the 2 platforms. An important feature of
this interface is based on different Mobile platforms to control one or many
robots.
