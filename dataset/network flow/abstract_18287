We investigate the viscoelastic properties of entangled networks of
semiflexible polymers. At intermediate time scales the elastic response of
these networks to shear deformation is described by the plateau modulus $G$.
Different scaling laws with polymer concentration $c$ have been proposed based
on the assumption that the deformation field is affine on all length scales. We
develop a numerical approach that allows to calculate the modulus via free
energy changes for both affine and non-affine deformations. The non-affine
deformation field is obtained by a free energy minimization. Our findings allow
for a confirmation of a power law $G \propto c^{7/5} l_p^{-1/5}$ with polymer
concentration $c$ and persistence length $l_p$ and furthermore quantify the
systematic deviations due to the affinity assumption.
