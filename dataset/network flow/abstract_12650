For a two-dimensional system of agents modeled by molecular dynamics, we
simulate epidemics spreading, which was recently studied on complex networks.
Our resulting network model is time-evolving. We study the transitions to
spreading as function of density, temperature and infection time. In addition,
we analyze the epidemic threshold associated to a power-law distribution of
infection times.
