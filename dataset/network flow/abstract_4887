Non-singlet chiral Ward identities for fermionic operators at positive
flow-time are derived using standard techniques based on local chiral
variations of the action and of local operators. The gradient flow formalism is
applied to twisted mass fermions and it is shown that automatic O(a)
improvement for Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist is a property
valid also at positive flow-time. A definition of the chiral condensate that is
multiplicatively renormalizable and automatically O(a) improved is then
derived.
