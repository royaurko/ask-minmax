The inertia of particles driven by the turbulent flow of the surrounding
fluid makes them prefer certain regions of the flow. The heavy particles lag
behind the flow and tend to accumulate in the regions with less vorticity,
while the light particles do the opposite. As a result of the long-time
evolution, the particles distribute over a multi-fractal attractor in space. We
consider this distribution using our recent results on the steady states of
chaotic dynamics. We describe the preferential concentration analytically and
derive the correlation functions of density and the fractal dimensions of the
attractor. The results are obtained for real turbulence and are testable
experimentally.
