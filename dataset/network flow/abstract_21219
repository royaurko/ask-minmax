We show that Hausdorff dimension may be used to distinguish different
dynamics of therelaxation in hierarchical systems. We examine the hierarchical
systems following the temperature-dependent power-law decay and the Kohlrausch
law. For our purposes, we consider a L\'evy stochastic processes on p-adic
integer numbers.
