Social interactions vary in time and appear to be driven by intrinsic
mechanisms, which in turn shape the emerging structure of the social network.
Large-scale empirical observations of social interaction structure have become
possible only recently, and modelling their dynamics is an actual challenge.
Here we propose a temporal network model which builds on the framework of
activity-driven time-varying networks with memory. The model also integrates
key mechanisms that drive the formation of social ties - social reinforcement,
focal closure and cyclic closure, which have been shown to give rise to
community structure and the global connectedness of the network. We compare the
proposed model with a real-world time-varying network of mobile phone
communication and show that they share several characteristics from
heterogeneous degrees and weights to rich community structure. Further, the
strong and weak ties that emerge from the model follow similar weight-topology
correlations as real-world social networks, including the role of weak ties.
