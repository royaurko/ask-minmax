We study the structure of differential equations of one-dimensional
dispersive flows into compact Riemann surfaces. These equations geometrically
generalize two-sphere valued systems modeling the motion of vortex filament. We
define a generalized Hasimoto transform by constructing a good moving frame,
and reduce the equation with values in the induced bundle to a complex valued
equation which is easy to handle. We also discuss the relationship between our
reduction and the theory of linear dispersive partial differential equations.
