We discuss various limits which transform configuration space into phase
space, with emphasis on those related to lightfront field theory, and show that
they are unified by spectral flow. Examples include quantising in `almost
lightfront' coordinates and the appearance of lightlike noncommutativity from a
strong background laser field. We compare this with the limit of a strong
magnetic field, and investigate the role played by lightfront zero modes.
