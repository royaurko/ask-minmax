Within the formalism of matrix product ansatz, we study a two-species
asymmetric exclusion process with backward and forward site-ordered sequential
update. This model, which was originally introduced with the random sequential
update, describes a two-way traffic flow with a dynamic impurity and shows a
phase transition between the free flow and traffic jam. We investigate the
characteristics of this jamming and examine similarities and differences
between our results and those with random sequential update.
