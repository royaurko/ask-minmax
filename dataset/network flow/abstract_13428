In this paper we discuss a coding and the associated symbolic dynamics for
the geodesic flow on Hecke triangle surfaces. We construct an explicit cross
section for which the first return map factors through a simple (explicit) map
given in terms of the generating map of a particular continued fraction
expansion closely related to the Hecke triangle groups. We also obtain explicit
expressions for the associated first return times.
