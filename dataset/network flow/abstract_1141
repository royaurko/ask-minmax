This paper presents power coordination, power generation, and power flow
control schemes for supply-demand balance in distributed grid networks.
Consensus schemes using only local information are employed to generate power
coordination, power generation and power flow control signals. For the
supply-demand balance, it is required to determine the amount of power needed
at each distributed power node. Also due to the different power generation
capacities of each power node, coordination of power flows among distributed
power resources is essentially required. Thus, this paper proposes a
decentralized power coordination scheme, a power generation, and a power flow
control method considering these constraints based on distributed consensus
algorithms. Through numerical simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed
approaches is illustrated.
