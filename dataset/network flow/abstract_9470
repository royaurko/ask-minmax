In this Rapid Communication we investigate spatially constrained networks
that realize optimal synchronization properties. After arguing that spatial
constraints can be imposed by limiting the amount of `wire' available to
connect nodes distributed in space, we use numerical optimization methods to
construct networks that realize different trade-offs between optimal
synchronization and spatial constraints. Over a large range of parameters such
optimal networks are found to have a link length distribution characterized by
power law tails $P(l)\propto l^{-\alpha}$, with exponents $\alpha$ increasing
as the networks become more constrained in space. It is also shown that the
optimal networks, which constitute a particular type of small world network,
are characterized by the presence of nodes of distinctly larger than average
degree around which long distance links are centred.
