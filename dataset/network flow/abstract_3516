We study the influence of elements diffusing in and out of a network to the
topological changes of the network and characterize it by investigating the
behavior of probability of degree distribution ($\Gamma(k)$) with degree $k$.
The local memory of the incoming element and its interaction with the elements
already present in the network during the growing process significantly affect
the network stability which in turn reorganize the network properties. We found
that the properties of $\Gamma(k)$ of this network are deviated from scale free
type, where the power law behavior contains a exponentially decay factor
supporting earlier reported results of Amaral et.al. \cite{ama} and Newman
\cite{new1} and recent statistical analysis results on degree distribution data
of some scale free network [11]. Our numerical results also support the
behavior of this $\Gamma(k)$. However, we found numerically the contribution
from exponential factor to the $\Gamma(k)$ to be very weak as compared to the
scale free factor showing that the network as a whole carries the scale free
properties approximately.
