We present a model for the evolution of networks of occupied sites on
undirected regular graphs. At every iteration step in a parallel update I
randomly chosen empty sites are occupied and occupied sites having degree
outside of a given interval (t_l,t_u) are set empty. Depending on the influx I
and the values of both lower threshold and upper threshold of the degree
different kinds of behaviour can be observed. In certain regimes stable
long-living patterns appear. We distinguish two types of pattern: static
patterns arising on graphs with low connectivity and dynamic patterns found on
high connectivity graphs. Increasing I patterns become unstable and transitions
between almost stable patterns, interrupted by disordered phases, occur. For
still larger I the lifetime of occupied sites becomes very small and network
structures are dominated by randomness. We develop methods to analyze nature
and dynamics of these network patterns, give a statistical description of
defects and fluctuations around them, and elucidate transitions between
different patterns. Results and methods presented can be applied to a variety
of problems in different fields and a broad class of graphs. Aiming chiefly at
the modeling of functional networks of interacting antibodies and B-cells of
the immune system (idiotypic networks) we focus on a class of graphs
constructed by bit-chains. The biological relevance of the patterns and
possible operational modes of idiotypic networks are discussed.
