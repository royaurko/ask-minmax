Hierarchical application of Triple-Modular Redundancy (TMR) increases fault
tolerance of digital Integrated Circuit (IC). In this paper, a simple
probabilistic model was proposed for analysis of fault masking performance of
hierarchical TMR networks. Performance improvements obtained by second order
TMR network were theoretically compared with first order TMR network.
