This paper explores fast, polynomial time heuristic approximate solutions to
the NP-hard problem of scheduling jobs on N identical machines. The jobs are
independent and are allowed to be stopped and restarted on another machine at a
later time. They have well-de?ned deadlines, and relative priorities quantified
by non-negative real weights. The objective is to find schedules which minimize
the total weighted tardiness (TWT) of all jobs. We show how this problem can be
mapped into quadratic form and present a polynomial time heuristic solution
based on the Hop?eld Neural Network (HNN) approach. It is demonstrated, through
the results of extensive numerical simulations, that this solution outperforms
other popular heuristic methods. The proposed heuristic is both theoretically
and empirically shown to be scalable to large problem sizes (over 100 jobs to
be scheduled), which makes it applicable to grid computing scheduling, arising
in fields such as computational biology, chemistry and finance.
