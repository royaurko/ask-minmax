The surrounding of a vertex in a network can be more or less symmetric. We
derive measures of a specific kind of symmetry of a vertex which we call degree
symmetry -- the property that many paths going out from a vertex have
overlapping degree sequences. These measures are evaluated on artificial and
real networks. Specifically we consider vertices in the human metabolic
network. We also measure the average degree-symmetry coefficient for different
classes of real-world network. We find that most studied examples are weakly
positively degree-symmetric. The exceptions are an airport network (having a
negative degree-symmetry coefficient) and one-mode projections of social
affiliation networks that are rather strongly degree-symmetric.
