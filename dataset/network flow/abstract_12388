Starting from the hypothesis that both physics, in particular space-time and
the physical vacuum, and the corresponding mathematics are discrete on the
Planck scale we develop a certain framework in form of a class of '
cellular networks' consisting of cells (nodes) interacting with each other via
bonds according to a certain 'local law' which governs their evolution.
Both the internal states of the cells and the strength/orientation of the bonds
are assumed to be dynamical variables. We introduce a couple of candidates of
such local laws which, we think, are capable of catalyzing the unfolding of the
network towards increasing complexity and pattern formation. In section 3 the
basis is laid for a version of 'discrete analysis' on 'graphs' and
'networks' which, starting from different, perhaps more physically
oriented principles, manages to make contact with the much more abstract
machinery of Connes et al. and may complement the latter approach. In section 4
several more advanced geometric/topological concepts and tools are introduced
which allow to study and classify such irregular structures as (random)graphs
and networks. We show in particular that the systems under study carry in a
natural way a 'groupoid structure'. In section 5 a, as far as we can see,
promising concept of 'topological dimension' (or rather: ' fractal
dimension') in form of a 'degree of connectivity' for graphs, networks
and the like is developed. The possibility of dimensional phase transitions is
discussed.
