We simulate evolution of cometary H II regions based on several champagne
flow models and bow shock models, and calculate the profiles of the [Ne II]
fine-structure line at $12.81\mu m$, the $H30\alpha$ recombination line and the
[Ne III] fine-structure line at $15.55\mu m$ for these models at different
inclinations of $0^o, 30^o \textrm{and} 60^o$. We find that the profiles in the
bow shock models are generally different from those in the champagne flow
models, but the profiles in the bow shock with lower stellar velocity ($\leq5km
s^{-1}$) are similar to those in the champagne flow models. In champagne flow
models, both the velocity of peak flux and the flux weighted central velocities
of all three lines are pointing outward from molecular clouds. In bow shock
models, the directions of these velocities rely on the speed of stars. They
have the similar motion in high stellar speed case but opposite directions in
low stellar speed case. We notice that the line profiles from the slit along
the symmetrical axis of the projected 2D image of these models are useful for
distinguishing bow shock models and champagne flow models. It is also confirmed
by the calculation that the flux weighted central velocity and the line
luminosity of the [Ne III] line can be estimated from the [Ne II] line and the
$H30\alpha$ line.
