Remote control systems are a very useful element to control and monitor
devices quickly and easily. This paper proposes a new architecture for remote
control of Android mobile devices, analyzing the different alternatives and
seeking the optimal solution in each case. Although the area of remote control,
in case of mobile devices, is little explored, it may provide important
advantages for testing software and hardware developments in several real
devices. It can also allow an efficient management of various devices of
different types for performing different tasks, related for example to security
or forensic tasks.
  The main idea behind the proposed architecture was the design of a system to
use it as a platform which provides the services needed to perform remote
control of mobile devices. As a result of this research, a proof of concept was
implemented. An Android application running a group of server programs on the
device, connected to the network or USB interface, depending on availability.
This servers can be controlled through a small client written in Java and
runnable both on desktop and web systems.
