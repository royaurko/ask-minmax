Oscillatory dynamics of complex networks has recently attracted great
attention. In this paper we study pattern formation in oscillatory complex
networks consisting of excitable nodes. We find that there exist a few center
nodes and small skeletons for most oscillations. Complicated and seemingly
random oscillatory patterns can be viewed as well-organized target waves
propagating from center nodes along the shortest paths, and the shortest loops
passing through both the center nodes and their driver nodes play the role of
oscillation sources. Analyzing simple skeletons we are able to understand and
predict various essential properties of the oscillations and effectively
modulate the oscillations. These methods and results will give insights into
pattern formation in complex networks, and provide suggestive ideas for
studying and controlling oscillations in neural networks.
