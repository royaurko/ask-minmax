The analysis of complex networks has revealed patterns of organization in a
variety of natural and artificial systems, including neuronal networks of the
brain at multiple scales. In this paper, we describe a novel analysis of the
large-scale connectivity between regions of the mammalian cerebral cortex,
utilizing a set of hierarchical measurements proposed recently. We examine
previously identified functional clusters of brain regions in macaque visual
cortex and cat cortex and find significant differences between such clusters in
terms of several hierarchical measures, revealing differences in how these
clusters are embedded in the overall cortical architecture. For example, the
ventral cluster of visual cortex maintains structurally more segregated, less
divergent connections than the dorsal cluster, which may point to functionally
different roles of their constituent brain regions.
