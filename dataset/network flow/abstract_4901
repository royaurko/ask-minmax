Using high-resolution direct numerical simulation and arguments based on the
kinetic energy flux $\Pi_u$, we demonstrate that for stably stratified flows,
the kinetic energy spectrum $E_u(k) \sim k^{-11/5}$, the entropy spectrum
$E_\theta(k) \sim k^{-7/5}$, and $\Pi_u(k) \sim k^{-4/5}$ (Bolgiano-Obukhov
scaling). This scaling is due to the depletion of kinetic energy because of
buoyancy. For weaker buoyancy in stratified flows, $E_u(k)$ follows Kolmgorov's
spectrum with a constant energy flux. We also argue that for Rayleigh
B\'{e}nard convection, the Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling will not hold for the bulk
flow due to the positive energy supply by buoyancy and non-decreasing
$\Pi_u(k)$.
