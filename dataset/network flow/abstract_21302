This paper aims to improve the accuracy of port-scan detectors by analyzing
traffic of BitTorrent hosts and differentiating their respective BitTorrent
connection (attempts) from port-scans.
  It is shown that by looking at BitTorrent coordination traffic and modelling
port-scanning behavior the number of BitTorrent-related false positives can be
reduced by 80% without any loss of IDS accuracy.
