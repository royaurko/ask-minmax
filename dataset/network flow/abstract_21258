A simple quantitative example of a reflexive feedback process and the
resulting price dynamics after an exogenous price shock to a financial network
is presented. Furthermore, an outline of a theory that connects financial
reflexivity, which stems from cross-ownership and delayed or incomplete
information, and no-arbitrage pricing theory under systemic risk is provided.
