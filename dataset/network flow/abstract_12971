Transport measurements along the node and anti-node directions in the a-b
plane of optimally doped and epitaxial thin films of YBCO are reported. Low
bias magnetoresistance measurements near and below T_c show that the flux flow
resistivity along the node and anti-node directions versus magnetic field are
indistinguishable. This result suggests that within the experimental error of
our measurements, no correspondence is found between the flux pinning
properties in YBCO and the d-wave nature of the order parameter.
