The onset of monami, the synchronous waving of sea grass beds driven by a
steady flow, is modeled as a linear instability of the flow. Our model treats
the drag exerted by the grass in establishing the steady flow profile, and in
damping out perturbations to it. This damping leads to a finite threshold flow
for the instability, which agrees with experimental observations. This role of
vegetation drag differentiates our mechanism from the previous hypothesis that
the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability underlies monami.
