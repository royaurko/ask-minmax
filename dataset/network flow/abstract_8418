We consider a novel method of cloaking objects from the surrounding
electromagnetic fields in the microwave region. The method is based on
transmission-line networks that simulate the wave propagation in the medium
surrounding the cloaked object. The electromagnetic fields from the surrounding
medium are coupled into the transmission-line network that guides the waves
through the cloak thus leaving the cloaked object undetected. The cloaked
object can be an array or interconnected mesh of small inclusions that fit
inside the transmission-line network.
