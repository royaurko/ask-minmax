We find M-theory solutions that are holographic duals of flows of the
maximally supersymmetric N=8 scalar-fermion theory in (2+1) dimensions. In
particular, we construct the M-theory solution dual to a flow in which a single
chiral multiplet is given a mass, and the theory goes to a new infra-red fixed
point. We also examine this new solution using M2-brane probes. The
(2+1)-dimensional field theory fixed-point is closely related to that of Leigh
and Strassler, while the M-theory solution is closely related to the
corresponding IIB flow solution. We recast the IIB flow solution in a more
geometric manner and use this to obtain an Ansatz for the M-theory flow. We are
able to generalize our solution further to obtain flows with del Pezzo
sub-manifolds, and we give an explicit solution with a conifold singularity.
