The assumption that radiative cooling of gas in the centers of galaxy
clusters is approximately balanced by energy input from a central supermassive
black hole implies that the observed X-ray luminosity of the cooling flow
region sets a lower limit on AGN mechanical power. The conversion efficiency of
AGN mechanical power into gas heating is uncertain, but we argue that it can be
high even in the absence of strong shocks. These arguments inevitably lead to
the conclusion that the time averaged mechanical power of AGNs in cooling flows
is much higher than the presently observed bolometric luminosity of these
objects.
  The energy balance between cooling losses and AGN mechanical power requires
some feedback mechanism. We consider a toy model in which the accretion rate
onto a black hole is set by the classic Bondi formula. Application of this
model to the best studied case of M87 suggests that accretion proceeds at
approximately the Bondi rate down to a few gravitational radii with most of the
power (at the level of a few percent of the rest mass) carried away by an
outflow.
