The resource allocation problem of optimal assignment of the clients to the
available access points in 60 GHz millimeterWave wireless access networks is
investigated. The problem is posed as a multiassignment optimisation problem.
The proposed solution method converts the initial problem to a minimum cost
flow problem and allows to design an efficient algorithm by a combination of
auction algorithms. The solution algorithm exploits the network optimization
structure of the problem, and thus is much more powerful than computationally
intensive general-purpose solvers. Theoretical and numerical results evince
numerous properties, such as optimality, convergence, and scalability in
comparison to existing approaches.
