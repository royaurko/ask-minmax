We propose that negative degree correlation among nodes in a network of
nonlinear oscillators, often detected in real world networks, is motivated by
its positive effects on synchronizability. In so doing, we use a novel
methodology to characterise degree correlation based on clustering the network
vertices in p classes according to their degrees. Using this strategy we
construct networks with an assigned power law distribution but changing degree
correlation properties. We find that the network synchronizability improves
when the network becomes dissassortative, i.e. when nodes with low degree are
more likely to be connected to nodes with higher degree. Our numerical
observations are confirmed by the analytical estimates found in this letter
using an innovative approach based on the use of graph theoretical results.
