This paper is a direct continuation of an earlier work, where we studied
Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs perturbed by an interaction Hamiltonian favouring
the formation of short cycles. Here, we generalize these results. We keep the
same interaction Hamiltonian but let it act on general graphs with uncorrelated
nodes and an arbitrary given degree distribution. It is shown that the results
obtained for Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs are generic, at the qualitative level.
However, scale-free graphs are an exception to this general rule and exhibit a
singular behaviour, studied thoroughly in this paper, both analytically and
numerically.
