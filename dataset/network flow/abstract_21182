(NxN)-matrix is called additive when its elements are pair-wise sums of N
real numbers. For a quadratic binary functional with an additive connection
matrix we succeeded in finding the global minimum expressing it through
external parameters of the problem. Computer simulations show that energy
surface of a quadratic binary functional with an additive matrix is complicate
enough.
