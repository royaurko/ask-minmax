Recent work in data mining and related areas has highlighted the importance
of the statistical assessment of data mining results. Crucial to this endeavour
is the choice of a non-trivial null model for the data, to which the found
patterns can be contrasted. The most influential null models proposed so far
are defined in terms of invariants of the null distribution. Such null models
can be used by computation intensive randomization approaches in estimating the
statistical significance of data mining results.
  Here, we introduce a methodology to construct non-trivial probabilistic
models based on the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle. We show how MaxEnt
models allow for the natural incorporation of prior information. Furthermore,
they satisfy a number of desirable properties of previously introduced
randomization approaches. Lastly, they also have the benefit that they can be
represented explicitly. We argue that our approach can be used for a variety of
data types. However, for concreteness, we have chosen to demonstrate it in
particular for databases and networks.
