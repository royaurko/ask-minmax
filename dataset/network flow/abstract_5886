In this paper, we propose an architecture for Network of Information mobile
node (NetInf MN). It bears characteristics and features of basic NetInf node
architecture with features introduced in the LISP MN architecture. We also
introduce a virtual node layer for mobility management in the Network of
Information. Therefore, by adopting this architecture no major changes in the
contemporary network topologies is required. Thus, making our approach more
practical.
