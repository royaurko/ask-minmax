We propose flow-based analysis to estimate quality of an Internet connection.
Using results from the queuing theory we compare two expressions for backbone
traffic that have different scopes of applicability. A curve that shows
dependence of utilization of a link on a number of active flows in it describes
different states of the network. We propose a methodology for plotting such a
curve using data received from a Cisco router by NetFlow protocol, determining
the working area and the overloading point of the network. Our test is an easy
way to find a moment for upgrading the backbone.
