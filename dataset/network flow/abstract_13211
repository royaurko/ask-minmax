A continuum one-dimensional model of the plane Couette-Poiseuille flow is
developed to describe the pressure distribution in a drag stage of molecular
pump of either the Gaede or Holweck type. In spite of its simplicity and
approximate nature the model provides a good qualitative representation of the
drag pump operation in the whole range of the regimes from the continuum to
free molecular ones.
