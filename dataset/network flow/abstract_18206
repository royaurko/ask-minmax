This article investigates the evolution of the $h-$index in a complex network
including two communities (in the sense of having different features) with the
same number of contributors whose yearly productions follow the Zipf's law. Models
considering indiscriminate citations, as well as citations preferential to the
fitness values of each community and/or the number of existing citations are
proposed and numerically simulated. The $h-$indices of each type of contributor is
estimated along a period of 20 years, while the number of contributors remains
constant. Interesting results are obtained including the fact that, for the
model where citations are preferential to both community fitness and number of
existing citations per article, the $h-$indices of the community with the
largest fitness value are only moderately increased while the indices of the
other community are severely and irreversibly limited to low values. Three
possible strategies are discussed in order to change this situation. In
addition, based on such findings, a new version of the $h-$index is proposed
involving the automated identification of virtual citations which can provide
complementary and unbiased quantification of the relevance of scientific works.
