Usually broadband wireless access networks are considered to be enterprise
level networks providing us with more capacity as well as coverage. We have
seen that in remote inaccessible areas wired networks are not at all cost
effective. Wireless networking has offered us an alternative solution for such
problem of information access. They have definitely changed the way people
communicate and share information among themselves by overcoming problems
nowadays associated with distance and location. This paper provides a
comparison and technical analysis of alternatives for implementing last-mile
wireless broadband services. It provides detailed technical differences between
802.11 (Wi-FI) wireless networks with 802.16 (WiMAX), a new technology that
solves many of the difficulties in last-mile implementations.
