We present the results of velocity measurements obtained by ultrasonic
Doppler velocimetry and local potential probes in the flow of GaInSn eutectic
melt driven by a two-phase inductor in a cylindrical container. This type of
flow is expected in a recent modification to the floating zone technique for
the growth of small-diameter single intermetallic compound crystals. We show
that the flow structure can be changed from the typical two toroidal vortices
to a single vortex by increasing the phase shift between the currents in the
two coils from 0 to 90 degrees. The latter configuration is thought to be
favourable for the growth of single crystals. The flow is also computed
numerically and a reasonable agreement with the experimental results is found.
The obtained results may be useful for the design of combined two-phase
electromagnetic stirrers and induction heaters for metal or semiconductor
melts.
