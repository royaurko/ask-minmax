We prove convergence of solutions to the parabolic Allen-Cahn equation to
Brakke's motion by mean curvature in space forms, generalizing previous results
from [15] in Euclidean space. We show that a sequence of measures, associated
to energy density of solutions of the parabolic Allen-Cahn equation, converges
in the limit to a family of rectifiable Radon measures, which evolves by mean
curvature flow in the sense of Brakke. A key role is played by a local almost
monotonicity formula (a weak counterpart of Huisken's monotonicity formula)
proved in [22], to get various density bounds for the limiting measures.
