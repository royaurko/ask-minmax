We employ simulations of model proteins to study folding on rugged energy
landscapes. We construct ``first-passage'' networks as the system transitions
from unfolded to native states. The nodes and bonds in these networks
correspond to basins and transitions between them in the energy landscape. We
find power-laws between the folding time and number of nodes and bonds. We show
that these scalings are determined by the fractal properties of first-passage
networks. Reliable folding is possible in systems with rugged energy landscapes
because first passage networks have small fractal dimension.
