We study the energy dependence of collective (hydrodynamic-like) nuclear
matter flow in 400-1970 A MeV Ni+Au and 1000-1970 A MeV Ni+Cu reactions. The
flow increases with energy, reaches a maximum, and then gradually decreases at
higher energies. A way of comparing the energy dependence of flow values for
different projectile-target mass combinations is introduced, which demonstrates
a common scaling behaviour among flow values from different systems.
