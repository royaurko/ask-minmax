We present numerical simulations for the diluted antiferromagnetic 3D Ising
model (DAFF) in an external magnetic field at zero temperature. Our results are
compatible with the DAFF being in the same universality class as the Random
Field Ising model, in agreement with the renormalization group prediction.
