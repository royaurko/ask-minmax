LTE/4G is the next generation of cellular network which specifically aims to
improve the network performance for data traffic and is currently being rolled
out by many network operators. We present results from an extensive LTE
measurement campaign in Dublin, Ireland using a custom performance measurement
tool. Performance data was measured at a variety of locations within the city
(including cell edge locations, indoors, outdoors etc) as well as for mobile
users on public transport within the city. Using this data we derive a model of
the characteristics of link layer RTT and bandwidth vs link signal strength.
This model is suited to use for performance evaluation of applications and
services, and since it is based on real measurements it allows realistic
evaluation of performance.
