The motion of driven interfaces in random media at finite temperature $T$ and
small external force $F$ is usually described by a linear displacement $h_G(t)
\sim V(F,T) t$ at large times, where the velocity vanishes according to the
creep formula as $V(F,T) \sim e^{-K(T)/F^{\mu}}$ for $F \to 0$. In this paper,
we question this picture on the specific example of the directed polymer in a
two dimensional random medium. We have recently shown (C. Monthus and T. Garel,
arxiv:0802.2502) that its dynamics for F=0 can be analyzed in terms of a strong
disorder renormalization procedure, where the distribution of renormalized
barriers flows towards some "infinite disorder fixed point". In the present
paper, we obtain that for small $F$, this "infinite disorder fixed point"
becomes a "strong disorder fixed point" with an exponential distribution of
renormalized barriers. The corresponding distribution of trapping times then
only decays as a power-law $P(\tau) \sim 1/\tau^{1+\alpha}$, where the exponent
$\alpha(F,T)$ vanishes as $\alpha(F,T) \propto F^{\mu}$ as $F \to 0$. Our
conclusion is that in the small force region $\alpha(F,T)<1$, the divergence of
the averaged trapping time $\bar{\tau}=+\infty$ induces strong
non-self-averaging effects that invalidate the usual creep formula obtained by
replacing all trapping times by the typical value. We find instead that the
motion is only sub-linearly in time $h_G(t) \sim t^{\alpha(F,T)}$, i.e. the
asymptotic velocity vanishes V=0. This analysis is confirmed by numerical
simulations of a directed polymer with a metric constraint driven in a traps
landscape. We moreover obtain that the roughness exponent, which is governed by
the equilibrium value $\zeta_{eq}=2/3$ up to some large scale, becomes equal to
$\zeta=1$ at the largest scales.
