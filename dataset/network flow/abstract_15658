Learning and inferring features that generate sensory input is a task
continuously performed by cortex. In recent years, novel algorithms and
learning rules have been proposed that allow neural network models to learn
such features from natural images, written text, audio signals, etc. These
networks usually involve deep architectures with many layers of hidden neurons.
Here we review recent advancements in this area emphasizing, amongst other
things, the processing of dynamical inputs by networks with hidden nodes and
the role of single neuron models. These points and the questions they arise can
provide conceptual advancements in understanding of learning in the cortex and
the relationship between machine learning approaches to learning with hidden
nodes and those in cortical circuits.
