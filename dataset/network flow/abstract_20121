The aim of this paper is to study self-similar solutions to the symplectic
cuvature flow on 6-dimensional nilmanifolds. For this purpose, we focus our
attention in the family of symplectic Two- and Three-step nilpotent Lie
algebras admitting a "minimal compatible metric" and we give a complete
classification of these algebras together with their respective metric. Such
classification is given by using our generalization of Nikolayevsky's nice
basis criterium (arXiv:1301.4949), which will be repeated here in the context
of canonical compatible metrics for geometric structures on nilmanifolds, for
the convenience of the reader.
  By computing the Chern-Ricci operator $P$ in each case, we show that the
above distinguished metrics define a soliton almost K\"{a}hler structure.
  Many illustrative examples are carefully developed.
