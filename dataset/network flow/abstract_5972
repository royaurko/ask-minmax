The observation that some subgraphs, called motifs, appear more often in real
networks than in their randomized counterparts has attracted much attention in
the scientific community. In the prevalent approach the detection of motifs is
based on comparing subgraph counts in a network with their counterparts in the
configuration model with the same degree distribution as the network. In this
short note we derive conservation laws that relate motif counts in the
configuration model.
