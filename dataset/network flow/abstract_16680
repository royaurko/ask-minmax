Horizontal integration of access technologies to networks and services should
be accompanied by some kind of convergence of authentication technologies. The
missing link for the federation of user identities across the technological
boundaries separating authentication methods can be provided by trusted
computing platforms. The concept of establishing transitive trust by trusted
computing enables the desired crossdomain authentication functionality. The
focus of target application scenarios lies in the realm of mobile networks and
devices.
