Parameter space of a driven damped oscillator in a double well potential
presents either a chaotic trajectory with sign oscillating amplitude or a
non-chaotic trajectory with a fixed sign amplitude. A network of such delay
coupled damped oscillators is shown to present chaotic dynamics while the
amplitude sign of each damped oscillator is randomly frozen. This phenomenon of
random broken global symmetry of the network simultaneously with random
freezing of each degree of freedom is accompanied by the existence of
exponentially many randomly frozen chaotic attractors with the ize of the
network. Results are exemplified by a network of modified Duffing oscillators
with infinite ange pseudo-inverse delayed interactions.
