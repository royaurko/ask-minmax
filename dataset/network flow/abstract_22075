We develop and analyze a minimal hydrodynamic model in the overdamped limit
to understand why a drop climbs a smooth homogeneous incline that is
harmonically vibrated at an angle different from the substrate normal [Brunet,
Eggers and Deegan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 144501 (2007)]. We find that the
vibration component orthogonal to the substrate induces a nonlinear
(anharmonic) response in the drop shape. This results in an asymmetric response
of the drop to the parallel vibration and, in consequence, in the observed net
motion. Beside establishing the basic mechanism, we identify scaling laws valid
in a broad frequency range and a flow reversal at high frequencies.
