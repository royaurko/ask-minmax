Fast thermalization and a strong buildup of elliptic flow of QCD matter as
found at RHIC are understood as the consequence of perturbative QCD (pQCD)
interactions within the 3+1 dimensional parton cascade BAMPS. The main
contributions stem from pQCD bremsstrahlung $2 \leftrightarrow 3 $ processes.
By comparing to Au+Au data of the flow parameter $v_2$ the shear viscosity to
entropy ratio $\eta/s$ has been extracted dynamically and lies in the range of
0.08 and 0.2. Also jet-quenching has been investigated consistently within a
full dynamical picture of the heavy ion collision. The results for gluonic jets
indicate a slightly too large suppression, but are encouraging to understand
the two major phenomena, strong flow and jet-quenching, within a unified
microscopic treatment of kinetic processes. In addition, simulations on the
temporal propagation of dissipative shock waves lead to the observation that an
$\eta/s$ ratio larger than 0.2 prevents the development of well-defined shock
waves on timescales typical for ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.
