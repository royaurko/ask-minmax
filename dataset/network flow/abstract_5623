We study the elastic deformations in a cross-linked polymer network film
triggered by the binding of submicron particles with a sticky surface,
mimicking the interactions of viral pathogens with thin films of
stimulus-responsive polymeric materials such as hydrogels. From extensive
Langevin Dynamics simulations we quantify how far the network deformations
propagate depending on the elasticity parameters of the network and the
adhesion strength of the particles. We examine the dynamics of the collective
area shrinkage of the network and obtain some simple relations for the
associated characteristic decay lengths. A detailed analysis elucidates how the
elastic energy of the network is distributed between stretching and compression
modes in response to the particle binding. We also examine the force-distance
curves of the repulsion or attraction interactions for a pair of sticky
particles in the polymer network film as a function of the particle-particle
separation. The results of this computational study provide new insight into
collective phenomena in soft polymer network films and may, in particular, be
applied to applications for visual detection of pathogens such as viruses via a
macroscopic response of thin films of cross-linked hydrogels.
