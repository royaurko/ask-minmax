A macroscopic model-based approach for estimation of the traffic state,
specifically of the (total) density and flow of vehicles, is developed for the
case of "mixed" traffic, i.e., traffic comprising both ordinary and connected
vehicles. The development relies on the following realistic assumptions: (i)
The density and flow of connected vehicles are known at the (local or central)
traffic monitoring and control unit on the basis of their regularly reported
positions, and (ii) the average speed of conventional vehicles is roughly equal
to the average speed of connected vehicles. Thus, complete traffic state
estimation (for arbitrarily selected segments in the network) may be achieved
by merely estimating the percentage of connected vehicles with respect to the
total number of vehicles. A model is derived, which describes the dynamics of
the percentage of connected vehicles, utilizing only well-known conservation
law equations that describe the dynamics of the density of connected vehicles
and of the total density of all vehicles. Based on this model, which is a
linear time-varying system, an estimation algorithm for the percentage of
connected vehicles is developed employing a Kalman filter. The estimation
methodology is validated through simulations using a second-order macroscopic
traffic flow model as ground truth for the traffic state. The approach calls
for a minimum of spot sensor-based total flow measurements {according to a
variety of possible location configurations.
