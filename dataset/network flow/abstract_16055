Recent study shows that the accuracy of the k-shell method in determining
node coreness in a spreading process is largely impacted due to the existence
of core-like group, which has a large k-shell index but a low spreading
efficiency. Based on analysis of the structure of core-like groups in
real-world networks, we discover that nodes in the core-like group are mutually
densely connected with very few out-leaving links from the group. By defining a
measure of diffusion importance for each edge based on the number of
out-leaving links of its both ends, we are able to identify redundant links in
the spreading process, which have a relatively low diffusion importance but
lead to form the locally densely connected core-like group. After filtering out
the redundant links and applying the k-shell method to the residual network, we
obtain a renewed coreness for each node which is a more accurate index to
indicate its location importance and spreading influence in the original
network. Moreover, we find that the performance of the ranking algorithms based
on the renewed coreness are also greatly enhanced. Our findings help to more
accurately decompose the network core structure and identify influential nodes
in spreading processes.
