In this paper, we present an algorithm for the recovery of wireless networks
after a disaster. Considering a damaged wireless network, presenting coverage
holes or/and many disconnected components, we propose a disaster recovery
algorithm which repairs the network. It provides the list of locations where to
put new nodes in order to patch the coverage holes and mend the disconnected
components. In order to do this we first consider the simplicial complex
representation of the network, then the algorithm adds supplementary vertices
in excessive number, and afterwards runs a reduction algorithm in order to
reach an optimal result. One of the novelty of this work resides in the
proposed method for the addition of vertices. We use a determinantal point
process: the Ginibre point process which has inherent repulsion between
vertices, and has never been simulated before for wireless networks
representation. We compare both the determinantal point process addition method
with other vertices addition methods, and the whole disaster recovery algorithm
to the greedy algorithm for the set cover problem.
