A new variational problem for upper bounds on the rate of energy dissipation
in body-forced shear flows is formulated by including a balance parameter in
the derivation from the Navier-Stokes equations. The resulting min-max problem
is investigated computationally, producing new estimates that quantitatively
improve previously obtained rigorous bounds. The results are compared with data
from direct numerical simulations.
