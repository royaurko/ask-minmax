Large eddy approximation of turbulent flow is given a natural setting within
the DSC framework of computational fluid dynamics. Periodic cellular
coarse-graining prevents the nodal flow from piling up and preserves its large
patterns. The coarsening operations are consistent with the near-field
interaction principle of DSC and - therefore - uncomplicated at boundaries.
Numerical examples validate the approach.
