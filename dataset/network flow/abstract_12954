We model a shear-thickening fluid that combines a tendency to form
inhomogeneous, shear-banded flows with a slow relaxational dynamics for fluid
microstructure. The interplay between these factors gives rich dynamics, with
periodic regimes (oscillating bands, travelling bands, and more complex
oscillations) and spatiotemporal rheochaos. These phenomena, arising from
constitutive nonlinearity not inertia, can occur even when the steady-state
flow curve is monotonic. Our model also shows rheochaos in a low-dimensional
truncation where sharply defined shear bands cannot form.
