We study the problem of phase coherence in doped striped cuprates. We assume
the stripes to form a network of one-dimensional Luttinger liquids which are
dominated by superconducting fluctuations and pinned by impurities. The problem
of phase coherence is discussed. We study the dynamics of the superconducting
phase using a model of resistively shunted junctions which leads to a
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We show that our results are consistent with
recent experiments in Zn-doped cuprates. We also explain the scaling of the
superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ with the incommensurability as seen
in recent neutron scattering experiments and predict the behavior of $H_{c2}$
in the underdoped region.
