We study vaccine control for disease spread on an adaptive network modeling
disease avoidance behavior. Control is implemented by adding Poisson
distributed vaccination of susceptibles. We show that vaccine control is much
more effective in adaptive networks than in static networks due to an
interaction between the adaptive network rewiring and the vaccine application.
Disease extinction rates using vaccination are computed, and orders of
magnitude less vaccine application is needed to drive the disease to extinction
in an adaptive network than in a static one.
