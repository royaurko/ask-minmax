With the feature of multi-master bus access, nondestructive contention-based
arbitration and flexible configuration, Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is
applied into the control system of Wire Harness Assembly Machine (WHAM). To
accomplish desired goal, the specific features of the CAN bus is analyzed by
compared with other field buses and the functional performances in the CAN bus
system of WHAM is discussed. Then the application layer planning of CAN bus for
dynamic priority is presented. The critical issue for the use of CAN bus system
in WHAM is the data transfer rate between different nodes. So processing
efficient model is introduced to assist analyzing data transfer procedure.
Through the model, it is convenient to verify the real time feature of the CAN
bus system in WHAM.
