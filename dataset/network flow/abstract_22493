We consider the mass conserving Allen-Cahn equation proposed in
\cite{Bra-Bre}: the Lagrange multiplier which ensures the conservation of the
mass contains not only nonlocal but also local effects (in contrast with
\cite{Che-Hil-Log}). As a parameter related to the thickness of a diffuse
internal layer tends to zero, we perform formal asymptotic expansions of the
solutions. Then, equipped with these approximate solutions, we rigorously prove
the convergence to the volume preserving mean curvature flow, under the
assumption that classical solutions of the latter exist. This requires a
precise analysis of the error between the actual and the approximate Lagrange
multipliers.
