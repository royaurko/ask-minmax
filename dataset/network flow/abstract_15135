This paper proposes, a hardware implementation of Wireless Mesh Networks
(WMN) medium Access Controller (MAC) layer transmitter. In the literature a lot
of works are focused on WMN routing protocol as well as performance analysis
and software integration of WMN units, however few works deals with WMN
hardware implementation. In this field our contribution is to conceive and to
implements on FPGA a WMN MAC transmitter module. Our implementation, written in
hardware description language (HDL) is based on the IEEE 802.11 s standard. The
hardware implementation retains a good performance in speed.
