The late infall of cold dark matter onto an isolated galaxy such as our own
produces flows with definite velocity vectors at any physical point in the
galactic halo. It also produces caustics which are places where the dark matter
density is very large. The outer caustics are topological spheres whereas the
inner caustics are rings. The self-similar model of galactic halo formation
predicts that the caustic ring radii $a_n$ follow the approximate law $a_n \sim
1/n$. In a recent study of 32 extended and well-measured galactic rotation
curves, we found evidence for this law.
