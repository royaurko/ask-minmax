Mobility support in IPv6 networks is ready for release as an RFC, stimulating
major discussions on improvements to meet real-time communication requirements.
Sprawling hot spots of IP-only wireless networks at the same time await voice
and videoconferencing as standard mobile Internet services, thereby adding the
request for multicast support to real-time mobility. This paper briefly
introduces current approaches for seamless multicast extensions to Mobile IPv6.
Key issues of multicast mobility are discussed. Both analytically and in
simulations comparisons are drawn between handover performance characteristics,
dedicating special focus on the M-HMIPv6 approach.
