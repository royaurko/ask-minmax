Effects of truncation in self-similar continuous unitary transformations
(S-CUT) are estimated rigorously. We find a formal description via an
inhomogeneous flow equation. In this way, we are able to quantify truncation
errors within the framework of the S-CUT and obtain rigorous error bounds for
the ground state energy and the highest excited level. These bounds can be
lowered exploiting symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate our approach
with results for a toy model of two interacting hard-core bosons and the
dimerized S=1/2 Heisenberg chain.
