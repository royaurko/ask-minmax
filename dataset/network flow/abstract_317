We are interested in unicast traffic over wireless networks that employ
constructive inter-session network coding, including single-hop and multi-hop
schemes. In this setting, TCP flows do not fully exploit the network coding
opportunities due to their bursty behavior and due to the fact that TCP is
agnostic to the underlying network coding. In order to improve the performance
of TCP flows over coded wireless networks, we take the following steps. First,
we formulate the problem as network utility maximization and we present a
distributed solution. Second, mimicking the structure of the optimal solution,
we propose a "network-coding aware" queue management scheme (NCAQM) at
intermediate nodes; we make no changes to TCP or to the MAC protocol (802.11).
We demonstrate, via simulation, that NCAQM significantly improves TCP
performance compared to TCP over baseline schemes.
