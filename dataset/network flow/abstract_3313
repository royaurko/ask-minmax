The effect of shear flow on mode selection and the length scale of patterns
formed in a nonlinear auto-catalytic reaction-diffusion model is investigated.
We predict analytically the existence of transverse and longitudinal modes. The
type of the selected mode strongly depends on the difference in the flow rates
of the participating species, quantified by the differential flow parameter.
New spatial structures are obtained by varying the length scale of individual
modes and superposing them via the differential flow parameter. Our predictions
are in line with numerical results obtained from lattice Boltzmann simulations.
