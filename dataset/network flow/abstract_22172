The curvature drift instability has long been considered as a viable
mechanism for pulsar radio emission. We reconsidered this mechanism by finding
an explicit solution describing propagation of short-wave electro-magnetic
waves in a plasma flow along curved magnetic field lines. We show that even
though the waves could be amplified, the amplification factor remains very
close to unity therefore this mechanism is unable to generate high brightness
temperature emission from initial weak fluctuations.
