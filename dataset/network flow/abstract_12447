Edges in a network can be divided into two kinds according to their different
roles: some enhance the locality like the ones inside a cluster while others
contribute to the global connectivity like the ones connecting two clusters. A
recent study by Onnela et al uncovered the weak ties effects in mobile
communication. In this article, we provide complementary results on document
networks, that is, the edges connecting less similar nodes in content are more
significant in maintaining the global connectivity. We propose an index named
bridgeness to quantify the edge significance in maintaining connectivity, which
only depends on local information of network topology. We compare the
bridgeness with content similarity and some other structural indices according
to an edge percolation process. Experimental results on document networks show
that the bridgeness outperforms content similarity in characterizing the edge
significance. Furthermore, extensive numerical results on disparate networks
indicate that the bridgeness is also better than some well-known indices on
edge significance, including the Jaccard coefficient, degree product and
betweenness centrality.
