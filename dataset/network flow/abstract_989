In this work, we apply a common economic tool, namely money, to coordinate
network packets. In particular, we present a network economy, called
PacketEconomy, where each flow is modeled as a population of rational network
packets, and these packets can self-regulate their access to network resources
by mutually trading their positions in router queues. Every packet of the
economy has its price, and this price determines if and when the packet will
agree to buy or sell a better position. We consider a corresponding Markov
model of trade and show that there are Nash equilibria (NE) where queue
positions and money are exchanged directly between the network packets. This
simple approach, interestingly, delivers improvements even when fiat money is
used. We present theoretical arguments and experimental results to support our
claims.
