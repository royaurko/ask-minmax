Based on Sirovich's two-fluid kinetic theory and a dodecagonal discrete
velocity model, a two-dimensional 61-velocity finite-difference lattice
Boltzmann method for the complete Navier-Stokes equations of binary fluids is
formulated. Previous constraints, in most existing lattice Boltzmann methods,
on the studied systems, like isothermal and nearly incompressible, are released
within the present method. This method is designed to simulate compressible and
thermal binary fluid mixtures. The validity of the proposed method is verified
by investigating (i) the Couette flow and (ii) the uniform relaxation process
of the two components.
