The most important stages in designing a computer network in a wider
geographical area include: definition of requirements, topological description,
identification and calculation of relevant parameters (i.e. traffic matrix),
determining the shortest path between nodes, quantification of the effect of
various levels of technical and technological development of urban areas
involved, the cost of technology, and the cost of services. These parameters
differ for WAN networks in different regions - their calculation depends
directly on the data "in the field": number of inhabitants, distance between
populated areas, network traffic density, as well as available bandwidth. The
main reason for identification and evaluation of these parameters is to develop
a model that could meet the constraints imposed by potential beneficiaries. In
this paper, we develop a methodology for planning and cost-modeling of a wide
area network and validate it in a case study, under the supposition that
behavioral interactions of individuals and groups play a significant role and
have to be taken into consideration by employing either simple or composite
indicators of socioeconomic status.
