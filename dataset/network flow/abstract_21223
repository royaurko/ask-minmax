We give a combinatorial characterization of generic minimally rigid
reflection frameworks. The main new idea is to study a pair of direction
networks on the same graph such that one admits faithful realizations and the
other has only collapsed realizations. In terms of infinitesimal rigidity,
realizations of the former produce a framework and the latter certifies that
this framework is infinitesimally rigid.
