We consider the problem of rate allocation among multiple simultaneous video
streams sharing multiple heterogeneous access networks. We develop and evaluate
an analytical framework for optimal rate allocation based on observed available
bit rate (ABR) and round-trip time (RTT) over each access network and video
distortion-rate (DR) characteristics. The rate allocation is formulated as a
convex optimization problem that minimizes the total expected distortion of all
video streams. We present a distributed approximation of its solution and
compare its performance against H-infinity optimal control and two heuristic
schemes based on TCP-style additive-increase-multiplicative decrease (AIMD)
principles. The various rate allocation schemes are evaluated in simulations of
multiple high-definition (HD) video streams sharing multiple access networks.
Our results demonstrate that, in comparison with heuristic AIMD-based schemes,
both media-aware allocation and H-infinity optimal control benefit from
proactive congestion avoidance and reduce the average packet loss rate from 45%
to below 2%. Improvement in average received video quality ranges between 1.5
to 10.7 dB in PSNR for various background traffic loads and video playout
deadlines. Media-aware allocation further exploits its knowledge of the video
DR characteristics to achieve a more balanced video quality among all streams.
