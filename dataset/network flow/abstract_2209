We introduce a flow of K\"ahler structures over Fano manifolds with formal
limit at infinite time a K\"ahler-Ricci soliton. This flow correspond to a
Perelman's modified backward K\"ahler-Ricci type flow that we call
Soliton-K\"ahler-Ricci flow. It can be generated by the Soliton-Ricci flow. We
assume that the Soliton-Ricci flow exists for all times and the
Bakry-Emery-Ricci tensor preserve a positive uniform lower bound with respect
to the evolving metric. In this case we show that the corresponding
Soliton-K\"ahler-Ricci flow converges exponentially fast to a K\"ahler-Ricci
soliton.
