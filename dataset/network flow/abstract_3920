The main focus of this article is to achieve prolonged network lifetime with
overall energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks through controlled
utilization of limited energy. Major percentage of energy in wireless sensor
network is consumed during routing from source to destination, retransmission
of data on packet loss. For improvement, cross layered algorithm is proposed
for routing and retransmission scheme. Simulation and results shows that this
approach can save the overall energy consumption
