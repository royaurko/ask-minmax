We examine the excitation of oscillations in the magnetic network of the Sun
through the footpoint motion of photospheric magnetic flux tubes located in
intergranular lanes. The motion is derived from a time series of
high-resolution G band and continuum filtergrams using an object-tracking
technique. We model the response of the flux tube to the footpoint motion in
terms of the Klein-Gordon equation, which is solved analytically as an initial
value problem for transverse (kink) waves. We compute the wave energy flux in
upward propagating transverse waves. In general we find that the injection of
energy into the chromosphere occurs in short-duration pulses, which would lead
to a time variability in chromospheric emission that is incompatible with
observations. Therefore, we consider the effects of turbulent convective flows
on flux tubes in intergranular lanes. The turbulent flows are simulated by
adding high-frequency motions (periods 5-50 s) with an amplitude of 1 km
s^{-1}. The latter are simulated by adding random velocity fluctuations to the
observationally determined velocities. In this case we find that the energy
flux is much less intermittent and can in principle carry adequate energy for
chromospheric heating.
