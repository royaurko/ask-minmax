We propose a systematic formulation of the migration behaviors of a vesicle
in a Poiseuille flow based on Onsager's variational principle. Our model is
described by a combination of the phase field theory for the vesicle and the
hydrodynamics for the flow field. The time evolution equations for the phase
field of the vesicle and the flow field are derived based on the Onsager's
principle, where the dissipation functional is composed of viscous dissipation
of the flow field, bending energy of the vesicle and the friction between the
vesicle and the flow field. We performed a series of simulations on
2-dimensional systems by changing the bending elasticity of the membrane, and
observed 3 types of steady states, i.e. those with bullet, snaking, and slipper
shapes. We show that the transitions among these steady states can be
quantitatively explained with use of the Onsager's principle, where the
dissipation functional is dominated by the contribution from the friction
between the vesicle and the flow field.
