We analyze the second Fourier coefficient $v_2$ of the pion azimuthal
distribution in non-central heavy-ion collisions in a relativistic hydrodynamic
model. The exact treatment of the decay kinematics of resonances leads to
almost vanishing azimuthal anisotropy of pions near the midrapidity, while the
matter elliptic flow is in-plane at freeze-out. In addition, we reproduce the
rapidity dependence of $v_2$ for pions measured in non-central Pb + Pb
collisions at 158$A$ GeV. This suggests that resonance particles as well as
stable particles constitute the in-plane flow and are important ingredients for
the understanding of the observed pion flow.
