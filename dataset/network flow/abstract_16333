With growing multiplicity, the pp and pA collisions enter the domain where
the macroscopic description (thermodynamics and hydrodynamics) becomes
applicable. We discuss this situation, first with simplified thought
experiments, then with some idealized representative cases, and finally address
the real data. For clarity, we don't do it numerically but analytically, using
the Gubser solution. We found that the radial flow is expected to increase from
central AA to central pA, while the elliptic flow decreases, with higher
harmonics being comparable. In the second part of the paper we approach the
problem from the opposite side, using a string-based Pomeron model. We
extensively study the magnitude and distribution of the viscous corrections, in
Navier-Stokes and Israel-Stuart approximations, ending with higher gradient
re-summation proposed by Lublinsky and Shuryak. We found those corrections
growing, from AA to pA to pp, but remaining at the manageable size even in the
last case.
