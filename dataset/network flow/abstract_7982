In nuclear collisions at highest accessible LHC energies, often more than one
dijet pairs deposit momentum into the deconfined expanding medium. With the
help of 3+1 dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulation we show that this
leads to measurable contribution to the anisotropy of collective transverse
expansion. Hard partons generate streams in plasma which merge if they come
close to each other. This mechanism correlates the resulting contribution to
flow anisotropy with the fireball geometry and causes an increase of the
elliptic flow in non-central collisions.
