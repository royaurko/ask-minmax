A microscopic approach to macroeconomic features is intended. A model for
macroeconomic behavior based on the Ausloos-Clippe-Pekalski model is built and
investigated. The influence of a discrete time information transfer is
investigated. The formation of economic cycles is observed as a function of the
time of information delay. Three regions of delay time are recognized: short
$t_d \in (2 IS, 4 IS)$ (IS - iteration steps) - the system evolves toward a
unique stable equilibrium state, medium $t_d =5 IS $ or $t_d =6 IS $, the
system undergoes oscillations: stable concentration cycles appear in the
system. For long information flow delay times, $t_d \geq 7$, the systems may
crash for most initial concentrations. However, even in the case of long delay
time the crash time may be long enough to allow observation of the system
evolution and to introduce an appropriate strategy in order to avoid the
collapse of the e.g. company concentration. In the long time delay it is also
possible to observe an "economy resonance" where despite a long delay time the
system evolves for a long time or can even reach a stable state, which insures
its existence.
