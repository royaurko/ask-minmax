We propose an algorithm to locate the most critical nodes to network
robustness. Such critical nodes may be thought of as those most related to the
notion of network centrality. Our proposal relies only on a localized spectral
analysis of a limited subnetwork centered at each node in the network. We also
present a procedure allowing the navigation from any node towards a critical
node following only local information computed by the proposed algorithm.
Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposal considering
networks of different scales and topological characteristics.
