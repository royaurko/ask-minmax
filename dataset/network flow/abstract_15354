In this paper, we consider networked estimation of linear, discrete-time
dynamical systems monitored by a network of agents. In order to minimize the
power requirement at the (possibly, battery-operated) agents, we require that
the agents can exchange information with their neighbors only \emph{once per
dynamical system time-step}; in contrast to consensus-based estimation where
the agents exchange information until they reach a consensus. It can be
verified that with this restriction on information exchange, measurement fusion
alone results in an unbounded estimation error at every such agent that does
not have an observable set of measurements in its neighborhood. To over come
this challenge, state-estimate fusion has been proposed to recover the system
observability. However, we show that adding state-estimate fusion may not
recover observability when the system matrix is structured-rank ($S$-rank)
deficient.
  In this context, we characterize the state-estimate fusion and measurement
fusion under both full $S$-rank and $S$-rank deficient system matrices.
