This paper addresses the following foundational question: what is the maximum
theoretical delay performance achievable by an overlay peer-to-peer streaming
system where the streamed content is subdivided into chunks? As shown in this
paper, when posed for chunk-based systems, and as a consequence of the
store-and-forward way in which chunks are delivered across the network, this
question has a fundamentally different answer with respect to the case of
systems where the streamed content is distributed through one or more flows
(sub-streams). To circumvent the complexity emerging when directly dealing with
delay, we express performance in term of a convenient metric, called "stream
diffusion metric". We show that it is directly related to the end-to-end
minimum delay achievable in a P2P streaming network. In a homogeneous scenario,
we derive a performance bound for such metric, and we show how this bound
relates to two fundamental parameters: the upload bandwidth available at each
node, and the number of neighbors a node may deliver chunks to. In this bound,
k-step Fibonacci sequences do emerge, and appear to set the fundamental laws
that characterize the optimal operation of chunk-based systems.
