The vision of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) embodies the seam- less discovery,
configuration, and interoperability of networked devices in various settings,
ranging from home automation and multimedia to autonomous vehicles and
manufacturing equipment. As these ap- plications become increasingly critical,
the middleware coping with Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication and
coordination has to deal with fault tolerance and increasing complexity, while
still abiding to resource constraints of target devices. In this report, we
focus on configuration management and coordi- nation of services in a M2M
scenario. On one hand, we consider Zoo- Keeper, originally developed for cloud
data centers, offering a simple file-system abstraction, and embodying
replication for fault-tolerance and scalability based on a consensus protocol.
On the other hand, we consider the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS)
stack with replicated services based on our implementation of the Raft
consensus protocol. We show that the latter offers adequate performance for the
targeted applications while providing increasing flexibility.
