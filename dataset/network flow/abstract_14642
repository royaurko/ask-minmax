Fast thermalization and a strong buildup of elliptic flow of QCD matter as
found at RHIC are understood as the consequence of perturbative QCD (pQCD)
interactions within the 3+1 dimensional parton cascade BAMPS. The main
contributions stem from pQCD bremsstrahlung $2 \leftrightarrow 3 $ processes.
By comparing to Au+Au data of the flow parameter $v_2$ as a function of
participation number the shear viscosity to entropy ratio is dynamically
extracted, which lies in the range of 0.08 and 0.2, depending on the chosen
coupling constant and freeze out condition. Furthermore, first simulations on
the temporal propagation of dissipative shock waves are given. The cascade can
either simulate true ideal shocks as well as initially diluted, truely viscous
shocks, depending on the employed cross sections or mean free path,
respectively.
