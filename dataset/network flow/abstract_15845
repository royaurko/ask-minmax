We consider a cognitive network consisting of n random pairs of cognitive
transmitters and receivers communicating simultaneously in the presence of
multiple primary users. Of interest is how the maximum throughput achieved by
the cognitive users scales with n. Furthermore, how far these users must be
from a primary user to guarantee a given primary outage. Two scenarios are
considered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitter
uses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a bounded
distance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its power
according to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitive
transmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitable
for cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,
with path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearly
with the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primary
exclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on this
radius for a given primary outage constraint. These bounds can help in the
design of a primary network with exclusive regions, outside of which cognitive
users may transmit freely. Our results show that opportunistic secondary
spectrum access using single-hop transmission is promising.
