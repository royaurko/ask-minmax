We study the partial maxima of stationary \alpha-stable processes. We relate
their asymptotic behavior to the ergodic theoretical properties of the flow. We
observe a sharp change in the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of partial
maxima as flow changes from being dissipative to being conservative, and argue
that this may indicate a change from a short memory process to a long memory
process.
