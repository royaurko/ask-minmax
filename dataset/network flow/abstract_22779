This article reviews recent advances in our understanding of the experimental
aspects of jet-quenching and correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
at RHIC and LHC. Emphasis is put on correlation measurements, namely jet-like
correlations with anisotropic flow subtraction in heavy-ion collisions and
long-range pseudorapidity correlations in small systems. Future path on
correlation studies is envisioned which may elucidate jet-medium interactions
and the properties of the hot dense medium in QCD.
