We construct a network from climate records of atmospheric temperature at
surface level, at different geographical sites in the globe, using reanalysis
data from years 1948-2010. We find that the network correlates with the North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), both locally in the north Atlantic, and through
coupling to the southern Pacific Ocean. The existence of tele-connection links
between those areas and their stability over time allows us to suggest a
possible physical explanation for this phenomenon.
