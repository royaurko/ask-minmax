Let $k \geq 2$, and let $\Gamma \subset \PSL(2, \R)^k$ be an irreducible,
cocompact lattice. We prove effective equidistribution for coordinate horocycle
flows on $\Gamma \backslash \PSL(2, \R)^k$. This is the simplest case for
proving effective equidistribution of unipotent flows in this setting.
  The main ingredients are Flaminio-Forni's study of the equidistribution of
the horocycle flow and a result by Kelmer-Sarnak on the strong spectral gap
property of $\Gamma$ in $\PSL(2, \R)^k$.
