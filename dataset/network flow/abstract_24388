The long-Term Evolution (LTE) of the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership
Project) radio access network is in early stage of specification. Self-tuning
and self-optimisation algorithms are currently studied with the aim of
enriching the LTE standard. This paper investigates auto-tuning of LTE mobility
algorithm. The auto-tuning is carried out by adapting handover parameters of
each base station according to its radio load and the load of its adjacent
cells. The auto-tuning alleviates cell congestion and balances the traffic and
the load between cells by handing off mobiles close to the cell border from the
congested cell to its neighbouring cells. Simulation results show that the
auto-tuning process brings an important gain in both call admission rate and
user throughput.
