We present a general model for the growth of weighted networks in which the
structural growth is coupled with the edges' weight dynamical evolution. The
model is based on a simple weight-driven dynamics and a weights' reinforcement
mechanism coupled to the local network growth. That coupling can be generalized
in order to include the effect of additional randomness and non-linearities
which can be present in real-world networks. The model generates weighted
graphs exhibiting the statistical properties observed in several real-world
systems. In particular, the model yields a non-trivial time evolution of
vertices properties and scale-free behavior with exponents depending on the
microscopic parameters characterizing the coupling rules. Very interestingly,
the generated graphs spontaneously achieve a complex hierarchical architecture
characterized by clustering and connectivity correlations varying as a function
of the vertices' degree.
