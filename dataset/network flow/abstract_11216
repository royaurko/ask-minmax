Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a collection of nodes which can communicate
with each other without any prior infrastructure along with the ability to
collect data autonomously and effectively after being deployed in an ad-hoc
fashion to monitor a given area. One major problem encountered in data
gathering wireless systems is to obtain an optimal balance among the number of
nodes deployed, energy efficiency and lifetime as energy of nodes cannot be
replenished. In this paper we propose first a scheme to estimate the number of
nodes to be deployed in a WSN for a predetermined lifetime so that total energy
utilization and complete connectivity are ensured under all circumstances. This
scheme also guarantees that during each data gathering cycle, every node
dissipates the requisite amount of energy, which thus minimizes the number of
nodes required to achieve the desired network lifetime. Second, this paper has
proposed a framework to conduct data gathering in WSN. Extensive simulations
have been carried out in ns2 to establish the effectiveness of this framework.
