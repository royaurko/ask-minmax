The behaviour of electromagnetic waves propagating through an electroweak
homilia string network is examined. This string network is topologically stable
as a cosmic texture, and is characterized by the spatial variation of the
isospin rotation of the Higgs field. As a consequence the photon field couples
to the intermediate vector bosons, producing a finite range electromagnetic
field. It is found that the propagation speed of the photon depends on its
polarization vector, whence an homilia string network acts as a birefringent
medium. We estimate the birefringent scale for this texture and show that it
depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic wave and the length scale of
the homilia string network.
