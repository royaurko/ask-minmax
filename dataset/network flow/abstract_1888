Consider a tree network $T$, where each edge acts as an independent copy of a
given channel $M$, and information is propagated from the root. For which $T$
and $M$ does the configuration obtained at level $n$ of $T$ typically contain
significant information on the root variable? This problem arose independently
in biology, information theory and statistical physics.
  For all $b$, we construct a channel for which the variable at the root of the
$b$-ary tree is independent of the configuration at level 2 of that tree, yet
for sufficiently large $B>b$, the mutual information between the configuration
at level $n$ of the $B$-ary tree and the root variable is bounded away from
zero. This is related to certain secret-sharing protocols.
  We improve the upper bounds on information flow for asymmetric binary
channels (which correspond to the Ising model with an external field) and for
symmetric $q$-ary channels (which correspond to Potts models).
  Let $\lam_2(M)$ denote the second largest eigenvalue of $M$, in absolute
value. A CLT of Kesten and Stigum~(1966) implies that if $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 >1$,
then the {\em census} of the variables at any level of the $b$-ary tree,
contains significant information on the root variable. We establish a converse:
if $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 < 1$, then the census of the variables at level $n$ of the
$b$-ary tree is asymptotically independent of the root variable. This contrasts
with examples where $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 <1$, yet the {\em configuration} at level
$n$ is not asymptotically independent of the root variable.
