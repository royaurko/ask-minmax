Collective transverse flow in heavy-ion collisions at incident energies
E_{lab} = (1 -160)A GeV is analyzed within the model of 3-fluid dynamics (3FD).
Simulations are performed with purely hadronic equation of state (EoS). At the
AGS energies the flow turns out to be sensitive to the stopping power of
nuclear matter rather than only to the stiffness of the EoS. When the stopping
power is fixed to reproduce other observables, the flow data favor more and
more soft EoS with the incident energy rise, which can be associated with ``a
transition from hadronic to string matter'' reported in the
Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) model. Problems, which are met in simultaneous
reproduction of directed and elliptic flows within the 3FD, suggest that the
transverse flow is very sensitive to the character of the transverse-momentum
nonequilibrium at the initial stage of collision. Arguments in favor of
"early-stage" nature of the flow observable are put forward. This suggests that
the flow (especially the directed one) is determined by early-stage evolution
of the collision rather than freeze-out stage.
