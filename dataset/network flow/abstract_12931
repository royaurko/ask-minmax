The effect of velocity correlations on the equal-time density autocorrelation
function, e.g. the pair distribution function or pdf, of a hard-sphere fluid
undergoing shear flow is investigated. The pdf at contact is calculated within
the Enskog approximation and is shown to be in good agreement with molecular
dynamics simulations for shear rates below the shear-induced ordering
transition. These calculations are used to construct a nonequilibrium
generalised mean spherical approximation for the pdf at finite separations
which is also found to agree well with the simulation data.
