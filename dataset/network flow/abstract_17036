We study the dynamics of epidemic and reaction-diffusion processes in
metapopulation models with heterogeneous connectivity pattern. In SIR-like
processes, along with the standard local epidemic threshold, the system
exhibits a global invasion threshold. We provide an explicit expression of the
threshold that sets a critical value of the diffusion/mobility rate below which
the epidemic is not able to spread to a macroscopic fraction of subpopulations.
The invasion threshold is found to be affected by the topological fluctuations
of the metapopulation network. The presented results provide a general
framework for the understanding of the effect of travel restrictions in
epidemic containment.
