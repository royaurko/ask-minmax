Huisken and Sinestrari have recently defined a surgery process for mean
curvature flow when the initial data is a two-convex hypersurface. The process
depends on a parameter H. Its role is to initiate a surgery when the maximum of
the mean curvature of the evolving hypersurface becomes H, and to control the
scale at which each surgery is performed. We prove that as H goes to infinity
the surgery process converges to level set flow.
