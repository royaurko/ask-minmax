This paper is concerned with the free boundary value problem for
multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity
where the flow density vanishes continuously across the free boundary. A local
(in time) existence of weak solution is established, in particular, the density
is positive and the solution is regular away from the free boundary.
