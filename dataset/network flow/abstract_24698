Interference management has the potential to improve spectrum efficiency in
current and next generation wireless systems (e.g. 3GPP LTE and IEEE 802.11).
Recently, new paradigms for interference management have emerged to tackle
interference in a general class of wireless networks: interference shaping and
interference exploitation. Both approaches offer better performance in
interference-limited communication regimes than traditionally thought possible.
This article provides a high-level overview of several different interference
shaping and exploitation techniques for single-hop, multi-hop, and multi-way
network architectures. Graphical illustrations that explain the intuition
behind each strategy are provided. The article concludes with a discussion of
practical challenges associated with adopting sophisticated interference
management strategies in the future.
