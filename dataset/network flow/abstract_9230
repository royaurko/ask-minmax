We study the synchronization transition (ST) of a modified Kuramoto model on
two different types of modular complex networks. It is found that the ST
depends on the type of inter-modular connections. For the network with
decentralized (centralized) inter-modular connections, the ST occurs at finite
coupling constant (behaves abnormally). Such distinct features are found in the
yeast protein interaction network and the Internet, respectively. Moreover, by
applying the finite-size scaling analysis to an artificial network with
decentralized inter-modular connections, we obtain the exponent associated with
the order parameter of the ST to be $\beta \approx 1$ different from
$\beta_{\rm MF} \approx 1/2$ obtained from the scale-free network with the same
degree distribution but the absence of modular structure, corresponding to the
mean field value.
