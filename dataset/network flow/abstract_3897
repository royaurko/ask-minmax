We formulate a reduction theory that describes the response of an oscillator
network as a whole to external forcing applied nonuniformly to its constituent
oscillators. The phase description of multiple oscillator networks coupled
weakly is also developed. General formulae for the collective phase sensitivity
and the effective phase coupling between the oscillator networks are found. Our
theory is applicable to a wide variety of oscillator networks undergoing
frequency synchronization. Any network structure can systematically be treated.
A few examples are given to illustrate our theory.
