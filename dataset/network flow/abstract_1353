We address the problem of efficient data gathering in a wireless network
through multi-hop communication. We focus on the objective of minimizing the
maximum flow time of a data packet. We prove that no polynomial time algorithm
for this problem can have approximation ratio less than $\Omega(m^{1/3)$ when
$m$ packets have to be transmitted, unless $P = NP$. We then use resource
augmentation to assess the performance of a FIFO-like strategy. We prove that
this strategy is 5-speed optimal, i.e., its cost remains within the optimal
cost if we allow the algorithm to transmit data at a speed 5 times higher than
that of the optimal solution we compare to.
