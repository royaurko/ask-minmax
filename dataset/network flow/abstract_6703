Wireless sensor networks have profound effects on many application fields
like security management which need an immediate and fast system reaction.
Indeed, the monitoring of a dangerous product warehouse is a major issue in
chemical industry field. This paper describes the design of chemical warehouse
security system using the concept of active products and wireless sensor
networks. A security application layer is developed to supervise and exchange
messages between nodes and the control center to prevent industrial accident.
Different security rules are proposed on this layer to monitor the internal
state and incompatible products distance. If a critical event is detected, the
application generates alert message which need a short end to end delay and low
packet loss rate constraints by network layer. Thus, a QoS routing protocol is
also developed in the network layer. The proposed solution is implemented in
Castalia/OMNeT++ simulator. Simulation results show that the system reacts
perfectly for critical event and can meet the QoS constraints of alert message.
