Yukawa theory at vanishing temperature provides (one of the ingredients for)
an effective description of the thermodynamics of a variety of cold and dense
fermionic systems. We study the role of masses and the renormalization group
flow in the calculation of the equation of state up to two loops within the
MSbar scheme. Two-loop integrals are computed analytically for arbitrary
fermion and scalar masses, and expressed in terms of well-known special
functions. The dependence of the renormalization group flow on the number of
fermion flavors is also discussed.
