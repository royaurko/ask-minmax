In this paper we investigate a time dependent family of plane closed Jordan
curves evolving in the normal direction with a velocity which is assumed to be
a function of the curvature, tangential angle and position vector of a curve.
We follow the direct approach and analyze the system of governing PDEs for
relevant geometric quantities. We focus on a class of the so-called curvature
adjusted tangential velocities for computation of the curvature driven flow of
plane closed curves. Such a curvature adjusted tangential velocity depends on
the modulus of the curvature and its curve average. Using the theory of
abstract parabolic equations we prove local existence, uniqueness and
continuation of classical solutions to the system of governing equations. We
furthermore analyze geometric flows for which normal velocity may depend on
global curve quantities like the length, enclosed area or total elastic energy
of a curve. We also propose a stable numerical approximation scheme based on
the flowing finite volume method. Several computational examples of various
nonlocal geometric flows are also presented in this paper.
