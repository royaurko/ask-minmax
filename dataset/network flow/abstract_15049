Let G be a compact Lie group. Using suitable normalization conventions, we
show that the evaluation of GxG-symmetric spin networks is non-negative
whenever the edges are labeled by representations of the form V\otimes V^*
where V is a representation of G, and the intertwiners are generalizations of
the Barrett--Crane intertwiner. This includes in particular the relativistic
spin networks with symmetry group Spin(4) or SO(4). We also present a
counterexample, using the finite group S_3, to the stronger conjecture that all
spin network evaluations are non-negative as long as they can be written using
only group integrations and index contractions. This counterexample applies in
particular to the product of five 6j-symbols which appears in the spin foam
model of the S_3-symmetric BF-theory on the two-complex dual to a triangulation
of the sphere S^3 using five tetrahedra. We show that this product is negative
real for a particular assignment of representations to the edges.
