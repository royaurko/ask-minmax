A network, with nodes representing entities and edges the connections between
entities, is a representation of data or events. Arguably, for the same data
set, there can be different network representations, depending on how
nodes/edges are defined and/or weighted. The conventional way of constructing a
network from data implicitly assumes the Markov property (first order
dependency) by considering only pairwise connections in data; for data with
higher order dependencies (beyond dyadic or pairwise interactions), this
oversimplification during network construction can lead to inaccuracies in
network analyses, especially when transportation, clickstream, or other types
of movements are simulated on the network. In this paper, we develop a
framework to discover higher order dependencies in data, and build a network
representation that is more reflective of the underlying phenomena in the data.
The proposed Higher Order Network (HON) is (1) able to represent higher order
dependencies in data, so that the simulation of movements on the network can
follow higher order dependency patterns and be more accurate; (2) compact in
size by adding nodes and edges to a first order network only where necessary,
and (3) compatible with existing network analysis tools, such that existing
analysis frameworks do not have to change and can be directly applied to
achieve more accurate results from HON.
