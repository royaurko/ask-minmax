In Wireless sensor networks data aggregation with hundreds and thousands of
sensor nodes is very complex task. Recently, mobile agents have been proposed
for efficient data dissemination in sensor networks. In the traditional
client/server based computing architecture, data is collected from multiple
sources and forwarded to destination for further processing. It requires high
bandwidth, whereas in the mobile agent is a task specific executable code
traverses to the relevant source for gathering data. It reduces communication
overhead, reduce cost, low bandwidth. Agents have capability to perform task
for multiple applications. It will send only useful information to destination
node. The problem is to group similar mobile agents into a number of clusters
such that each cluster has similarity in responding to a group of nodes. By
clustering intelligent mobile agents, it is possible to reduce the cost of time
for each individual agent, decrease the demand imposed on network for a set of
required tasks, decrease total number of visits. This paper, we present the
problem of Multiple Criteria Clustering of Mobile Agents (MCCMA) where the
decision is to cluster mobile agents such that a group of similar intelligent
mobile agents will visit a group of similar sensor nodes.
