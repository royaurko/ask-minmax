Here we apply nanomechanical resonators to the study of oscillatory fluid
dynamics. A high-resonance-frequency nanomechanical resonator generates a
rapidly oscillating flow in a surrounding gaseous environment; the nature of
the flow is studied through the flow-resonator interaction. Over the broad
frequency and pressure range explored, we observe signs of a transition from
Newtonian to non-Newtonian flow at $\omega\tau\approx 1$, where $\tau$ is a
properly defined fluid relaxation time. The obtained experimental data appears
to be in close quantitative agreement with a theory that predicts purely
elastic fluid response as $\omega\tau\to \infty$.
