Cooperative technology is expected to have a great impact on the performance
of cellular or, more generally, infrastructure networks. Both multicell
processing (cooperation among base stations) and relaying (cooperation at the
user level) are currently being investigated. In this presentation, recent
results regarding the performance of multicell processing and user cooperation
under the assumption of limited-capacity interbase station and inter-user
links, respectively, are reviewed. The survey focuses on related results
derived for non-fading uplink and downlink channels of simple cellular system
models. The analytical treatment, facilitated by these simple setups, enhances
the insight into the limitations imposed by limited-capacity constraints on the
gains achievable by cooperative techniques.
