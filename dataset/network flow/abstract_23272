Matrix orthogonal Laurent polynomials in the unit circle and the theory of
Toda-like integrable systems are connected using the Gauss--Borel factorization
of two, left and a right, Cantero-Morales-Velazquez block moment matrices,
which are constructed using a quasi-definite matrix measure. A block
Gauss-Borel factorization problem of these moment matrices leads to two sets of
biorthogonal matrix orthogonal Laurent polynomials and matrix Szeg\H{o}
polynomials, which can be expressed in terms of Schur complements of bordered
truncations of the block moment matrix. The corresponding block extension of
the Christoffel-Darboux theory is derived. Deformations of the quasi-definite
matrix measure leading to integrable systems of Toda type are studied. The
integrable theory is given in this matrix scenario; wave and adjoint wave
functions, Lax and Zakharov-Shabat equations, bilinear equations and discrete
flows --connected with Darboux transformations--. We generalize the integrable
flows of the Cafasso's matrix extension of the Toeplitz lattice for the
Verblunsky coefficients of Szeg\H{o} polynomials. An analysis of the Miwa
shifts allows for the finding of interesting connections between
Christoffel--Darboux kernels and Miwa shifts of the matrix orthogonal Laurent
polynomials.
