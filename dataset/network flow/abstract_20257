Non-perturbative renormalization group approach to the dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking is an effective method which can accommodate beyond the
ladder (mean filed) approximation. The usual method relying on the field
operator expansion suffers explosive behaviors of the 4-fermi coupling
constant, which prevent us from evaluating the physical quantities in the
broken phase. In order to overcome this difficulty, we solve the flow equation
directly as a partial differential equation and calculate the dynamical mass
and the chiral condensates. Also we formulate a beyond the ladder equation and
it gives almost gauge independent results for the chiral condensates.
