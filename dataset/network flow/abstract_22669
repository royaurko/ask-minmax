Given a specific spectra of the single-particle reduced density matrices of
three qubits, the singular symplectic reduction method is applied to the
projective Hilbert space of tripartite pure states, under the local unitary
group action. The symplectic structure on the principal stratum of the
symplectic quotient is obtained. A criterion from which the elements of the
local normal model of the principal stratum can be constructed up to an
equivalence relation and also the components of the reduced Hamiltonian
dynamics on it are investigated. It is discussed that other lower dimensional
strata are isolated points and so they are the fixed points of every reduced
Hamiltonian flow, i.e. relative equilibria on the original manifold.
