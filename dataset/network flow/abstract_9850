In the AdS/CFT correspondence motion in the radial direction of the AdS space
is identified with renormalization group flow in the field theory. For the N=4
Yang-Mills theory this motion is trivial. More interesting examples of
renormalization group flow occur when the N=4 theory is deformed. Aspects of
the flows are discussed for the N=4 theory on its moduli space, and deformed to
N=2 in the infra-red within the context of 5d SUGRA. 10d lifts and brane
probing are crucial tools for linking the spacetime backgrounds to the dual
field theory.
