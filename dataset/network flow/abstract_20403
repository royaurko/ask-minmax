Optimized DC magnetron sputtering system for the deposition of transparent
conductive oxides (TCOs), such indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass substrate has
been applied in order to achieve low-emitting (low-e) transparent coatings. To
obtain the concerned electrical resistance and high infrared reflection, first
the effect of applied sputtering power then oxygen flow on the properties of
films have been investigated. The other depositions parameters are kept
constant. Film deposition at at temperature 400 degree of Celsius in oxygen
flow of 3 Standard Cubic Centimeters per Minute results in transparent and
infrared reflecting coatings. Under this condition the highest attained average
reflectance in the infrared is ({\lambda}=3-25 micron) 89.5% (lowest emittance
equals to less than 11%), whereas transparency in the visible is 85%
approximately. Plasma wavelength and carrier concentration was measured.
