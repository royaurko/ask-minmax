Galled trees, evolutionary networks with isolated reticulation cycles, have
appeared under several slightly different definitions in the literature. In
this paper we establish the actual relationships between the main four such
alternative definitions: namely, the original galled trees, level-1 networks,
nested networks with nesting depth 1, and evolutionary networks with
arc-disjoint reticulation cycles.
