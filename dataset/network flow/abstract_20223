Currently used model of spherical accretion onto a magnetized rotating
neutron star encounters major difficulties in explaining the entry rate of
accreting material into the stellar field and spin evolution of long-period
X-ray pulsars. These difficulties can be, however, avoided if the magnetic
field of the material captured by the neutron star is incorporated into the
model. The magnetic field of the flow itself under certain conditions controls
the accretion process and significantly affects the parameters of the accreting
material. The mode by which the accretion flow enters the stellar magnetosphere
in that case can be associated with Bohm (or turbulent) diffusion and the
torque applied to the neutron star appears to be substantially higher than that
evaluated in the non-magnetized accretion scenario.
