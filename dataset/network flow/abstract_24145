In paddy field, monitoring soil moisture is required for irrigation
scheduling and water resource allocation, management and planning. The current
study proposes an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model to estimate soil
moisture in paddy field with limited meteorological data. Dynamic of ANN model
was adopted to estimate soil moisture with the inputs of reference
evapotranspiration (ETo) and precipitation. ETo was firstly estimated using the
maximum, average and minimum values of air temperature as the inputs of model.
The models were performed under different weather conditions between the two
paddy cultivation periods. Training process of model was carried out using the
observation data in the first period, while validation process was conducted
based on the observation data in the second period. Dynamic of ANN model
estimated soil moisture with R2 values of 0.80 and 0.73 for training and
validation processes, respectively, indicated that tight linear correlations
between observed and estimated values of soil moisture were observed. Thus, the
ANN model reliably estimates soil moisture with limited meteorological data.
