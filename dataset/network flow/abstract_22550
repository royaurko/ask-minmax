We study a simple stochastic differential equation that models the dispersion
of close heavy particles moving in a turbulent flow. In one and two dimensions,
the model is closely related to the one-dimensional stationary Schroedinger
equation in a random delta-correlated potential. The ergodic properties of the
dispersion process are investigated by proving that its generator is
hypoelliptic and using control theory.
