Due to the development of information and communication technologies, it is
difficult to handle the billions of connected machines. In this paper, to cope
with the problem, we introduce machine social networks, where they freely
follow each other and share common interests with their neighbors. We classify
characteristics and describe required functionalities of socially connected
machines. We also illustrate two examples; a twit-bot and maze scenario.
