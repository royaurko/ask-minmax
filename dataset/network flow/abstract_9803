Anticipation in traffic means that drivers estimate their leaders' velocities
for future timesteps. In the article a specific stochastic car--following model
with non--unique flow--density relation is investigated with respect to
anticipatory driving. It is realized by next--nearest--neighbour interaction
which leads to large flows and short temporal headways. The underlying
mechanism that causes these effects is explained by the headways of the cars
which organize in an alternating structure with a short headway following a
long one, thereby producing a strong anti-correlation in the gaps or in the
headways of subsequent cars. For the investigated model the corresponding time
headway distributions display the short headways observed in reality. Even
though these effects are discussed for a specific model, the mechanism
described is in general present in any traffic flow models that work with
anticipation.
