The real and imaginary part of any Abelian differential on a compact Riemann
surface define two flows on the underlying compact orientable $C^\infty$
surface. Furthermore, these flows induce an interval exchange transformation on
every transversal simple closed curve, via Poincar\'e recurrence. This note
shows that the ordered $K_0$ groups of several $C^\ast$ algebras naturally
associated to one of the flows resp. interval exchange transformations are
isomorphic, mainly using methods of I. Putnam.
