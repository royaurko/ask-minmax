The paper establishes a version of the Hopf boundary point lemma for sections
of a vector bundle over a manifold with boundary. This result may be viewed as
a counterpart to the tensor maximum principle obtained by R. Hamilton in 1986.
Potential applications include the study of various geometric flows and the
construction of invariant sets for geometric boundary value problems.
