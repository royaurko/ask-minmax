The Gilbert-Steiner problem is a mass transportation problem, where the cost
of the transportation depends on the network used to move the mass and it is
proportional to a certain power of the "flow". In this paper, we introduce a
new formulation of the problem, which turns it into the minimization of a
convex functional in a class of currents with coefficients in a group. This
framework allows us to define calibrations, which can be used to prove the
optimality of concrete configurations. We apply this technique to prove the
optimality of a certain irrigation network, having the topological property
mentioned in the title.
