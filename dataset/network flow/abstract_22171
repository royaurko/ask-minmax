We study Hamiltonian difference schemes for scalar conservation laws with
monotone flux function and establish the existence of a three-parameter family
of periodic travelling waves (wavetrains). The proof is based on an integral
equation for the dual wave profile and employs constrained maximization as well
as the invariance properties of a gradient flow. We also discuss the
approximation of wavetrains and present some numerical results.
