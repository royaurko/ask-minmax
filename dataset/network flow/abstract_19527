We present a simple, sophisticated method to capture renormalization group
flow in Monte Carlo simulation, which provides important information of
critical phenomena. We applied the method to $D=3,4$ lattice $\phi^4$ model and
obtained renormalization flow diagram which well reproduces theoretically
predicted behavior of continuum $\phi^4$ model. We also show that the method
can be easily applied to much more complicated models, such as frustrated spin
models.
