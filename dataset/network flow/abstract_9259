Study of the cluster- or community structure of complex networks makes an
important contribution to the understanding of networks at a functional level.
Despite the many efforts, no definition of community has been agreed on and
important aspects such as the statistical significance and theoretical limits
of community detection are not well understood. We show how the problem of
community detection can be mapped onto finding the ground state of an infinite
range spin glass. The ground state energy then corresponds directly to the
quality of the partition. The network modularity Q previously defined by Girvan
and Newman [Phys. Rev. E, 69, 026113 (2004)] turns out to be a special case of
this spin glass energy. Through this spin glass analogy, we are able to give
expectation values for the modularity of random graphs that can be used in the
assessment of the statistical significance of real network clusterings.
Further, it allows for assessing the theoretical limits of community detection.
