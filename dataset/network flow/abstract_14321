In many simulations of high-energy heavy-ion collisions on an event-by-event
analysis, it is known that the initial energy density distribution in the
transverse plane is highly fluctuating. Subsequent longitudinal expansion will
lead to many longitudinal tubes of quark-gluon plasma which have tendencies to
break up into many spherical droplets because of sausage instabilities. We are
therefore motivated to use a model of quark-gluon plasma granular droplets that
evolve hydrodynamically to investigate pion elliptic flows and
Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometry. We find that the data of pion transverse
momentum spectra, elliptic flows, and HBT radii in \sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV Au +
Au collisions at RHIC can be described well by an expanding source of granular
droplets with an anisotropic velocity distribution.
