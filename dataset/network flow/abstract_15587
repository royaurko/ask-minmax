In this paper, we propose a distributed interference and channel-aware
opportunistic access control technique for D2D underlaid cellular networks, in
which each potential D2D link is active whenever its estimated
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is above a predetermined threshold so as to
maximize the D2D area spectral efficiency. The objective of our SIR-aware
opportunistic access scheme is to provide sufficient coverage probability and
to increase the aggregate rate of D2D links by harnessing interference caused
by dense underlaid D2D users using an adaptive decision activation threshold.
We determine the optimum D2D activation probability and threshold, building on
analytical expressions for the coverage probabilities and area spectral
efficiency of D2D links derived using stochastic geometry. Specifically, we
provide two expressions for the optimal SIR threshold, which can be applied in
a decentralized way on each D2D link, so as to maximize the D2D area spectral
efficiency derived using the unconditional and conditional D2D success
probability respectively. Simulation results in different network settings show
the performance gains of both SIR-aware threshold scheduling methods in terms
of D2D link coverage probability, area spectral efficiency, and average sum
rate compared to existing channel-aware access schemes.
