Dissipations, e.g. heat flow and bulk and shear viscosities, cause the
transport of energy, momentum and angular momentum, which is the essence of
accretion of matters onto celestial objects. Dissipations are usually described
by the Fourier and Navier-Stokes laws ("classic laws" of dissipations). However
the classic laws result in an infinitely fast propagation of dissipations. In
relativistic formulation, the classic laws of dissipations violate the
causality, and hence no relativistic theory of accretion flow onto celestial
object is formulated. In this short report, we summarize the causal dissipative
hydrodynamics, so-called "Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics" (EIT), with a
supplemental comment of which the original works of EIT are not aware, and then
show two theorems about relativistic dissipative flows around a Schwarzschild
black hole. By these theorems, a significant property of EIT in contrast with
classic laws of dissipations is clarified, and a dissipative instability of an
exact solution of relativistic perfect fluid flow is also obtained.
