Wireless Ad-hoc network is generally employed in military and emergencies due
to its flexibility and easy-to-use. It's suitable for military wireless network
that has the characteristics of mobility and works effectively under severe
environment and electromagnetic interfering conditions. However, military
network cannot benefit from existing routing protocol directly; there exists
quite many features which are only typical for military network. This paper
presents a new metric for routing, which is employed in A* algorithm. The goal
of the metric is to choose a route of less distance and less transmission delay
between a source and a destination. Our metric is a function of the distance
between the ends and the bandwidth over the link. Moreover, we take frequency
selection into account since a node can work on multi-frequencies. This paper
proposed the new metric, and experimented it based on A* algorithm. The
simulation results show that this metric can find the optimal route which has
less transmission delay compared to the shortest path routing.
