We present the SALT spectroscopy of a globular cluster in the center of the
nearby isolated dSph galaxy KKs3 situated at a distance of 2.12 Mpc. Its
heliocentric radial velocity is 316+-7 km/s that corresponds to V_{LG} = 112
km/s in the Local Group (LG) reference frame. We use its distance and velocity
along with the data on other 35 field galaxies in the proximity of the LG to
trace the local Hubble flow. Some basic properties of the local field galaxies:
their morphology, absolute magnitudes, average surface brightnesses, specific
star formation rates, and hydrogen mass-to-stellar mass ratios are briefly
discussed. Surprisingly, the sample of the neighboring isolated galaxies
displays no signs of compression under the influence of the expanding Local
Void.
