The classical Helmholtz problem is applied for modelling the axisymmetric
inviscid cusp-ended separated flow around a sphere. Two coordinate systems are
employed: polar for initial calculations and parabolic the latter being more
suitable for investigation of infinitely-long stagnation zones. Scaled
coordinates are introduced and difference schemes for the free-stream equation
and the Bernoulli integral are devised. The separation point is not initially
prescribed and is defined iteratively. A separated flow with vanishing drag
coefficient is obtained.
