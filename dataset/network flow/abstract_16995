The noisy-or and its generalization noisy-max have been utilized to reduce
the complexity of knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we present a new
representation of noisy-max that allows for efficient inference in general
Bayesian networks. Empirical studies show that our method is capable of
computing queries in well-known large medical networks, QMR-DT and CPCS, for
which no previous exact inference method has been shown to perform well.
