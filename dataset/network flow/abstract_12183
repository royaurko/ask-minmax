Mat\'ern hard core processes of types I and II are the point processes of
choice to model concurrent transmitters in CSMA networks. We determine the mean
interference observed at a node of the process and compare it with the mean
interference in a Poisson point process of the same density. It turns out that
despite the similarity of the two models, they behave rather differently. For
type I, the excess interference (relative to the Poisson case) increases
exponentially in the hard-core distance, while for type II, the gap never
exceeds 1 dB.
