We show that flows of pure electromagnetic energy are subject to
instabilities familiar from hydrodynamics and plasma physics---Kelvin-Helmholtz
and screw instabilities. In the framework of force-free electrodynamics, it is
found that electric-like tangential discontinuities are
Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable. All non-trivial cylindrically symmetrical magnetic
configurations are screw-unstable. The Poynting jet of the Goldreich-Julian
pulsar is screw-unstable if the current density in the polar cap region exceeds
the charge density times the speed of light. This may be the process that
determines the pulsar luminosity.
