We uncover a vulnerability that allows for an attacker to perform an
email-based attack on selected victims, using only standard scripts and agents.
What differentiates the attack we describe from other, already known forms of
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is that an attacker does not need
to infiltrate the network in any manner -- as is normally required to launch a
DDoS attack. Thus, we see this type of attack as a poor man's DDoS. Not only is
the attack easy to mount, but it is also almost impossible to trace back to the
perpetrator. Along with descriptions of our attack, we demonstrate its
destructive potential with (limited and contained) experimental results. We
illustrate the potential impact of our attack by describing how an attacker can
disable an email account by flooding its inbox; block competition during
on-line auctions; harm competitors with an on-line presence; disrupt phone
service to a given victim; cheat in SMS-based games; disconnect mobile
corporate leaders from their networks; and disrupt electronic elections.
Finally, we propose a set of countermeasures that are light-weight, do not
require modifications to the infrastructure, and can be deployed in a gradual
manner.
