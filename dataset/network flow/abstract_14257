The problem of the spreading of a granular mass released at the top of a
rough inclined plane was investigated. We experimentally measure the evolution
of the avalanche from the initiation up to the deposit using a Moir\'e image
processing technique. The results are quantitatively compared with the
prediction of an hydrodynamic model based on depth averaged equations. In the
model, the interaction between the flowing layer and the rough bottom is
described by a non trivial friction force whose expression is derived from
measurements on steady uniform flows. We show that the spreading of the mass is
quantitatively predicted by the model when the mass is released on a plane free
of particles. When an avalanche is triggered on an initially static layer, the
model fails in quantitatively predicting the propagation but qualitatively
captures the evolution.
