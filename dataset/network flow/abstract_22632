This paper introduces Dexpler, a software package which converts Dalvik
bytecode to Jimple. Dexpler is built on top of Dedexer and Soot. As Jimple is
Soot's main internal rep- resentation of code, the Dalvik bytecode can be
manipu- lated with any Jimple based tool, for instance for performing point-to
or flow analysis.
