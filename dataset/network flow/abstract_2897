Network coding is a recently proposed method for transmitting data, which has
been shown to have potential to improve wireless network performance. We study
network coding for one specific case of multicast, broadcasting, from one
source to all nodes of the network. We use network coding as a loss tolerant,
energy-efficient, method for broadcast. Our emphasis is on mobile networks. Our
contribution is the proposal of DRAGONCAST, a protocol to perform network
coding in such a dynamically evolving environment. It is based on three
building blocks: a method to permit real-time decoding of network coding, a
method to adjust the network coding transmission rates, and a method for
ensuring the termination of the broadcast. The performance and behavior of the
method are explored experimentally by simulations; they illustrate the
excellent performance of the protocol.
