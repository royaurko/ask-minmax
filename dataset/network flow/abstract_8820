We model two temperature viscous accretion flows in the sub-Keplerian,
optically thin, regime around rotating black holes including important
radiation effects self-consistently. The model successfully explains observed
luminosities from ultra-luminous to under-luminous sources and predicts the
spin parameter of black holes.
