One of the most significant threats faced by enterprise networks today is
from Bots. A Bot is a program that operates as an agent for a user and runs
automated tasks over the internet, at a much higher rate than would be possible
for a human alone. A collection of Bots in a network, used for malicious
purposes is referred to as a Botnet. Bot attacks can range from localized
attacks like key-logging to network intensive attacks like Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS). In this paper, we suggest a novel approach that can detect
and combat Bots. The proposed solution adopts a two pronged strategy which we
have classified into the standalone algorithm and the network algorithm. The
standalone algorithm runs independently on each node of the network. It
monitors the active processes on the node and tries to identify Bot processes
using parameters such as response time and output to input traffic ratio. If a
suspicious process has been identified the network algorithm is triggered. The
network algorithm will then analyze conversations to and from the hosts of the
network using the transport layer flow records. It then tries to deduce the Bot
pattern as well as Bot signatures which can subsequently be used by the
standalone algorithm to thwart Bot processes at their very onset.
