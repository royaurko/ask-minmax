We review the influence of micromechanical parameters on the macroscopic
mechanical behaviour of granular materials, as numerically simulated in
discrete element approaches, both in quasistatic conditions an din dense flow.
We insist in particular on the role of suitably defined dimensionless numbers
apt to provide a classification of rheological regimes of quite general
validity.
