Parapatric speciation is studied using an individual--based model with sexual
reproduction. We combine the theory of mutation accumulation for biological
ageing with an environmental selection pressure that varies according to the
individuals geographical positions and phenotypic traits. Fluctuations and
genetic diversity of large populations are crucial ingredients to model the
features of evolutionary branching and are intrinsic properties of the model.
Its implementation on a spatial lattice gives interesting insights into the
population dynamics of speciation on a geographical landscape and the
disruptive selection that leads to the divergence of phenotypes. Our results
suggest that assortative mating is not an obligatory ingredient to obtain
speciation in large populations at low gene flow.
