We consider a simple but generic model of gravity where Weyl--invariance is
realized thanks to the presence of a gauge field for dilatations. We quantize
the theory by suitably defining renormalization group flows that describe the
integration of successive momentum shells, in such a way that Weyl--invariance
is maintained in the flow. When the gauge fields are massless the theory has,
in addition to Weyl invariance, an abelian gauge symmetry. According to the
definition of the cutoff, the flow can break or preserve this extended
symmetry. We discuss the fixed points of these flows.
