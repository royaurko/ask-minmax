The random walk is fundamental to modeling dynamic processes on networks.
Metrics based on the random walk have been used in many applications from image
processing to Web page ranking. However, how appropriate are random walks to
modeling and analyzing social networks? We argue that unlike a random walk,
which conserves the quantity diffusing on a network, many interesting social
phenomena, such as the spread of information or disease on a social network,
are fundamentally non-conservative. When an individual infects her neighbor
with a virus, the total amount of infection increases. We classify diffusion
processes as conservative and non-conservative and show how these differences
impact the choice of metrics used for network analysis, as well as our
understanding of network structure and behavior. We show that Alpha-Centrality,
which mathematically describes non-conservative diffusion, leads to new
insights into the behavior of spreading processes on networks. We give a
scalable approximate algorithm for computing the Alpha-Centrality in a massive
graph. We validate our approach on real-world online social networks of Digg.
We show that a non-conservative metric, such as Alpha-Centrality, produces
better agreement with empirical measure of influence than conservative metrics,
such as PageRank. We hope that our investigation will inspire further
exploration into the realms of conservative and non-conservative metrics in
social network analysis.
