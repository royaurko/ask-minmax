The purpose of research was to check up the influence of decrease of
nonequality of ventilating (after bronchodilator (berotec) inhalation (BI)) on
the magnitude of dynamic compliance of lungs (Cdyn) at asthma patients with
ventilating infringements. Methods and materials: 20 patients (with 2 and 3
degrees of ventilating infringements (VC<73%, FEV1<51%, MVV<56%), without
restrictive disease of lungs, suffering from bronchial asthma were studied
before and after BI by plotting volume, rate flow, against the transpulmonare
pressure. About the change of nonequality of ventilating we consider by the
change after BI of Cdyn, Cdyn at once after flow interruption (Cdyn1), tissue
resistance at inhalation (Rti in) and exhalation (Rti ex), parameters of
ventilating and general parameters of respiratory mechanics. Results: the
parameters of ventilating were improved (P < 0,05). General parameters of
respiratory mechanics also improved. Rti in and Rti ex are made 0,48+0,16;
1,05+0,25 kPa/l/s before BI and decreased 0,09+0,04; 0,28+0,09 kPa/l/s after BI
(P < 0,05; P < 0,05). But Cdyn and Cdyn1 are not changed after BI. Conclusions:
1. The decrease of ventilation nonequality and tissue friction after BI do not
influence on the initially reduced dynamic compliance of lungs at asthma
patients without any restrictive diseases of lungs. 2. The cause of not
increasing of dynamic compliance after BI probably due by changes in elastic
component of parenchyma of lungs, insensitive to berotec.
