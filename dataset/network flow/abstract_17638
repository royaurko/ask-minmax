We have measured the resistance noise of copper metallic wires during a
tensile stress. The time variation of the main resistance is continuous up to
the wire breakdown, but its fluctuations reveal the intermittent and
heterogeneous character of plastic flow. We show in particular direct
correlations between strengthening mechanisms and noise spectra
characteristics.
