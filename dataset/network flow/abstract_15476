We address the question to what extent the success of scientific articles is
due to social influence. Analyzing a data set of over 100000 publications from
the field of Computer Science, we study how centrality in the cocontributorship
network differs between contributors who have highly cited papers and those who do
not. We further show that a machine learning classifier, based only on
cocontributorship network centrality measures at time of publication, is able to
predict with high precision whether an article will be highly cited five years
after publication. By this we provide quantitative insight into the social
dimension of scientific publishing - challenging the perception of citations as
an objective, socially unbiased measure of scientific success.
