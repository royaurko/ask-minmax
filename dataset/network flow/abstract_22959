In the preceding paper (cond-mat/0405252), we have conjectured that the main
transport properties of a dilute gas of inelastic hard spheres (IHS) can be
satisfactorily captured by an equivalent gas of elastic hard spheres (EHS),
provided that the latter are under the action of an effective drag force and
their collision rate is reduced by a factor $(1+\alpha)/2$ (where $\alpha$ is
the constant coefficient of normal restitution). In this paper we test the
above expectation in a paradigmatic nonequilibrium state, namely the simple or
uniform shear flow, by performing Monte Carlo computer simulations of the
Boltzmann equation for both classes of dissipative gases with a dissipation
range $0.5\leq \alpha\leq 0.95$ and two values of the imposed shear rate $a$.
The distortion of the steady-state velocity distribution from the local
equilibrium state is measured by the shear stress, the normal stress
differences, the cooling rate, the fourth and sixth cumulants, and the shape of
the distribution itself. In particular, the simulation results seem to be
consistent with an exponential overpopulation of the high-velocity tail. The
EHS results are in general hardly distinguishable from the IHS ones if
$\alpha\gtrsim 0.7$, so that the distinct signature of the IHS gas (higher
anisotropy and overpopulation) only manifests itself at relatively high
dissipations
