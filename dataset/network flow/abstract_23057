The pressure-volume-temperature equation of state of the intermetallic
compound NiAl was calculated theoretically, and compared with experimental
measurements. Electron ground states were calculated for NiAl in the CsCl
structure, using density functional theory, and were used to predict the cold
compression curve and the density of phonon states. The Rose form of
compression curve was found to reproduce the ab initio calculations well in
compression but exhibited significant deviations in expansion. A
thermodynamically-complete equation of state was constructed for NiAl. Shock
waves were induced in crystals of NiAl by the impact of laser-launched Cu
flyers and by launching NiAl flyers into transparent windows of known
properties. The TRIDENT laser was used to accelerate the flyers to speeds
between 100 and 600m/s. Point and line-imaging laser Doppler velocimetry was
used to measure the acceleration of the flyer and the surface velocity history
of the target. The velocity histories were used to deduce the stress state, and
hence states on the principal Hugoniot and the flow stress. Flyers and targets
were recovered from most experiments. The effect of elasticity and plastic flow
in the sample and window was assessed. The ambient isotherm reproduced static
compression data very well, and the predicted Hugoniot was consistent with
shock compression data.
