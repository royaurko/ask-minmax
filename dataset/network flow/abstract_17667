We consider the linearized 2D inviscid shallow water equations in a
rectangle. A set of boundary conditions is proposed which make these equations
well-posed. Several different cases occur depending on the relative values of
the reference velocities $(u_0,v_0)$ and reference height $\phi_0$ (sub- or
super-critical flow at each part of the boundary).
