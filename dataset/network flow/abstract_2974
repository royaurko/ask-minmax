We consider the queuing networks, which are made from servers, exchanging
their positions. The customers, using the network, try to reach their
destinations, which is complicated by the movements of the servers, taking
their customers with them, while they wait for the service. We develop the
general theory of such networks, and we establish the convergence of the
symmetrized version of the network to the Non-Linear Markov Process.
