The public sector comprises government agencies, ministries, education
institutions, health providers and other types of government, commercial and
not-for-profit organisations. Unlike commercial enterprises, this environment
is highly heterogeneous in all aspects. This forms a complex network which is
not always optimised. A lack of optimisation and communication hinders
information sharing between the network nodes limiting the flow of information.
Another limiting aspect is privacy of personal information and security of
operations of some nodes or segments of the network. Attempts to reorganise the
network or improve communications to make more information available for
sharing and analysis may be hindered or completely halted by public concerns
over privacy, political agendas, social and technological barriers. This paper
discusses a technical solution for information sharing while addressing the
privacy concerns with no need for reorganisation of the existing public sector
infrastructure . The solution is based on imposing an additional layer of
Intelligent Software Agents and Knowledge Bases for data mining and analysis.
