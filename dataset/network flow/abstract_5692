In a class of methods for measurement of available path capacity and other
capacity-related metrics in a network, trains of probe packets are transmitted
from a sender to a receiver across a network path, and the sequences of time
stamps at sending and reception are analyzed. In large-scale implementations
there may potentially be interference between the probe-packet trains
corresponding to several concurrent measurement sessions, due to congestion in
the network and common measurement end points.
  This paper outlines principles for large-scale deployments of network
capacity measurement methods using standardized network functionality. Further,
the paper provides an in-depth study of dimensioning and scalability challenges
related to the measurement end-points of such systems.
  The main result is a framework for dimensioning of large-scale network
capacity measurement systems based on TWAMP. The framework is based on a method
for explicit calculation of queuelength and waiting-time distributions, where
results from M/G/1 queuing theory are combined with Monte Carlo integration.
