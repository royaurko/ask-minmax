At the same time as the emergence of multimedia in mobile Ad hoc networks,
research for the introduction of the quality of service (QoS) has received much
attention. However, when designing a QoS solution, the estimation of the
available resources still represents one of the main issues. This paper
suggests an approach to estimate available resources on a node. This approach
is based on the estimation of the busy ratio of the shared canal. We consider
in our estimation the several constraints related to the Ad hoc transmission
mode such as Interference phenomena. This approach is implemented on the AODV
routing protocol. We call AODVwithQOS our new routing protocol. We also
performed a performance evaluation by simulations using NS2 simulator. The
results confirm that AODVwithQoS provides QoS support in ad hoc wireless
networks with good performance and low overhead.
