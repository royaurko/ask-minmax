The purpose of this paper is to formally specify a flow devoted to the design
of Differential Power Analysis (DPA) resistant QDI asynchronous circuits. The
paper first proposes a formal modeling of the electrical signature of QDI
asynchronous circuits. The DPA is then applied to the formal model in order to
identify the source of leakage of this type of circuits. Finally, a complete
design flow is specified to minimize the information leakage. The relevancy and
efficiency of the approach is demonstrated using the design of an AES
crypto-processor.
