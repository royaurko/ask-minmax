A classic experiment by Milgram shows that individuals can route messages
along short paths in social networks, given only simple categorical information
about recipients (such as "he is a prominent lawyer in Boston" or "she is a
Freshman sociology major at Harvard"). That is, these networks have very short
paths between pairs of nodes (the so-called small-world phenomenon); moreover,
participants are able to route messages along these paths even though each
person is only aware of a small part of the network topology. Some sociologists
conjecture that participants in such scenarios use a greedy routing strategy in
which they forward messages to acquaintances that have more categories in
common with the recipient than they do, and similar strategies have recently
been proposed for routing messages in dynamic ad-hoc networks of mobile
devices. In this paper, we introduce a network property called membership
dimension, which characterizes the cognitive load required to maintain
relationships between participants and categories in a social network. We show
that any connected network has a system of categories that will support greedy
routing, but that these categories can be made to have small membership
dimension if and only if the underlying network exhibits the small-world
phenomenon.
