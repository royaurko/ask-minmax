This limited review is intended as an introduction to the fast growing
subject of mathematical modelling of cell metabolism and its biochemical
pathways, and more precisely on pathways linked to apoptosis of cancerous
cells. Some basic mathematical models of chemical kinetics, with emphasis on
stochastic models, are presented.
