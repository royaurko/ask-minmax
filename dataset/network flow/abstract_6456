Recent collapses of SIP servers in the carrier networks indicates two
potential problems of SIP: (1) the current SIP design does not easily scale up
to large network sizes, and (2) the built-in SIP overload control mechanism
cannot handle overload conditions effectively. In order to help carriers
prevent widespread SIP network failure effectively, this chapter presents a
systematic investigation of current state-of-the-art overload control
algorithms. To achieve this goal, this chapter first reviews two basic
mechanisms of SIP, and summarizes numerous experiment results reported in the
literatures which demonstrate the impact of overload on SIP networks. After
surveying the approaches for modeling the dynamic behaviour of SIP networks
experiencing overload, the chapter presents a comparison and assessment of
different types of SIP overload control solutions. Finally it outlines some
research opportunities for managing SIP overload control.
