We develop a simple model for a self-gravitating spherically symmetric
relativistic star which begins to collapse from an initially static
configuration by dissipating energy in the form of radial heat flow. We utilize
the model to show how local anisotropy effects the collapse rate and thermal
behaviour of gravitationally evolving systems.
