The Axial Magnetic Effect is the generation of an equilibrium dissipationless
energy flow of chiral fermions in the direction of the axial (chiral) magnetic
field. At finite temperature the dissipationless energy transfer may be
realized in the absence of any chemical potentials. We numerically study the
temperature behavior of the Axial Magnetic Effect in quenched SU(2) lattice
gauge theory. We show that in the confinement (hadron) phase the effect is
absent. In the deconfinement transition region the conductivity quickly
increases, reaching the asymptotic $T^2$ behavior in a deep deconfinement
(plasma) phase. Apart from an overall proportionality factor, our results
qualitatively agree with theoretical predictions for the behavior of the energy
flow as a function of temperature and strength of the axial magnetic field.
