Let $G$ be a Lie group and $\Gamma$ be a lattice of $G$, i.e., $G/\Gamma$
admits a finite $G$-invariant measure. We consider the left actions of SO(n,1)
on $G/\Gamma$. For a compact segment of analytic curve on SO(n,1) $\phi: I ->
SO(n,1)$ and $x = g\Gamma \in G/\Gamma$, $\phi(I)x$ gives a curve in the space,
we assume that the orbit SO(n,1)x is dense in $G/\Gamma$. In this article, we
consider the limit distributions of such curves under geodesic flow. Since
SO(n,1)/SO(n-1) can be identified as the unit tangent bundle of the universal
hyperbolic $n$-space, and there is a visual map sending every point in the unit
bundle to the ideal boundary sphere of hyperbolic space. It is shown that if
the visual map doesn't send the curve into a proper subsphere of the ideal
boundary, then under geodesic flow the orbit $\phi(I)x$ gets asymptotically
equidistributed on $G/\Gamma$. This problem was proposed by Nimish Shah in one
of his paper and is a generalization of the main result in that paper. The
proof borrows the main technique from that paper but needs some new
observations on the representations of SL(2,R).
