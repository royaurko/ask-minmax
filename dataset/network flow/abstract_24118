On roads showing significant violations of posted speed limits, one measure
of the safety effect of speeding is the difference between the road's actual
accident count and the count that would have occurred if the posted speed limit
had been strictly obeyed. An estimate of this accident reduction can be had by
computing the probability that speeding was a necessary condition for each of
set of accidents. This is an instance of assessing individual probabilities of
causation, which is generally not possible absent prior knowledge of causal
structure. For traffic accidents such prior knowledge is often available and
this paper illustrates how, for a commonly occurring class of
vehicle/pedestrian accidents, approaches to uncertainty and causal analyses
appearing in the accident reconstruction literature can be unified using
Bayesian networks. Measured skidmarks, pedestrian throw distances, and
pedestrian injury severity are treated as evidence, and using the Gibbs
Sampling routine BUGS, the posterior probability distribution over exogenous
variables, such as the vehicle's initial speed, location, and driver reaction
time, is computed. This posterior distribution is then used to compute the
"probability of necessity" for speeding.
