Expanding the ordinary Dirac's equation,
$\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial
t}+\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{\nabla}\psi+\frac{imc\beta}{\hbar }\psi=0$, in
quaternionic form yielded Maxwell-like field equations. As in the Maxwell's
formulation, the particle fields are represented by a scalar, $\psi_0$ and a
vector $\vec{\psi}$. The analogy with Maxwell's equations requires that the
inertial fields are $\vec{E}_D=c^2\vec{\alpha}\times\vec{\psi}$, and
$\vec{B}_D=\vec{\alpha}\,\psi_0+c\beta\,\vec{\psi}$ and that
$\psi_0=-c\beta\,\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{\psi}$. An alternative solution suggests
that magnetic monopole-like behaviour accompanies Dirac's field. In this
formulation a field-like representation of Dirac's particle is derived. It is
shown that when the vector field of the particle, $\vec{\psi}$, is normal to
the vector $\vec{\alpha}$, Dirac's field represents a medium with maximal
conductivity. The energy flux (Poynting vector) of the Dirac's fields is found
to flow in opposite direction to the particle's motion. A system of equivalent
symmetrised Maxwell's equations is introduced. A longitudinal (scalar) wave
traveling at speed of light is found to accompany magnetic charges flow. This
wave is not affected by presence of electric charges and currents.
