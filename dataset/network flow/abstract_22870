Contacting a bilayer ferromagnet with a singlet even-frequency superconductor
allows for the realization of an effective triplet odd-frequency
superconductor. In this work, we investigate the Josephson effect between
superconductors with different symmetries (e.g. odd- versus even-frequency). In
particular, we study the supercurrent flowing between two triplet odd-frequency
superconducting leads through a weak singlet even-frequency superconductor. We
show that the peculiar temperature dependence of the critical current below the
superconducting transition of the weak superconductor is a signature of the
competition between odd/odd-frequency and odd/even-frequency Josephson
couplings.
