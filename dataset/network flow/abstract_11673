Human conflict, geopolitical crises, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters
can turn large parts of energy distribution networks offline. Europe's current
gas supply network is largely dependent on deliveries from Russia and North
Africa, creating vulnerabililties to social and political instabilities. During
crises, less delivery may mean greater congestion, as the pipeline network is
used in ways it has not been designed for. Given the importance of the security
of natural gas supply, we develop a model to handle network congestion on
various geographical scales. We offer a resilient response strategy to energy
shortages and quantify its effectiveness for a variety of relevant scenarios.
In essence, Europe's gas supply can be made robust even to major supply
disruptions, if a fair distribution strategy is applied.
