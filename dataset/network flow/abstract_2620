Two finite volume methods are derived and applied to the solution of problems
of incompressible flow. In particular, external inviscid flows and
boundary-layer flows are examined. The firstmethod analyzed is a cell-centered
finite volume scheme. It is shown to be formally first order accurate on
equilateral triangles and used to calculate inviscid flow over an airfoil. The
second method is a vertex-centered least-squares method and is second order
accurate. It's quality is investigated for several types of inviscid flow
problems and to solve Prandtl's boundary-layer equations over a flat plate.
Future improvements and extensions of the method are discussed.
