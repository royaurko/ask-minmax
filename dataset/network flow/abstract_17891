Facial Action Coding System consists of 44 action units (AUs) and more than
7000 combinations. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) classifier has been used
successfully to recognize facial action units (AUs) and expressions due to its
ability to deal with AU dynamics. However, a separate HMM is necessary for each
single AU and each AU combination. Since combinations of AU numbering in
thousands, a more efficient method will be needed. In this paper an accurate
real-time sequence-based system for representation and recognition of facial
AUs is presented. Our system has the following characteristics: 1) employing a
mixture of HMMs and neural network, we develop a novel accurate classifier,
which can deal with AU dynamics, recognize subtle changes, and it is also
robust to intensity variations, 2) although we use an HMM for each single AU
only, by employing a neural network we can recognize each single and
combination AU, and 3) using both geometric and appearance-based features, and
applying efficient dimension reduction techniques, our system is robust to
illumination changes and it can represent the temporal information involved in
formation of the facial expressions. Extensive experiments on Cohn-Kanade
database show the superiority of the proposed method, in comparison with other
classifiers. Keywords: classifier design and evaluation, data fusion, facial
action units (AUs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), neural network (NN).
