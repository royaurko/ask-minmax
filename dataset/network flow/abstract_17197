In this paper we compare different types of recurrent units in recurrent
neural networks (RNNs). Especially, we focus on more sophisticated units that
implement a gating mechanism, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and
a recently proposed gated recurrent unit (GRU). We evaluate these recurrent
units on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling. Our
experiments revealed that these advanced recurrent units are indeed better than
more traditional recurrent units such as tanh units. Also, we found GRU to be
comparable to LSTM.
