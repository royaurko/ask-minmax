This paper is concerned with the existence of the simultaneous
route-and-departure choice dynamic user equilibrium (SRDC-DUE) in continuous
time. The SRDC-DUE problem was formulated as an infinite-dimensional
variational inequality in Friesz et al. (1993). In deriving our existence
result, we employ the generalized Vickrey model (GVM) introduced in Han et al.
(2012a, 2012b) to formulate the underlying network loading problem. As we
explain, the GVM corresponds to a path delay operator that is provably strongly
continuous on the Hilbert space of interest. Finally, we provide the desired
SRDC-DUE existence result for general constraints relating path flows to a
table of fixed trip volumes without invocation of a priori bounds on the path
flows.
