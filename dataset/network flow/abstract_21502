We study the boundary conditions at a fluid-solid interface using molecular
dynamics simulations covering a broad range of fluid-solid interactions and
fluid densities, and both simple and chain-molecule fluids. The slip length is
shown to be independent of the type of flow, but rather is related to the fluid
organization near the solid, as governed by the fluid-solid molecular
interactions.
