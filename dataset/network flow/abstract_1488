In this dissertation we develop a new formal graphical framework for causal
reasoning. Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated
graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical
perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for
describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic
structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric
monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways
of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of
reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations
of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these
variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing
concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we
shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps
provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a
category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category,
classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions.

collections, in $V$, and we include swaps as generating morphisms, subject to
the identities defining a symmetric monoidal category. (ii) Page 46: A causal
