The paper presents a new sampling methodology for Bayesian networks that
samples only a subset of variables and applies exact inference to the rest.
Cutset sampling is a network structure-exploiting application of the
Rao-Blackwellisation principle to sampling in Bayesian networks. It improves
convergence by exploiting memory-based inference algorithms. It can also be
viewed as an anytime approximation of the exact cutset-conditioning algorithm
developed by Pearl. Cutset sampling can be implemented efficiently when the
sampled variables constitute a loop-cutset of the Bayesian network and, more
generally, when the induced width of the networks graph conditioned on the
observed sampled variables is bounded by a constant w. We demonstrate
empirically the benefit of this scheme on a range of benchmarks.
