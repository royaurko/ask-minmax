In this paper, we consider the second-order consensus problem for networked
mechanical systems subjected to nonuniform communication delays, and the
mechanical systems are assumed to interact on a general directed topology. We
propose an adaptive controller plus a distributed velocity observer to realize
the objective of second-order consensus. It is shown that both the positions
and velocities of the mechanical agents synchronize, and furthermore, the
velocities of the mechanical agents converge to the scaled weighted average
value of their initial ones. We further demonstrate that the proposed
second-order consensus scheme can be used to solve the leader-follower
synchronization problem with a constant-velocity leader and under constant
communication delays. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the
performance of the proposed adaptive controllers.
