We use the Melnikov integral method to prove that the Hamiltonian flow on the
zero-energy manifold for the Kepler problem perturbed by a quadrupole moment is
chaotic, irrespective of the perturbation being of prolate or oblate type. This
result helps to elucidate some recent conflicting works in the physical
literature based on numerical simulations.
