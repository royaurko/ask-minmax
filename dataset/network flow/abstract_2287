We introduce the discrete Einstein metrics as critical points of discrete
energy on triangulated 3-manifolds, and study them by discrete curvature flow
of second (fourth) order. We also study the convergence of the discrete
curvature flow. Discrete curvature flow of second order is an analogue of
smooth Ricci flow.
