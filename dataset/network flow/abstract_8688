We present an exact nonperturbative flow equation for the average action for
quarks which incorporates the effects of gluon fluctuations. With suitable
truncations this allows one to compute effective multiquark interactions in
dependence on an infrared scale $k$. Our method amounts to integrating out the
gluons with momenta larger than $k$.
