We study the general Ericksen-Leslie system with non-constant density, which
describes the flow of nematic liquid crystal. In particular the model
investigated here is associated with Parodi's relation. We prove that: in two
dimension, the solutions are globally regular with general data; in three
dimension, the solutions are globally regular with small initial data, or for
short time with large data. Moreover, a weak-strong type of uniqueness result
is obtained.
