We study numerically the variability of the outbreak of diseases on complex
networks. We use a SI model to simulate the disease spreading at short times,
in homogeneous and in scale-free networks. In both cases, we study the effect
of initial conditions on the epidemic's dynamics and its variability. The
results display a time regime during which the prevalence exhibits a large
sensitivity to noise. We also investigate the dependence of the infection time
on nodes' degree and distance to the seed. In particular, we show that the
infection time of hubs have large fluctuations which limit their reliability as
early-detection stations. Finally, we discuss the effect of the multiplicity of
shortest paths between two nodes on the infection time. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the existence of even longer paths reduces the average
infection time. These different results could be of use for the design of
time-dependent containment strategies.
