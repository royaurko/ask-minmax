Consider a deformable body immersed in an incompressible fluid that is
randomly stirred. Sticking to physical situations in which the body departs
only slightly from its spherical shape, we investigate the deformations of the
body. The shape is decomposed into spherical harmonic modes. We study the
correlations of these modes for a general class of random flows that include
the flow due to thermal agitation. Our results are general in the sense that
they are applicable to any body that is described solely by the shape of its
surface.
