Biochemical reaction networks are subjected to large fluctuations
attributable to small molecule numbers, yet underlie reliable biological
functions. Most theoretical approaches describe them as purely deterministic or
stochastic dynamical systems, depending on which point of view is favored.
Here, we investigate the dynamics of a self-repressing gene using an
intermediate approach based on a moment closure approximation of the master
equation, which allows us to take into account the binary character of gene
activity. We thereby obtain deterministic equations that describe how
nonlinearity feeds back fluctuations into the mean-field equations, providing
insight into the interplay of determinism and stochasticity. This allows us to
identify regions of parameter space where fluctuations induce relatively
regular oscillations.
