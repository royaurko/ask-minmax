Explicit determination of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for trapping
problem on complex media is a theoretical challenge. In this paper, we study
random walks on the Apollonian network with a trap fixed at a given hub node
(i.e. node with the highest degree), which are simultaneously scale-free and
small-world. We obtain the precise analytic expression for the MFPT that is
confirmed by direct numerical calculations. In the large system size limit, the
MFPT approximately grows as a power-law function of the number of nodes, with
the exponent much less than 1, which is significantly different from the
scaling for some regular networks or fractals, such as regular lattices,
Sierpinski fractals, T-graph, and complete graphs. The Apollonian network is
the most efficient configuration for transport by diffusion among all
previously studied structure.
