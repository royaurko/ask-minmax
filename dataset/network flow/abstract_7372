We report a 3 sigma upper limit of 220 microJanskys on any 22-GHz continuum
emission coincident with the central engine in NGC 4258. If NGC 4258 is powered
by an advection-dominated accretion flow, this radio upper limit implies that
the inner advection-dominated flow cannot extend significantly beyond about 100
Schwarzschild radii.
