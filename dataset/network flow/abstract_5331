The mechanisms by which modularity emerges in complex networks are not well
understood but recent reports have suggested that modularity may arise from
evolutionary selection. We show that finding the modularity of a network is
analogous to finding the ground-state energy of a spin system. Moreover, we
demonstrate that, due to fluctuations, stochastic network models give rise to
modular networks. Specifically, we show both numerically and analytically that
random graphs and scale-free networks have modularity. We argue that this fact
must be taken into consideration to define statistically-significant modularity
in complex networks.
