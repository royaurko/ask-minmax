Oceanic Kelvin and Rossby waves play an important role in tropical climate
and \en dynamics. Here we develop and apply a climate network approach to
quantify the characteristics of \en related oceanic waves, based on sea surface
height satellite data. We associate the majority of dominant long distance
($\geq 500$ km) links of the network with (i) equatorial Kelvin waves, (ii)
off-equatorial Rossby waves, and (iii) tropical instability waves. Notably, we
find that the location of the hubs of out-going ($\sim 180^{\circ}\rm{E}$) and
in-coming ($\sim 140^{\circ}\rm{W}$) links of the climate network coincide with
the locations of the Kelvin wave initiation and dissipation, respectively. We
also find that this dissipation at $\sim 140^{\circ}\rm{W}$ is much weaker
during \en times. Moreover, the hubs of the off-equatorial network coincide
with the locations of westerly wind burst activity and high wind vorticity, two
mechanisms that were associated with Rossby waves activity. The quantitative
methodology and measures developed here can improve the understanding of \en
dynamics and possibly its prediction.
