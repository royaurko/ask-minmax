The new `quantum-foam in-flow' theory of gravity has explained numerous
so-called gravitational anomalies, particularly the `dark matter' effect which
is now seen to be a dynamical effect of space itself, and whose strength is
determined by the fine structure constant, and not by Newton's gravitational
constant G. Here we show an experimentally significant approximate dynamical
effect, namely a vector superposition effect which arises under certain
dynamical conditions when we have absolute motion and gravitational in-flows:
the velocities for these processes are shown to be approximately vectorially
additive under these conditions. This effect plays a key role in interpreting
the data from the numerous experiments that detected the absolute linear motion
of the earth. The violations of this superposition effect lead to observable
effects, such as the generation of turbulence. The flow theory also leads to
vorticity effects that the Gravity Probe B gyroscope experiment will soon begin
observing. As previously reported General Relativity predicts a smaller
vorticity effect (therein called the Lense-Thirring `frame-dragging' effect)
than the new theory of gravity.
