We present a new application of the framework of Lagrangian Perturbation
Theory (LPT): the stability analysis of fluid flows. The incompressible
Navier-Stokes equation is recast such that the particle position is the
fundamental variable, expressed as a function of Lagrangian coordinates. The
displacement due to the steady state flow is taken to be the zeroth order
solution and the position is formally expanded in terms of a small parameter
(generally, the strength of the initial perturbation). The resulting hierarchy
of equations is solved analytically at first order. As a test case, we apply
this framework to analyze the stability of the plane Couette flow. We find that
we recover the standard result in the Eulerian frame: the plane Couette flow is
asymptotically stable for all Reynolds numbers. However, it is also well
established that experiments contradict this prediction. In the Eulerian
picture, this is attributed to the phenomenon of `transient growth' which is
related to the non-normal nature of the linear stability operator. The first
order solution in the Lagrangian frame also qualitatively recovers this
feature, this providing an alternate analytic derivation of the `transient
growth'. As a first step, and for the purposes of analytic manipulation, we
consider only linear stability of 2D perturbations but the framework presented
is general and can be extended to higher orders, other flows and/or 3D
perturbations.
