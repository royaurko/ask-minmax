Continuum hydrodynamic models of active liquid crystals have been used to
describe dynamic self-organising systems such as bacterial swarms and
cytoskeletal gels. A key prediction of such models is the existence of
self-stabilising kink states that spontaneously generate fluid flow in
quasi-one dimensional channels. Using simple stability arguments and numerical
calculations we extend previous studies to give a complete characterisation of
the phase space for both contractile and extensile particles (ie pullers and
pushers) moving in a narrow channel as a function of their flow alignment
properties and initial orientation. This gives a framework for unifying many of
the results in the literature. We describe the response of the kink states to
an imposed shear, and investigate how allowing the system to be polar modifies
its dynamical behaviour.
