Recent results in d+Au and p+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC provide
evidence for collective expansion and flow of the created medium. We propose a
control set of experiments to directly compare particle emission patterns from
p+Au, d+Au, and He3+Au or t+Au collisions at the same sqrt(sNN). Using Monte
Carlo Glauber we find that a He3 or triton projectile, with a realistic
wavefunction description, induces a significant intrinsic triangular shape to
the initial medium and that, even with viscous damping, this survives into a
significant third order flow moment v3. By comparing systems with one, two, and
three initial hot spots, one can disentangle the effects from the initial
spatial distribution of the deposited energy and viscous damping. These are key
tools to answering the question of how small a droplet of matter is necessary
to form a quark-gluon plasma described by nearly inviscid hydrodynamics.
