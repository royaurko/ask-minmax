Based on a rigorous extension of classical statistical mechanics to networks,
we study a specific microscopic network Hamiltonian. The form of this
Hamiltonian is derived from the assumption that individual nodes
increase/decrease their utility by linking to nodes with a higher/lower degree
than their own. We interpret utility as an equivalent to energy in physical
systems and discuss the temperature dependence of the emerging networks. We
observe the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ where total energy
(utility) and network-architecture undergo radical changes. Along this
topological transition we obtain scale-free networks with complex hierarchical
topology. In contrast to models for scale-free networks introduced so far, the
scale-free nature emerges within equilibrium, with a clearly defined
microcanonical ensemble and the principle of detailed balance strictly
fulfilled. This provides clear evidence that 'complex' networks may arise
without irreversibility. The results presented here should find a wide variety
of applications in socio-economic statistical systems.
