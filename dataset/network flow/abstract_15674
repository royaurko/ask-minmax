The uplink of interference-limited cellular networks with base stations that
have large numbers of antennas and use linear Minimum-Mean-Square Error (MMSE)
processing with power control is analyzed. Simple approximations, which are
exact in an asymptotic sense, are provided for the spectral efficiencies
(b/s/Hz) of links in these systems. It is also found that when the number of
base-station antennas is moderately large, and the number of mobiles in the
entire network is large, correlations between the transmit powers of mobiles
within a given cell do not significantly influence the spectral efficiency of
the system. As a result, mobiles can perform simple power control (e.g.
fractional power control) that does not depend on other users in the network,
reducing system complexity and improving the analytical tractability of such
systems.
