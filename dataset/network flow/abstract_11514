Password authentication using Hopfield Networks is presented in this paper.
In this paper we discussed the Hopfield Network Scheme for Textual and
graphical passwords, for which input Password will be converted in to
probabilistic values. We observed how to get password authentication using
Probabilistic values for Textual passwords and Graphical passwords. This study
proposes the use of a Hopfield neural network technique for password
authentication. In comparison to existing layered neural network techniques,
the proposed method provides better accuracy and quicker response time to
registration and password changes.
