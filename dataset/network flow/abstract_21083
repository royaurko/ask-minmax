The low-temperature instability of one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB)
phase in 3-state Potts spin glass is obtained explicitly. The temperature of
the instability is higher than the temperature where the 1RSB entropy becomes
negative. The conjecture of the possibility of the low-temperature full RSB is
supported.
