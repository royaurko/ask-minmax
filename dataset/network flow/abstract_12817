In this paper we present ChirpCast, a system for broadcasting network access
keys to laptops ultrasonically. This work explores several modulation
techniques for sending and receiving data using sound waves through commodity
speakers and built-in laptop microphones. Requiring only that laptop users run
a small application, the system successfully provides robust room-specific
broadcasting at data rates of 200 bits/second.
