The wireless network places vital role in the present day communication
scenario. The ad hoc nature of wireless communication adds flavour to suit
various real world applications. This improves the performance of the network
tremendously while the clustering mechanism gets added to the ad hoc network.
It has been found out that the existing WCA lacks in forming efficient
clusters. Thus, this work proposes an Extended weighted partitioning around
cluster head mechanism by considering W-PAC as a base to form clusters. The
cluster members are configured with IPv6 address. This IPv6 clusters formed
through W-PAC will be taken further for validation to determine the perfectness
of clusters. The cluster formation and maintenance have been implemented in C++
as a programming language. The cluster validation has been carried out using
OMNET++ simulator.
