We analytically determine when a range of abstract social contagion models
permit global spreading from a single seed on degree-correlated random
networks. We deduce the expected size of the largest vulnerable component, a
network's tinderbox-like critical mass, as well as the probability that
infecting a randomly chosen individual seed will trigger global spreading. In
the appropriate limits, our results naturally reduce to standard ones for
models of disease spreading and to the condition for the existence of a giant
component. Recent advances in the distributed, infinite seed case allow us to
further determine the final size of global spreading events, when they occur.
To provide support for our results, we derive exact expressions for key
spreading quantities for a simple yet rich family of random networks with
bimodal degree distributions.
