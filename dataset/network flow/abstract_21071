Phenomenological criterion of a choice of the order parameter for superfluid
phases of $^3$He in aerogel in a near vicinity of the transition temperature is
formulated. Except for the B-phase this criterion is met by the order parameter
of axiplanar phase for a special choice of its parameters. It is proposed as a
limiting at $T\to T_c$ form of the order parameter for the observed A-like
phase.
