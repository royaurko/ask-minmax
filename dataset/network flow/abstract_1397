The last years have seen a growing interest in collaborative systems like
electronic marketplaces and P2P file sharing systems where people are intended
to interact with other people. Those systems, however, are subject to security
and operational risks because of their open and distributed nature. Reputation
systems provide a mechanism to reduce such risks by building trust
relationships among entities and identifying malicious entities. A popular
reputation model is the so called flow-based model. Most existing reputation
systems based on such a model provide only a ranking, without absolute
reputation values; this makes it difficult to determine whether entities are
actually trustworthy or untrustworthy. In addition, those systems ignore a
significant part of the available information; as a consequence, reputation
values may not be accurate. In this paper, we present a flow-based reputation
metric that gives absolute values instead of merely a ranking. Our metric makes
use of all the available information. We study, both analytically and
numerically, the properties of the proposed metric and the effect of attacks on
reputation values.
