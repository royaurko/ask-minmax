While the deployment of base stations (BSs) becomes increasingly dense in
order to accommodate the growth in traffic demand, these BSs may be
under-utilized during most hours except peak hours. Accordingly, the
deactivation of these under-utilized BSs is regarded as the key to reducing
network power consumption; however, the remaining active BSs should increase
their transmit power in order to fill network coverage holes that result from
BS switching off. This paper investigates the optimal balance between such
beneficial and harmful effects of BS switching off in terms of minimizing the
network power consumption, through comprehensively considering the spatial BS
distribution, BS transmit power, BS power consumption behaviors, radio
propagation environments, and frequency reuse. When BSs are deployed according
to a homogeneous Poisson point process, the suboptimal and approximated design
problems are formulated as geometric programming and the solutions lead to
insightful design principles for the key design parameters including the
spatial density, transmit power, and frequency reuse of remaining active BSs.
The numerical results demonstrate that these solutions are very close to the
optimal balances.
