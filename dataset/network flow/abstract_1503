Wind is becoming an increasingly significant source of energy in modern power
generation. Amongst existing technologies, Variable Speed Wind Turbines (VSWT)
equipped with Double Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) is widely deployed.
Consequently, power systems are now experiencing newer power flow patterns and
operating conditions. This paper investigates the impact of a DFIG based Wind
Farm (WF) on the stability of electromechanical oscillations. This is achieved
by performing modal analysis to evaluate the stability of a two-area power
network when subjected to different wind penetration levels and different
geographical installed locations. The approach via eigenvalues analysis
involves the design of voltage and Supplementary Damping Controllers (SDCs)
that contribute to network damping. The effect of Power System Stabilizer (PSS)
is also examined for several network conditions. Simulations demonstrate a
damping improvement up to 933% when the control systems are activated and the
system operates with 25% wind integration.
