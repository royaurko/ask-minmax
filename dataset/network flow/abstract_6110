Observability and controllability are essential concepts to the design of
predictive observer models and feedback controllers of networked systems. For
example, noncontrollable mathematical models of real systems have subspaces
that influence model behavior, but cannot be controlled by an input. Such
subspaces can be difficult to determine in complex nonlinear networks. Since
almost all of the present theory was developed for linear networks without
symmetries, here we present a numerical and group representational framework,
to quantify the observability and controllability of nonlinear networks with
explicit symmetries that shows the connection between symmetries and nonlinear
measures of observability and controllability. We numerically observe and
theoretically predict that not all symmetries have the same effect on network
observation and control. Our analysis shows that the presence of symmetry in a
network may decrease observability and controllability, although networks
containing only rotational symmetries remain controllable and observable. These
results alter our view of the nature of observability and controllability in
complex networks, change our understanding of structural controllability, and
affect the design of mathematical models to observe and control such networks.
