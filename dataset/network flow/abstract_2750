These Network Coding improves the network operation beyond the traditional
routing or store-and-forward, by mixing of data stream within a network.
Network coding techniques explicitly minimizes the total no of transmission in
wireless network. The Coding-aware routing maximizes the coding opportunity by
finding the coding possible path for every packet in the network. Here we
propose CORMEN: a new coding-aware routing mechanism based on opportunistic
routing. In CORMEN, every node independently can take the decision whether to
code packets or not and forwarding of packets is based on the coding
opportunity available.
