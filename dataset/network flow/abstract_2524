Most networks of interest do not live in isolation. Instead they form
components of larger systems in which multiple networks with distinct
topologies coexist and where elements distributed amongst different networks
may interact directly. Here we develop a mathematical framework based on
generating functions for analyzing a system of L interacting networks given the
connectivity within and between networks. We derive exact expressions for the
percolation threshold describing the onset of large-scale connectivity in the
system of networks and each network individually. These general expressions
apply to networks with arbitrary degree distributions and we explicitly
evaluate them for L=2 interacting networks with a few choices of degree
distributions. We show that the percolation threshold in an individual network
can be significantly lowered once "hidden" connections to other networks are
considered. We show applications of the framework to two real-world systems
involving communications networks and socio-tecnical congruence in software
systems.
