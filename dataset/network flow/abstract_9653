Community structure can naturally emerge in paths to synchronization, and
scratching it from the paths is a tough issue that accounts for the diverse
dynamics of synchronization. In this paper, with assumption that the
synchronization on complex networks is made up of local and collective
processes, we proposed a scheme to lock the local synchronization (phase
locking) at a stable state meanwhile suppress the collective synchronization
based on Kuramoto model. Through this scheme, the network dynamics only
contains the local synchronization, which suggests that the nodes in the same
community synchronize together and these synchronization clusters well reveal
the community structure of network. Furthermore, by analyzing the paths to
synchronization, the relations or overlaps among different communities are also
obtained. Thus, the community detection based on the scheme is performed on
five real networks and the observed community structures are much more apparent
than modularity-based fast algorithm. Our results not only provide a deep
insight to understand the synchronization dynamics on complex network but also
enlarge the research scope of community detection.
