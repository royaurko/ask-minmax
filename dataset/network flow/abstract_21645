We consider the acceleration of particles (protons) in a plasma clot by an
induced field which appears due to the dissolving of the clot. The mechanism of
this acceleration is based on a model where the clot consists of double flat
moving current layers. It is assumed that the currents flow in opposite
directions, while the clot moves in a perpendicular one. It is shown that
protons can reach the highest observed energy (of the order of $10^{11}-
10^{12}$GeV), providing that the size of the clot is large enough.
