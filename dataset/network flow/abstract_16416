A stable partitioned algorithm for coupling incompressible flows with
compressible elastic solids is described. This added-mass partitioned (AMP)
scheme requires no sub-iterations, can be made fully second- or higher-order
accurate, and remains stable even in the presence of strong added-mass effects.
The approach extends the scheme of Banks et al. [1,2] for compressible flow,
and uses Robin (mixed) boundary conditions with the fluid and solid solvers at
the interface. The AMP Robin conditions are derived from a local characteristic
decomposition in the solid at the interface. Two forms of the Robin conditions
are derived depending on whether the fluid equations are advanced with a
fractional-step method or not. A normal mode analysis for a discretization of
an FSI model problem is performed to show that the new AMP algorithm is stable
for any ratio of the solid and fluid densities, including the case of very
light solids when the added-mass effects are large. In contrast, it is shown
that a traditional partitioned algorithm involving a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling
for the same FSI problem is formally unconditionally unstable for any ratio of
densities. Exact traveling wave solutions are derived for three FSI model
problems of increasing complexity, and these solutions are used to verify the
stability and accuracy of the corresponding numerical results obtained from the
AMP algorithm for the cases of light, medium and heavy solids.
