We investigate the role of migration patterns on the spread of epidemics in
complex networks. We enhance the SIS-diffusion model on metapopulations to a
nonlinear diffusion. Specifically, individuals move randomly over the network
but at a rate depending on the population of the departure patch. In the
absence of epidemics, the migration-driven equilibrium is described by
quantifying the total number of individuals living in heavily/lightly populated
areas. Our analytical approach reveals that strengthening the migration from
populous areas contains the infection at the early stage of the epidemic.
Moreover, depending on the exponent of the nonlinear diffusion rate, epidemic
outbreaks do not always occur in the most populated areas as one might expect.
