In channel flows a step on the route to turbulence is the formation of
streaks, often due to algebraic growth of disturbances. While a variation of
viscosity in the gradient direction often plays a large role in
laminar-turbulent transition in shear flows, we show that it has, surprisingly,
little effect on the algebraic growth. Non-uniform viscosity therefore may not
always work as a flow-control strategy for maintaining the flow as laminar.
