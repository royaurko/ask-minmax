We determine the more general geometrical flow in the space of metrics
corresponding to the steepest descent for the three-dimensional gravitational
Chern-Simons action, extending the results previously considered in
  Class. Quantum Grav. 25 (2008) 165019, and reveling another trouble with the
four dimensional Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity introduced in Phys. Rev. D 79,
084008 (2009), and JHEP 0903, 020 (2009), which attempts to be a candidate for
an UV completion of Einstein general relativity.
