Here we develop a lung ventilation model, based a continuum poroelastic
representation of lung parenchyma and a 0D airway tree flow model. For the
poroelastic approximation we design and implement a lowest order stabilised
finite element method. This component is strongly coupled to the 0D airway tree
model. The framework is applied to a realistic lung anatomical model derived
from computed tomography data and an artificially generated airway tree to
model the conducting airway region. Numerical simulations produce
physiologically realistic solutions, and demonstrate the effect of airway
constriction and reduced tissue elasticity on ventilation, tissue stress and
alveolar pressure distribution. The key advantage of the model is the ability
to provide insight into the mutual dependence between ventilation and
deformation. This is essential when studying lung diseases, such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis. Thus the model can be
used to form a better understanding of integrated lung mechanics in both the
healthy and diseased states.
