We consider a model of strongly correlated electrons in 1D called the t-J
model, which was solved by graded algebraic Bethe ansatz. We use it to design
graded tensor networks which can be contracted approximately to obtain a Matrix
Product State. As a proof of principle, we calculate observables of ground
states and excited states of finite lattices up to $18$ lattice sites.
