In this paper, we generalize a recently introduced Expectation Maximization
(EM) method for graphs and apply it to content-based networks. The EM method
provides a classification of the nodes of a graph, and allows to infer
relations between the different classes. Content-based networks are ideal
models for graphs displaying any kind of community or/and multipartite
structure. We show both numerically and analytically that the generalized EM
method is able to recover the process that led to the generation of such
networks. We also investigate the conditions under which our generalized EM
method can recover the underlying contents-based structure in the presence of
randomness in the connections. Two entropies, Sq and Sc, are defined to measure
the quality of the node classification and to what extent the connectivity of a
given network is content-based. Sq and Sc are also useful in determining the
number of classes for which the classification is optimal.
