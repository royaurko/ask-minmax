802.11 device fingerprinting is the action of characterizing a target device
through its wireless traffic. This results in a signature that may be used for
identification, network monitoring or intrusion detection. The fingerprinting
method can be active by sending traffic to the target device, or passive by
just observing the traffic sent by the target device. Many passive
fingerprinting methods rely on the observation of one particular network
feature, such as the rate switching behavior or the transmission pattern of
probe requests. In this work, we evaluate a set of global wireless network
parameters with respect to their ability to identify 802.11 devices. We
restrict ourselves to parameters that can be observed passively using a
standard wireless card. We evaluate these parameters for two different tests:
i) the identification test that returns one single result being the closest
match for the target device, and ii) the similarity test that returns a set of
devices that are close to the target devices. We find that the network
parameters transmission time and frame inter-arrival time perform best in
comparison to the other network parameters considered. Finally, we focus on
inter-arrival times, the most promising parameter for device identification,
and show its dependency from several device characteristics such as the
wireless card and driver but also running applications.
