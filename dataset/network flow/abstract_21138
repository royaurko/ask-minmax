Cores are, besides connectivity components, one among few concepts that
provides us with efficient decompositions of large graphs and networks.
  In the paper a generalization of the notion of core of a graph based on
vertex property function is presented. It is shown that for the local monotone
vertex property functions the corresponding cores can be determined in $O(m
\max (\Delta, \log n))$ time.
