The one-mode projecting is extensively used to compress the bipartite
networks. Since the one-mode projection is always less informative than the
bipartite representation, a proper weighting method is required to better
retain the original information. In this article, inspired by the network-based
resource-allocation dynamics, we raise a weighting method, which can be
directly applied in extracting the hidden information of networks, with
remarkably better performance than the widely used global ranking method as
well as collaborative filtering. This work not only provides a creditable
method in compressing bipartite networks, but also highlights a possible way
for the better solution of a long-standing challenge in modern information
science: How to do personal recommendation?
