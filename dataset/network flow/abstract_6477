With the rapid development in mobile network effective network planning tool
is needed to satisfy the need of customers. However, deciding upon the optimum
placement for the base stations (BS) to achieve best services while reducing
the cost is a complex task requiring vast computational resource. This paper
addresses antenna placement problem or the cell planning problem, involves
locating and configuring infrastructure for mobile networks. The Cluster
Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) original algorithm has been modified and a
new algorithm M-PAM (Modified-Partitioning Around Medoids) has been proposed by
the contributors in a recent work. In the present paper, the M-PAM algorithm is
modified and a new algorithm CWN-PAM (Clustering with Weighted
Node-Partitioning Around Medoids) has been proposed to satisfy the requirements
and constraints. Implementation of this algorithm to a real case study is
presented. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the
modifying algorithm in tackling the important problem of mobile network
planning.
