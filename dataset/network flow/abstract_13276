Sand traps are used to measure Aeolian flux. Since they modify the
surrounding wind velocity field their gauging represents an important
challenge. We use numerical simulations under the assumption of homogeneous
turbulence based on FLUENT to systematically study the flow field and trapping
efficiency of one of the most common devices based on a hollow cylinder with
two slits. In particular, we investigate the dependence on the wind speed, the
Stokes number, the permeability of the membrane on the slit and the saltation
height.
