This paper is based on a series of talks given at the Patejdlovka Enumeration
Workshop held in the Czech Republic in November 2007. The topics covered are as
follows. The graph polynomial, Tutte-Grothendieck invariants, an overview of
relevant elementary finite Fourier analysis, the Tutte polynomial of a graph as
a Hamming weight enumerator of its set of tensions (or flows), and a
description of a family of polynomials containing the graph polynomial which
yield Tutte-Grothendieck invariants in a similar way.
