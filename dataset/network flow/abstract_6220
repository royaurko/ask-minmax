We study networks constructed from gene expression data obtained from many
types of cancers. The networks are constructed by connecting vertices that
belong to each others' list of K-nearest-neighbors, with K being an a priori
selected non-negative integer. We introduce an order parameter for
characterizing the homogeneity of the networks. On minimizing the order
parameter with respect to K, degree distribution of the networks shows
power-law behavior in the tails with an exponent of unity. Analysis of the
eigenvalue spectrum of the networks confirms the presence of the power-law and
small-world behavior. We discuss the significance of these findings in the
context of evolutionary biological processes.
