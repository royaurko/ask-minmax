Excitation functions of flow and stopping observables for the Au+Au system at
energies from 40 to 1500 MeV per nucleon are presented. The systematics were
obtained by merging the results of the INDRA and FOPI experiments, both
performed at the GSI facility. The connection to the nuclear equation of state
is discussed.
