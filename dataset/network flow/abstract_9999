Colliding flows are a commonly used scenario for the formation of molecular
clouds in numerical simulations. Due to the thermal instability of the warm
neutral medium, turbulence is produced by cooling. We carry out a
two-dimensional numerical study of such colliding flows in order to test
whether statistical properties inferred from adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
simulations are robust with respect to the applied refinement criteria. We
compare probability density functions of various quantities as well as the
clump statistics and fractal dimension of the density fields in AMR simulations
to a static-grid simulation. The static grid with 2048^2 cells matches the
resolution of the most refined subgrids in the AMR simulations. The density
statistics is reproduced fairly well by AMR. Refinement criteria based on the
cooling time or the turbulence intensity appear to be superior to the standard
technique of refinement by overdensity. Nevertheless, substantial differences
in the flow structure become apparent. In general, it is difficult to separate
numerical effects from genuine physical processes in AMR simulations.
