Our current world is linked by a complex mesh of networks where information,
people and goods flow. These networks are interdependent each other, and
present structural and dynamical features different from those observed in
isolated networks. While examples of such "dissimilar" properties are becoming
more abundant, for example diffusion, robustness and competition, it is not yet
clear where these differences are rooted in. Here we show that the composition
of independent networks into an interconnected network of networks undergoes a
structurally sharp transition as the interconnections are formed. Depending of
the relative importance of inter and intra-layer connections, we find that the
entire interdependent system can be tuned between two regimes: in one regime,
the various layers are structurally decoupled and they act as independent
entities; in the other regime, network layers are indistinguishable and the
whole system behave as a single-level network. We analytically show that the
transition between the two regimes is discontinuous even for finite size
networks. Thus, any real-world interconnected system is potentially at risk of
abrupt changes in its structure that may reflect in new dynamical properties.
