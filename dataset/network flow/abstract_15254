Geocasting is a special variant of multicasting, where data packet or message
is transmitted to a predefined geographical location i.e., known as geocast
region. The applications of geocasting in VANET are to disseminate information
like, collision warning, advertising, alerts message, etc. In this paper, we
have proposed a model for highway scenario where the highway is divided into
number of cells. The intersection area between two successive cells is computed
to find the number of common nodes. Therefore, probabilistic analysis of the
nodes present and void occurrence in the intersection area is carried out.
Further, we have defined different forwarding zones to restrict the number of
participated nodes for data delivery. Number of nodes present and void
occurrence in the different forwarding zones have also been analysed based on
various node density in the network to determine the successful delivery of
data. Our analytical results show that in a densely populated network, data can
be transmitted with low radio transmission range. In a densely populated
network smaller forwarding zones will be selected for data delivery.
