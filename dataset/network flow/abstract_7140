We report on results obtained with the Event Shape Engineering technique
applied to Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\rm{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. By selecting events
in the same centrality interval, but with very different average flow,
different initial state conditions can be studied. We find the effect of the
event-shape selection on the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$ to be almost
independent of transverse momentum $p_\rm{T}$, as expected if this effect is
due to fluctuations in the initial geometry of the system. Charged hadron,
pion, kaon, and proton transverse momentum distributions are found to be harder
in events with higher-than-average elliptic flow, indicating an interplay
between radial and elliptic flow.
