In this paper, the size of bubbles formed through the breakup of a gaseous
jet in a co-axial microfluidic device is derived. The gaseous jet surrounded by
a co-flowing liquid stream breaks up into monodisperse microbubbles and the
size of the bubbles is determined by the radius of the inner gas jet and the
bubble formation frequency. We obtain the radius of the gas jet by solving the
Navier-Stokes equations for low Reynolds number flows and by minimization of
the dissipation energy. The prediction of the bubble size is based on the
system's control parameters only, i.e. the inner gas flow rate $Q_i$, the outer
liquid flow rate $Q_o$, and the tube radius $R$. For a very low gas-to-liquid
flow rate ratio ($Q_i / Q_o \rightarrow 0$) the bubble radius scales as $r_b /
R \propto \sqrt{Q_i / Q_o}$, independently of the inner to outer viscosity
ratio $\eta_i/\eta_o$ and of the type of the velocity profile in the gas, which
can be either flat or parabolic, depending on whether high-molecular-weight
surfactants cover the gas-liquid interface or not. However, in the case in
which the gas velocity profiles are parabolic and the viscosity ratio is
sufficiently low, i.e. $\eta_i/\eta_o \ll 1$, the bubble diameter scales as
$r_b \propto (Q_i/Q_o)^\beta$, with $\beta$ smaller than 1/2.
