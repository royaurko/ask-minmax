We show that a bacteria and bacteriophage system with either a perfectly
nested or a one-to-one infection network is permanent, a.k.a uniformly
persistent, provided that bacteria that are superior competitors for nutrient
devote the least to defence against infection and the virus that are the most
efficient at infecting host have the smallest host range. By ensuring that the
density-dependent reduction in bacterial growth rates are independent of
bacterial strain, we are able to arrive at the permanence conclusion sought by
Jover et al (J. Theor. Biol. 332:65-77, 2013). The same permanence results hold
for the one-to-one infection network considered by Thingstad (Limnol Oceanogr
45:1320-1328, 2000) but without virus efficiency ordering. Additionally we show
the global stability for the nested infection network, and the global dynamics
for the one-to-one network.
