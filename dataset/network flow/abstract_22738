The objectives of this work are to revisit the experimental measurements on
dam break flow over a dry horizontal bed and to provide a detailed insight into
the dynamics of the dam break wave impacting a vertical wall downstream the
dam, with emphasis on the pressure loads. The measured data are statistically
analyzed and critically discussed. As a result, an extensive set of data for
validation of computational tools is provided.
