We present WFPC2 images of the core of the cooling flow cD galaxy in Abell
1795. An irregular, asymmetric dust lane extends 7 \h75 kpc in projection to
the north-northwest. The dust shares the morphology observed in the H$\alpha$
and excess UV emission. We see both diffuse and knotty blue emission around the
dust lane, especially at the ends. The dust and emission features lie on the
edge of the radio lobes, suggesting star formation induced by the radio source
or the deflection of the radio jets off of pre-existing dust and gas. We
measure an apparent R$_V$ significantly less than 3.1, implying that the
extinction law is not Galactic in the dust lane, or the presence of line
emission which is proportional to the extinction. The dust mass is at least
2$\times10^{5} h_{75}^{-2}$ M\solar\ and is more likely to be 6.5$\times10^{5}
h_{75}^{-2}$ M\solar.
