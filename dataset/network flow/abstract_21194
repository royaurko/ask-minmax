On the Andean highlands, the "qochas" are lakes or ponds of natural or
artificial origin. An ancient agricultural technique is based on their use.
Linked together by a network of canals, qochas form a system of water and soil
management, alternately used for crops or pasture. The concave structure of
qochas controls the strong evaporation produced by solar radiation and wind
blowing. Qochas can be observed in the satellite imagery of Google Maps.
