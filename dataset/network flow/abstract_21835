We find strong evidence for intermittency in forced two dimensional (2D)
turbulence in a flowing soap film experiment. In the forward enstrophy cascade
the structure function scaling exponents are nearly indistinguishable from 3D
studies. Intermittency corrections are present in the inverse energy cascade as
well, but weaker. Stretched exponential tails of the velocity difference
probability distribution functions and shock like events at large velocity
differences also resemble 3D studies. For decaying turbulence, where only the
forward enstrophy cascade remains, all signs of intermittency disappear.
