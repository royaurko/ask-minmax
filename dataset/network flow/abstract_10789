Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed X-ray cavities in many nearby cooling
flow clusters. The cavities trace feedback from the central active galactic
nulceus (AGN) on the intracluster medium (ICM), an important ingredient in
stabilizing cooling flows and in the process of galaxy formation and evolution.
But, the prevalence and duty cycle of such AGN outbursts is not well
understood. To this end, we study how the cooling is balanced by the cavity
heating for a complete sample of clusters (the Brightest 55 clusters of
galaxies, hereafter B55). In the B55, we found 33 cooling flow clusters, 20 of
which have detected X-ray bubbles in their ICM. Among the remaining 13, all
except Ophiuchus could have significant cavity power yet remain undetected in
existing images. This implies that the duty cycle of AGN outbursts with
significant heating potential in cooling flow clusters is at least 60 % and
could approach 100 %, but deeper data is required to constrain this further.
