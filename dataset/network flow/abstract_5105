Inferring genetic networks from gene expression data is one of the most
challenging work in the post-genomic era, partly due to the vast space of
possible networks and the relatively small amount of data available. In this
field, Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) provides a convenient framework for the
discovery of biological networks. In this paper, we propose an original
approach for inferring gene regulation networks using a robust biological prior
on their structure in order to limit the set of candidate networks.
  Pathways, that represent biological knowledge on the regulatory networks,
will be used as an informative prior knowledge to drive Network Inference. This
approach is based on the selection of a relevant set of genes, called the
"molecular signature", associated with a condition of interest (for instance,
the genes involved in disease development). In this context, differential
expression analysis is a well established strategy. However outcome signatures
are often not consistent and show little overlap between studies. Thus, we will
dedicate the first part of our work to the improvement of the standard process
of biomarker identification to guarantee the robustness and reproducibility of
the molecular signature.
  Our approach enables to compare the networks inferred between two conditions
of interest (for instance case and control networks) and help along the
biological interpretation of results. Thus it allows to identify differential
regulations that occur in these conditions. We illustrate the proposed approach
by applying our method to a study of breast cancer's response to treatment.
