The flow behavior of a viscoelastic organogel is investigated using
ultrasonic velocimetry combined with rheometry. Our gel presents a decreasing
flow curve, i.e., the measured stress decreases as a function of the applied
shear rate. Strikingly, we note that the local flow curve calculated from the
velocity profiles also exhibits a decreasing part. We attribute this regime to
the presence of a fracturing process and three-dimensional motions in the bulk
of the sample.
