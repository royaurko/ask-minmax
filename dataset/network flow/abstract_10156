The short-time motion of Brownian particles in an incompressible Newtonian
fluid under shear, in which the fluid inertia becomes important, was
investigated by direct numerical simulation of particulate flows.
Three-dimensional simulations were performed, wherein external forces were
introduced to approximately form Couette flows throughout the entire system
with periodic boundary conditions. In order to examine the validity of the
method, the mean square displacement of a single spherical particle in a simple
shear flow was calculated, and these results were compared with a hydrodynamic
analytical solution that includes the effects of the fluid inertia. Finally,
the dynamical behavior of a monodisperse dispersion composed of repulsive
spherical particles was examined on short time scales, and the shear-induced
diffusion coefficients were measured for several volume fractions up to 0.50.
