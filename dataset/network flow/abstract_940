The observed long-range spatiotemporal correlations of real world dynamical
systems is governed by quantumlike mechanics with inherent non-local
connections. In summary, microscopic scale local fluctuations form a unified
self-organized adaptive network manifested as the macro-scale dynamical system
with implicit ordered energy flow between the larger and smaller scales. Such a
concept of ladder networks may find applications in the design of artificial
intelligence systems.
