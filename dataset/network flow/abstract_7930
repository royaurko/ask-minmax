We construct the next-to-leading order chiral lagrangian for scalar and
pseudo-scalar densities defined using the gradient flow. We calculate the
chiral condensate and the pion decay constant to this order from operators at
positive flow time, and confirm results obtained earlier in the chiral limit.
We also calculate the quark mass dependence of the scales $t_0$ and $w_0$
defined from the scalar gluon density and find that nonanalytic terms in the
quark mass only enter at next-to-next-to-leading order.
