It is suggested that the degree distribution for networks of the
cell-metabolism for simple organisms reflects an ubiquitous randomness. This
implies that natural selection has exerted no or very little pressure on the
network degree distribution during evolution. The corresponding random network,
here termed the blind watchmaker network has a power-law degree distribution
with an exponent gamma >= 2. It is random with respect to a complete set of
network states characterized by a description of which links are attached to a
node as well as a time-ordering of these links. No a priory assumption of any
growth mechanism or evolution process is made. It is found that the degree
distribution of the blind watchmaker network agrees very precisely with that of
the metabolic networks. This implies that the evolutionary pathway of the
cell-metabolism, when projected onto a metabolic network representation, has
remained statistically random with respect to a complete set of network states.
This suggests that even a biological system, which due to natural selection has
developed an enormous specificity like the cellular metabolism, nevertheless
can, at the same time, display well defined characteristics emanating from the
ubiquitous inherent random element of Darwinian evolution. The fact that also
completely random networks may have scale-free node distributions gives a new
perspective on the origin of scale-free networks in general.
