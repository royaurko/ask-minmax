We employ hydrodynamic equations to follow the clustering instability of a
freely cooling dilute gas of inelastically colliding spheres into a
well-developed nonlinear regime. We simplify the problem by dealing with a
one-dimensional coarse-grained flow. We observe that at a late stage of the
instability the shear stress becomes negligibly small, and the gas flows solely
by inertia. As a result the flow formally develops a finite time singularity,
as the velocity gradient and the gas density diverge at some location. We argue
that flow by inertia represents a generic intermediate asymptotic of unstable
free cooling of dilute inelastic gases.
