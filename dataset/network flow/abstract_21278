We consider a new class of open covers and classes of spaces defined from
them, called "iota spaces". We explore their relationship with epsilon-spaces
(that is, spaces having all finite powers Lindelof) and countable network
weight. An example of a hereditarily epsilon-space whose square is not
hereditarily Lindelof is provided.
