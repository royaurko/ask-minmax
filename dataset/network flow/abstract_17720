This paper presents a solution for the Flow Graphs case of the Transformation
Tool Contest 2013, using the Eclectic model transformation tool. The solution
makes use of several languages of Eclectic, showing how it is possible to
combine them to address a non-trivial transformation problem in a concise and
modulary way.
