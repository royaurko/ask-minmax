We study the Bayesian model averaging approach to learning Bayesian network
structures (DAGs) from data. We develop new algorithms including the first
algorithm that is able to efficiently sample DAGs according to the exact
structure posterior. The DAG samples can then be used to construct estimators
for the posterior of any feature. We theoretically prove good properties of our
estimators and empirically show that our estimators considerably outperform the
estimators from the previous state-of-the-art methods.
