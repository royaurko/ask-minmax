Recently several contributors have proposed stochastic models of the growth of the
Web graph that give rise to power-law distributions. These models are based on
the notion of preferential attachment leading to the ``rich get richer''
phenomenon. However, these models fail to explain several distributions arising
from empirical results, due to the fact that the predicted exponent is not
consistent with the data. To address this problem, we extend the evolutionary
model of the Web graph by including a non-preferential component, and we view
the stochastic process in terms of an urn transfer model. By making this
extension, we can now explain a wider variety of empirically discovered
power-law distributions provided the exponent is greater than two. These
include: the distribution of incoming links, the distribution of outgoing
links, the distribution of pages in a Web site and the distribution of visitors
to a Web site. A by-product of our results is a formal proof of the convergence
of the standard stochastic model (first proposed by Simon).
