Worldwide, we are experiencing an unprecedented, accelerated loss of
biodiversity triggered by a bundle of anthropogenic threats such as habitat
destruction, environmental pollution and climate change. Despite all efforts of
the European biodiversity conservation policy, initiated 20 years ago by the
Habitats Directive that provided the legal basis for establishing the Natura
2000 network, the goal to halt the decline of biodiversity in Europe by 2010
has been missed. Hochkirch et al. (2013, Conserv. Lett. 6: 462-467) identified
four major shortcomings of the current implementation of the directive
concerning prioritization of the annexes, conservation plans, survey systems
and financial resources. However they did not account for the intended network
character of the Natura 2000 sites, an aspect of highest relevance. This
response letter deals with this shortcoming as it is the prerequisite, over any
other strategies, ensuring a Natura 2020 network being worth its name.
