This paper presents a survey of key distribution schemes for wireless sensor
networks. This survey includes the new approach of key distribution using the
piggy bank method. Different Network architectures and different key
pre-distribution schemes are described. The survey includes the use of the
piggy bank approach to cryptography in which part of the key is pre-distributed
and the remainder is varied in the application.
