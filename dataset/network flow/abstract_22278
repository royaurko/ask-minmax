Using a final state interaction model which describes the data on these two
observables, at RHIC, we make predictions at the LHC -- using the same
cross-section and pT-shift. The increase in the medium density between these
two energies (by a factor close to three) produces an increase of the fixed pT
pi0 suppression by a factor 2 at large pT and of v2 by a factor 1.5.
