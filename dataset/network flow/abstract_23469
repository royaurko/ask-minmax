We use empirical molecular dynamics technique to study the low-energy
vibrations in a large 4096 atom model for pure amorphous silicon and a set of
models with voids of different size based on it. Numerical vibrational
eigenvalues and eigenvectors for our models are obtained by exact
diagonalization of their dynamical matrices. Our calculations show that
localized low-energy vibrational excitations of rather complex structure are
present in amorphous silicon models with voids. According to their spatial
localization patterns we make an attempt to classify these excitations as modes
associated with the void and "mixed" modes associated with the interaction of
the void with strained regions of silicon network.
