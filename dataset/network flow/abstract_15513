Self-organized quasi periodicity is one of the most puzzling dynamical phases
observed in systems of non linear coupled oscillators. The single dynamical
units are not locked to the periodic mean field they produce, but they still
feature a coherent behavior, through an unexplained complex form of
correlation. We consider a class of leaky integrate-and-fire oscillators on
random sparse and massive networks with dynamical synapses, featuring
self-organized quasi periodicity, and we show how complex collective
oscillations arise from constructive interference of microscopic dynamics. In
particular, we find a simple quantitative relationship between two relevant
microscopic dynamical time scales and the macroscopic time scale of the global
signal. We show that the proposed relation is a general property of collective
oscillations, common to all the partially synchronous dynamical phases
analyzed. We argue that an analogous mechanism could be at the origin of
similar network dynamics.
