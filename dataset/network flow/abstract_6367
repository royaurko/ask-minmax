Considering topologies of anonymous networks we used to organizing anonymous
communication into hard to trace paths hiding its origin or destination. In
anonymity the company is crucial, however the serial transportation imposes a
costly tradeoff between a level of privacy and a speed of communication.
  This paper introduces a framework of a novel architecture for anonymous
networks that hides initiators of communications by parallelization of
anonymous links. The new approach, which is based on the grounds of the
anonymous P2P network called P2Priv, does not require content forwarding via a
chain of proxy nodes to assure high degree of anonymity. Contrary to P2Priv,
the new architecture can be suited to anonymization of various network
communications, including anonymous access to distributed as well as
client-server services. In particular, it can be considered as an anonymization
platform for these network applications where both privacy and low delays are
required.
