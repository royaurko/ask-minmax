We consider magnetic geodesic flows on the 2-torus. We prove that the
question of existence of polynomial in momenta first integrals on one energy
level leads to a Semi-Hamiltonian system of quasi-linear equations, i.e. in the
hyperbolic regions the system has Riemann invariants and can be written in
conservation laws form.
