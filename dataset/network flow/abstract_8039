A modelling methodology to reproduce the experimental measurements of a
turbulent flow under the presence of symmetry is presented. The flow is a
three-dimensional wake generated by an axisymmetric body. We show that the
dynamics of the turbulent wake- flow can be assimilated by a nonlinear
two-dimensional Langevin equation, the deterministic part of which accounts for
the broken symmetries which occur at the laminar and transitional regimes at
low Reynolds numbers and the stochastic part of which accounts for the
turbulent fluctuations. Comparison between theoretical and experimental results
allows the extraction of the model parameters.
