We consider a single-hop switched queueing network. Amongst a plethora of
applications, these networks have been used to model wireless networks and
input queued switches. The MaxWeight scheduling policies have proved popular,
chiefly, because they are throughput optimal and do not require explicit
estimation of arrival rates.
  In this article, we prove the same throughput optimality property for a
generalization of the MaxWeight policy called the MaxWeight-({\alpha},g)
policy. These throughput optimal, myopic scheduling policies allow for
scheduling choices similar to those found in bandwidth sharing networks -- a
further well studied model of Internet congestion.
