Since Marco Polo (1) it has been known that some sand dunes have the peculiar
ability of emitting a loud sound with a well defined frequency, sometimes for
several minutes. The origin of this sustained sound has remained mysterious,
partly because of its rarity in nature (2). It has been recognized that the
sound is not due to the air flow around the dunes but to the motion of an
avalanche (3), and not to an acoustic excitation of the grains but to their
relative motion (4-7). By comparing several singing dunes and two controlled
experiments, one in the laboratory and one in the field, we here demonstrate
that the frequency of the sound is the frequency of the relative motion of the
sand grains. The sound is produced because some moving grains synchronize their
motions. The existence of a velocity threshold in both experiments further
shows that this synchronization comes from an acoustic resonance within the
flowing layer: if the layer is large enough it creates a resonance cavity in
which grains self-synchronize.
