Various possiblities for a distributed magnetometer network are considered.
We discuss strategies such as croudsourcing smartphone magnetometer data, the
use of trees as magnetometers, and performing interferometry using magnetometer
arrays to synthesize the magnetometers into a large-scale low-frequency radio
telescope. Geophysical and other applications of such a network are discussed.
