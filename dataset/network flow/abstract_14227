We study the GOY shell model simulating the cascade processes of turbulent
flow. The model has two inviscid invariants governing the dynamical behavior.
Depending on the choice of interaction coefficients, or coupling parameters,
the two invariants are either both positive definite, analogous to energy and
enstrophy of 2D flow, or only one is positive definite and the other not,
analogous to energy and helicity of 3D flow. In the 2D like model the dynamics
depend on the spectral ratio of enstrophy to energy. That ratio depends on
wave-number as $k^{\alpha}$. The enstrophy transfer through the inertial
sub-range can be described as a forward cascade for $\alpha < 2$ and a
diffusion in a statistical equilibrium for $\alpha > 2$. The $\alpha =2$ case,
corresponding to 2D turbulence, is a borderline between the two descriptions.
The difference can be understood in terms of the ratio of typical timescales in
the inertial sub-range and in the viscous sub-range. The multi fractality of
the enstrophy dissipation also depends on the parameter $\alpha$, and seems to
be related to the ratio of typical timescales of the different shell
velocities.
