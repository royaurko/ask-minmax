The characteristics of heat flow in a coupled magnetic system are studied.
The coupled system is composed of a gapped chain and a gapless chain. The
system size is assumed to be quite small so that the mean free path is
comparable to it. When the parameter set of the temperatures of reservoirs is
exchanged, the characteristics of heat flow are studied with the Keldysh Green
function technique. The asymmetry of current is found in the presence of a
local equilibrium process at the contact between the magnetic systems. The
present setup is realistic and such an effect will be observed in real
experiments. We also discuss the simple phenomenological explanation to obtain
the asymmetry.
