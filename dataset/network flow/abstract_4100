We show that the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded for the normalized
Kahler-Ricci flow on a Kahler manifold with semi-ample canonical bundle. In
particular, the normalized Kahler-Ricci flow has long time existence if and
only if the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded, for Kahler surfaces,
projective manifolds of complex dimension three, and for projective manifolds
of all dimensions if assuming the abundance conjecture.
