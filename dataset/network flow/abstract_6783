The phenomenon of the very local ($\le3$ Mpc) Hubble flow is studied on the
basis of the data of recent precision observations. A set of computer
simulations is performed to trace the trajectories of the flow galaxies back in
time to the epoch of the formation of the Local Group. It is found that the
`initial conditions' of the flow are drastically different from the linear
velocity-distance relation. The simulations enable also to recognize the major
trends of the flow evolution and identify the dynamical role of universal
antigravity produced by cosmic vacuum.
