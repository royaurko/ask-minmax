This paper deals with uncertain parabolic fluid flow problem where the
uncertainty occurs due to the initial conditions and parameters involved in the
system. Uncertain values are considered as fuzzy and these are handled through
a recently developed method. Here the concepts of fuzzy numbers are combined
with Finite Difference Method (FDM) and then Fuzzy Finite Difference Method
(FFDM) has been proposed. The proposed FFDM has been used to solve the fluid
flow problem bounded by two parallel plates. Finally sensitivity of the fuzzy
parameters has also been analysed.
