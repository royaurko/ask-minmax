Transmitting messages in the most efficient way as possible has always been
one of politicians main concerns during electoral processes. Due to the rapidly
growing number of users, online social networks have become ideal platforms for
politicians to interact with their potential voters. Exploiting the available
potential of these tools to maximize their influence over voters is one of
politicians actual challenges. To step in this direction, we have analyzed the
user activity in the online social network Twitter, during the 2011 Spanish
Presidential electoral process, and found that such activity is correlated with
the election results. We introduce a new measure to study political support in
Twitter, which we call the Relative Support. We have also characterized user
behavior by analyzing the structural and dynamical patterns of the complex
networks emergent from the mention and retweet networks. Our results suggest
that the collective attention is driven by a very small fraction of users.
Furthermore we have analyzed the interactions taking place among politicians,
observing a lack of debate. Finally we develop a network growth model to
reproduce the interactions taking place among politicians.
