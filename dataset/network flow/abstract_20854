In this paper we develop scheduling policies that maximize the stability
region of a wireless network under the assumption that mutual information
accumulation is implemented at the physical layer. When the link quality
between nodes is not sufficiently high that a packet can be decoded within a
single slot, the system can accumulate information across multiple slots,
eventually decoding the packet. The result is an expanded stability region. The
accumulation process over weak links is temporally coupled and therefore does
not satisfy the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption that
underlies many previous analysis in this area. Therefore the problem setting
also poses new analytic challenges. We propose two dynamic scheduling
algorithms to cope with the non-i.i.d nature of the decoding. The first
performs scheduling every $T$ slots, and approaches the boundary of the
stability region as $T$ gets large, but at the cost of increased average delay.
The second introduces virtual queues for each link and constructs a virtual
system wherein two virtual nodes are introduced for each link. The constructed
virtual system is shown to have the same stability region as the original
system. Through controlling the virtual queues in the constructed system, we
avoid the non-i.i.d analysis difficulty and attain the full stability region.
We derive performance bounds for both algorithms and compare them through
simulation results.
