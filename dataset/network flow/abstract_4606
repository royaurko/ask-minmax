Propagation of contagion in networks depends on the graph topology. This
paper is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behavior of the extended
contact processes on static, undirected, finite-size networks. This is a
contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate (also known as the
{\epsilon}-SIS, {\epsilon} susceptible-infected-susceptible, model [1]). The
only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this
process is for complete networks. For large networks with arbitrary topology,
it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it
requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is
exponential in N , the size of the network. We show that, for a certain range
of the network process parameters, the equilibrium distribution of the extended
contact process on arbitrary, finite-size networks is well approximated by the
equilibrium distribution of the scaled SIS process, which we derived in
closed-form in prior work. We confirm this result with numerical simulations
comparing the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process with
that of a scaled SIS process. We use this approximation to decide, in
polynomial-time, which agents and network substructures are more susceptible to
infection by the extended contact process.
