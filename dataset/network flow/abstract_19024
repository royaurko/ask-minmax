Complex network theory has been used to study complex systems. However, many
real life systems involve multiple kinds of objects . They can't be described
by simple graphs. In order to provide complete information of these systems, we
extend the concept of evolving models of complex networks to hypernetworks. In
this work, we firstly propose a non-uniform hypernetwork model with
attractiveness, and obtain the stationary average hyperdegree distribution of
the non-uniform hypernetwork. Furthermore, we develop a model for weighted
hypernetworks that couples the establishment of new hyperedges and nodes and
the weights' dynamical evolution. We obtain the stationary average hyperdegree
and hyperstrength distribution by using the hyperdegree distribution of the
hypernetwork model with attractiveness, respectively. In particular, the model
yields a nontrivial time evolution of nodes' properties and scale-free behavior
for the hyperdegree and hyperstrength distribution. It is expected that our
work may give help to the study of the hypernetworks in real-world systems.
