Stochastic differential games are considered in a non-Markovian setting.
Typically, in stochastic differential games the modulating process of the
diffusion equation describing the state flow is taken to be Markovian. Then
Nash equilibria or other types of solution such as Pareto equilibria are
constructed using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. But in a
non-Markovian setting the HJB method is not applicable. To examine the
non-Markovian case, this paper considers the situation in which the modulating
process is a fractional Brownian motion. Fractional noise calculus is used for
such models to find the Nash equilibria explicitly. Although fractional
Brownian motion is taken as the modulating process because of its versatility
in modeling in the fields of finance and networks, the approach in this paper
has the merit of being applicable to more general Gaussian stochastic
differential games with only slight conceptual modifications. This work has
applications in finance to stock price modeling which incorporates the effect
of institutional investors, and to stochastic differential portfolio games in
markets in which the stock prices follow diffusions modulated with fractional
Brownian motion.
