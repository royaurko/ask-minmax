We investigate a class of nonlocal conservation laws with the nonlinear
advection coupling both local and nonlocal mechanism, which arises in several
applications such as the collective motion of cells and traffic flows. It is
proved that the $C^1$ solution regularity of this class of conservation laws
will persist at least for a short time. This persistency may continue as long
as the solution gradient remains bounded. Based on this result, we further
identify sub-thresholds for finite time shock formation in traffic flow models
with Arrhenius look-ahead dynamics.
