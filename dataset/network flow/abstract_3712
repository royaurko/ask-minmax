Commonplace in oceanography is the collection of ocean drifter positions.
Ocean drifters are devices that sit on the surface of the ocean and move with
the flow, transmitting their position via GPS to stations on land. Using
drifter data, it is possible to obtain a posterior on the underlying flow. This
problem, however, is highly underdetermined. Through controlling an ocean
drifter, we attempt to improve our knowledge of the underlying flow. We do this
by instructing the drifter to explore parts of the flow currently uncharted,
thereby obtaining fresh observations. The efficacy of a control is determined
by its effect on the variance of the posterior distribution. A smaller variance
is interpreted as a better understanding of the flow. We show a systematic
reduction in variance can be achieved by utilising controls that allow the
drifter to navigate new or interesting flow structures, a good example of which
are eddies.
