Detailed data describing the motion of a rigid sphere settling in unperturbed
fluid is generated by means of highly-accurate spectral/spectral-element
simulations with the purpose of serving as a future benchmark case. A single
solid-to-fluid density ratio of 1.5 is chosen, while the value of the Galileo
number is varied from 144 to 250 such as to cover the four basic regimes of
particle motion (steady vertical, steady oblique, oscillating oblique,
chaotic). This corresponds to a range of the particle Reynolds number from 185
to 365. In addition to the particle velocity data, extracts of the fluid
velocity field are provided, as well as the pressure distribution on the
sphere's surface. Furthermore, the same solid-fluid system is simulated with a
particular non-boundary-conforming approach, i.e. the immersed boundary method
proposed by Uhlmann (JCP 2005), using various spatial resolutions. It is shown
that the current benchmark case allows to adjust the resolution requirements
for a given error tolerance in each flow regime.
