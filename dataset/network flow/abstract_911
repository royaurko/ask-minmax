This paper studies the problem of congestion control and scheduling in ad hoc
wireless networks that have to support a mixture of best-effort and real-time
traffic. Optimization and stochastic network theory have been successful in
designing architectures for fair resource allocation to meet long-term
throughput demands. However, to the best of our knowledge, strict packet delay
deadlines were not considered in this framework previously. In this paper, we
propose a model for incorporating the quality of service (QoS) requirements of
packets with deadlines in the optimization framework. The solution to the
problem results in a joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm which
fairly allocates resources to meet the fairness objectives of both elastic and
inelastic flows, and per-packet delay requirements of inelastic flows.
