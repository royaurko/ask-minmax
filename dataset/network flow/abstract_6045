Paths are important structural elements in complex networks because they are
finite (unlike walks), related to effective node coverage (minimum spanning
trees), and can be understood as being dual to star connectivity. This article
introduces the concept of random path applies it for the investigation of
structural properties of complex networks and as the means to estimate the
longest path. Random paths are obtained by selecting one of the network nodes
at random and performing a random self-avoiding walk (here called path-walk)
until its termination. It is shown that the distribution of random paths are
markedly different for diverse complex network models (i.e. Erdos-Renyi,
Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, a geographical model, as well as two recently
introduced path-based network types), with the BA structures yielding the
shortest random walks, while the longest paths are produced by WS networks.
Random paths are also explored as the means to estimate the longest paths (i.e.
several random paths are obtained and the longest taken). The convergence to
the longest path and its properties ire characterized with respect to several
networks models. Several results are reported and discussed, including the
markedly distinct lengths of the longest paths obtained for the different
network models.
