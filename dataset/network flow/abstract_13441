We analyze the isometries of Type IIB flux vacua based on the
Papadopolous-Tseytlin ansatz and identify the related massless bulk vector
fields. To this end we devise a general ansatz, valid in any flux
compactification, for the fluctuations of the metric and p-forms that
diagonalizes the coupled equations. We then illustrate the procedure in the
simple case of holographic flows driven by the RR 3-form flux only.
Specifically we study the fate of the isometries of the Maldacena-Nunez
solution associated to wrapped D5-branes.
