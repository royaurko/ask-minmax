We analyse the large-scale structure of the journal citation network built
from information contained in the Thomson-Reuters Journal Citation Reports. To
this end, we take advantage of the network science paraphernalia and explore
network properties like density, percolation robustness, average and largest
node distances, reciprocity, incoming and outgoing degree distributions, as
well as assortative mixing by node degrees. We discover that the journal
citation network is a dense, robust, small, and reciprocal world. Furthermore,
in and out node degree distributions display long-tails, with few vital
journals and many trivial ones, and they are strongly positively correlated.
