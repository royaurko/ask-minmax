The equivalent resistance between the origin and any other lattice site, in
an infinite Face Centered Cubic network consisting from identical resistors,
has been expressed rationally in terms of the known value and . The asymptotic
behavior is investigated, and some calculated values for the equivalent
resistance are presented.
