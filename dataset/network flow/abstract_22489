An adhesive unilateral contact of elastic bodies with a small viscosity in
the linear Kelvin-Voigt rheology at small strains is scrutinized. The flow-rule
for debonding the adhesive is considered rate-independent and unidirectional,
and inertia is neglected. The asymptotics for the viscosity approaching zero
towards purely elastic material involves a certain defect-like measure
recording in some sense natural additional energy dissipated in the bulk due to
(vanishing) viscosity, which is demonstrated on particular 2-dimensional
computational simulations based on a semi-implicit time discretisation and a
spacial discretisation implemented by boundary-element method.
