The hydrodynamic model for the expansion of the fireball in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions is presented. Calculations using relativistic
hydrodynamics of a fluid with small viscosity yield a satisfactory description
of the experimental data on the particle spectra, the elliptic flow or the
interferometry radii.
