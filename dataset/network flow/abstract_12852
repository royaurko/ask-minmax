Rotating transonic flows are long known to admit standing or oscillating
shocks and that the excess thermal energy in the post shock flow drives a part
of the infalling matter as bipolar outflows. We compute massloss from a viscous
advective disc. We show that the mass outflow rate decreases with increasing
viscosity of the accretion disc, since viscosity weakens the centrifugal
barrier that generates the shock. We also show that the optical depth of the
post-shock matter decreases due to massloss which may soften the spectrum from
such a mass losing disc.
