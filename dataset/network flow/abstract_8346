We present a model for the description of the evolution of contacts among
individuals in a network. At each time step each individual is associated with
a domain or neighborhood of fully connected agents.The dynamics of this
changing neighborhood will later be translated into a situation where the links
between individuals are also dynamic. A characterization in terms of the
parameters that govern the evolution of the network and a comparison to
previous work on Small World networks is presented as well.
