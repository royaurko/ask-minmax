We report the measurement of anisotropic flow at RHIC - PHENIX experiment. We
present the v_4 results at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV in Au+Au collision. The scaling
ratio of v_4/(v_2)^2 is about 1.5 and it is found to be smaller than the
prediction from simple coalescence model. The v_2 for high p_T identified
particles ($\sim$ 5 GeV/c) measured with Aerogel Cherenkov Counter are
presented. We discuss the constituent quark scaling of v_2 for identified
particles. We also report the first observation of v_2 for inclusive charged
hadrons as well as identified hadrons at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV in Cu+Cu
collisions. The system size dependence of v_2 and scaling properties are
discussed.
