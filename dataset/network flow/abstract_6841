I generalize the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations to correlators of spectral
flowed fields in AdS3 string theory. If spectral flow is preserved or violated
by one unit, the resulting equations are equivalent to the KZ equations. If
spectral flow is violated by two units or more, only some linear combinations
of the KZ equations hold, but extra equations appear. Then I explicitly show
how these correlators and the associated conformal blocks are related to
Liouville theory correlators and conformal blocks with degenerate field
insertions, where each unit of spectral flow violation removes one degenerate
field. A similar relation to Liouville theory holds for noncompact
parafermions.
