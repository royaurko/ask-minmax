Surface flows are excited by steadily adding spherical glass beads to the top
of a heap. To simultaneously characterize the fast single-grain dynamics and
the much slower collective intermittency of the flow, we extend
photon-correlation spectroscopy via fourth-order temporal correlations in the
scattered light intensity. We find that microscopic grain dynamics during an
avalanche are similar to those in the continuous flow just above the
transition. We also find that there is a minimum jamming time, even arbitrarily
close to the transition.
