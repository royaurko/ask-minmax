The graph of communities is a network emerging above the level of individual
nodes in the hierarchical organisation of a complex system. In this graph the
nodes correspond to communities (highly interconnected subgraphs, also called
modules or clusters), and the links refer to members shared by two communities.
Our analysis indicates that the development of this modular structure is driven
by preferential attachment, in complete analogy with the growth of the
underlying network of nodes. We study how the links between communities are
born in a growing co-contributorship network, and introduce a simple model for the
dynamics of overlapping communities.
