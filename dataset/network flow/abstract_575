Full exploitation of the bandwidth resources of Wireless Networks is
challenging because of the sharing of the radio medium among neighboring nodes.
Practical algorithms and distributed schemes that tries to optimising the use
of the network radio resources. In this technical report we present the proof
that maximising the network capacity is is an APX Complete problem (not
approximable within 1/(1 - 2^(-k)) - eps for eps > 0).
