Powerful spectrum decision schemes enable cognitive radios (CRs) to find
transmission opportunities in spectral resources allocated exclusively to the
primary users. One of the key effecting factor on the CR network throughput is
the spectrum sensing sequence used by each secondary user. In this paper,
secondary users' throughput maximization through finding an appropriate sensing
matrix (SM) is investigated. To this end, first the average throughput of the
CR network is evaluated for a given SM. Then, an optimization problem based on
the maximization of the network throughput is formulated in order to find the
optimal SM. As the optimum solution is very complicated, to avoid its major
challenges, three novel sub optimum solutions for finding an appropriate SM are
proposed for various cases including perfect and non-perfect sensing. Despite
of having less computational complexities as well as lower consumed energies,
the proposed solutions perform quite well compared to the optimum solution (the
optimum SM). The structure and performance of the proposed SM setting schemes
are discussed in detail and a set of illustrative simulation results is
presented to validate their efficiencies.
