A global existence result is established for a free boundary problem of
planar magnetohydrodynamic fluid flows with radiation and large initial data.
Particularly, it is novelty to embrace the constant transport coefficient. As a
by-product, the free boundary is shown to expand outward at an algebraic rate
from above in time.
