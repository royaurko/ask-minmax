In this article an upscaled model is presented, for complex networks with
highly clustered regions exchanging some abstract quantities in both,
microscale and macroscale level. Such an intricate system is approximated by a
partitioned open map in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The behavior of
the quantities is modeled as flowing in the map constructed and thus it is
subject to be described by partial differential equations. We follow this
approach using the Darcy Porous Media, saturated fluid flow model in mixed
variational formulation.
