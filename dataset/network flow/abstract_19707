The origin of the azimuthal anisotropy in particle yields at high pT (pT > 5
GeV/c) in RHIC collisions remains an intriguing puzzle. Traditional flow and
parton energy loss models have failed to completely explain the large v2
observed at high pT. Measurement of this parameter at high pT will help to gain
an understanding of the interplay between flow, recombination and energy loss,
and the role they play in the transition from soft to hard physics. Neutral
mesons measured in the PHENIX experiment provide an ideal observable for such
studies. We present recent measurements of \piz yields with respect to the
reaction plane, and discuss the impact current models have on our understanding
of these mechanisms.
