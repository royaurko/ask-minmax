In this paper, we study cryptography from a geometrical viewpoint. Let N be a
network, we endow N with a natural Grothendieck topology. We use geometric
representations of cohomological classes to define encryptions protocols. Link
to link encryption is related to the notion of torsors. We use the notion of
connective structure defined on a gerbe to define public encryption. We study
statistical properties of data conveyed in a network, and define an entropy
cocycle.
