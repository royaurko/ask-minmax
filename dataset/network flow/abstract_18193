We investigate the networks of committee and subcommittee assignments in the
United States House of Representatives from the 101st--108th Congresses, with
the committees connected by ``interlocks'' or common membership. We examine the
community structure in these networks using several methods, revealing strong
links between certain committees as well as an intrinsic hierarchical structure
in the House as a whole. We identify structural changes, including additional
hierarchical levels and higher modularity, resulting from the 1994 election, in
which the Republican party earned majority status in the House for the first
time in more than forty years. We also combine our network approach with
analysis of roll call votes using singular value decomposition to uncover
correlations between the political and organizational structure of House
committees.
