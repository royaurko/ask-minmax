Many realistic networks are scale-free, with small characteristic path
lengths, high clustering, and power law in their degree distribution. They can
be obtained by dynamical networks in which a preferential attachment process
takes place. However, this mechanism is non-local, in the sense that it
requires knowledge of the whole graph in order for the graph to be updated.
Instead, if preferential attachment and realistic networks occur in physical
systems, these features need to emerge from a local model. In this paper, we
propose a local model and show that a possible ingredient (which is often
underrated) for obtaining scale-free networks with local rules is memory. Such
a model can be realised in solid-state circuits, using non-linear passive
elements with memory such as memristors, and thus can be tested experimentally.
