We use hydrodynamics to generate freeze-out configurations for non-central
heavy-ion collisions at present and future collider energies. Such collisions
are known to produce strong elliptic flow. The accompanying space-time
structure of the source at freeze-out is analyzed using pion interferometry.
Between RHIC and LHC energies the source deformation in the transverse plane
changes sign. This leaves characteristic signatures in the emission angle
dependence of the HBT radii.
