We show that multipole solitons can be made stable via vectorial coupling in
bulk nonlocal nonlinear media. Such vector solitons are composed of mutually
incoherent nodeless and multipole components jointly inducing a nonlinear
refractive index profile. We found that stabilization of the otherwise highly
unstable multipoles occurs below a maximum energy flow. Such threshold is
determined by the nonlocality degree.
