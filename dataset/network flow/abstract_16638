The axiomatic theory of ideally glassy networks, which has proved effective
in describing phase diagrams and many properties of chalcogenide, oxide, and
even molecular glasses, is here broadened to describe both geometrical
properties, such as the first sharp diffraction peak, and kinetic properties,
such as the nonreversible enthalpy of the glass transition, as measured by
modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The discussion shows why the
latter is such an effective tool for identifying strong glasses.
