A novel channel representation for a two-hop decentralized wireless relay
network (DWRN) is proposed, where the relays operate in a completely
distributive fashion. The modeling paradigm applies an analogous approach to
the description method for a double-directional multipath propagation channel,
and takes into account the finite system spatial resolution and the extended
relay listening/transmitting time. Specifically, the double-directional
information azimuth spectrum (IAS) is formulated to provide a compact
representation of information flows in a DWRN. The proposed channel
representation is then analyzed from a geometrically-based statistical modeling
perspective. Finally, we look into the problem of relay network tomography
(RNT), which solves an inverse problem to infer the internal structure of a
DWRN by using the instantaneous doubledirectional IAS recorded at multiple
measuring nodes exterior to the relay region.
