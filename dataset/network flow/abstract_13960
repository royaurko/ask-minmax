The nature of dynamo action in shear flows prone to magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities is investigated using the magnetorotational dynamo in Keplerian
shear flow as a prototype problem. Using direct numerical simulations and
Newton's method, we compute an exact time-periodic magnetorotational dynamo
solution to the three-dimensional dissipative incompressible
magnetohydrodynamic equations with rotation and shear. We discuss the physical
mechanism behind the cycle and show that it results from a combination of
linear and nonlinear interactions between a large-scale axisymmetric toroidal
magnetic field and non-axisymmetric perturbations amplified by the
magnetorotational instability. We demonstrate that this large scale dynamo
mechanism is overall intrinsically nonlinear and not reducible to the standard
mean-field dynamo formalism. Our results therefore provide clear evidence for a
generic nonlinear generation mechanism of time-dependent coherent large-scale
magnetic fields in shear flows and call for new theoretical dynamo models.
These findings may offer important clues to understand the transitional and
statistical properties of subcritical magnetorotational turbulence.
