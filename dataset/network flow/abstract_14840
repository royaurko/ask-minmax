We study the dilaton action induced by RG flows between holographic CFT fixed
points. For this purpose we introduce a general bulk effective theory for the
goldstone boson of the broken spacetime symmetry, providing an AdS analog of
the EFT of Inflation. In two dimensions, we use the effective theory to compute
the dilaton action, as well as the UV and IR conformal anomalies, without
further assumptions. In higher dimensions we take a `slow-flow' limit analogous
to the assumption of slow-roll in Inflation, and in this context we obtain the
dilaton action, focusing on terms proportional to the difference of the A-type
anomalies. We include Gauss-Bonnet terms in the gravitational action in order
to verify that our method correctly differentiates between A-type and other
anomalies.
