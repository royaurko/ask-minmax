Starting from microscopic interaction rules we derive kinetic models of
Fokker--Planck type for vehicular traffic flow. The derivation is based on
taking a suitable asymptotic limit of the corresponding Boltzmann model. As
particular cases, the derived models comprise existing models.
  New Fokker--Planck models are also given and their differences to existing
models are highlighted. Finally, we report on numerical experiments.
