Methane adsorption and its effect on fluid flow in shale matrix are
investigated through multi-scale simulation scheme by using molecular dynamics
(MD) and lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods. Equilibrium MD simulations are
conducted to study methane adsorption on the organic and inorganic walls of
nanopores in shale matrix with different pore sizes and pressures. Density and
pressure distributions within the adsorbed layer and the free gas region are
discussed. The illumination of the MD results on larger scale LB simulations is
presented. Pressure-dependent thickness of adsorbed layer should be adopted and
the transport of adsorbed layer should be properly considered in LB
simulations. LB simulations, which are based on a generalized Navier-Stokes
equation for flow through low-permeability porous media with slippage, are
conducted by taking into consideration the effects of adsorbed layer. It is
found that competitive effects of slippage and adsorbed layer exist on the
permeability of shale matrix, leading to different changing trends of the
apparent permeability.
