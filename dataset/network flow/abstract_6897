Elliptic flow ($v_2$) and hexadecupole flow ($v_4$) of light clusters have
been studied in details for 25 MeV/nucleon $^{86}$Kr + $^{124}$Sn at large
impact parameters by Quantum Molecular Dynamics model with different potential
parameters. Four parameter sets which include soft or hard equation of state
(EOS) with/without symmetry energy term are used. Both number-of-nucleon ($A$)
scaling of the elliptic flow versus transverse momentum ($p_t$) and the scaling
of $v_4/A^{2}$ versus $(p_t/A)^2$ have been demonstrated for the light clusters
in all above calculation conditions. It was also found that the ratio of
$v_4/{v_2}^2$ keeps a constant of 1/2 which is independent of $p_t$ for all the
light fragments. By comparisons among different combinations of EOS and
symmetry potential term, the results show that the above scaling behaviors are
solid which do not depend the details of potential, while the strength of flows
is sensitive to EOS and symmetry potential term.
