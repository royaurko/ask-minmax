The results of investigations of main characteristics of a one-dimensional
percolation theory (percolation threshold, critical exponents of correlation
radius and specific heat, and free energy) are presented for the problem of
bonds and sites. For the first time it is shown that for a finite-size system
the stability condition is fulfilled while the scaling hypothesis is
inacceptable for one-dimensional bond problem.
