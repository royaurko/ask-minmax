In my previaou paper of K. Horihata, we have proposed a Ginzburg-Landau
system with a time-dependent parameter and then passing to the limit we have
constructed a harmonic heat flow into spheres. Thanks to this scheme, we
establish a few energy inequalities of our flow: (i) monotonical inequalities
and (ii) a reverse Poincare inequality at any boundary point. These
inequalities (i) and (ii) derive the smaller estimates on the set on
noncontinuouspoints for pur flow contrast to the former results. We refer to
them by Y. Chen and Y. Chen, J. Li, F. H. Lin. Next we introduce two sufficient
condition for the whole domain's regularity for it; The one is a boundary
energy smallness and the another is an one-sided condition proposed by S.
Hildebrandt and K. O. Widman.
