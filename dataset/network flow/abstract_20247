We study a quasilinear parabolic Cauchy problem with a cumulative
distribution function on the real line as an initial condition. We call
'probabilistic solution' a weak solution which remains a cumulative
distribution function at all times. We prove the uniqueness of such a solution
and we deduce the existence from a propagation of chaos result on a system of
scalar diffusion processes, the interactions of which only depend on their
ranking. We then investigate the long time behaviour of the solution. Using a
probabilistic argument and under weak assumptions, we show that the flow of the
Wasserstein distance between two solutions is contractive. Under more stringent
conditions ensuring the regularity of the probabilistic solutions, we finally
derive an explicit formula for the time derivative of the flow and we deduce
the convergence of solutions to equilibrium.
