Doppler shifts of the Fe I spectral line at lambda5250 Angstroms from the
full solar disk obtained over the period 1986 to 2009 are analyzed to determine
the circulation velocity of the solar surface along meridional planes.
Simultaneous measurements of the Zeeman splitting of this line are used to
obtain measurements of the solar magnetic field that are used to select low
field points and impose corrections for the magnetically induced Doppler shift.
The data utilized is from a new reduction that preserves the full spatial
resolution of the original observations so that the circulation flow can be
followed to latitudes of 80 degrees N/S. The deduced meridional flow is shown
to differ from the circulation velocities derived from magnetic pattern
movements. A reversed circulation pattern is seen in polar regions for three
successive solar minima. An surge in circulation velocity at low latitudes is
seen during the rising phases of cycles 22 and 23.
