We develop an effective potential approach for assessing the flow of charge
within a two-dimensional donor-acceptor/metal network based on core-level
shifts. To do so, we perform both density functional theory (DFT) calculations
and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the core-level
shifts for three different monolayers adsorbed on a Ag substrate. Specifically,
we consider perfluorinated pentacene (PFP), copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and
their 1:1 mixture (PFP+CuPc) adsorbed on Ag(111).
