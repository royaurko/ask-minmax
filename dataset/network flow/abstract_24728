Personalized PageRank vectors used for many community detection and graph
diffusion problems have a subtle dependence on a parameter epsilon that
controls their accuracy. This parameter governs the sparsity of the solution
and can be interpreted as a regularization parameter. We study algorithms to
estimate the solution path as a function of the sparsity and propose two
methods for this task. The first computes a full solution path and we prove it
remains localized in the graph for fast runtimes. Using this method, we propose
a PageRank solution path plot to diagnose new aspects of the behavior of
personalized PageRank. The second method is a faster approximation to the
solution path on a grid of logarithmically-spaced values that uses an
interesting application of bucket sort to make the process efficient. We
demonstrate that both of these algorithms are fast and local on large networks.
