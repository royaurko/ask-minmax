We discuss the presence of a light dilaton in CFTs deformed by a
nearly-marginal operator O, in the holographic realizations consisting of
confining RG flows that end on a soft wall. Generically, the deformations
induce a condensate <O>, and the dilaton mode can be identified as the
fluctuation of <O>. We obtain a mass formula for the dilaton as a certain
average along the RG flow. The dilaton is naturally light whenever i)
confinement is reached fast enough (such as via the condensation of O) and ii)
the beta function is small (walking) at the condensation scale. These
conditions are satisfied for a class of models with a bulk pseudo-Goldstone
boson whose potential is nearly flat at small field and exponential at large
field values. Thus, the recent observation by Contino, Pomarol and Rattazzi
holds in CFTs with a single nearly-marginal operator. We also discuss the
holographic method to compute the condensate <O>, based on solving the
first-order nonlinear differential equation that the beta function satisfies.
