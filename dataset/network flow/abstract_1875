Spectrum refarming (SR) refers to a radio resource management technique which
allows different generations of cellular networks to operate in the same radio
spectrum. In this paper, an underlay SR model is proposed, in which an
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system refarms the
spectrum of a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system through intelligently
exploiting the interference margin provided by the CDMA system. We investigate
the mutual effect of the two systems by evaluating the asymptotic
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the users, based on which the
interference margin tolerable by the CDMA system is determined. By using the
interference margin together with the transmit power constraints, the uplink
resource allocation problem of OFDMA system is formulated and solved through
dual decomposition method. Simulation results have verified our theoretical
analysis, and validated the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation
algorithm and its capability to protect the legacy CDMA users. The proposed SR
system requires the least information flow from the CDMA system to the OFDMA
system, and importantly, no upgrading of legacy CDMA system is needed; thus it
can be deployed by telecom operators to maximize the spectral efficiency of
their cellular networks.
