Smart grid, regarded as the next generation power grid, uses two-way flows of
electricity and information to create a widely distributed automated energy
delivery network. In this work we present our vision on smart grid from the
perspective of wireless communications and networking technologies. We present
wireless communication and networking paradigms for four typical scenarios in
the future smart grid and also point out the research challenges of the
wireless communication and networking technologies used in smart grid
