We analyze azimuthal anisotropy in heavy ion collisions related to the
reaction plane in terms of standard reggeon approach and find that it is
nonzero even when the final state interaction is switched off. This effect can
be interpreted in terms of partonic structure of colliding nuclei. We use
Feynman diagram analysis to describe details of this mechanism. Main
qualitative features of the appropriate azimuthal correlations are discussed.
