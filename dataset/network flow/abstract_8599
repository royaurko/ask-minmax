In the past, online social networks (OSN) like Facebook and Twitter became
powerful instruments for communication and networking. Unfortunately, they have
also become a welcome target for socialbot attacks. Therefore, a deep
understanding of the nature of such attacks is important to protect the
Eco-System of OSNs. In this extended abstract we propose a categorization
scheme of social bot attacks that aims at providing an overview of the state of
the art of techniques in this emerging field. Finally, we demonstrate the
usefulness of our categorization scheme by characterizing recent socialbot
attacks according to our categorization scheme.
