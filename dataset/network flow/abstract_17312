The contributors investigate the impact of external sources on the pattern
formation of concentration profiles of passive tracers in a two-dimensional
shear flow. By using the pullback attractor technique for the associated
nonautonomous dynamical system, it is shown that a unique time-almost periodic
concentration profile exists for time-almost periodic external source.
