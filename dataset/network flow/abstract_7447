We present a dynamic van der Waals theory. It is useful to study phase
separation when the temperature varies in space. We show that if heat flow is
applied to liquid suspending a gas droplet at zero gravity, a convective flow
occurs such that the temperature gradient within the droplet nearly vanishes.
As the heat flux is increased, the droplet becomes attached to the heated wall
that is wetted by liquid in equilibrium. In one case corresponding to partial
wetting by gas, an apparent contact angle can be defined. In the ther case with
larger heat flux, the droplet completely wets the heated wall expelling liquid.
