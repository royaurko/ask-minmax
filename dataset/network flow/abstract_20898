Cancer forms a robust system and progresses as stages over time typically
with increasing aggressiveness and worsening prognosis. Characterizing these
stages and identifying the genes driving transitions between them is critical
to understand cancer progression and to develop effective anti-cancer
therapies. Here, we propose a novel model of the 'cancer system' as a Boolean
state space in which a Boolean network, built from protein interaction and
gene-expression data from different stages of cancer, transits between Boolean
satisfiability states by "editing" interactions and "flipping" genes. The
application of our model (called BoolSpace) on three case studies - pancreatic
and breast tumours in human and post spinal-cord injury in rats - reveals
valuable insights into the phenomenon of cancer progression. In particular, we
notice that several of the genes flipped are serine/threonine kinases which act
as natural cellular switches and that different sets of genes are flipped
during the initial and final stages indicating a pattern to tumour progression.
We hypothesize that robustness of cancer partly stems from "passing of the
baton" between genes at different stages, and therefore an effective therapy
should target a "cover set" of these genes. A C/C++ implementation of BoolSpace
