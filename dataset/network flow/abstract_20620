We analyze the temporal behavior of Network Bright Points (NBPs) searching
for low-atmosphere signatures of flares occuring on the magnetic network. We
make use of a set of data acquired during coordinated observations between
ground based observatories (NSO/Sacramento Peak) and the MDI instrument onboard
SOHO. Light curves in chromospheric spectral lines show only small amplitude
temporal variations, without any sudden intensity enhancement that could
suggest the presence of a transient phenomenon such as a (micro) flare. Only
one NBP shows spikes of downward velocity, of the order of 2 - 4 Km/s,
considered as signals of compression associated to a (micro) flare occurrence.
For this same NBP, we also find a peculiar relationship between the magnetic
and velocity fields fluctuations, as measured by MDI. Only for this point the B
- V fluctuations are well correlated, suggesting the presence of magneto
acoustic waves propagating along the magnetic structure. This correlation is
lost during the compression episodes and resumes afterward. An A6 GOES soft
X-ray burst is temporally associated with the downward velocity episodes,
suggesting that this NBP is the footpoint of the flaring loop. This event has a
total thermal energy content of about $10^{28}$ erg, and hence belongs to the
microflare class.
