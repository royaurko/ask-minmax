A persistent challenge in Complex Systems (CS) research is the
phenomenological reconstruction of systems from raw data. In order to face the
problem, the use of sound features to reason on the system from data processing
is a key step. In the specific case of complex societal systems, sentiment
analysis allows to mirror (part of) the affective dimension. However it is not
reasonable to think that individual sentiment categorization can encompass the
new affective phenomena in digital social networks.
  The present papers addresses the problem of isolating sentiment concepts
which emerge in social networks. In an analogy to Artificial Intelligent
Singularity, we propose the study and analysis of these new complex sentiment
structures and how they are similar to or diverge from classic conceptual
structures associated to sentiment lexicons. The conjecture is that it is
highly probable that hypercomplex sentiment structures -not explained with
human categorizations- emerge from high dynamic social information networks.
Roughly speaking, new sentiment can emerge from the new global nervous systems
as it occurs in humans.
