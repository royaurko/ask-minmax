We study pattern-forming instabilities in reaction-advection-diffusion
systems. We develop an approach based on Lyapunov-Bloch exponents to figure out
the impact of a spatially periodic mixing flow on the stability of a spatially
homogeneous state. We deal with the flows periodic in space that may have
arbitrary time dependence. We propose a discrete in time model, where reaction,
advection, and diffusion act as successive operators, and show that a mixing
advection can lead to a pattern-forming instability in a two-component system
where only one of the species is advected. Physically, this can be explained as
crossing a threshold of Turing instability due to effective increase of one of
the diffusion constants.
