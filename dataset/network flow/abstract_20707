Dynamic connectivity is a well-studied problem, but so far the most
compelling progress has been confined to the edge-update model: maintain an
understanding of connectivity in an undirected graph, subject to edge
insertions and deletions. In this paper, we study two more challenging, yet
equally fundamental problems.
  Subgraph connectivity asks to maintain an understanding of connectivity under
vertex updates: updates can turn vertices on and off, and queries refer to the
subgraph induced by "on" vertices. (For instance, this is closer to
applications in networks of routers, where node faults may occur.)
  We describe a data structure supporting vertex updates in O (m^{2/3})
amortized time, where m denotes the number of edges in the graph. This greatly
improves over the previous result [Chan, STOC'02], which required fast matrix
multiplication and had an update time of O(m^0.94). The new data structure is
also simpler.
  Geometric connectivity asks to maintain a dynamic set of n geometric objects,
and query connectivity in their intersection graph. (For instance, the
intersection graph of balls describes connectivity in a network of sensors with
bounded transmission radius.)
  Previously, nontrivial fully dynamic results were known only for special
cases like axis-parallel line segments and rectangles. We provide similarly
improved update times, O (n^{2/3}), for these special cases. Moreover, we show
how to obtain sublinear update bounds for virtually all families of geometric
objects which allow sublinear-time range queries, such as arbitrary 2D line
segments, d-dimensional simplices, and d-dimensional balls.
