We analyze the security and reliability of a recently proposed class of
public-key cryptosystems against attacks by uncontributorized parties who have
acquired partial knowledge of one or more of the private key components and/or
of the plaintext. Phase diagrams are presented, showing critical partial
knowledge levels required for uncontributorized decryption
