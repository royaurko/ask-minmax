Mesenchymal motion describes the movement of cells in biological tissues
formed by fiber networks. An important example is the migration of tumor cells
through collagen networks during the process of metastasis formation. We
investigate the mesenchymal motion model proposed by T. Hillen (J. Math. Biol.
53:585-616, 2006) in higher dimensions. We formulate the problem as an
evolution equation in a Banach space of measure-valued functions and use
methods from semigroup theory to show the global existence of classical
solutions. We investigate steady states of the model and show that patterns of
network type exist as steady states. For the case of constant fiber
distribution, we find an explicit solution and we prove the convergence to the
parabolic limit.
