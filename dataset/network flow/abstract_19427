We present here the first effort to compute synthetic synchrotron
polarization maps of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe). Our goal is to highlight how
polarization can be used as an additional diagnostic tool for the flow
structure in the inner regions of these nebulae. Recent numerical simulations
suggest the presence of flow velocities ~0.5 c in the surroundings of the
termination shock, where most of the high energy emission comes from. We
construct polarization maps taking into account relativistic effects like
Doppler boosting and position angle swing. The effect of different bulk
velocities is clarified with the help of a toy-model consisting of a uniformly
emitting torus. We also present a map based on recent numerical simulations of
the entire nebula and compare it with presently available data. The comparison
with upcoming high resolution observations could provide new insight into the
inner structure of the nebula and put constraints on the geometrical properties
of the magnetic field.
