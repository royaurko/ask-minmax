Granulation is a ubiquitous process crucial for many products ranging from
food and care products to pharmaceuticals. Granulation is the process in which
a powder is mixed with a small amount of liquid (binder) to form solid
agglomerates surrounded by air. By contrast, at low solid volume fractions
{\phi}, the mixing of solid and liquid produces suspensions. At intermediate
{\phi}, either granules or dense suspensions are produced, depending on the
applied stress. We address the question of how and when high shear mixing can
lead to the formation of jammed, non-flowing granules as {\phi} is varied. In
particular, we measure the shear rheology of a model system - a suspension of
glass beads with an average diameter of $\sim$ 7 {\mu}m - at solid volume
fractions {\phi} $\gtrsim$ 0.40. We show that recent insights into the role of
inter-particle friction in suspension rheology allow us to use flow data to
predict some of the boundaries between different types of granulation as {\phi}
increases from $\sim$ 0.4 towards and beyond the maximum packing point of
random close packing.
