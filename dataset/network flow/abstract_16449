Ridge and trough terrain is a common landform on icy satellites of the outer
solar system. Examples include the grooved terrain on Ganymede, gray bands on
Europa, coronae on Uranus's moon Miranda, and ridges and troughs in the
northern plains of Saturn's small, but active, moon Enceladus. Regardless of
setting, the heat flow and strain rates associated with the formation of each
of these terrains are similar: heat flows of order tens to a hundred milliwatts
per meter squared, and deformation rates of order $10^{-16}$ to $10^{-12}$
s$^{-1}$. Barr (2008) and Hammond & Barr (2014a) have previously shown that the
conditions associated with the formation of ridge and trough terrain on
Ganymede and the south polar terrain on Enceladus are consistent with
solid-state ice shell convection in a shell with a weak surface. Here, we show
that sluggish lid convection can simultaneously create the heat flow and
deformation appropriate for the formation of ridge and trough terrains on a
number of satellites. This conclusion holds regardless of the thickness of the
satellites' ice shells. For convection to deform their surfaces, the ice shells
must have yield stresses similar in magnitude to the daily tidal stresses
exerted by the gravitational pull from their parent planets. This suggests that
tidal and convective stresses must act together to deform the surface, and that
the spatial pattern of tidal cracking on the surfaces of the moons controls the
locations of ridge and trough terrain.
