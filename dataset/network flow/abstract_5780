We are interested in how to best communicate a real valued source to a number
of destinations (sinks) over a network with capacity constraints in a
collective fidelity metric over all the sinks, a problem which we call joint
network-source coding. It is demonstrated that multiple description codes along
with proper diversity routing provide a powerful solution to joint
network-source coding. A systematic optimization approach is proposed. It
consists of optimizing the network routing given a multiple description code
and designing optimal multiple description code for the corresponding optimized
routes.
