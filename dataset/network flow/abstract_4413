We study epidemic spreading processes in large networks, when the spread is
assisted by a small number of external agents: infection sources with bounded
spreading power, but whose movement is unrestricted vis-\`a-vis the underlying
network topology. For networks which are `spatially constrained', we show that
the spread of infection can be significantly speeded up even by a few such
external agents infecting randomly. Moreover, for general networks, we derive
upper-bounds on the order of the spreading time achieved by certain simple
(random/greedy) external-spreading policies. Conversely, for certain common
classes of networks such as line graphs, grids and random geometric graphs, we
also derive lower bounds on the order of the spreading time over all
(potentially network-state aware and adversarial) external-spreading policies;
these adversarial lower bounds match (up to logarithmic factors) the spreading
time achieved by an external agent with a random spreading policy. This
demonstrates that random, state-oblivious infection-spreading by an external
agent is in fact order-wise optimal for spreading in such spatially constrained
networks.
