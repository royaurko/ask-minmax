A diffusion's induced transport is defined for a linear model of a
Fokker-Plank equation under periodic boundary conditions in one-dimensional
geometry. The flow is generated by a diffusion and a periodic deriving force
induced by a velocity potential. An inverse problem is suggested for evaluating
the deriving force in terms of the response function associated with the flow.
It is also shown that the inverse problem can be partially solved under some
simplifying assumption.
