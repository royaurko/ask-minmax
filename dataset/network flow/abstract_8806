Orderliness, reflected via mathematical laws, is encountered in different
frameworks involving social groups. Here we show that a thermodynamics can be
constructed that macroscopically describes urban population flows. Microscopic
dynamic equations and simulations with random walkers underlie the macroscopic
approach. Our results might be regarded, via suitable analogies, as a step
towards building an explicit social thermodynamics.
