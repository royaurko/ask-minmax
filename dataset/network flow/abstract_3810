We develop a theoretical approach to percolation in random clustered
networks. We find that, although clustering in scale-free networks can strongly
affect some percolation properties, such as the size and the resilience of the
giant connected component, it cannot restore a finite percolation threshold. In
turn, this implies the absence of an epidemic threshold in this class of
networks extending, thus, this result to a wide variety of real scale-free
networks which shows a high level of transitivity. Our findings are in good
agreement with numerical simulations.
