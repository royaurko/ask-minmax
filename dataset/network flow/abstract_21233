The Fourier law and the diffusion equation are derived from the Schrodinger
equation of a diffusive medium (consisting of a random potential). The
theoretical model is backed by numerical simulation. This derivation can easily
be generalized to demonstrate the transition from any random wave equation to
the diffusive equation.
