We show that the removal of angular momentum is possible in the presence of
large scale magnetic stresses in geometrically thick, advective, sub-Keplerian
accretion flows around black holes in steady-state, in the complete absence of
alpha-viscosity. The efficiency of such an angular momentum transfer could be
equivalent to that of alpha-viscosity with alpha=0.01-0.08. Nevertheless,
required field is well below its equipartition value, leading to a magnetically
stable disk flow. This is essentially important in order to describe the hard
spectral state of the sources, when the flow is non/sub-Keplerian. We show in
our simpler 1.5-dimensional, vertically averaged disk model that larger the
vertical-gradient of azimuthal component of magnetic field, stronger the rate
of angular momentum transfer is, which in turn may lead to a faster rate of
outflowing matter. Finding efficient angular momentum transfer, in black hole
disks, via magnetic stresses alone is very interesting, when the generic origin
of alpha-viscosity is still being explored.
