We present a unified mathematical derivation of the asymptotic behaviour of
three of the main forms of \textit{directed transfer function} (DTF)
complementing recent partial directed coherence (PDC) results
\cite{Baccala2013}. Based on these results and numerical examples we argue for
a new directed `link' centered neural connectivity framework to replace the
widespread correlation based effective/functional network concepts so that
directed network influences between structures become classified as to whether
links are \textit{active} in a \textit{direct} or in an \textit{indirect} way
thereby leading to the new notions of \textit{Granger connectivity} and
\textit{Granger influenciability} which are more descriptive than speaking of
Granger causality alone.
