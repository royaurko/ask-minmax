In the past decade, Social Tagging Systems have attracted increasing
attention from both physical and computer science communities. Besides the
underlying structure and dynamics of tagging systems, many efforts have been
addressed to unify tagging information to reveal user behaviors and
preferences, extract the latent semantic relations among items, make
recommendations, and so on. Specifically, this article summarizes recent
progress about tag-aware recommender systems, emphasizing on the contributions
from three mainstream perspectives and approaches: network-based methods,
tensor-based methods, and the topic-based methods. Finally, we outline some
other tag-related works and future challenges of tag-aware recommendation
algorithms.
