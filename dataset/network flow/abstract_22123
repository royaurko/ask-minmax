The 'a - maximization' was introduced by K. Inrtiligator and B. Wecht for
finding anomalous dimensions of chiral superfields at the IR fixed points of
the RG flow. Using known explicit calculations of anomalous dimensions in the
perturbation theory of SQCD (with one or two additional adjoint fields), it is
checked here at the three-loop level.
