Small particles transported by a fluid medium do not necessarily have to
follow the flow. We show that for a wide class of time-periodic incompressible
flows inertial particles have a tendency to spontaneously align in
one-dimensional dynamic coherent structures. This effect may take place for
particles so small that often they would be expected to behave as passive
tracers and be used in PIV measurement technique. We link the particle tendency
to form one-dimensional structures to the nonlinear phenomenon of phase
locking. We propose that this general mechanism is, in particular, responsible
for the enigmatic formation of the `particle accumulation structures'
discovered experimentally in thermocapillary flows more than a decade ago and
unexplained until now.
