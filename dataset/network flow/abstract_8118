Orbital evolution of an interplanetary dust particle under action of an
interstellar gas flow is investigated. Secular time derivatives of the particle
orbital elements, for arbitrary orbit orientation, are presented. An important
result concerns secular evolution of semi-major axis. Secular semi-major axis
of the particle on a bound orbit decreases under the action of fast
interstellar gas flow. Possible types of evolution of other Keplerian orbital
elements are discussed. The paper compares influences of the Poynting-Robertson
effect, the radial solar wind and the interstellar gas flow on dynamics of the
dust particle in outer planetary region of the Solar System and beyond it, up
to 100 AU.
  Evolution of putative dust ring in the zone of the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt is
studied. Also non-radial solar wind and gravitational effect of major planets
may play an important role. Low inclination orbits of micron-sized dust
particles in the belt are not stable due to fast increase of eccentricity
caused by the interstellar gas flow and subsequent planetary perturbations -
the increase of eccentricity leads to planet crossing orbits of the particles.
  Gravitational and non-gravitational effects are treated in a way which fully
respects physics. As a consequence, some of the published results turned out to
be incorrect. Moreover, the paper treats the problem in a more general way than
it has been presented up to now.
  The influence of the fast interstellar neutral gas flow might not be ignored
in modeling of evolution of dust particles beyond planets.
