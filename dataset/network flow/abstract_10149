We construct a coordinate system for the Kerr solution, based on the zero
angular momentum observers dropped from infinity, which generalizes the
Painleve-Gullstrand coordinate system for the Schwarzschild solution. The Kerr
metric can then be interpreted as describing space flowing on a (curved)
Riemannian 3-manifold. The stationary limit arises as the set of points on this
manifold where the speed of the flow equals the speed of light, and the
horizons as the set of points where the radial speed equals the speed of light.
A deeper analysis of what is meant by the flow of space reveals that the
acceleration of free-falling objects is generally not in the direction of this
flow. Finally, we compare the new coordinate system with the closely related
Doran coordinate system.
