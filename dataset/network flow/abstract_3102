Network synchronization is an emerging phenomenon in complex networks. The
spectrum of Laplacian matrix will be immensely helpful for getting the network
dynamics information. Especially, network synchronizability is characterized by
the ratio of second smallest eigen value to largest eigen value of the
Laplacian matrix. We study the synchronization of complex networks modeled by
regular graphs. We obtained the analytical expressions for network
synchronizability for r-nearest neighbor cycle and r-nearest neighbor torus. We
have also derived the generalized expression for synchronizability for
m-dimensional r-nearest neigh- bor torus. The obtained analytical results agree
with the simulation results and shown the effect of network dimension, number
of nodes and overhead on syn- chronizability and connectivity in complex
networks. This work provides the basic analytical tools for managing and
controlling the synchronization in the fi- nite sized complex networks and also
given the generalized expressions for eigen values of Laplacian matrix for
multi dimensional r- nearest neighbor networks.
