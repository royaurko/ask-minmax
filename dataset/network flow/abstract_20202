In this paper, we consider some long-standing problems in communication
systems with access to noisy feedback. We introduce a new notion, the residual
directed information, to capture the effective information flow (i.e. mutual
information between the message and the channel outputs) in the forward
channel. In light of this new concept, we investigate discrete memoryless
channels (DMC) with noisy feedback and prove that the noisy feedback capacity
is not achievable by using any typical closed-loop encoder (non-trivially
taking feedback information to produce channel inputs). We then show that the
residual directed information can be used to characterize the capacity of
channels with noisy feedback. Finally, we provide computable bounds on the
noisy feedback capacity, which are characterized by the causal conditional
directed information.
