We analyze the process of informational exchange through complex networks by
measuring network efficiencies. Aiming to study non-clustered systems, we
propose a modification of this measure on the local level. We apply this method
to an extension of the class of small-worlds that includes {\it declustered}
networks, and show that they are locally quite efficient, although their
clustering coefficient is practically zero. Unweighted systems with small-world
and scale-free topologies are shown to be both globally and locally efficient.
Our method is also applied to characterize weighted networks. In particular we
examine the properties of underground transportation systems of Madrid and
Barcelona and reinterpret the results obtained for the Boston subway network.
