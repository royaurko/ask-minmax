ulticasting is an important communication paradigm for enabling the
dissemination of information selectively. This paper considers the problem of
optimal secure multicasting in a communication network captured through a graph
(optimal is in an interesting sense) and provides a doubly optimal solution
using results from source coding. It is realized that the solution leads to
optimal design (in a well defined optimality sense) of organizational
hierarchies captured through a graph. In this effort two novel concepts :
prefix free path, graph entropy are introduced. Some results of graph entropy
are provided. Also some results on Kraft inequality are discussed. As an
application Hierarchical Hybrid Communication Network is utilized as a model of
structured Mobile Adhoc network for utility in Disaster Management. Several new
research problems that naturally emanate from this research are summarized.
