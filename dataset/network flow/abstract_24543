A consumer Behaviour model is considered in the context of a network of
interacting individuals in an energy market. We propose and analyse a simple
dynamical model of an ensemble of coupled active elements mimicking consumers'
Behaviour, where ``word-of-mouth'' interactions between individuals is
important. A single element is modelled using the automatic control system
framework. Assuming local (nearest neighbour) coupling we study the evolution
of chains and lattices of the model consumers on variation of the coupling
strength and initial conditions. The results are interpreted as the dynamics of
the decision-making process by the energy-market consumers. We demonstrate that
a pitchfork bifurcation to the homogeneous solution leads to bistability of
stationary regimes, while the autonomous system is always monostable. In
presence of inhomogeneities this results in the formation of clusters of
sharply positive and negative opinions. We also find that, depending on the
coupling strength, the perturbations caused by inhomogeneities can be
exponentially Localised in space or de-Localised. In the latter case the
coarse-graining of opinion clusters occurs.
