The spatial configuration of initial partons in high-multiplicity
proton-proton scatterings at 14 TeV is assumed as three randomly positioned
"hot spots". The parton momentum distribution in the hot spots is calculated by
HIJING2.0 with some modifications. This initial condition causes not only large
eccentricity $\epsilon_2$ but also triangularity $\epsilon_3$ and the
correlation of $\epsilon_2-\epsilon_3$ event-plane angles. The final elliptic
flow $v_2$, triangular flow $v_3$, and the correlation of $v_2-v_3$ event-plane
angles are calculated by using the parton cascade model BAMPS to simulate the
space-time parton evolution. Our results show that the $v_2-v_3$ correlation is
different from that of $\epsilon_2-\epsilon_3$. This finding indicates that
translations of different Fourier components of the initial spatial asymmetry
to the final flow components are not independent. A dynamical correlation
between the elliptic and triangular flow appears during the collective
expansion.
