The possibility that the type of discontinuous flow changes as the conditions
gradually (continuously) change is investigated in connection with the problems
arising when the results of numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection in
plasma are interpreted. The conservation laws at a discontinuity surface in
magnetohydrodynamics admit such transitions, but the socalled transition
solutions for the boundary conditions that simultaneously satisfy two types of
discontinuities should exist in this case. The specific form of such solutions
has been found, and a generalized scheme of permitted transitions has been
constructed on their basis. An expression for the jump in internal energy at
discontinuity is derived. The dependence of the plasma heating efficiency on
the type of discontinuity is considered.
