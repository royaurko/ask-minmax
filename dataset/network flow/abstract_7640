The generation of large-scale zonal flows by small-scale electrostatic drift
waves in electron temperature gradient(ETG) driven turbulence model is
considered. The generation mechanism is based on the modulational instability
of a finite amplitude monochromatic drift wave. The threshold and growth rate
of the instability as well as the optimal spatial scale of zonal flow are
obtained.
