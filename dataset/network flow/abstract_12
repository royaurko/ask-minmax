We have investigated steady, radial gas outflows (or winds) from galaxies and
the development of thermal instability in the hot gas. In order to see the
maximum influence of the instability on the global structure of the galactic
outflows, we study inhomogeneous comoving flows and the non-linear fate of the
fluctuations in the flows. We compare the results with solutions for
homogeneous flows. In the case of supersonic flows, the global structure of
inhomogeneous flows is not much different from that of homogeneous flows.
However, detailed investigation shows that the average density of inhomogeneous
flows decreases faster than that of homogeneous flows, because local thermal
instability removes overdense regions in the inhomogeneous flows and reduces
the mass flux. We also find that when the gravity of a galaxy is strong, the
cold clouds formed from the removed gas are distributed in the galactic halo.
In the case of subsonic flows, the form of inhomogeneous flows is different
from that of homogeneous flows near the regions where the flows terminate. The
density rise appearing near the regions where the homogeneous flows terminate
is not seen in the inhomogeneous flows because the local thermal instability
decreases the mass flux. The cold clouds formed through thermal instability in
the inhomogeneous flow almost all coast to the same maximum radius.
