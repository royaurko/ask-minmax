We consider the rotation of neutrally buoyant axisymmetric particles
suspended in isotropic turbulence. Using laboratory experiments as well as
numerical and analytical calculations, we explore how particle rotation depends
upon particle shape. We find that shape strongly affects orientational
trajectories, but that it has negligible effect on the variance of the particle
angular velocity. Previous work has shown that shape significantly affects the
variance of the tumbling rate of axisymmetric particles. It follows that shape
affects the spinning rate in a way that is, on average, complementary to the
shape-dependence of the tumbling rate. We confirm this relationship using
direct numerical simulations, showing how tumbling rate and spinning rate
variances show complementary trends for rod-shaped and disk-shaped particles.
We also consider a random but non-turbulent flow. This allows us to explore
which of the features observed for rotation in turbulent flow are due to the
effects of particle alignment in vortex tubes.
