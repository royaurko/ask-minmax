In this paper, we study the global subsonic irrotational flows in a
multi-dimensional ($n\geq 2$) infinitely long nozzle with variable cross
sections. The flow is described by the inviscid potential equation, which is a
second order quasilinear elliptic equation when the flow is subsonic. First, we
prove the existence of the global uniformly subsonic flow in a general
infinitely long nozzle for arbitrary dimension for sufficiently small incoming
mass flux and obtain the uniqueness of the global uniformly subsonic flow.
Furthermore, we show that there exists a critical value of the incoming mass
flux such that a global uniformly subsonic flow exists uniquely, provided that
the incoming mass flux is less than the critical value. This gives a positive
answer to the problem of Bers on global subsonic irrotational flows in
infinitely long nozzles for arbitrary dimension. Finally, under suitable
asymptotic assumptions of the nozzle, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the
subsonic flow in far fields by a blow-up argument. The main ingredients of our
analysis are methods of calculus of variations, the Moser iteration techniques
for the potential equation and a blow-up argument for infinitely long nozzles.
