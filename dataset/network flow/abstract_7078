It has become widely known that when two flows of pedestrians cross stripes
emerge spontaneously by which the pedestrians of the two walking directions
manage to pass each other in an orderly manner. In this work, we report about
the results of an experiment on crossing flows which has been carried out at a
German school. These results include that previously reported high flow volumes
on the crossing area can be confirmed. The empirical results are furthermore
compared to the results of a simulation model which succesfully could be
calibrated to catch the specific properties of the population of participants.
