Folksonomy is an emerging technology that works to classify the information
over WWW through tagging the bookmarks, photos or other web-based contents. It
is understood to be organized by every user while not limited to the contributors of
the contents and the professional editors. This study surveyed the folksonomy
as a complex network. The result indicates that the network, which is composed
of the tags from the folksonomy, displays both properties of small world and
scale-free. However, the statistics only shows a local and static slice of the
vast body of folksonomy which is still evolving.
