Many complex networks demonstrate a phenomenon of striking degree
correlations, i.e., a node tends to link to other nodes with similar (or
dissimilar) degrees. From the perspective of degree correlations, this paper
attempts to characterize topological structures of urban street networks. We
adopted six urban street networks (three European and three North American),
and converted them into network topologies in which nodes and edges
respectively represent individual streets and street intersections, and
compared the network topologies to three reference network topologies
(biological, technological, and social). The urban street network topologies
(with the exception of Manhattan) showed a consistent pattern that distinctly
differs from the three reference networks. The topologies of urban street
networks lack striking degree correlations in general. Through reshuffling the
network topologies towards for example maximum or minimum degree correlations
while retaining the initial degree distributions, we found that all the
surrogate topologies of the urban street networks, as well as the reference
ones, tended to deviate from small world properties. This implies that the
initial degree correlations do not have any positive or negative effect on the
networks' performance or functions.
