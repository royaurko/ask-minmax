A possible clarification of memory effect observed in crack patterns of
drying pastes [A. Nakahara and Y. Matsuo, J. Phys. Soc. Japan 74, 1362 (2005)]
is presented in terms of a macroscopic elastoplastic model of isotropic pastes.
We study flows driven by steady gravitational force instead of external
oscillation. The model predicts creation of residual tension in favor of cracks
perpendicular to the flow direction, thus causing the same type of memory
effect as that reported by Nakahara and Matsuo for oscillated CaCO_3 pastes.
