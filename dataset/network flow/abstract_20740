Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are usually utilized to perform decision
fusion of event detection. Current decision fusion schemes are based on binary
valued decision and do not consider bursty contextcapture. However, bursty
context and multi-valued data are important characteristics of WSNs. One on
hand, the local decisions from sensors usually have bursty and contextual
characteristics. Fusion center must capture the bursty context information from
the sensors. On the other hand, in practice, many applications need to process
multi-valued data, such as temperature and reflection level used for lightening
prediction. To address these challenges, the Markov modulated Poisson process
(MMPP) and multi-valued logic are introduced into WSNs to perform
context-capture multi-valued decision fusion. The overall decision fusion is
decomposed into two parts. The first part is the context-capture model for WSNs
using superposition MMPP. Through this procedure, the fusion center has a
higher probability to get useful local decisions from sensors. The second one
is focused on multi-valued decision fusion. Fault detection can also be
performed based on MVL. Once the fusion center detects the faulty nodes, all
their local decisions are removed from the computation of the likelihood
ratios. Finally, we evaluate the capability of context-capture and fault
tolerant. The result supports the usefulness of our scheme.
