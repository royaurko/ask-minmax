RSS-based device-free localization (DFL) is a very promising technique which
allows localizing the target without attaching any electronic tags in wireless
environments. In cluttered indoor environments, the performance of DFL degrades
due to multipath interference. In this paper, we propose a multichannel
obstructed link detection method based on the RSS variation on difference
channels. Multichannel detection is proved to be very effective in multipath
environments compared to the single channel detection. We also propose a new
localization method termed as robust weighted least square (RWLS) method. RWLS
first use spatial property to eliminate the interference links and then employ
WLS method to localize the target. Since the spatial detection relies on the
unknown position of the target. A coarse position estimation of target is also
presented. RWLS is robust to interference links and has low computation
complexity. Results from real experiments verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method.
