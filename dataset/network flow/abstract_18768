We build up a directed network tracing links from a given integer to its
divisors and analyze the properties of the Google matrix of this network. The
PageRank vector of this matrix is computed numerically and it is shown that its
probability is inversely proportional to the PageRank index thus being similar
to the Zipf law and the dependence established for the World Wide Web. The
spectrum of the Google matrix of integers is characterized by a large gap and a
relatively small number of nonzero eigenvalues. A simple semi-analytical
expression for the PageRank of integers is derived that allows to find this
vector for matrices of billion size. This network provides a new PageRank order
of integers.
