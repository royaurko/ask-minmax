Attention has been paid to the similarity and duality between the
Gregory-Laflamme instability of black strings and the Rayleigh-Plateau
instability of extended fluids. In this paper, we derive a set of simple
(1+1)-dimensional equations from the Navier-Stokes equations describing thin
flows of (non-relativistic and incompressible) viscous fluids. This
formulation, a generalization of the theory of drop formation by Eggers and his
collaborators, would make it possible to examine the final fate of
Rayleigh-Plateau instability, its dimensional dependence, and possible
self-similar behaviors before and after the drop formation, in the context of
fluid/gravity correspondence.
