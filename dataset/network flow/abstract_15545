We study the evolution of various types of biased domain wall networks in the
early universe. We carry out larger numerical simulations than currently
available in the literature and provide a more detailed study of the decay of
these networks, in particular by explicitly measuring velocities in the
simulations. We also use the larger dynamic range of our simulations to test
previously suggested decay laws for these networks, including an ad-hoc
phenomenological fit to earlier simulations and a decay law obtained by
Hindmarsh through analytic arguments. We find the latter to be in good
agreement with simulations in the case of a biased potential, but not in the
case of biased initial conditions.
