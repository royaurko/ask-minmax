We investigate the isotropic-anisotropic phase transition of the
two-dimensional XY model with six-fold anisotropy, using Monte Carlo
renormalization group method. The result indicates difficulty of observing
asymptotic critical behavior in Monte Carlo simulations, owing to the marginal
flow at the fixed point.
