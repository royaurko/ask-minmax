We estimate the amount of collective "elliptic flow" expected at mid-rapidity
in proton-proton (p-p) collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
assuming that any possible azimuthal anisotropy of the produced hadrons with
respect to the plane of the reaction follows the same overlap-eccentricity and
particle-density scalings as found in high-energy heavy ion collisions. Using a
Glauber eikonal model, we compute the p-p eccentricities, transverse areas and
particle-multiplicities for various phenomenological parametrisations of the
proton spatial density. For realistic proton transverse profiles, we find
integrated elliptic flow v2 parameters below 3% in p-p collisions at sqrt(s) =
14 TeV.
