We consider the relationship between stationary distributions for stochastic
models of reaction systems and Lyapunov functions for their deterministic
counterparts. Specifically, we derive the well known Lyapunov function of
reaction network theory as a scaling limit of the non-equilibrium potential of
the stationary distribution of stochastically modeled complex balanced systems.
We extend this result to general birth-death models and demonstrate via example
that similar scaling limits can yield Lyapunov functions even for models that
are not complex or detailed balanced, and may even have multiple equilibria.
