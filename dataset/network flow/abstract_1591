The lognormal distribution describing, e.g., exponentials of Gaussian random
variables is one of the most common statistical distributions in physics. It
can exhibit features of broad distributions that imply qualitative departure
from the usual statistical scaling associated to narrow distributions.
Approximate formulae are derived for the typical sums of lognormal random
variables. The validity of these formulae is numerically checked and the
physical consequences, e.g., for the current flowing through small tunnel
junctions, are pointed out.
