We investigate numerically the spectral flow introduced by Adams for the
staggered Dirac operator on realistic gauge configurations. We study both the
unimproved and the HISQ Dirac operators. We compare the spectral flow index
with the index obtained by identifying low-lying modes of large chirality.
