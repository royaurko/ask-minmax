An extension $(V,d)$ of a metric space $(S,\mu)$ is a metric space with $S
\subseteq V$ and $d|_S = \mu$, and is said to be tight if there is no other
extension $(V,d')$ of $(S,\mu)$ with $d' \leq d$. Isbell and Dress
independently found that every tight extension is isometrically embedded into a
certain metrized polyhedral complex associated with $(S,\mu)$, called the tight
span. This paper develops an analogous theory for directed metrics, which are
"not necessarily symmetric" distance functions satisfying the triangle
inequality. We introduce a directed version of the tight span and show that it
has such a universal embedding property for tight extensions. Also we newly
introduce another natural class of extensions, called cyclically tight
extensions, and show that (a fiber of) the tropical polytope, introduced by
Develin and Sturmfels, has a universal embedding property for cyclically tight
extensions. As an application, we prove the following directed version of tree
metric theorem: directed metric $\mu$ is a directed tree metric if and only if
the tropical rank of $-\mu$ is at most two. Also we describe how tight spans
and tropical polytopes are applied to the study in multicommodity flows in
directed networks.
