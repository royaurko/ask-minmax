We address the role of community structure of an interaction network in
ordering dynamics, as well as associated forms of metastability. We consider
the voter and AB model dynamics in a network model which mimics social
interactions. The AB model includes an intermediate state between the two
excluding options of the voter model. For the voter model we find dynamical
metastable disordered states with a characteristic mean lifetime. However, for
the AB dynamics we find a power law distribution of the lifetime of metastable
states, so that the mean lifetime is not representative of the dynamics. These
trapped metastable states, which can order at all time scales, originate in the
mesoscopic network structure.
