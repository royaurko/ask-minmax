We study the dynamics of water confined between hydrophobic flat surfaces at
low temperature. At different pressures, we observe different behaviors that we
understand in terms of the hydrogen bonds dynamics. At high pressure, the
formation of the open structure of the hydrogen bond network is inhibited and
the surfaces can be rapidly dehydrated by decreasing the temperature. At lower
pressure the rapid ordering of the hydrogen bonds generates heterogeneities
that are responsible for strong non-exponential behavior of the correlation
function, but with no strong increase of the correlation time. At very low
pressures, the gradual formation of the hydrogen bond network is responsible
for the large increase of the correlation time and, eventually, the dynamical
arrest of the system and of the dehydration process.
