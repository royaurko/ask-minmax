This paper proposes a neural network approach based on Error Back Propagation
(EBP) for classification of different eye images. To reduce the complexity of
layered neural network the dimensions of input vectors are optimized using
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The main of this work is to provide for
best method for feature extraction and classification. The details of this
combined system named as SVD-EBP system, and results thereof are presented in
this paper.
  Keywords- Singular value decomposition(SVD), Error back Propagation(EBP).
