In this note, we extend our previous work on the inverse $\sigma_k$ problem.
Inverse $\sigma_{k}$ problem is a fully nonlinear geometric PDE on compact
K\"ahler manifolds. Given a proper geometric condition, we prove that a large
family of nonlinear geometric flows converges to the desired solution of the
given PDE.
