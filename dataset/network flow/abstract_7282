This paper is devoted to the problem of sample path large deviations for
multidimensional queueing models with feedback. We derive a new version of the
contraction principle where the continuous map is not well-defined on the whole
space: we give conditions under which it allows to identify the rate function.
We illustrate our technique by deriving a large deviation principle for a class
of networks that contains the classical Jackson networks.
