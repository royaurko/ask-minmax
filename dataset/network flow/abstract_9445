Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of numerous sensors which send sensed
data to base station. Energy conservation is an important issue for sensor
nodes as they have limited power.Many routing protocols have been proposed
earlier for energy efficiency of both homogeneous and heterogeneous
environments. We can prolong our stability and network lifetime by reducing our
energy consumption. In this research paper, we propose a protocol designed for
the characteristics of a reactive homogeneous WSNs, HEER (Hybrid Energy
Efficient Reactive) protocol. In HEER, Cluster Head(CH) selection is based on
the ratio of residual energy of node and average energy of network. Moreover,
to conserve more energy, we introduce Hard Threshold (HT) and Soft Threshold
(ST). Finally, simulations show that our protocol has not only prolonged the
network lifetime but also significantly increased stability period.
