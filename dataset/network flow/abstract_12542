Empirical data on contacts between individuals in social contexts play an
important role in providing information for models describing human behavior
and how epidemics spread in populations. Here, we analyze data on face-to-face
contacts collected in an office building. The statistical properties of
contacts are similar to other social situations, but important differences are
observed in the contact network structure. In particular, the contact network
is strongly shaped by the organization of the offices in departments, which has
consequences in the design of accurate agent-based models of epidemic spread.
We consider the contact network as a potential substrate for infectious disease
spread and show that its sparsity tends to prevent outbreaks of rapidly
spreading epidemics. Moreover, we define three typical behaviors according to
the fraction $f$ of links each individual shares outside its own department:
residents, wanderers and linkers. Linkers ($f\sim 50\%$) act as bridges in the
network and have large betweenness centralities. Thus, a vaccination strategy
targeting linkers efficiently prevents large outbreaks. As such a behavior may
be spotted a priori in the offices' organization or from surveys, without the
full knowledge of the time-resolved contact network, this result may help the
design of efficient, low-cost vaccination or social-distancing strategies.
