In the context of flow in porous media, up-scaling is the coarsening of a
geological model and it is at the core of water resources research and
reservoir simulation. An ideal up-scaling procedure preserves heterogeneities
at different length-scales but reduces the computational costs required by
dynamic simulations. A number of up-scaling procedures have been proposed. We
present a block renormalization algorithm using Haar wavelets which provide a
representation of data based on averages and fluctuations.
  In this work, absolute permeability will be discussed for single-phase
incompressible creeping flow in the Darcy regime, leading to a finite
difference diffusion type equation for pressure. By transforming the terms in
the flow equation, given by Darcy's law, and assuming that the change in scale
does not imply a change in governing physical principles, a new equation is
obtained, identical in form to the original. Haar wavelets allow us to relate
the pressures to their averages and apply the transformation to the entire
equation, exploiting their orthonormal property, thus providing values for the
coarse permeabilities.
  Focusing on the mean-field approximation leads to an up-scaling where the
solution to the coarse scale problem well approximates the averaged fine scale
pressure profile.
