The advent of ubiquitous computing and the proliferation of portable
computing devices have raised the importance of mobile ad-hoc network. A major
challenge lies in adapting multicast communication into such environments where
mobility and link failures are inevitable. The purpose of this paper is to
study impact of mobility models in performance of multicast routing protocols
in MANET. In this work, three widely used mobility models such as Random Way
Point, Reference Point Group and Manhattan mobility models and three popular
multicast routing protocols such as On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol,
Multicast Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing protocol and Adaptive Demand
driven Multicast Routing protocol have been chosen and implemented in NS2.
Several experiments have been carried out to study the relative strengths,
weakness and applicability of multicast protocols to these mobility models.
