For the purpose of propagating information and ideas through a social
network, a seeding strategy aims to find a small set of seed users that are
able to maximize the spread of the influence, which is termed as influence
maximization problem. Despite a large number of works have studied this
problem, the existing seeding strategies are limited to the static social
networks. In fact, due to the high speed data transmission and the large
population of participants, the diffusion processes in real-world social
networks have many aspects of uncertainness. Unfortunately, as shown in the
experiments, in such cases the state-of-art seeding strategies are pessimistic
as they fails to trace the dynamic changes in a social network. In this paper,
we study the strategies selecting seed users in an adaptive manner. We first
formally model the Dynamic Independent Cascade model and introduce the concept
of adaptive seeding strategy. Then based on the proposed model, we show that a
simple greedy adaptive seeding strategy finds an effective solution with a
provable performance guarantee. Besides the greedy algorithm an efficient
heuristic algorithm is provided in order to meet practical requirements.
Extensive experiments have been performed on both the real-world networks and
synthetic power-law networks. The results herein demonstrate the superiority of
the adaptive seeding strategies to other standard methods.
