We explore a simple mathematical model of network computation, based on
Markov chains. Similar models apply to a broad range of computational
phenomena, arising in networks of computers, as well as in genetic, and neural
nets, in social networks, and so on. The main problem of interaction with such
spontaneously evolving computational systems is that the data are not uniformly
structured. An interesting approach is to try to extract the semantical content
of the data from their distribution among the nodes. A concept is then
identified by finding the community of nodes that share it. The task of data
structuring is thus reduced to the task of finding the network communities, as
groups of nodes that together perform some non-local data processing. Towards
this goal, we extend the ranking methods from nodes to paths. This allows us to
extract some information about the likely flow biases from the available static
information about the network.
