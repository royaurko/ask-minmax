We introduce a minimal extended evolving model for small-world networks which
is controlled by a parameter. In this model the network growth is determined by
the attachment of new nodes to already existing nodes that are geographically
close. We analyze several topological properties for our model both
analytically and by numerical simulations. The resulting network shows some
important characteristics of real-life networks such as the small-world effect
and a high clustering.
