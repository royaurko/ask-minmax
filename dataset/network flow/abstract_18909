The stochastic dynamics of the multi-state voter model is investigated on a
class of complex networks made of non-overlapping cliques, each hosting a
political candidate and interacting with the others via Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
links. Numerical simulations of the model are interpreted in terms of an ad-hoc
mean field theory, specifically tuned to resolve the inter/intra-clique
interactions. Under a proper definition of the thermodynamic limit (with the
average degree of the agents kept fixed while increasing the network size), the
model is found to display the empirical scaling discovered by Fortunato and
Castellano (Phys Rev Lett 99(13):138701, 2007), while the vote distribution
resembles roughly that observed in Brazilian elections.
