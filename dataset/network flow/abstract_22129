We show that any cyclically symmetric monopole is gauge equivalent to Nahm
data given by Sutcliffe's ansatz, and so obtained from the affine Toda
equations. Further the direction (the Ercolani-Sinha vector) and base point of
the linearising flow in the Jacobian of the spectral curve associated to the
Nahm equations arise as pull-backs of Toda data. A theorem of Accola and Fay
then means that the theta-functions arising in the solution of the monopole
problem reduce to the theta-functions of Toda.
