The characterization of network community structure has profound implications
in several scientific areas. Therefore, testing the algorithms developed to
establish the optimal division of a network into communities is a fundamental
problem in the field. We performed here a highly detailed evaluation of
community detection algorithms, which has two main novelties: 1) using complex
closed benchmarks, which provide precise ways to assess whether the solutions
generated by the algorithms are optimal; and, 2) A novel type of analysis,
based on hierarchically clustering the solutions suggested by multiple
community detection algorithms, which allows to easily visualize how different
are those solutions. Surprise, a global parameter that evaluates the quality of
a partition, confirms the power of these analyses. We show that none of the
community detection algorithms tested provide consistently optimal results in
all networks and that Surprise maximization, obtained by combining multiple
algorithms, obtains quasi-optimal performances in these difficult benchmarks.
