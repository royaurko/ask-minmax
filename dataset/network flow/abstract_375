We present Onsager formalism applied to random networks with arbitrary degree
distribution. Using the well-known methods of non-equilibrium thermodynamics we
identify thermodynamic forces and their conjugated flows induced in networks as
a result of single node degree perturbation. The forces and the flows can be
understood as a response of the system to events, such as random removal of
nodes or intentional attacks on them. Finally, we show that cross effects (such
as thermodiffusion, or thermoelectric phenomena), in which one force may not
only give rise to its own corresponding flow, but to many other flows, can be
observed also in complex networks.
