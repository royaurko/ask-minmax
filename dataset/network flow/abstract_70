Cavitation is a general phenomenon of the fluid flows with obstacles. It
appears in the cooling conduits of the fast nuclear engines. A model of this
phenomenon using the theory of Laplace and a common non-convex energy for the
liquid and vapour bulks is proposed. This model makes it possible to determine
a higher limit of the density of bubbles (a number of bubbles per unit of
volume in the flow). The maximum intensity of cavitation is associated with the
mechanical and thermal characteristics of the fluid flow.
