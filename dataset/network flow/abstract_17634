We prove that several evolution equations arising as mathematical models for
fluid motion cannot be realized as metric Euler equations on the Lie group of
all smooth and orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms on the circle. These
include the quasi-geostrophic model equation, the axisymmetric Euler flow in
higher space dimensions, and De Gregorio's vorticity model equation.
