European VLBI Network spectral imaging of the "compact double" radio source
2050+364 in the UHF band at 1049 MHz has resolved the HI absorbing region, and
has shown a faint continuum component to the North (N), in addition to the
well-known East-West double (E, W). Re-examination of VLBI continuum images at
multiple frequencies suggests that 2050+364 may well be a one-sided core-jet
source, which appears as a double over a limited frequency range. One of the
dominant features, W, would then be the innermost visible portion of the jet,
and could be at or adjacent to the canonical radio core. The other, E, is
probably related to shocks at a sudden bend of the jet, towards extended
steep-spectrum region N. A remarkably deep and narrow HI absorption line
component extends over the entire projected extent of 2050+364. It coincides in
velocity with the [OIII] optical doublet lines to within 10 km/s. This HI
absorption could arise in the atomic cores of NLR clouds, and the motion in the
NLR is then remarkably coherent both along the line-of-sight and across a
projected distance of > 300 pc on the plane of the sky. Broader, shallower HI
absorption at lower velocities covers only the plausible core area W. This
absorption could be due to gas which is either being entrained by the inner jet
or is flowing out from the accretion region; it could be related to the BLR.
