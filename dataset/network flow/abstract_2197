This paper presents a method for calculating the wall shear rate in pipe
turbulent flow. It collapses adequately the data measured in laminar flow and
turbulent flow into a single flow curve and gives the basis for the design of
turbulent flow viscometers.
  Key words: non-Newtonian, wall shear rate, turbulent, rheometer
