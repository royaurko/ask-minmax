The popularity of online social networks (OSNs) makes the protection of
users' private information an important but scientifically challenging problem.
In the literature, relationship-based access control schemes have been proposed
to address this problem. However, with the dynamic developments of OSNs, we
identify new access control requirements which cannot be fully captured by the
current schemes. In this paper, we focus on public information in OSNs and
treat it as a new dimension which users can use to regulate access to their
resources. We define a new OSN model containing users and their relationships
as well as public information. Based on this model, we introduce a variant of
hybrid logic for formulating access control policies. A type of category
relations among public information are exploited to further improve our logic
for its usage in practice. In the end, we propose a few solutions to address
the problem of information reliability in OSNs.
