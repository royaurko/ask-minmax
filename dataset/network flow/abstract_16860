Community detection is one of the most investigated problems in the field of
complex networks. Although several methods were proposed, there is still no
precise definition of communities. As a step towards a definition, I highlight
two necessary properties of communities, separation and internal cohesion, the
latter being a new concept. I propose a local method of community detection
based on two-dimensional local optimization, which I tested on common
benchmarks and on the word association database.
