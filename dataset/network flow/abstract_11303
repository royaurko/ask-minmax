Link directions are essential to the functionality of networks and their
prediction is helpful towards a better knowledge of directed networks from
incomplete real-world data. We study the problem of predicting the directions
of some links by using the existence and directions of the rest of links. We
propose a solution by first ranking nodes in a specific order and then
predicting each link as stemming from a lower-ranked node towards a
higher-ranked one. The proposed ranking method works recursively by utilizing
local indicators on multiple scales, each corresponding to a subgraph extracted
from the original network. Experiments on real networks show that the
directions of a substantial fraction of links can be correctly recovered by our
method, which outperforms either purely local or global methods.
