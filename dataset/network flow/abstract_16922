We investigate collaborative and interdisciplinary research features of
University College Dublin, using methods from social network analysis to
analyze and visualize (co-)publications covered by the Web of Science from 1998
through 2007. We account for the extent of interdisciplinarity in
collaborations, distinguishing collaborations between schools within one
college ("small interdisciplinarity") from collaborations between schools in
different colleges ("big interdisciplinarity"). Based on the interdisciplinary
nature, we compare the types of collaboration to a model of random matching
across units, observing several marked differences. During the period of
consideration, collaborations within UC Dublin nearly doubled, almost entirely
due to the increasing level of intra-school collaborations.
