The periodic wind-tree model is a family T(a,b) of billiards in the plane in
which identical rectangular scatterers of size axb are disposed at each integer
point. It was proven by P. Hubert, S. Leli\`evre and S. Troubetzkoy
(arXiv:0912.2891v1) that for a residual set of parameters (a,b) the billiard
flow in T(a,b) is recurrent in almost every direction. We prove that for many
parameters (a,b) there exists a set S of angles of positive Hausdorff dimension
such that every billiard trajectory in T(a,b) with initial angle in S is
self-avoiding. In particular, the flow in a direction of S is divergent.
