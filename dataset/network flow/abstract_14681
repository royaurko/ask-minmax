We use coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate diffusion
properties of sheared lipid membranes with embedded transmembrane proteins. In
membranes without proteins, we find normal in-plane diffusion of lipids in all
flow conditions. Protein embedded membranes behave quite differently: by
imposing a simple shear flow and sliding the monolayers of the membrane over
each other, the motion of protein clusters becomes strongly superdiffusive in
the shear direction. In such a circumstance, subdiffusion regime is predominant
perpendicular to the flow. We show that superdiffusion is a result of
accelerated chaotic motions of protein--lipid complexes within the membrane
voids, which are generated by hydrophobic mismatch or the transport of lipids
by proteins.
