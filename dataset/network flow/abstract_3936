In a generalized framework, where multi-state and inter-state linkages are
allowed, we derive a sufficient condition for the stability of synchronization
in a network of chaotic attractors. This condition explicitly relates the
network structure and the local and coupling dynamics to synchronization
stability. For large Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks, the obtained condition is
translated into a lower bound on the probability of stability of synchrony. Our
results show that the probability of stability quickly increases as the
randomness crosses a threshold which for large networks is inversely
proportional to the network size.
