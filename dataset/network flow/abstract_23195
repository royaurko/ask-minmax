We analyse the results of four simulations of isolated galaxies: two with a
rigid spiral potential of fixed pattern speed, but with different degrees of
star-formation induced feedback, one with an axisymmetric galactic potential
and one with a `live' self-gravitating stellar component. Since we use a
Lagrangian method we are able to select gas that lies within giant molecular
clouds (GMCs) at a particular timeframe, and to then study the properties of
this gas at earlier and later times. We find that gas which forms GMCs is not
typical of the interstellar medium at least 50 Myr before the clouds form and
reaches mean densities within an order of magnitude of mean cloud densities by
around 10 Myr before. The gas in GMCs takes at least 50 Myr to return to
typical ISM gas after dispersal by stellar feedback, and in some cases the gas
is never fully recycled. We also present a study of the two-dimensional,
vertically-averaged velocity fields within the ISM. We show that the velocity
fields corresponding to the shortest timescales (that is, those timescales
closest to the immediate formation and dissipation of the clouds) can be
readily understood in terms of the various cloud formation and dissipation
mechanisms. Properties of the flow patterns can be used to distinguish the
processes which drive converging flows (e.g.\ spiral shocks, supernovae) and
thus molecular cloud formation, and we note that such properties may be
detectable with future observations of nearby galaxies.
