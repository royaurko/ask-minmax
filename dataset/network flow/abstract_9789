A fundamental result relevant to spin chains and two-dimensional disordered
systems is that the sphere sigma model with instanton coupling theta=pi has a
non-trivial low-energy fixed point and a gapless spectrum. This result is
extended to two series of sigma models with theta=pi: the SU(N)/SO(N) sigma
models flow to the SU(N)_1 WZW theory, while the O(2N)/O(N)\times O(N) models
flow to O(2N)_1 (2N free Majorana fermions). These models are integrable, and
the exact quasiparticle spectra and S matrices are found. One interesting
feature is that charges fractionalize when theta=pi. I compute the energy in a
background field, and verify that the perturbative expansions for \theta=0 and
pi are the same as they must be. I discuss the flows between the two sequences
of models, and also argue that the analogous sigma models with Sp(2N) symmetry,
the Sp(2N)/U(N) models, flow to Sp(2N)_1.
