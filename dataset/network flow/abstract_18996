In this paper, we proposed an evolving model via the hypergraph to illustrate
the evolution of the citation network. In the evolving model, we consider the
mechanism combined with preferential attachment and the aging influence.
Simulation results show that the proposed model can characterize the citation
distribution of the real system very well. In addition, we give the analytical
result of the citation distribution using the master equation. Detailed
analysis showed that the time decay factor should be the origin of the same
citation distribution between the proposed model and the empirical result. The
proposed model might shed some lights in understanding the underlying laws
governing the structure of real citation networks.
