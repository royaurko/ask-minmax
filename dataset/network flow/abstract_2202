To understand the factors that encourage the deployment of a new networking
technology, we must be able to model how such technology gets deployed. We
investigate how network structure influences deployment with a simple
deployment model and different network models through computer simulations. The
results indicate that a realistic model of networking technology deployment
should take network structure into account.
