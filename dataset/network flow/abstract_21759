We present the main ideas and techniques of the proof that the
duality-covariant four-dimensional noncommutative \phi^4-model is
renormalisable to all orders. This includes the reformulation as a dynamical
matrix model, the solution of the free theory by orthogonal polynomials as well
as the renormalisation by flow equations involving power-counting theorems for
ribbon graphs drawn on Riemann surfaces.
