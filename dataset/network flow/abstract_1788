Optimal paths play a fundamental role in numerous physical applications
ranging from random polymers to brittle fracture, from the flow through porous
media to information propagation. Here for the first time we explore the path
that is activated once this optimal path fails and what happens when this new
path also fails and so on, until the system is completely disconnected. In fact
numerous applications can be found for this novel fracture problem. In the
limit of strong disorder, our results show that all the cracks are located on a
single self-similar connected line of fractal dimension $D_{b} \approx 1.22$.
For weak disorder, the number of cracks spreads all over the entire network
before global connectivity is lost. Strikingly, the disconnecting path
(backbone) is, however, completely independent on the disorder.
