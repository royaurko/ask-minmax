In this paper, we introduce a natural class of multigraphs called
hierarchical-scale-free (HSF) multigraphs, and consider constant-time
testability on the class. We show that a very wide subclass, specifically, that
in which the power-law exponent is greater than two, of HSF is hyperfinite.
Based on this result, an algorithm for a deterministic partitioning oracle can
be constructed. We conclude by showing that every property is constant-time
testable on the above subclass of HSF. This algorithm utilizes findings by
Newman and Sohler of STOC'11. However, their algorithm is based on the
bounded-degree model, while it is known that actual scale-free networks usually
include hubs, which have a very large degree. HSF is based on scale-free
properties and includes such hubs. This is the first universal result of
constant-time testability on the general graph model, and it has the potential
to be applicable on a very wide range of scale-free networks.
