This is a progress report on our numerical simulations of conditions in the
cold cores of cooling flow condensations. The physical conditions in any
non-equilibrium plasma are the result of a host of microphysical processes,
many involving reactions that are research areas in themselves. We review the
dominant physical processes in our previously published simulations, to clarify
those issues that have caused confusion in the literature. We show that
conditions in the core of an X-ray illuminated cloud are very different from
those found in molecular clouds, largely because carbon remains substantially
atomic and provides powerful cooling through its far infrared lines. We show
how the results of the Opacity Project have had a major impact on our
predictions, largely because photoionization cross sections of atoms and first
ions are now calculated to be far larger than previously estimated. Finally we
show that the predicted conditions are strongly affected by such complexities
as microturbulence or the presence of small amounts of dust. Large masses of
cold dense gas, in addition to the warmer molecular gas detected recently,
could be present in cooling flows.
