It is shown that in contrast to the electric pulse power driven implosion of
a single conical wire array, the implosion of a nested conical wire array with
opposite alternate opening angles can lead to the generation of fast jets, with
velocities of the order 108 cm/s. This technique can be applied for the
supersonic shear flow stabilization of a dense z-pinch, but possibly also for
the fast ignition of a pre-compressed dense deuterium-tritium target.
