The theme of this contribution is the idea that the metals in the
intracluster medium (ICM) may be inhomogeneously distributed on small scales.
We focus on the possible interplay between this and the cooling flow process.
We begin with a brief review of some evidence for a patchy distribution of
metals in the ICM. Next we outline a simple numerical model for this within the
framework of the cooling flow hypothesis. Finally we present some of our recent
results on the presence of gradients in the observed abundance profiles.
