In this paper, joint designs of data routes and resource allocations are
developed for generic half-duplex multicarrier wireless networks in which each
subcarrier can be reused by multiple links. Two instances are considered. The
first instance pertains to the general case in which each subcarrier can be
timeshared by multiple links, whereas the second instance pertains to a special
case in which time-sharing is not allowed and a subcarrier, once assigned to a
set of links, is used by those links throughout the signalling interval. Novel
frameworks are developed to optimize the joint design of data routes,
subcarrier schedules and power allocations. These design problems are nonconvex
and hence difficult to solve. To circumvent this difficulty, efficient
techniques based on geometric programming are developed to obtain locally
optimal solutions. Numerical results show that the designs developed in both
instances yield performance that is superior to that of their counterparts in
which frequency-reuse is not allowed.
