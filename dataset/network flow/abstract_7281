This paper proposes a formal model for a network of robotic agents that move
and communicate. Building on concepts from distributed computation, robotics
and control theory, we define notions of robotic network, control and
communication law, coordination task, and time and communication complexity. We
then analyze a number of basic motion coordination algorithms such as pursuit,
rendezvous and deployment.
