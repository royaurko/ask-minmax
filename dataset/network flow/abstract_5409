We show that to correctly describe the position of the critical line in the
Kauffman random boolean networks one must take into account percolation
phenomena underlying the process of damage spreading. For this reason, since
the issue of percolation transition is much simpler in random undirected
networks, than in the directed ones, we study the Kauffman model in undirected
networks. We derive the mean field formula for the critical line in the giant
component of these networks, and show that the critical line characterizing the
whole network results from the fact that the ordered behavior of small clusters
shields the chaotic behavior of the giant component. We also show a possible
attitude towards the analytical description of the shielding effect. The
theoretical derivations given in this paper quite tally with numerical
simulations done for classical random graphs.
