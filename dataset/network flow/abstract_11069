We build networks of genetic similarity in which the nodes are organisms
sampled from biological populations. The procedure is illustrated by
constructing networks from genetic data of a marine clonal plant. An important
feature in the networks is the presence of clone subgraphs, i.e. sets of
organisms with identical genotype forming clones. As a first step to understand
the dynamics that has shaped these networks, we point up a relationship between
a particular degree distribution and the clone size distribution in the
populations. We construct a dynamical model for the population dynamics,
focussing on the dynamics of the clones, and solve it for the required
distributions. Scale free and exponentially decaying forms are obtained
depending on parameter values, the first type being obtained when clonal growth
is the dominant process. Average distributions are dominated by the power law
behavior presented by the fastest replicating populations.
