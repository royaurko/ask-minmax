In a network of devices in close proximity such as Device to Device ($D2D$)
communication, we study the dissemination of public safety information at
country scale level. In order to provide a realistic model for the information
dissemination, we extract a spatial distribution of the population of Ivory
Coast from census data and determine migration pattern from the Call Detail
Records ($CDR$) obtained during the Data for Development ($D4D$) challenge. We
later apply epidemic model towards the information dissemination process based
on the spatial properties of the user mobility extracted from the provided
$CDR$. We then propose enhancements by adding latent states to the epidemic
model in order to model more realistic user dynamics. Finally, we study
dynamics of the evolution of the information spreading through the population.
