A new lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is introduced, based on a regularization
of the pre-collision distribution functions in terms of the local density,
velocity, and momentum flux tensor. The model dramatically improves the
precision and numerical stability for the simulation of fluid flows by LB
methods. This claim is supported by simulation results of some 2D and 3D flows.
