We study the limiting behavior of a random dynamic system driven by a
stochastic chain. Our main interest is in the chains that are not necessarily
ergodic but rather decomposable into ergodic classes. To investigate the
conditions under which the ergodic classes of a model can be identified, we
introduce and study an l_1-approximation and infinite flow graph of the model.
We show that the l_1-approximations of random chains preserve certain limiting
behavior. Using the l_1-approximations, we show how the connectivity of the
infinite flow graph is related to the structure of the ergodic groups of the
model. Our main result of this paper provides conditions under which the
ergodicity groups of the model can be identified by considering the connected
components in the infinite flow graph. We provide two applications of our main
result to random networks, namely broadcast over time-varying networks and
networks with random link failure.
