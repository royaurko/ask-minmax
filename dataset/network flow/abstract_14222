In this paper we investigate mixing and transport in correspondence of a
meandering jet. The large-scale flow field is a kinematically assigned
streamfunction. Two basic mixing mechanisms are considered, first separately
and then combined together: deterministic chaotic advection, induced by a time
dependence of the flow, and turbulent diffusion, described by means of a
stochastic model for particle motion.
  Rather than looking at the details of particle trajectories, fluid exchange
is studied in terms of markovian approximations. The two-dimensional physical
space accessible to fluid particles is subdivided into regions characterized by
different Lagrangian behaviours. From the observed transitions between regions
it is possible to derive a number of relevant quantities characterizing
transport and mixing in the studied flow regime, such as residence times,
meridional mixing, correlation functions. These estimated quantities are
compared with the corresponding ones resulting from the actual simulations. The
outcome of the comparison suggests the possibility of describing in a
satisfactory way at least some of the mixing properties ot the system through
the very simplified approach of a first order markovian approximation, whereas
other properties exhibit memory patterns of higher order.
