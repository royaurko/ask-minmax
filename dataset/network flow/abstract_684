We formulate the optimal placement, sizing and control of storage devices in
a power network to minimize generation costs with the intent of load shifting.
We assume deterministic demand, a linearized DC approximated power flow model
and a fixed available storage budget. Our main result proves that when the
generation costs are convex and nondecreasing, there always exists an optimal
storage capacity allocation that places zero storage at generation-only buses
that connect to the rest of the network via single links. This holds regardless
of the demand profiles, generation capacities, line-flow limits and
characteristics of the storage technologies. Through a counterexample, we
illustrate that this result is not generally true for generation buses with
multiple connections. For specific network topologies, we also characterize the
dependence of the optimal generation cost on the available storage budget,
generation capacities and flow constraints.
