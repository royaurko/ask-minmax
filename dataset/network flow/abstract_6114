Many real networks exhibit a layered structure in which links in each layer
reflect the function of nodes on different environments. These multiple types
of links are usually represented by a multiplex network in which each layer has
a different topology. In real-world networks, however, not all nodes are
present on every layer. To generate a more realistic scenario, we use a
generalized multiplex network and assume that only a fraction $q$ of the nodes
are shared by the layers. We develop a theoretical framework for a branching
process to describe the spread of an epidemic on these partially overlapped
multiplex networks. This allows us to obtain the fraction of infected
individuals as a function of the effective probability that the disease will be
transmitted $T$. We also theoretically determine the dependence of the epidemic
threshold on the fraction $q > 0$ of shared nodes in a system composed of two
layers. We find that in the limit of $q \to 0$ the threshold is dominated by
the layer with the smaller isolated threshold. Although a system of two
completely isolated networks is nearly indistinguishable from a system of two
networks that share just a few nodes, we find that the presence of these few
shared nodes causes the epidemic threshold of the isolated network with the
lower propagating capacity to change discontinuously and to acquire the
threshold of the other network.
