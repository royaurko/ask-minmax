We investigate the gas jet breakup and the resulting microbubble formation in
a microfluidic flow-focusing device using ultra high-speed imaging at 1 million
frames/s. In recent experiments [Dollet et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 034504
(2008)] it was found that in the final stage of the collapse the radius of the
neck scales with time with a 1/3 power-law exponent, which suggested that gas
inertia and the Bernoulli suction effect become important. Here, ultra
high-speed imaging was used to capture the complete bubble contour and quantify
the gas flow through the neck. It revealed that the resulting decrease in
pressure, due to Bernoulli suction, is too low to account for an accelerated
pinch-off. The high temporal resolution images enable us to approach the final
moment of pinch-off to within 1 {\mu}s. We observe that the final moment of
bubble pinch-off is characterized by a scaling exponent of 0.41 +/- 0.01. This
exponent is approximately 2/5, which can be derived, based on the observation
that during the collapse the neck becomes less slender, due to the exclusive
driving through liquid inertia.
