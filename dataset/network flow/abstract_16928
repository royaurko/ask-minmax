Adaptive models of opinion formation among humans can display a fragmentation
transition, where a social network breaks into disconnected components. Here,
we investigate this transition in a class of models with arbitrary number of
opinions. In contrast to previous work we do not assume that opinions are
equidistant or arranged on a one-dimensional conceptual axis. Our investigation
reveals detailed analytical results on fragmentations in a three-opinion model,
which are confirmed by agent-based simulations. Furthermore, we show that in
certain models the number of opinions can be reduced without affecting the
fragmentation points.
