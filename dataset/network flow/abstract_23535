Motivated by a fundamental synchronization problem in scalable parallel
computing and by a recent criterion for ``mean-field'' synchronizability in
interacting systems, we study the Edwards-Wilkinson model on two variations of
a small-worldnetwork. In the first version each site has exactly one random
link of strength $p$, while in the second one each site on average has $p$
links of unit strength. We construct a perturbative description for the width
of the stationary-state surface (a measure of synchronization), in the weak-
and sparse-coupling limits, respectively, and verify the results by performing
exact numerical diagonalization. The width remains finite in both cases, but
exhibits anomalous scaling with $p$ in the latter for $d\leq 2$.
