We discuss the design and ongoing development of the Monitoring Extreme-scale
Lustre Toolkit (MELT), a unified Lustre performance monitoring and analysis
infrastructure that provides continuous, low-overhead summary information on
the health and performance of Lustre, as well as on-demand, in- depth problem
diagnosis and root-cause analysis. The MELT infrastructure leverages a
distributed overlay network to enable monitoring of center-wide Lustre
filesystems where clients are located across many network domains. We preview
interactive command-line utilities that help administrators and users to
observe Lustre performance at various levels of resolution, from individual
servers or clients to whole filesystems, including job-level reporting.
Finally, we discuss our future plans for automating the root-cause analysis of
common Lustre performance problems.
