Supersonic turbulent flows of magnetized gas are believed to play an
important role in the dynamics of star-forming clouds in galaxies.
Understanding statistical properties of such flows is crucial for developing a
theory of star formation. In this letter we propose a unified approach for
obtaining the velocity scaling in compressible and super--Alfv\'{e}nic
turbulence, valid for arbitrary sonic Mach number, \ms. We demonstrate with
numerical simulations that the scaling can be described with the
She--L\'{e}v\^{e}que formalism, where only one parameter, interpreted as the
Hausdorff dimension of the most intense dissipative structures, needs to be
varied as a function of \ms. Our results thus provide a method for obtaining
the velocity scaling in interstellar clouds once their Mach numbers have been
inferred from observations.
