We show that symmetric n-mixture states, when they exist, are almost never
stable in autoassociative networks with threshold-linear units. Only with a
binary coding scheme we could find a limited region of the parameter space in
which either 2-mixtures or 3-mixtures are stable attractors of the dynamics.
