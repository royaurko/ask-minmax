A review of works on associative neural networks accomplished during last
four years in the Institute of Optical Neural Technologies RAS is given. The
presentation is based on description of parametrical neural networks (PNN). For
today PNN have record recognizing characteristics (storage capacity, noise
immunity and speed of operation). Presentation of basic ideas and principles is
accentuated.
