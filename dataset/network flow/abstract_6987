We investigate the reality of large-scale streaming on scales of up to 150
Mpc using the peculiar motions of galaxies in three directions. New R-band CCD
photometry and spectroscopy for elliptical galaxies is used. The Fundamental
Plane distance indicator is calibrated using the Coma cluster and an
inhomogeneous Malmquist bias correction is applied. A linear bulk-flow model is
fitted to the peculiar velocities in the sample regions and the results do not
reflect the bulk flow observed by Lauer and Postman (LP). Accounting for the
difference in geometry between the galaxy distribution in the three regions and
the LP clustersconfirms the disagreement; assuming a low-density CDM power
spectrum, we find that the observed bulk flow of the galaxies in our sample
excludes the LP bulk flow at the 99.8% confidence level.
