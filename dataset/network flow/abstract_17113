The robust principles of treating interference as noise (TIN) when it is
sufficiently weak, and avoiding it when it is not, form the background for this
work. Combining TIN with the topological interference management (TIM)
framework that identifies optimal interference avoidance schemes, a baseline
TIM-TIN approach is proposed which decomposes a network into TIN and TIM
components, allocates the signal power levels to each user in the TIN
component, allocates signal vector space dimensions to each user in the TIM
component, and guarantees that the product of the two is an achievable number
of signal dimensions available to each user in the original network.
