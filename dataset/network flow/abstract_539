We consider large fluctuations, namely overload of servers, in a network with
dynamic routing of messages. The servers form a circle. The number of input
flows is equal to the number of servers, the messages of any flow are
distributed between two neighboring servers, upon its arrival a message is
directed to the least loaded of these servers. Under the condition that at
least two servers are overloaded the number of overloaded servers in such
network depends on the rate of input flows. In particular there exists critical
level of input rate that in case of higher rate most probable that all servers
are overloaded.
