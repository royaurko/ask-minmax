The Lattice Gas Model was extended to incorporate the effect of radial flow.
Contrary to popular belief, radial flow has little effect on the clusterization
process in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions except adding an ordered
motion to the particles in the fragmentation source. We compared the results
from the lattice gas model with and without radial flow to experimental data.
We found that charge yields from central collisions are not significantly
affected by inclusion of any reasonable radial flow.
