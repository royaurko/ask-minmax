The Ricci flow is an evolution system on metrics. For a given metric as
initial data, its local existence and uniqueness on compact manifolds was first
established by Hamilton \cite{Ha1}. Later on, De Turck \cite{De} gave a
simplified proof. In the later of 80's, Shi \cite{Sh1} generalized the local
existence result to complete noncompact manifolds. However, the uniqueness of
the solutions to the Ricci flow on complete noncompact manifolds is still an
open question. Recently it was found that the uniqueness of the Ricci flow on
complete noncompact manifolds is important in the theory of the Ricci flow with
surgery. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer for the uniqueness
question. More precisely, we prove that the solution of the Ricci flow with
bounded curvature on a complete noncompact manifold is unique.
