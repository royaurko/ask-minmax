We propose a method of constructing a network, in which its time structure is
directly incorporated, based on a deterministic model from a time series. To
construct such a network, we transform a linear model containing terms with
different time delays into network topology. The terms in the model are
translated into temporal nodes of the network. On each link connecting these
nodes, we assign a positive real number representing the strength of
relationship, or the "distance," between nodes specified by the parameters of
the model. The method is demonstrated by a known system and applied to two
actual time series.
