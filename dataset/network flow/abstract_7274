Our contribution in this paper is e3D, a diffusion based routing protocol
that prolongs the system lifetime, evenly distributes the power dissipation
throughout the network, and incurs minimal overhead for synchronizing
communication. We compare e3D with other algorithms in terms of system
lifetime, power dissipation distribution, cost of synchronization, and
simplicity of the algorithm.
