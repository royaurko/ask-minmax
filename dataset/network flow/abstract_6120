Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have great practical importance for
surveillance systems to perform monitoring by acquiring and sending information
on any intrusion in a secured area. Requirement of very little human
intervention is one of the most desirable features of WSNs, thus making it a
cheaper and safer alternative for securing large areas such as international
borders. Jamming attacks in WSNs can be applied to disrupt communications among
the sensor nodes in the network. Since it is difficult to prevent jamming
attacks, detection and mapping out the jammed regions is critical to overcome
this problem. In a security monitoring scenario, the network operators will be
able to take proper measures against jamming once the jammed regions in the
network are known to them. It is also desirable to keep the interactions of the
sensor nodes in the network minimal, as they are low powered devices and need
to conserve their resources. In this paper we propose a light-weight technique
for faster mapping of the jammed regions. We minimize the load on the sensors
by removing the actual responsibility of mapping from the network to the
central base station (BS). After a few nodes report to the BS, it carries out
the task of mapping of the jammed regions in the network. We use our simulation
results to compare our proposed system with the existing techniques and also to
measure the performance of our system. Our results show that the jammed regions
in a network can be mapped from fewer nodes reporting to the base station.
