This paper is concerned with a dynamic traffic network performance model,
known as dynamic network loading (DNL), that is frequently employed in the
modeling and computation of analytical dynamic user equilibrium (DUE). As a key
component of continuous-time DUE models, DNL aims at describing and predicting
the spatial-temporal evolution of traffic flows on a network that is consistent
with established route and departure time choices of travelers, by introducing
appropriate dynamics to flow propagation, flow conservation, and travel delays.
The DNL procedure gives rise to the path delay operator, which associates a
vector of path flows (path departure rates) with the corresponding path travel
costs. In this paper, we establish strong continuity of the path delay operator
for networks whose arc flows are described by the link delay model (Friesz et
al., 1993). Unlike result established in Zhu and Marcotte (2000), our
continuity proof is constructed without assuming a priori uniform boundedness
of the path flows. Such a more general continuity result has a few important
implications to the existence of simultaneous route-and-departure choice DUE
without a priori boundedness of path flows, and to any numerical algorithm that
allows convergence to be rigorously analyzed.
