The differential encoding/decoding setup introduced by Kiran et al, Oggier et
al and Jing et al for wireless relay networks that use codebooks consisting of
unitary matrices is extended to allow codebooks consisting of scaled unitary
matrices. For such codebooks to be used in the Jing-Hassibi protocol for
cooperative diversity, the conditions that need to be satisfied by the relay
matrices and the codebook are identified. A class of previously known rate one,
full diversity, four-group encodable and four-group decodable Differential
Space-Time Codes (DSTCs) is proposed for use as Distributed DSTCs (DDSTCs) in
the proposed set up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known low
decoding complexity DDSTC scheme for cooperative wireless networks.
