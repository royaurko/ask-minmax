We consider the following interference model for wireless sensor and ad hoc
networks: the receiver interference of a node is the number of transmission
ranges it lies in. We model transmission ranges as disks. For this case we show
that choosing transmission radii which minimize the maximum interference while
maintaining a connected symmetric communication graph is NP-complete.
