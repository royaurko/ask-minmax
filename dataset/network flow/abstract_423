The rate optimization for wireless networks with low SNR is investigated.
While the capacity in the limit of disappearing SNR is known to be linear for
fading and non-fading channels, we study the problem of operating in low SNR
wireless network with given node locations that use network coding over flows.
The model we develop for low SNR Gaussian broadcast channel and multiple access
channel respectively operates in a non-trivial feasible rate region. We show
that the problem reduces to the optimization of total network power which can
be casted as standard linear multi-commodity min-cost flow program with no
inherent combinatorially difficult structure when network coding is used with
non integer constraints (which is a reasonable assumption). This is essentially
due to the linearity of the capacity with respect to vanishing SNR which helps
avoid the effect of interference for the degraded broadcast channel and
multiple access environment in consideration, respectively. We propose a fully
decentralized Primal-Dual Subgradient Algorithm for achieving optimal rates on
each subgraph (i.e. hyperarcs) of the network to support the set of traffic
demands (multicast/unicast connections).
