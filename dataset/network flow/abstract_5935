In this paper we apply the Named Data Networking, a newly proposed Internet
architecture, to networking vehicles on the run. Our initial design, dubbed
V-NDN, illustrates NDN's promising potential in providing a unifying
architecture that enables networking among all computing devices independent
from whether they are connected through wired infrastructure, ad hoc, or
intermittent DTN. This paper describes the prototype implementation of V-NDN
and its preliminary performance assessment.
