Within the framework of the random distribution assumption of cyclic bonds,
the preceding theory of gelation is extended to mixing systems with various
functionalities. To examine the validity of the assumption, the theory is
applied to experimental data in polyurethane network formation, the result
showing the soundness of the theory for the prediction of gel points and gel
fraction.
