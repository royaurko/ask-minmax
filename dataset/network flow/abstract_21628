The analogy between general relativity and electromagnetism suggests that
there is a galvano-gravitomagnetic effect, which is the gravitational analog of
the Hall effect. This new effect takes place when a current carrying conductor
is placed in a gravitomagnetic field and the conduction electrons moving inside
the conductor are deflected transversally with respect to the current flow. In
connection with this galvano-gravitomagnetic effect, we explore the possibility
of using current carrying conductors for detecting the gravitomagnetic field of
the Earth.
