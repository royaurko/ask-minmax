We present DISco, a storage and communication middleware designed to enable
distributed and task-centric autonomic control of networks.
  DISco is designed to enable multi-agent identification of anomalous
situations -- so-called "challenges" -- and assist coordinated remediation that
maintains degraded -- but acceptable -- service level, while keeping a track of
the challenge evolution in order to enable human-assisted diagnosis of flaws in
the network. We propose to use state-of-art peer-to-peer publish/subscribe and
distributed storage as core building blocks for the DISco service.
