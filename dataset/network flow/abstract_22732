We study Seiberg-like dualities for 3d N=2 theories with flavors in
fundamental and adjoint representations. The recent results of Intriligator and
Seiberg provide a derivation of an Aharony duality from a Giveon-Kutasov
duality. We extend their result to the case of more general theories involving
various masses for fundamental quarks and adjoint fields. By fine tuning the
vev of a scalar field and using various identifications between gauge groups
and their singlet duals, we derive several examples of Aharony dualities. For
theories with an adjoint field, we discuss the connection between the Aharony
dualities proposed by Kim and Park for theories with multiple Coulomb branches
and Giveon-Kutasov-Niarchos dualities.
