We present three-dimensional MHD simulations of rotating radiatively
inefficient accretion flows onto black holes. In the simulations, we
continuously inject magnetized matter into the computational domain near the
outer boundary, and we run the calculations long enough for the resulting
accretion flow to reach a quasi-steady state. We have studied two limiting
cases for the geometry of the injected magnetic field: pure toroidal field and
pure poloidal field. In the case of toroidal field injection, the accreting
matter forms a nearly axisymmetric, geometrically-thick, turbulent accretion
disk. The disk resembles in many respects the convection-dominated accretion
flows found in previous numerical and analytical investigations of viscous
hydrodynamic flows. Models with poloidal field injection evolve through two
distinct phases. In an initial transient phase, the flow forms a relatively
flattened, quasi-Keplerian disk with a hot corona and a bipolar outflow.
However, when the flow later achieves steady state, it changes in character
completely. The magnetized accreting gas becomes two-phase, with most of the
volume being dominated by a strong dipolar magnetic field from which a thermal
low-density wind flows out. Accretion occurs mainly via narrow slowly-rotating
radial streams which `diffuse' through the magnetic field with the help of
magnetic reconnection events.
