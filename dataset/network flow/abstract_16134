The properties of the velocity field in the local volume (cz < 550 km/s) have
been difficult to constrain due to a lack of a consistent set of galaxy
distances. The sparse observations available to date suggest a remarkably quiet
flow, with little deviation from a pure Hubble law. However, velocity field
models based on the distribution of galaxies in the 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift
survey, predict a quadrupolar flow pattern locally with strong infall at the
poles of the local Supergalactic plane. We probe this velocity field and begin
to establish a consistent set of galactic distances. We have obtained images of
nearby galaxies in the I and V band from the W.M. Keck Observatory and in F814W
and F555W filters from the Hubble Space Telescope. Where these galaxies are
well resolved into stars we may use the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) as a
distance indicator. Using a maximum likelihood analysis to quantitatively
measure the I magnitude of the TRGB we determine precise distances to seven
nearby galaxies: Leo I, Sextans B, NGC 1313, NGC 3109, UGC 03755, UGC 06456,
and UGC 07577.
