It is shown that a generalized magneto-Bernoulli mechanism can effectively
generate high velocity flows in the Solar chromosphere by transforming the
plasma pressure energy into kinetic energy. It is found that at reasonable
heights and for realistic plasma parameters, there is a precipitous pressure
fall accompanied by a sharp amplification of the flow speed.
