Blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals offer a spectacular example of
naturally occurring disclination line networks. Here we numerically solve the
hydrodynamic equations of motion to investigate the response of three types of
blue phases to an imposed Poiseuille flow. We show that shear forces bend and
twist and can unzip the disclination lines. Under gentle forcing the network
opposes the flow and the apparent viscosity is significantly higher than that
of an isotropic liquid. With increased forcing we find strong shear thinning
corresponding to the disruption of the defect network. As the viscosity starts
to drop, the imposed flow sets the network into motion. Disclinations break-up
and re-form with their neighbours in the flow direction. This gives rise to
oscillations in the time-dependent measurement of the average stress.
