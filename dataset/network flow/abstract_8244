We show that for a particular choice of the coupling parameters the
Ashkin-Teller spin-glass neural network model with the Hebb learning rule and
one condensed pattern yields the same thermodynamic properties as the
four-state anisotropic Potts-glass neural network model. This equivalence is
not seen at the level of the Hamiltonians.
