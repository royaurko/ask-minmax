A numerical bifurcation analysis is carried out to understand the role of
gravity on the shear-band formation in rapid granular Couette flow. At {\it
low} shear rates, there is a unique solution with a {\it plug} near the bottom
wall and a {\it shear-layer} near the top-wall; this solution mirrors typical
shearbanding-type profiles in earth-bound shear-cell experiments.
Interestingly, a {\it stable} plug near the top-wall is also a solution of
these equations at {\it high} shear rates; there is a multitude of other
plugged states, with the plugs being located in an ordered fashion within the
Couette gap. The origin of such shearbanding solutions is tied to the
spontaneous symmetry-breaking {\it shearbanding} instabilities of the
gravity-free uniform shear flow, leading to both subcritical and supercritical
pitchfork bifurcations. In the language of singularity theory, we have
established that this bifurcation problem admits {\it universal unfolding} of
pitchfork bifurcations.
