We propose FrogWild, a novel algorithm for fast approximation of high
PageRank vertices, geared towards reducing network costs of running traditional
PageRank algorithms. Our algorithm can be seen as a quantized version of power
iteration that performs multiple parallel random walks over a directed graph.
One important innovation is that we introduce a modification to the GraphLab
framework that only partially synchronizes mirror vertices. This partial
synchronization vastly reduces the network traffic generated by traditional
PageRank algorithms, thus greatly reducing the per-iteration cost of PageRank.
On the other hand, this partial synchronization also creates dependencies
between the random walks used to estimate PageRank. Our main theoretical
innovation is the analysis of the correlations introduced by this partial
synchronization process and a bound establishing that our approximation is
close to the true PageRank vector.
  We implement our algorithm in GraphLab and compare it against the default
PageRank implementation. We show that our algorithm is very fast, performing
each iteration in less than one second on the Twitter graph and can be up to 7x
faster compared to the standard GraphLab PageRank implementation.
