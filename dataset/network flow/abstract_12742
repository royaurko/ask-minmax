We propose a general Bayesian network model for application in a wide class
of problems of therapy monitoring. We discuss the use of stochastic simulation
as a computational approach to inference on the proposed class of models. As an
illustration we present an application to the monitoring of cytotoxic
chemotherapy in breast cancer.
