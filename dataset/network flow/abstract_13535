We prove nonlinear stability for finite amplitude perturbations of plane
Couette flow. A bound of the solution of the resolvent equation in the unstable
complex half-plane is used to estimate the solution of the full nonlinear
problem.The result is a lower bound, including Reynolds number dependence,of
the threshold amplitude below which all perturbations are stable. Our result is
an improvement of the corresponding bound derived in \cite{KLH:1}.
