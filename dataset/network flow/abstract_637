An admission control scheme should play the role of a coordinator for flows
in a data communication network, to provide the guarantees as the medium is
shared. The nodes of a wired network can monitor the medium to know the
available bandwidth at any point of time. But, in wireless ad hoc networks, a
node must consume the bandwidth of neighboring nodes, during a communication.
Hence, the consumption of bandwidth by a flow and the availability of resources
to any wireless node strictly depend upon the neighboring nodes within its
transmission range. We present a scalable and efficient admission control
scheme, Multi-hop Bandwidth Management Protocol (MBMP), to support the QoS
requirements in multi-hop ad hoc networks. We simulate several options to
design MBMP and compare the performances of these options through mathematical
analysis and simulation results, and compare its effectiveness with the
existing admission control schemes through extensive simulations.
