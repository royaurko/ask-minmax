The purpose of this paper is investigating behaviors of Ad Hoc protocols in
Agent-based simulation environments. First we bring brief introduction about
agents and Ad Hoc networks. We introduce some agent-based simulation tools like
NS-2. Then we focus on two protocols, which are Ad Hoc On-demand Multipath
Distance Vector (AODV) and Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV). At the
end, we bring simulation results and discuss about their reasons.
