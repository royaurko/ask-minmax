Electroosmotic pumping of fluid through a nanopore that traverses an
insulating membrane is considered. The density of surface charge on the
membrane is assumed uniform, and sufficiently low for the Poisson-Boltzmann
equation to be linearized. The reciprocal theorem gives the flow rate generated
by an applied weak electric field, expressed as an integral over the fluid
volume. For a circular hole in a membrane of zero thickness, an analytical
result is possible up to quadrature. For a membrane of arbitrary thickness, the
full Poisson--Nernst--Planck--Stokes system of equations is solved numerically
using a finite volume method. The numerical solution agrees with the standard
analytical result for electro-osmotic flux through a long cylindrical pore when
the membrane thickness is large compared to the hole diameter. When the
membrane thickness is small, the flow rate agrees with that calculated using
the reciprocal theorem.
