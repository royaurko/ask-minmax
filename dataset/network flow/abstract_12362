LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) recurrent neural networks have been highly
successful in a number of application areas. This technical report describes
the use of the MNIST and UW3 databases for benchmarking LSTM networks and
explores the effect of di?erent architectural and hyperparameter choices on
performance. Significant ?ndings include: (1) LSTM performance depends smoothly
on learning rates, (2) batching and momentum has no significant effect on
performance, (3) softmax training outperforms least square training, (4)
peephole units are not useful, (5) the standard non-linearities (tanh and
sigmoid) perform best, (6) bidirectional training combined with CTC performs
better than other methods.
