A polymer placed in chaotic flow with large mean shear tumbles, making
a-periodic flips. We describe the statistics of angular orientation, as well as
of tumbling time (separating two subsequent flips) of polymers in this flow.
The probability distribution function (PDF) of the polymer orientation is
peaked around a shear-preferred direction. The tails of this angular PDF are
algebraic. The PDF of the tumbling time, $\tau$, has a maximum at the value
estimated as inverse Lyapunov exponent of the flow. This PDF shows an
exponential tail for large $\tau$ and a small-$\tau$ tail determined by the
simultaneous statistics of velocity PDF.
