In this paper we propose an investing strategy based on neural network models
combined with ideas from game-theoretic probability of Shafer and Vovk. Our
proposed strategy uses parameter values of a neural network with the best
performance until the previous round (trading day) for deciding the investment
in the current round. We compare performance of our proposed strategy with
various strategies including a strategy based on supervised neural network
models and show that our procedure is competitive with other strategies.
