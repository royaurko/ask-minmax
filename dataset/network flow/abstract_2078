The key contribution of the paper is a comprehensive study of the egalitarian
mechanism with respect to manipulation by a coalition of agents. Our main
result is that the egalitarian mechanism is, in fact, peak group strategyproof
: no coalition of agents can (weakly) benefit from jointly misreporting their
peaks. Furthermore, we show that the egalitarian mechanism cannot be
manipulated by any coalition of suppliers (or any coalition of demanders) in
the model where both the suppliers and demanders are agents. Our proofs shed
light on the structure of the two models and simpify some of the earlier proofs
of strategyproofness in the earlier papers. An implication of our results is
that the well known algorithm of Megiddo to compute a lexicographically optimal
flow in a network is group strategyproof with respect to the source capacities
(or sink capacities).
