Pure spin currents can be injected and detected in conductors via
ferromagnetic contacts. We consider the case when the conductors become
superconducting. A DC pure spin current flowing in one superconducting wire
towards another superconductor via a ferromagnet contact induces AC voltage
oscillations caused by Josephson tunneling of condensate electrons.
Quasiparticles simultaneously counterflow resulting in zero total electric
current through the contact. The Josephson oscillations can be accompanied by
Carlson-Goldman collective modes leading to a resonance in the voltage
oscillation amplitude.
