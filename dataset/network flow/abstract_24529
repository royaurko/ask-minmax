This paper establishes the rate region for a class of source coding function
computation setups where sources of information are available at the nodes of a
tree and where a function of these sources must be computed at the root. The
rate region holds for any function as long as the sources' joint distribution
satisfies a certain Markov criterion. This criterion is met, in particular,
when the sources are independent.
  This result recovers the rate regions of several function computation setups.
These include the point-to-point communication setting with arbitrary sources,
the noiseless multiple access network with "conditionally independent sources,"
and the cascade network with Markovian sources.
