Plane Poiseuille flow shows turbulence at a Reynolds number that is lower
than the critical one for the onset of Tollmien-Schlichting waves. The
transition to turbulence follows the same route as the by-pass transition in
boundary layers, i.e. finite amplitude perturbations are required and the flow
is dominated by downstream vortices and streaks in the transitional regime. In
order to relate the phenomenology in plane Poiseuille flow to our previous
studies of plane Couette flow (Kreilos & Eckhardt, 2012), we study a symmetric
subspace of plane Poiseuille flow in which the bifurcation cascade stands out
clearly. By tracing the edge state, which in this system is a travelling wave,
and its bifurcations, we can trace the formation of a chaotic attractor, the
interior crisis that increase the phase space volume affected by the flow, and
the ultimate transition into a chaotic saddle in a crisis bifurcation. After
the boundary crisis we can observe transient chaos with exponentially
distributed lifetimes.
