High quality low leakage SINIS devices made of Al-AlMn-Al layers were
fabricated for energy dispersive single photon detection. Information on
different heat flow channels was extracted from the measured dynamics of
detector signals due to X-ray events. At the optimum operation point, the
extracted effective electron temperature decreased from 88 mK down to 43 mK due
to self-cooling, roughly doubling the detector sensitivity.
