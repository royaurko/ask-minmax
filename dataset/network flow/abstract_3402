We consider various methods of flow analysis in heavy ion collisions and
compare experimental data on corresponding observables to the predictions of
our saturation model proposed earlier. We demonstrate that, due to the nature
of the standard flow analysis, azimuthal distribution of particles with respect
to reaction plane determined from the second order harmonics should always be
proportional to $\cos 2(\phi-\Psi_R)$ independent of the physical origin of
particle correlations (flow or non-flow). The amplitude of this distribution is
always physical and proportional to $v_2$. Two-particle correlations analysis
is therefore a more reliable way of extracting the shape of physical azimuthal
anisotropy. We demonstrate that two-particle correlation functions generated in
our minijet model of particle production are in good agreement with the data
reported by PHENIX. We discuss the role of non-flow correlations in the
cumulant flow analysis and demonstrate using a simple example that if the flow
is weak, higher order cumulants analysis does not significantly reduce the
contribution of non-flow correlations to elliptic flow observable $v_2$ in RHIC
data.
