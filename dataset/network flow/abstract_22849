We derive a selection rule among the $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2)
Wess-Zumino-Witten theories, based on the global anomaly of the discrete
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry found by Gepner and Witten. In the presence of both the
SU(2) and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, an RG flow is possible between level-$k$
and level-$k'$Wess-Zumino-Witten theories only if $k\equiv k' \mod{2}$. This
classifies the Lorentz-invariant, SU(2)-symmetric critical behaviors into two
"symmetry-protected" categories, corresponding to even and odd levels.
