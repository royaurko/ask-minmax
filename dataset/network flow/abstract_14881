We extend the Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) method to
flows in porous media discretised by mixed-hybrid finite elements with combined
mesh dimensions. Such discretisations appear when major geological fractures
are modelled by 1D or 2D elements inside three-dimensional domains. In this
set-up, the global problem as well as the substructure problems have a
symmetric saddle-point structure, containing a `penalty' block due to the
combination of meshes. We show that the problem can be reduced by means of
iterative substructuring to an interface problem, which is symmetric and
positive definite. The interface problem can thus be solved by conjugate
gradients with the BDDC method as a preconditioner. A parallel implementation
of this algorithm is incorporated into an existing software package for
subsurface flow simulations. We study the performance of the iterative solver
on several academic and real-world problems. Numerical experiments illustrate
its efficiency and scalability.
