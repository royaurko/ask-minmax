  The scaling push-relabel method is an important theoretical development in the area of minimum-cost flow algorithms. We study practical implementations of this method. We are especially interested in heuristics which improve real-life performance of the method. Our implementation works very well over a wide range of problem classes. Some heuristics we develop may apply to other network algorithms. Our experimental work on the minimum-cost flow problem motivated theoretical work on related problems. 1 R.K. Ahuja, T.L.
