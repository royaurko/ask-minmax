Automatic classification of variability is now possible with tools like
neural networks. Here, we present two neural networks for the identification of
microlensing events -- the first discriminates against variable stars and the
second against supernovae. The inputs to the networks include parameters
describing the shape and the size of the lightcurve, together with colour of
the event. The network computes the posterior probability of microlensing,
together with an estimate of the likely error. An algorithm is devised for
direct calculation of the microlensing rate from the output of the neural
networks. We present a new analysis of the microlensing candidates towards the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The neural networks confirm the microlensing
nature of only 7 of the possible 17 events identified by the MACHO experiment.
This suggests that earlier estimates of the microlensing optical depth towards
the LMC may have been overestimated. A smaller number of events is consistent
with the assumption that all the microlensing events are caused by the known
stellar populations in the outer Galaxy/LMC.
