The behavior of a phase separating binary mixture in uniform shear flow is
investigated by numerical simulations and in a renormalization group (RG)
approach. Results show the simultaneous existence of domains of two
characteristic scales. Stretching and cooperative ruptures of the network
produce a rich interplay where the recurrent prevalence of thick and thin
domains determines log-time periodic oscillations. A power law growth $ R(t)
\sim t^{\alpha}$ of the average domain size, with $\alpha =4/3$ and $\alpha =
1/3$ in the flow and shear direction respectively, is shown to be obeyed.
