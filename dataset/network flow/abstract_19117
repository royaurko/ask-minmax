Virtual Sectorization (ViSn) aims at covering a confined area such as a
traffic hot-spot using a narrow beam. The beam is generated by a remote antenna
array located at-or close to the Base Station (BS). This paper develops the
ViSn model and provides the guidelines for designing the Virtual Sector (ViS)
antenna. In order to mitigate interference between the ViS and the traditional
macro sector covering the rest of the area, a Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA)
algorithm that self-optimizes the frequency bandwidth split between the macro
cell and the ViS is also proposed. The Self-Organizing Network (SON) algorithm
is constructed to maximize the proportional fair utility of all the users
throughputs. Numerical simulations show the interest in deploying ViSn, and the
significant capacity gain brought about by the self-optimized bandwidth sharing
with respect to a full reuse of the bandwidth by the ViS.
