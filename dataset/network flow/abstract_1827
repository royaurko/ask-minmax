Online social media have greatly affected the way in which we communicate
with each other. However, little is known about what are the fundamental
mechanisms driving dynamical information flow in online social systems. Here,
we introduce a generative model for online sharing behavior and analytically
show, using techniques from mathematical population genetics, that competition
between memes for the limited resource of user attention leads to a type of
self-organized criticality, with heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity:
a few memes "go viral" but the majority become only moderately popular. The
time-dependent solutions of the model are shown to fit empirical micro-blogging
data on hashtag usage, and to predict novel scaling features of the data. The
presented framework, in contrast to purely empirical studies or
simulation-based models, clearly distinguishes the roles of two distinct
factors affecting meme popularity: the memory time of users and the
connectivity structure of the social network.
