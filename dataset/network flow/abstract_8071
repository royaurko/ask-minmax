Results are presented for the phase separation process of a binary mixture
subject to an uniform shear flow quenched from a disordered to a homogeneous
ordered phase. The kinetics of the process is described in the context of the
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with an external velocity term. The
large-N approximation is used to study the evolution of the model in the
presence of a stationary flow and in the case of an oscillating shear.
  For stationary flow we show that the structure factor obeys a generalized
dynamical scaling. The domains grow with different typical lengthscales $R_x$
and $R_\perp$ respectively in the flow direction and perpendicularly to it. In
the scaling regime $R_\perp \sim t^{\alpha_\perp}$ and $R_x \sim \gamma
t^{\alpha_x}$ (with logarithmic corrections), $\gamma $ being the shear rate,
with $\alpha_x=5/4$ and $\alpha_\perp =1/4$. The excess viscosity $\Delta \eta$
after reaching a maximum relaxes to zero as $\gamma ^{-2}t^{-3/2}$. $\Delta
\eta$ and other observables exhibit log-time periodic oscillations which can be
interpreted as due to a growth mechanism where stretching and break-up of
domains cyclically occur.
  In the case of an oscillating shear a cross-over phenomenon is observed:
Initially the evolution is characterized by the same growth exponents as for a
stationary flow. For longer times the phase separating structure cannot align
with the oscillating drift and a different regime is entered with an isotropic
growth and the same exponents of the case without shear.
