We investigate the constraints on power flow in networks and its implications
to the optimal power flow problem. The constraints are described by the
injection region of a network; this is the set of all vectors of power
injections, one at each bus, that can be achieved while satisfying the network
and operation constraints. If there are no operation constraints, we show the
injection region of a network is the set of all injections satisfying the
conservation of energy. If the network has a tree topology, e.g., a
distribution network, we show that under voltage magnitude, line loss
constraints, line flow constraints and certain bus real and reactive power
constraints, the injection region and its convex hull have the same
Pareto-front. The Pareto-front is of interest since these are the the optimal
solutions to the minimization of increasing functions over the injection
region. For non-tree networks, we obtain a weaker result by characterize the
convex hull of the voltage constraint injection region for lossless cycles and
certain combinations of cycles and trees.
