It has been recently proven that natural images exhibit scaling properties
analogue to those of turbulent flows. These properties allow regarding each
image as a multifractal object, for which its most singular manifold conveys
the most of the non-redundant structure. In the present work, we go further in
this analysis, proposing a simple propagator that reconstructs the whole image
from this set. This fact could have deep implications for biology, technology
and statistical mechanics.
