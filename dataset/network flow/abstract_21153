We propose a generalization of small world networks, in which the
reconnection of links is governed by a function that depends on the distance
between the elements to be linked. An adequate choice of this function lets us
control the clusterization of the system. Control of the clusterization, in
turn, allows the generation of a wide variety of topologies.
