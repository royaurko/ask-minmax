Context-free approaches to static analysis gain precision over classical
approaches by perfectly matching returns to call sites---a property that
eliminates spurious interprocedural paths. Vardoulakis and Shivers's recent
formulation of CFA2 showed that it is possible (if expensive) to apply
context-free methods to higher-order languages and gain the same boost in
precision achieved over first-order programs.
  To this young body of work on context-free analysis of higher-order programs,
we contribute a pushdown control-flow analysis framework, which we derive as an
abstract interpretation of a CESK machine with an unbounded stack. One
instantiation of this framework marks the first polyvariant pushdown analysis
of higher-order programs; another marks the first polynomial-time analysis. In
the end, we arrive at a framework for control-flow analysis that can
efficiently compute pushdown generalizations of classical control-flow
analyses.
