Many communication and social networks have power-law link distributions,
containing a few nodes which have a very high degree and many with low degree.
The high connectivity nodes play the important role of hubs in communication
and networking, a fact which can be exploited when designing efficient search
algorithms. We introduce a number of local search strategies which utilize high
degree nodes in power-law graphs and which have costs which scale sub-linearly
with the size of the graph. We also demonstrate the utility of these strategies
on the Gnutella peer-to-peer network.
