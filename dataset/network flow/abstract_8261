We study a dynamical model of epidemic spreading on complex networks in which
there are explicit correlations among the node's connectivities. For the case
of Markovian complex networks, showing only correlations between pairs of
nodes, we find an epidemic threshold inversely proportional to the largest
eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix that gives the average number of links
that from a node with connectivity $k$ go to nodes with connectivity $k'$.
Numerical simulations on a correlated growing network model provide support for
our conclusions.
