This article explores the relationship between communities and short cycles
in complex networks, based on the fact that nodes more densely connected
amongst one another are more likely to be linked through short cycles. By
identifying combinations of 3-, 4- and 5-edge-cycles, a subnetwork is obtained
which contains only those nodes and links belonging to such cycles, which can
then be used to highlight community structure. Examples are shown using a
theoretical model (Sznajd networks) and a real-world network (NCAA football).
