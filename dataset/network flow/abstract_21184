Detailed account is given of the chirality scenario of experimental
spin-glass transitions. In this scenario, the spin glass order of weakly
anisotropic Heisenberg-like spin-glass magnets including canonical spin glasses
are essentially chirality driven. Recent numerical and experimental results are
discussed in conjunction with this scenario.
