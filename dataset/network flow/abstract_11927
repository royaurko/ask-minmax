Networks today rely on expensive and proprietary hard- ware appliances, which
are deployed at fixed locations, for DDoS defense. This introduces key
limitations with respect to flexibility (e.g., complex routing to get traffic
to these "chokepoints") and elasticity in handling changing attack patterns. We
observe an opportunity to ad- dress these limitations using new networking
paradigms such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions
virtualization (NFV). Based on this observation, we design and implement of
Bohatei, an elastic and flexible DDoS defense system. In designing Bohatei, we
address key challenges of scalability, responsive- ness, and
adversary-resilience. We have implemented defenses for several well-known DDoS
attacks in Bohatei. Our evaluations show that Bohatei is scalable (handling 500
Gbps attacks), responsive (mitigating attacks within one minute), and resilient
to dynamic adversaries.
