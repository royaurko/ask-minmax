In hierarchical Mobile IPv6 networks, Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) may become
a single point of bottleneck as it handles more and more mobile nodes (MNs). A
number of schemes have been proposed to achieve load balancing among different
MAPs. However, signaling reduction is still imperfect because these schemes
also avoid the effect of the number of CNs. Also only the balancing of MN is
performed, but not the balancing of the actual traffic load, since CN of each
MN may be different. This paper proposes an efficient admission control
algorithm along with a replacement mechanism for HMIPv6 networks. The admission
control algorithm is based on the number of serving CNs and achieves actual
load balancing among MAPs. Moreover, a replacement mechanism is introduced to
decrease the new MN blocking probability and the handoff MN dropping
probability. By simulation results, we show that, the handoff delay and packet
loss are reduced in our scheme, when compared with the standard HMIPv6 based
handoff.
