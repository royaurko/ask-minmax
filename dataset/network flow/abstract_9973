Robust and accurate schemes are designed to simulate the coupling between
subsurface and overland flows. The coupling conditions at the interface enforce
the continuity of both the normal flux and the pressure. Richards' equation
governing the subsurface flow is discretized using a Backward Differentiation
Formula and a symmetric interior penalty Discontinuous Galerkin method. The
kinematic wave equation governing the overland flow is discretized using a
Godunov scheme. Both schemes individually are mass conservative and can be used
within single-step or multi-step coupling algorithms that ensure overall mass
conservation owing to a specific design of the interface fluxes in the
multi-step case. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performances
of the proposed algorithms.
