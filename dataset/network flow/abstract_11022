We describe a model of a communication network that allows us to price
complex network services as financial derivative contracts based on the spot
price of the capacity in individual routers. We prove a theorem of a Girsanov
transform that is useful for pricing linear derivatives on underlying assets,
which can be used to price many complex network services, and it is used to
price an option that gives access to one of several virtual channels between
two network nodes, during a specified future time interval. We give the
continuous time hedging strategy, for which the option price is independent of
the service providers attitude towards risk. The option price contains the
density function of a sum of lognormal variables, which has to be evaluated
numerically.
