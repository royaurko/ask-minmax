The roll calls of the Italian Parliament in the XVI legislature are studied
by employing multidimensional scaling, hierarchical clustering, and network
analysis. In order to detect changes in voting behavior, the roll calls have
been divided in seven periods of six months each. All the methods employed
pointed out an increasing fragmentation of the political parties endorsing the
previous government that culminated in its downfall. By using the concept of
modularity at different resolution levels, we identify the community structure
of Parliament and its evolution in each of the considered time periods. The
analysis performed revealed as a valuable tool in detecting trends and drifts
of Parliamentarians. It showed its effectiveness at identifying political
parties and at providing insights on the temporal evolution of groups and their
cohesiveness, without having at disposal any knowledge about political
membership of Representatives.
