In this work we extend the model of Bonabeau et al. in the case of scale-free
networks. A sharp transition is observed from an egalitarian to an hierarchical
society, with a very low population density threshold. The exact threshold
value also depends on the network size. We find that in an hierarchical society
the number of individuals with strong winning attitude is much lower than the
number of the community members that have a low winning probability.
