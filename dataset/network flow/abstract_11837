Understanding information transmission across a network is a fundamental task
for controlling and manipulating both biological and man-made information
processing systems. Here, we show how topological resonant-like amplification
effects in scale-free networks of signaling devices are drastically reduced
when phase disorder in the external signals is considered. This is demonstrated
theoretically by means of a star-like network of overdamped bistable systems,
and confirmed numerically by simulations of scale-free networks of such
systems. The taming effect of the phase disorder is found to be sensitive to
the amplification's strength, while the topology-induced amplification
mechanism is robust against this kind of quenched disorder in the sense that it
does not significantly change the values of the coupling strength where
amplification is maximum in its absence.
