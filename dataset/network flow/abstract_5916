We address the common rate maximization problem in two-layer cellular
networks where high-power and low-power base stations are colocated in the same
geographical area. Interference becomes a serious problem when two or more
layers are considered in the same network. For this purpose, power control in
the downlink needs to be used to limit the interference and to fully exploit
the benefits of additional layer deployments.We present an analytical framework
to the common rate maximization problem both with and without maximum power
constraints and propose a heuristic algorithm. We present simulation results
for the proposed approaches in a two-layer network setup and observe a
significant common rate increase compared to single-layer wireless networks.
