Multi-region segmentation algorithms often have the onus of incorporating
complex anatomical knowledge representing spatial or geometric relationships
between objects, and general-purpose methods of addressing this knowledge in an
optimization-based manner have thus been lacking. This paper presents
Generalized Hierarchical Max-Flow (GHMF) segmentation, which captures simple
anatomical part-whole relationships in the form of an unconstrained hierarchy.
Regularization can then be applied to both parts and wholes independently,
allowing for spatial grouping and clustering of labels in a globally optimal
convex optimization framework. For the purposes of ready integration into a
variety of segmentation tasks, the hierarchies can be presented in run-time,
allowing for the segmentation problem to be readily specified and alternatives
explored without undue programming effort or recompilation.
