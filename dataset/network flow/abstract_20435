In this paper we obtain an analytical solution of the relativistic Boltzmann
equation under the relaxation time approximation that describes the
out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a radially expanding massless gas. This solution
is found by mapping this expanding system in flat spacetime to a static flow in
the curved spacetime $\mathrm{AdS}_{2}\otimes \mathrm{S}_{2}$. We further
derive explicit analytic expressions for the momentum dependence of the single
particle distribution function as well as for the spatial dependence of its
moments. We find that this dissipative system has the ability to flow as a
perfect fluid even though its entropy density does not match the equilibrium
form. The non-equilibrium contribution to the entropy density is shown to be
due to higher order scalar moments (which possess no hydrodynamical
interpretation) of the Boltzmann equation that can remain out of equilibrium
but do not couple to the energy-momentum tensor of the system. Thus, in this
system the slowly moving hydrodynamic degrees of freedom can exhibit true
perfect fluidity while being totally decoupled from the fast moving,
non-hydrodynamical microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to entropy
production.
