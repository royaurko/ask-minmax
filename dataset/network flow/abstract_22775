A novel residual-type {\it a posteriori} error analysis technique is
developed for multipoint flux mixed finite element methods for flow in porous
media in two or three space dimensions. The derived {\it a posteriori} error
estimator for the velocity and pressure error in $L^{2}-$norm consists of
discretization and quadrature indicators, and is shown to be reliable and
efficient. The main tools of analysis are a locally postprocessed approximation
to the pressure solution of an auxiliary problem and a quadrature error
estimate. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the competitive
behavior of the estimator.
