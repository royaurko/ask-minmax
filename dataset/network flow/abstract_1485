Contractile forces are essential for many developmental processes involving
cell shape change and tissue deformation. Recent experiments on reconstituted
actomyosin networks, the major component of the contractile machinery, have
shown that active contractility occurs above a threshold motor concentration
and within a window of crosslink concentration. We present a microscopic
dynamic model that incorporates two essential aspects of actomyosin
self-organization: the asymmetric load response of individual actin filaments
and the correlated motor-driven events mimicking myosin-induced filament
sliding. Using computer simulations we examine how the concentration and
susceptibility of motors contribute to their collective behavior and interplay
with the network connectivity to regulate macroscopic contractility. Our model
is shown to capture the formation and dynamics of contractile structures and
agree with the observed dependence of active contractility on microscopic
parameters including the contractility onset. Cooperative action of
load-resisting motors in a force-percolating structure integrates local
contraction/buckling events into a global contractile state via an active
coarsening process, in contrast to the flow transition driven by uncorrelated
kicks of susceptible motors.
