We study irreducible representations of Rees cones and characterize the
max-flow min-cut property of clutters in terms of the normality of Rees
algebras and the integrality of certain polyhedra. Then we present some
applications to combinatorial optimization and commutative algebra. As a
byproduct we obtain an "effective" method, based on the program "Normaliz", to
determine whether a given clutter satisfies the max-flow min-cut property. Let
C be a clutter and let I be its edge ideal. We prove that C has the max-flow
min-cut property if and only if I is normally torsion free, that is,
I^i=I^{(i)} for all i>=1, where I^{(i)} is the ith symbolic power of I.
