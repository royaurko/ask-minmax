Dynamics of arbitrary communication system is analysed as unreduced
interaction process. The applied generalised, universally nonperturbative
method of effective potential reveals the phenomenon of dynamic multivaluedness
of competing system configurations forced to permanently replace each other in
a causally random order, which leads to universally defined dynamical chaos,
complexity, fractality, self-organisation, and adaptability (physics/9806002,
physics/0211071, physics/0405063). We demonstrate the origin of huge,
exponentially high efficiency of the unreduced, complex network dynamics and
specify the universal symmetry of complexity (physics/0404006) as the
fundamental guiding principle for creation and control of such qualitatively
new kind of networks and devices. The emerging intelligent communication
paradigm and its practical realisation in the form of knowledge-based networks
involve the features of true, unreduced intelligence and consciousness
(physics/0409140) appearing in complex (multivalued) network dynamics and
results.
