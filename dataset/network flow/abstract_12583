In this chapter, we consider the problem of designing protection strategies
to contain spreading processes in complex cyber-physical networks. We
illustrate our ideas using a family of bio-motivated spreading models
originally proposed in the epidemiological literature, e.g., the
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. We first introduce a framework in
which we are allowed to distribute two types of resources in order to contain
the spread, namely, (i) preventive resources able to reduce the spreading rate,
and (ii) corrective resources able to increase the recovery rate of nodes in
which the resources are allocated. In practice, these resources have an
associated cost that depends on either the resiliency level achieved by the
preventive resource, or the restoration efficiency of the corrective resource.
We present a mathematical framework, based on dynamic systems theory and convex
optimization, to find the cost-optimal distribution of protection resources in
a network to contain the spread. We also present two extensions to this
framework in which (i) we consider generalized epidemic models, beyond the
simple SIS model, and (ii) we assume uncertainties in the contact network in
which the spreading is taking place. We compare these protection strategies
with common heuristics previously proposed in the literature and illustrate our
results with numerical simulations using the air traffic network.
