We study an extension of the classical graph cut problem, wherein we replace
the modular (sum of edge weights) cost function by a submodular set function
defined over graph edges. Special cases of this problem have appeared in
different applications in signal processing, machine learning and computer
vision. In this paper, we connect these applications via the generic
formulation of "cooperative graph cuts", for which we study complexity,
algorithms and connections to polymatroidal network flows. Finally, we compare
the proposed algorithms empirically.
