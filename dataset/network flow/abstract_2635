Regular perturbation solutions are obtained for the Stokes flow field, the
first order effects of inertia on the flow field, and the primary and secondary
pressure fields in the circular lid driven cavity. The physical mechanism that
causes vortex breakdown exists at small Reynolds number; it is a stagnation of
the secondary flow by an adverse pressure gradient. The discontinuity between
the rotating lid and the stationary sidewall has negligible influence on the
flow field provided that the inertial forcing of the secondary flow is not
localized near the boundary discontinuity, and the Reynolds number is small.
