A two-terminal interactive distributed source coding problem with alternating
messages for function computation at both locations is studied. For any number
of messages, a computable characterization of the rate region is provided in
terms of single-letter information measures. While interaction is useless in
terms of the minimum sum-rate for lossless source reproduction at one or both
locations, the gains can be arbitrarily large for function computation even
when the sources are independent. For a class of sources and functions,
interaction is shown to be useless, even with infinite messages, when a
function has to be computed at only one location, but is shown to be useful, if
functions have to be computed at both locations. For computing the Boolean AND
function of two independent Bernoulli sources at both locations, an achievable
infinite-message sum-rate with infinitesimal-rate messages is derived in terms
of a two-dimensional definite integral and a rate-allocation curve. A general
framework for multiterminal interactive function computation based on an
information exchange protocol which successively switches among different
distributed source coding configurations is developed. For networks with a star
topology, multiple rounds of interactive coding is shown to decrease the
scaling law of the total network rate by an order of magnitude as the network
grows.
