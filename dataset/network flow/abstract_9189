Recent research on finding important intermediate nodes in a network
suspected to contain criminal activity is highly dependent on network
centrality values. Betweenness centrality, for example, is widely used to rank
the nodes that act as brokers in the shortest paths connecting all source and
all the end nodes in a network. However both the shortest path node betweenness
and the linearly scaled betweenness can only show rankings for all the nodes in
a network. In this paper we explore the mathematical concept of pair-dependency
on intermediate nodes, adapting the concept to criminal relationships and
introducing a new source-intermediate reliance measure. To illustrate our
measure, we apply it to rank the nodes in the Enron email dataset and the
Noordin Top Terrorist networks. We compare the reliance ranking with Google
PageRank, Markov centrality as well as betweenness centrality and show that a
criminal investigation using the reliance measure, will lead to a different
prioritisation in terms of possible people to investigate. While the ranking
for the Noordin Top terrorist network nodes yields more extreme differences
than for the Enron email transaction network, in the latter the reliance values
for the set of finance managers immediately identified another employee
convicted of money laundering.
