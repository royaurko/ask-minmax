The initial boundary value problem for the three-dimensional incompressible
flow of liquid crystals is considered in a bounded smooth domain. The existence
and uniqueness is established for both the local strong solution with large
initial data and the global strong solution with small data. It is also proved
that when the strong solution exists, a weak solution must be equal to the
unique strong solution with the same data.
