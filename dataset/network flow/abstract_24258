This paper considers a two-user Gaussian interference channel with energy
harvesting transmitters. Different than conventional battery powered wireless
nodes, energy harvesting transmitters have to adapt transmission to
availability of energy at a particular instant. In this setting, the optimal
power allocation problem to maximize the sum throughput with a given deadline
is formulated. The convergence of the proposed iterative coordinate descent
method for the problem is proved and the short-term throughput maximizing
offline power allocation policy is found. Examples for interference regions
with known sum capacities are given with directional water-filling
interpretations. Next, stochastic data arrivals are addressed. Finally online
and/or distributed near-optimal policies are proposed. Performance of the
proposed algorithms are demonstrated through simulations.
