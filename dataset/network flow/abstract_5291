A model for ICRH induced flows in the presence of a strong magnetic field is
presented. These flows are the finite temperature counterpart of flows existing
in cold plasmas described e.g. in [D. Van Eester et al., Plasma Phys. Control.
Fusion 55 (2013) 025002] and thus do not rely on the waves being damped. The
kinetic corrections offer insight in what happens at cyclotron resonances.
Authors commonly either rely on the confining magnetic field $\vec{B}_o$-field
to be strong, or the electric field $\vec{E}$-field to be rapidly varying but
are not accounting for both when writing down the solution of the equation of
motion on the slow time scale. In this paper, the equation of motion is solved
for constant $B_o$ to keep the discussion as simple as possible. The
simultaneous presence of $\vec{B}_o$ and the $\vec{E}$-field inhomogeneity
causes drifts perpendicular to the $\vec{B}_o$ and to other slow time scale
accelerations, the Ponderomotive acceleration being one of them. Because of the
first and having tokamak applications in mind, these flows - although small in
magnitude - cause drifts that enter in competition with transport induced
flows.
