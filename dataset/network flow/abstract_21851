Measurements of a variety of hadron species in pp and Au+Au collisions at 200
GeV are presented and studied within the framework of chemical and local
kinetic equilibrium models. The extracted chemical and final kinetic freeze-out
temperatures and collective flow velocities are discussed as function of
centrality. The results suggest that Au+Au collisions of various centralities
at RHIC always evolve toward the same temperature at chemical freeze-out,
followed by cooling and expansion toward kinetic freeze-out.
