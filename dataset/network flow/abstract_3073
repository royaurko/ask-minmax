How do local topological changes affect the global operation and stability of
complex supply networks? Studying supply networks on various levels of
abstraction, we demonstrate that and how adding new links may not only promote
but also degrade stable operation of a network. Intriguingly, the resulting
overloads may emerge remotely from where such a link is added, thus resulting
in nonlocal failure. We link this counter-intuitive phenomenon to Braess'
paradox originally discovered in traffic networks. We use elementary network
topologies to explain its underlying mechanism for different types of supply
networks and find that it generically occurs across these systems. As an
important consequence, upgrading supply networks such as communication
networks, biological supply networks or power grids requires particular care
because even adding only single connections may destabilize normal network
operation and induce disturbances remotely from the location of structural
change and even global cascades of failures.
