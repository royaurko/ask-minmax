Dynamical systems with a network structure can display collective behaviour
such as synchronisation. Golubitsky and Stewart observed that all the robustly
synchronous dynamics of a network is contained in the dynamics of its quotient
networks. DeVille and Lerman have recently shown that the original network and
its quotients are related by graph fibrations and hence their dynamics are
conjugate. This paper demonstrates the importance of self-fibrations of network
graphs. Self-fibrations give rise to symmetries in the dynamics of a network.
We show that every homogeneous network admits a lift with self-fibrations and
that every robust synchrony in this lift is determined by the symmetries of its
dynamics. These symmetries moreover impact the global dynamics of network
systems and can be used to explain and predict generic scenarios for synchrony
breaking. We also discuss networks with interior symmetries and nonhomogeneous
networks.
