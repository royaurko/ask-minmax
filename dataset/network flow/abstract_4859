In this paper we define the torsion flow, a CR analogue of the Ricci flow.
For homogeneous CR manifolds we give explicit solutions to the torsion flow
illustrating various kinds of behavior. We also derive monotonicity formulas
for CR entropy functionals. As an application, we classify torsion breathers.
