We present a new outer bound for the sum capacity of general multi-unicast
deterministic networks. Intuitively, this bound can be understood as applying
the cut-set bound to concatenated copies of the original network with a special
restriction on the allowed transmit signal distributions. We first study
applications to finite-field networks, where we obtain a general outer-bound
expression in terms of ranks of the transfer matrices. We then show that, even
though our outer bound is for deterministic networks, a recent result relating
the capacity of AWGN KxKxK networks and the capacity of a deterministic
counterpart allows us to establish an outer bound to the DoF of KxKxK wireless
networks with general connectivity. This bound is tight in the case of the
"adjacent-cell interference" topology, and yields graph-theoretic necessary and
sufficient conditions for K DoF to be achievable in general topologies.
