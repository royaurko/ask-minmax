I propose event-plane correlations as a test of collectivity in small
colliding systems: In d-Au and $^3$He-Au collisions, I predict a strong
anti-correlation between elliptic and triangular flow, generated by the
geometry of the light projectile. A significant anti-correlation is also
predicted in central p-Pb collisions at the LHC, which is solely generated by
fluctuations. Similar, but stronger correlation patterns are predicted in
correlations involving dipolar flow.
