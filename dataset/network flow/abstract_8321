Small-world networks, which combine randomized and structured elements, are
seen as prevalent in nature. Several random graph models have been given for
small-world networks, with one of the most fruitful, introduced by Jon
Kleinberg, showing in which type of graphs it is possible to route, or
navigate, between vertices with very little knowledge of the graph itself.
Kleinberg's model is static, with random edges added to a fixed grid. In this
paper we introduce, analyze and test a randomized algorithm which successively
rewires a graph with every application. The resulting process gives a model for
the evolution of small-world networks with properties similar to those studied
by Kleinberg.
