In this article we present an analytical method for deriving the relationship
between the pressure drop and flow rate in laminar flow regimes, and apply it
to the flow of power-law fluids through axially-symmetric corrugated tubes. The
method, which is general with regards to fluid and tube shape within certain
restrictions, can also be used as a foundation for numerical integration where
analytical expressions are hard to obtain due to mathematical or practical
complexities. Five converging-diverging geometries are used as examples to
illustrate the application of this method.
