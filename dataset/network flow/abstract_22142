In this article we prove the existence and uniqueness for degenerate
stochastic differential equations with Sobolev (possibly singular) drift and
diffusion coefficients in a generalized sense. In particular, our result covers
the classical DiPerna-Lions flows and, we also obtain the well-posedness for
degenerate Fokker-Planck equations with irregular coefficients. Moreover, a
large deviation principle of Freidlin-Wenzell type for this type of SDEs is
established.
