In this paper we propose methodology for inference of binary adjacency
matrices from various measures of the strength of association between pairs of
network nodes, or more generally pairs of variables. This strength of
association can be quantified by sample covariance and correlation matrices,
and more generally by test-statistics and hypothesis test p-values from
arbitrary distributions. Binary adjacency matrices inferred in this way are
then ideal for community detection, for example by block-modelling. The
proposed methodology is applicable to large high-dimensional data-sets and is
based on computationally efficient algorithms: we illustrate its utility in a
range of contexts including biological and social/communication networks.
