An asymptotic technique is developed to find the
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) and spectral efficiency of a
link with N receiver antennas in wireless networks with non-homogeneous
distributions of nodes. It is found that with appropriate normalization, the
SINR and spectral efficiency converge with probability 1 to asymptotic limits
as N increases. This technique is applied to networks with power-law node
intensities, which includes homogeneous networks as a special case, to find a
simple approximation for the spectral efficiency. It is found that for
receivers in dense clusters, the SINR grows with N at rates higher than that of
homogeneous networks and that constant spectral efficiencies can be maintained
if the ratio of N to node density is constant. This result also enables the
analysis of a new scaling regime where the distribution of nodes in the network
flattens rather than increases uniformly. It is found that in many cases in
this regime, N needs to grow approximately exponentially to maintain a constant
spectral efficiency. In addition to strengthening previously known results for
homogeneous networks, these results provide insight into the benefit of using
antenna arrays in non-homogeneous wireless networks, for which few results are
available in the literature.
