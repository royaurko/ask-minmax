Computational methods have complemented experimental and clinical
neursciences and led to improvements in our understanding of the nervous
systems in health and disease. In parallel, neuromodulation in form of electric
and magnetic stimulation is gaining increasing acceptance in chronic and
intractable diseases. In this paper, we firstly explore the relevant state of
the art in fusion of both developments towards translational computational
neuroscience. Then, we propose a strategy to employ the new theoretical concept
of dynamical network biomarkers (DNB) in episodic manifestations of chronic
disorders. In particular, as a first example, we introduce the use of
computational models in migraine and illustrate on the basis of this example
the potential of DNB as early-warning signals for neuromodulation in episodic
migraine.
