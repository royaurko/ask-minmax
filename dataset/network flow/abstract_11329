Existing models of network growth typically have one or two parameters or
strategies which are fixed for all times. We introduce a general framework
where feedback on the current state of a network is used to dynamically alter
the values of such parameters. A specific model is analyzed where limited
resources are shared amongst arriving nodes, all vying to connect close to the
root. We show that tunable feedback leads to growth of larger, more efficient
networks. Exact results show that linear scaling of resources with system size
yields crossover to a trivial condensed state, which can be considerably
delayed with sublinear scaling.
