We perform an in-depth study for mean first-passage time (MFPT)---a primary
quantity for random walks with numerous applications---of maximal-entropy
random walks (MERW) performed in complex networks. For MERW in a general
network, we derive an explicit expression of MFPT in terms of the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix associated with the network. For MERW
in uncorrelated networks, we also provide a theoretical formula of MFPT at the
mean-field level, based on which we further evaluate the dominant scalings of
MFPT to different targets for MERW in uncorrelated scale-free networks, and
compare the results with those corresponding to traditional unbiased random
walks (TURW). We show that the MFPT to a hub node is much lower for MERW than
for TURW. However, when the destination is a node with the least degree or a
uniformly chosen node, the MFPT is higher for MERW than for TURW. Since MFPT to
a uniformly chosen node measures real efficiency of search in networks, our
work provides insight into general searching process in complex networks.
