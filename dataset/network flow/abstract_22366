Accurate prediction of interfacial slip in nanoscale channels is required by
many microfluidic applications. Existing hydrodynamic solutions based on
Maxwellian boundary conditions include an empirical parameter that depends on
material properties and pore dimensions. This paper presents a derivation of a
new expression for the slip coefficient that is not based on the assumptions
concerning the details of solid-fluid collisions and whose parameters are
obtainable from \textit{equilibrium} simulation. The results for the slip
coefficient and flow rates are in good agreement with non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics simulation.
