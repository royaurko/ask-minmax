We address the evaluation of mixing efficiency in experiments of chaotic
mixing inside an open-flow channel. Since the open flow continuously brings new
fluid into the limited mixing region, it is difficult to define relevant mixing
indices, as fluid particles experience typically very different stretching and
mixing histories. The repeated stretching and folding of a spot of dye leads to
a persistent pattern. We propose that the normalized standard deviation of this
characteristic pattern is a good measure of the mixing quality of the flow. We
discuss the link between this measure and mixing of continuously-injected dye,
and investigate it using an idealized map.
