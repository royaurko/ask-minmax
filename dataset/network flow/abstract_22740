We are concerned with solutions to the parabolic Allen-Cahn equation in
Riemannian manifolds. For a general class of initial condition we show non
positivity of the limiting energy discrepancy. This in turn allows to prove
almost monotonicity formula (a weak counterpart of Huisken's monotonicity
formula) which gives a local uniform control of the energy densities at small
scales.
  Such results will be used in [40] to extend previous important results from
[31] in Euclidean space, showing convergence of solutions to the parabolic
Allen-Cahn equations to Brakke's motion by mean curvature in space forms.
