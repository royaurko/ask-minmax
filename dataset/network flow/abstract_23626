Detecting gravitational wave bursts (characterised by short durations and
poorly modelled waveforms) requires to have coincidences between several
interferometric detectors in order to reject non-stationary noise events. As
the wave amplitude seen in a detector depends on its location with respect to
the source direction and as the signal to noise ratio of these bursts are
expected to be low, coincidences between antennas may not be so likely. This
paper investigates this question from a statistical point of view by using a
simple model of a network of detectors; it also estimates the timing precision
of a detection in an interferometer which is an important issue for the
reconstruction of the source location, based on time delays.
