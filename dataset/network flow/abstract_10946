The development of Econophysics is studied from the perspective of scientific
communication networks. Papers in Econophysics published from 1992 to 2003 are
collected. Then a weighted and directed network of scientific communication,
including collaboration, citation and personal discussion, is constructed. Its
static geometrical properties, including degree distribution, weight
distribution, weight per degree, and betweenness centrality, give a nice
overall description of the research works. The way we introduced here to
measure the weight of connections can be used as a general one to construct
weighted network.
