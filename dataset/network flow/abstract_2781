Interconnected networks are mathematical representation of systems where two
or more simple networks are coupled to each other. Depending on the coupling
weight between the two components, the interconnected network can function in
two regimes: one where the two networks are structurally distinguishable, and
one where they are not. The coupling threshold--denoting this structural
transition--is one of the most crucial concepts in interconnected networks.
Yet, current information about the coupling threshold is limited. This letter
presents an analytical expression for the exact value of the coupling threshold
and outlines network interrelation implications.
