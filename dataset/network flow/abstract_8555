We investigate certain configurations of Luneburg lenses that form light
propagating and guiding networks. We study single Luneburg lens dynamics and
apply the single lens ray tracing solution to various arrangements of multiple
lenses. The wave propagating features of the Luneburg lens networks are also
verified through direct numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations. We find
that Luneburg lenses may form efficient waveguides for light propagation and
guiding. The additional presence of nonlinearity improves the focusing
characteristics of the networks.
