We analyze magnetic kinematic dynamo in a conducting fluid where the
stationary shear flow is accompanied by relatively weak random velocity
fluctuations. The diffusionless and diffusion regimes are described. The growth
rates of the magnetic field moments are related to the statistical
characteristics of the flow describing divergence of the Lagrangian
trajectories. The magnetic field correlation functions are examined, we
establish their growth rates and scaling behavior. General assertions are
illustrated by explicit solution of the model where the velocity field is
short-correlated in time.
