We present STAR results on the elliptic flow v_2 of charged hadrons, strange
and multi-strange particles from sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC.
The detailed study of the centrality dependence of v_2 over a broad transverse
momentum range is presented. Comparison of different analysis methods are made
in order to estimate systematic uncertainties. In order to discuss the non-flow
effect, we have performed the first analysis of v_2 with the Lee-Yang Zero
method for K_s^0 and Lambda.
  In the relatively low p_T region, p_T <= 2 GeV/c, a scaling with m_T - m is
observed for identified hadrons in each centrality bin studied. However, we do
not observe v_2(p_T) scaled by the participant eccentricity to be independent
of centrality. At higher p_T, 2 GeV/c <= p_T <= 6 GeV/c, v_2 scales with quark
number for all hadrons studied. For the multi-strange hadron Omega, which does
not suffer appreciable hadronic interactions, the values of v_2 are consistent
with both m_T -m scaling at low p_T and number-of-quark scaling at intermediate
p_T. As a function of collision centrality, an increase of p_T-integrated v_2
scaled by the participant eccentricity has been observed, indicating a stronger
collective flow in more central Au+Au collisions.
