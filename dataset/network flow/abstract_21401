We report simulations of the gas flow in the gravitational potential of the
COBE NIR bulge and disk. These models lead to four--armed spiral structure
between corotation of the bar and the Sun, in agreement with the observed
spiral arm tangents. The 3-kpc-arm is identified with one of the arms emanating
from the ends of the bar.
