This chapter describes Aneka-Federation, a decentralized and distributed
system that combines enterprise Clouds, overlay networking, and structured
peer-to-peer techniques to create scalable wide-area networking of compute
nodes for high-throughput computing. The Aneka-Federation integrates numerous
small scale Aneka Enterprise Cloud services and nodes that are distributed over
multiple control and enterprise domains as parts of a single coordinated
resource leasing abstraction. The system is designed with the aim of making
distributed enterprise Cloud resource integration and application programming
flexible, efficient, and scalable. The system is engineered such that it:
enables seamless integration of existing Aneka Enterprise Clouds as part of
single wide-area resource leasing federation; self-organizes the system
components based on a structured peer-to-peer routing methodology; and presents
end-users with a distributed application composition environment that can
support variety of programming and execution models. This chapter describes the
design and implementation of a novel, extensible and decentralized peer-to-peer
technique that helps to discover, connect and provision the services of Aneka
Enterprise Clouds among the users who can use different programming models to
compose their applications. Evaluations of the system with applications that
are programmed using the Task and Thread execution models on top of an overlay
of Aneka Enterprise Clouds have been described here.
