This paper investigates the problem of decomposition with respect to outputs
for Boolean control networks (BCNs). First, with the linear expression of BCNs
and the matrix semi-tensor product, some algebraic equivalent conditions for
the decomposition are obtained. Second, a necessary and sufficient graphical
condition for the decomposition with respect to outputs is given. Third, an
effective method is proposed to reduce the computational burden in the
realization of the decomposition. Finally, some examples are addressed to
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
