We study the metastability and nucleation of the Blume-Capel model on complex
networks, in which each node can take one of three possible spin variables
$\left\{ {-1, 0, 1} \right\}$. We consider the external magnetic field $h$ to
be positive, and let the chemical potential $\lambda$ vary between $-h$ and $h$
in a low temperature, such that the $1$ configuration is stable, and $-1$
configuration and/or $0$ configuration are metastable. Combining the
heterogeneous mean-field theory with simulations, we show that there exist four
regions with distinct nucleation scenarios depending on the values of $h$ and
$\lambda$: the system undergoes a two-step nucleation process from $-1$
configuration to $0$ configuration and then to $1$ configuration (region I);
nucleation becomes a one-step process without an intermediate metastable
configuration directly from $-1$ configuration to $1$ configuration (region
II(1)) or directly from $0$ configuration to $1$ configuration (region II(2))
depending on the sign of $\lambda$; the metastability of the system vanishes
and nucleation is thus irrelevant (region III). Furthermore, we show that in
the region I nucleation rates for each step intersect that results in the
occurrence of a maximum in the total nucleation rate.
