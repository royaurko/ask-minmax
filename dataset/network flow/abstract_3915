This paper describes a content centric network architecture which uses
software defined networking principles to implement efficient metadata driven
services by extracting content metadata at the network layer. The ability to
access content metadata transparently enables a number of new services in the
network. Specific examples discussed here include: a metadata driven traffic
engineering scheme which uses prior knowledge of content length to optimize
content delivery, a metadata driven content firewall which is more resilient
than traditional firewalls and differentiated treatment of content based on the
type of content being accessed. A detailed outline of an implementation of the
proposed architecture is presented along with some basic evaluation.
