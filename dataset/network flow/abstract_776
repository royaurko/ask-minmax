Today in fast technology development in wireless mobile adhoc network there
is vast scope for research. As it is known that wireless communication for
mobile network has many application areas like routing services, security
services etc. The mobile adhoc network is the wireless network for
communication in which the mobile nodes are organized without any centralized
administrator. There are many Manet routing protocols like reactive, proactive,
hybrid etc. In this paper the reactive Manet routing protocol like DSR is
simulated for traffic analysis for 50 mobile nodes for IP traffic flows. Also
throughput is analyzed for DSR and ER-DSR protocol. And finally the memory
utilized during simulation of DSR and ER-DSR is evaluated in order to compare
both.
