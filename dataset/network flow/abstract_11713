Networked Control Systems (NCS) are distributed systems where plants,
sensors, actuators and controllers communicate over shared networks. Non-ideal
behaviors of the communication network include variable sampling/transmission
intervals and communication delays, packet losses, communication constraints
and quantization errors. NCS have been the object of intensive study in the
last few years. However, due to the inherent complexity of NCS, current
literature focuses on only a subset of these non-idealities and mostly
considers stability and stabilizability problems. Recent technology advances
indeed demand that different and more complex control objectives are
considered. In this paper we present first a general model of NCS, including
all the non-idealities of the communication network; then, we propose a
symbolic model approach to the control design with objectives expressed in
terms of non-deterministic transition systems. The presented results are based
on recent advances in symbolic control design of hybrid and continuous control
systems. An example in the context of robot motion planning with remote control
is included, showing the effectiveness of the approach taken.
