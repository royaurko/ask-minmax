In their paper on discrete analogues of some classical systems such as the
rigid body and the geodesic flow on an ellipsoid, Moser and Veselov introduced
their analysis in the general context of flows on Stiefel manifolds. We
consider here a general class of continuous time, quadratic cost, optimal
control problems on Stiefel manifolds, which in the extreme dimensions again
yield these classical physical geodesic flows. We have already shown that this
optimal control setting gives a new symmetric representation of the rigid body
flow and in this paper we extend this representation to the geodesic flow on
the ellipsoid and the more general Stiefel manifold case. The metric we choose
on the Stiefel manifolds is the same as that used in the symmetric
representation of the rigid body flow and that used by Moser and Veselov. In
the extreme cases of the ellipsoid and the rigid body, the geodesic flows are
known to be integrable. We obtain the extremal flows using both variational and
optimal control approaches and elucidate the structure of the flows on general
Stiefel manifolds.
