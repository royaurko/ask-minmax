Logistic models for random graphs are commonly used to study binary networks
when covariate information is available. After estimating the logistic
parameters, one of the main questions which arises in practice is to assess the
goodness of fit of the corresponding model. To address this problem, we add a
general term, related to the graphon function of W-graph models, to the
logistic function. Such an extra term aims at characterizing the residual
structure of the network, that is not explained by the covariates. We
approximate this new generic logistic model using a class of models with
blockwise constant residual structure. This framework allows to derive a
Bayesian procedure from a model based selection context using goodness-of-fit
criteria. All these criteria depend on marginal likelihood terms for which we
do provide estimates relying on two series of variational approximations.
Experiments on toy data are carried out to assess the inference procedure.
Finally, two real networks from social sciences and ecology are studied to
illustrate the proposed methodology.
