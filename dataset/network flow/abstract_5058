In this work the contributors study the multiphase flow soft-sensing problem based
on a previously established framework. There are three functional modules in
this framework, namely, a transient well flow model that describes the response
of certain physical variables in a well, for instance, temperature, velocity
and pressure, to the flow rates entering and leaving the well zones; a Markov
jump process that is designed to capture the potential abrupt changes in the
flow rates; and an estimation method that is adopted to estimate the underlying
flow rates based on the measurements from the physical sensors installed in the
well.
  In the previous studies, the variances of the flow rates in the Markov jump
process are chosen manually. To fill this gap, in the current work two
automatic approaches are proposed in order to optimize the variance estimation.
Through a numerical example, we show that, when the estimation framework is
used in conjunction with these two proposed variance-estimation approaches, it
can achieve reasonable performance in terms of matching both the measurements
of the physical sensors and the true underlying flow rates.
