We relate structurally dynamic cellular networks, a class of models we
developed in fundamental space-time physics, to SDCA, introduced some time ago
by Ilachinski and Halpern. We emphasize the crucial property of a non-linear
interaction of network geometry with the matter degrees of freedom in order to
emulate the supposedly highly erratic and strongly fluctuating space-time
structure on the Planck scale. We then embark on a detailed numerical analysis
of various large scale characteristics of several classes of models in order to
understand what will happen if some sort of macroscopic or continuum limit is
performed. Of particular relevance in this context is a notion of network
dimension and its behavior in this limit. Furthermore, the possibility of phase
transitions is discussed.
