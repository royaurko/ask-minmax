Proteins participating in a protein-protein interaction network can be
grouped into homology classes following their common ancestry. Proteins added
to the network correspond to genes added to the classes, so that the dynamics
of the two objects are intrinsically linked. Here, we first introduce a
statistical model describing the joint growth of the network and the
partitioning of nodes into classes, which is studied through a combined
mean-field and simulation approach. We then employ this unified framework to
address the specific issue of the age dependence of protein interactions,
through the definition of three different node wiring/divergence schemes.
Comparison with empirical data indicates that an age-dependent divergence move
is necessary in order to reproduce the basic topological observables together
with the age correlation between interacting nodes visible in empirical data.
We also discuss the possibility of nontrivial joint partition/topology
observables.
