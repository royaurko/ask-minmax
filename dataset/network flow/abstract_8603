We investigate cluster synchronization in coupled map networks in the
presence of heterogeneous delays. We find that while parity of heterogeneous
delays plays a crucial role in determining the phenomenon of cluster formation,
the synchronizability of network predominantly gets affected by the amount of
heterogeneity. The heterogeneity in delays induces a rich cluster patterns as
compared to the homogeneous delays. The complete bipartite networks stands as
an extreme example of this richness, where instead of robust ideal driven
clusters, versatile cluster patterns are observed for which we provide
arguments using the Lyapunov function analysis. Furthermore, interplay between
the number of connections in the network and the amount of heterogeneity has
important role in deciding cluster formation.
