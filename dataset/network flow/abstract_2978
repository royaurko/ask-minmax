The radio continuum properties of galaxy clusters with cooling flows are
reviewed along with the relationship to the X-ray environment. We find that
60-70% of cD galaxies in cooling flows are radio-loud, a much higher fraction
than the 14% found for typical cluster ellipticals. New ROSAT HRI observations
reveal a variety of interesting correlations and anticorrelations between the
X-ray structure within the inner cooling flows and the radio morphologies. It
appears that the radio plasma can have a strong effect on the inner structure
of cluster cooling cores as virtually all cooling flow clusters with central
radio sources have non-symmetric X-ray structure. Numerical simulations of
radio jets in cooling flow atmospheres are presented. We also discuss the
prospects for destroying cooling flows via cluster-cluster mergers, using new
hydro/N-body simulations which incorporate radiative cooling.
