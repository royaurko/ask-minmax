Analytical study of the distribution of phase of the transmission coefficient
through 1D disordered absorbing system is presented. The phase is shown to obey
approximately Gaussian distribution. An explicit expression for the variance is
obtained, which shows that absorption suppresses the fluctuations of the phase.
The applicability of the random phase approximation is discussed.
