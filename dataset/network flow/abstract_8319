We suggest a method for routing when the source does not posses full
information about the shortest path to the destination. The method is
particularly useful for scale-free networks, and exploits its unique
characteristics. By assigning new (short) names to nodes (aka labelling) we are
able to reduce significantly the memory requirement at the routers, yet we
succeed in routing with high probability through paths very close in distance
to the shortest ones.
