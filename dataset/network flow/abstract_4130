The expansion of the fireball created in relativistic heavy ion collisions is
described using the 3+1D hydrodynamical model. Experimentally observed
transverse momentum spectra at different rapdities, elliptic flow and HBT
correlations of produced particles can be reproduced. We give estimates of
shear viscosity corrections at freeze-out, which we find important only for the
elliptic flow coefficient.
