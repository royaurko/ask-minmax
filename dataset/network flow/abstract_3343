Gene regulatory network inference uses genome-wide transcriptome measurements
in response to genetic, environmental or dynamic perturbations to predict
causal regulatory influences between genes. We hypothesized that evolution also
acts as a suitable network perturbation and that integration of data from
multiple closely related species can lead to improved reconstruction of gene
regulatory networks. To test this hypothesis, we predicted networks from
temporal gene expression data for 3,610 genes measured during early embryonic
development in six Drosophila species and compared predicted networks to gold
standard networks of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq interactions for developmental
transcription factors in five species. We found that (i) the performance of
single-species networks was independent of the species where the gold standard
was measured; (ii) differences between predicted networks reflected the known
phylogeny and differences in biology between the species; (iii) an integrative
consensus network which minimized the total number of edge gains and losses
with respect to all single-species networks performed better than any
individual network. Our results show that in an evolutionarily conserved
system, integration of data from comparable experiments in multiple species
improves the inference of gene regulatory networks. They provide a basis for
future studies on the numerous multi-species gene expression datasets for other
biological processes available in the literature.
