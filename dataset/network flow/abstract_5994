The vertices of an interval graph represent intervals over a real line where
overlapping intervals denote that their corresponding vertices are adjacent.
This implies that the vertices are measurable by a metric and there exists a
linear structure in the system. The generalization is an embedding of a graph
onto a multi-dimensional Euclidean space and it was used by scientists to study
the multi-relational complexity of ecology. However the research went out of
fashion in the 1980s and was not revisited when Network Science recently
expressed interests with multi-relational networks known as multiplexes. This
paper studies interval graphs from the perspective of Network Science.
