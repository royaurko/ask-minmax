We establish rigorous lower bounds on the speed of traveling fronts and on
the bulk burning rate in reaction-diffusion equation with passive advection.
The non-linearity is assumed to be of either KPP or ignition type. We consider
two main classes of flows. Percolating flows, which are characterized by the
presence of long tubes of streamlines mixing hot and cold material, lead to
strong speed-up of burning which is linear in the amplitude of the flow, $U$.
On the other hand the cellular flows, which have closed streamlines, are shown
to produce weaker increase in reaction. For such flows we get a lower bound
which grows as $U^{1/5}$ for a large amplitude of the flow.
