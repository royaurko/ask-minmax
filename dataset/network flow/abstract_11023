A 100 Mbps Ethernet link between a college campus and the outside world was
monitored with a dedicated PC and the measured data analysed for its
statistical properties. Similar measurements were taken at an internal node of
the network. The networks in both cases are a full-duplex switched Ethernet.
Inter-event interval histograms and power spectra of the throughput aggregated
for 10ms bins were used to analyse the measured traffic. For most investigated
cases both methods reveal that the traffic behaves according to a power law.
The results will be used in later studies to parameterise models for network
traffic.
