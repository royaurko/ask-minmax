Contact processes describe the transmission of distinct properties of nodes
via the links of a network. They provide a simple framework for many phenomena,
such as epidemic spreading and opinion formation. Combining contact processes
with rules for topological evolution yields an adaptive network in which the
states of the nodes can interact dynamically with the topological degrees of
freedom. By moment-closure approximation it is possible to derive
low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations that describe the
dynamics of the adaptive network on a coarse-grained level. In this chapter we
discuss the approximation technique itself as well as its applications to
adaptive networks. Thus, it can serve both as a tutorial as well as a review of
recent results.
