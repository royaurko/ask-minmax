We have developed a multi-phase SPH method to simulate arbitrary interfaces
containing surface active agents (surfactants) that locally change the
properties of the interface, such the surface tension coefficient. Our method
incorporates the effects of surface diffusion, transport of surfactant from/to
the bulk phase to/from the interface and diffusion in the bulk phase.
Neglecting transport mechanisms, we use this method to study the impact of
insoluble surfactants on drop deformation and breakup in simple shear flow and
present the results in a fluid dynamics video.
