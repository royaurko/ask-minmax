Elliptic flow and two-particle azimuthal correlations of charged hadrons and
high-$p_T$ pions ($p_T>$ 1 GeV/$c$) have been measured close to mid-rapidity in
158A GeV/$c$ Pb+Au collisions by the CERES experiment. Elliptic flow ($v_2$)
rises linearly with $p_T$ to a value of about 10% at 2 GeV/$c$. Beyond
$p_T\approx$ 1.5 GeV/$c$, the slope decreases considerably, possibly indicating
a saturation of $v_2$ at high $p_T$. Two-pion azimuthal anisotropies for $p_T>$
1.2 GeV/$c$ exceed the elliptic flow values by about 60% in mid-central
collisions. These non-flow contributions are attributed to near-side and
back-to-back jet-like correlations, the latter exhibiting centrality dependent
broadening.
