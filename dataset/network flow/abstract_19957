We investigate the nonlinear evolution of the Bales-Zangwill instability,
responsible for the meandering of atomic steps on a growing vicinal surface. We
develop an asymptotic method to derive, in the continuous limit, an evolution
equation for the two-dimensional step flow. The dynamics of the crystal surface
is greatly influenced by the anisotropy inherent to its geometry, and is
characterized by the coarsening of undulations along the step direction and by
the elastic relaxation in the mean slope direction. We demonstrate, using
similarity arguments, that the coalescence of meanders and the step flow follow
simple scaling laws, and deduce the exponents of the characteristic length
scales and height amplitude. The relevance of these results to experiments is
discussed.
