Synchronization is an important phenomenon in complex networks of oscillators
and many patterns of synchronized clusters result from symmetries in the
network and the related equations of motion. Application of computational group
theory has proved invaluable in discovering these clusters and analyzing their
stability. However, in some networks, especially Laplacian-coupled oscillators,
there are synchronization patterns that are not the direct result of symmetries
(e.g. global synchronization). We show that all possible patterns of cluster
synchronization in Laplacian-coupled systems can be analyzed with the help of
group theory applied to dynamically equivalent Laplacians. This also allows us
to extend the stability analysis to all such patterns.
