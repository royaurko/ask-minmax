Full-overlap U+U collisions provide significantly larger initial energy
densities at comparable spatial deformation, and significantly larger
deformation and volume at comparable energy density, than semicentral Au+Au
collisions. We show quantitatively that this provides a long lever arm for
studying the hydrodynamic behavior of elliptic flow in much larger and denser
collision systems and the predicted non-linear path-length dependence of
radiative parton energy loss.
