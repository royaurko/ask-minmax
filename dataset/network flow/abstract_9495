We analyze the behavior of closed product-form queueing networks when the
number of customers grows to infinity and remains proportionate on each route
(or class). First, we focus on the stationary behavior and prove the conjecture
that the stationary distribution at non-bottleneck queues converges weakly to
the stationary distribution of an ergodic, open product-form queueing network.
This open network is obtained by replacing bottleneck queues with per-route
Poissonian sources whose rates are determined by the solution of a strictly
concave optimization problem. Then, we focus on the transient behavior of the
network and use fluid limits to prove that the amount of fluid, or customers,
on each route eventually concentrates on the bottleneck queues only, and that
the long-term proportions of fluid in each route and in each queue solve the
dual of the concave optimization problem that determines the throughputs of the
previous open network.
