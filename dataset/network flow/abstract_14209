We show by means of a perturbative weakly nonlinear analysis that the
axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) of a viscous, resistive,
incompressible rotating shear flow in a thin channel gives rise to a real
Ginzburg-Landau equation for the disturbance amplitude. For small magnetic
Prandtl number (${\cal P}_{\rm m}$), the saturation amplitude is $\propto
\sqrt{{\cal P}_{\rm m}}$ and the resulting momentum transport scales as ${\cal
R}^{-1}$, where $\cal R$ is the {\em hydrodynamic} Reynolds number. Simplifying
assumptions, such as linear shear base flow, mathematically expedient boundary
conditions and continuous spectrum of the vertical linear modes, are used to
facilitate this analysis. The asymptotic results are shown to comply with
numerical calculations using a spectral code. They suggest that the transport
due to the nonlinearly developed MRI may be very small in experimental setups
with ${\cal P}_{\rm m} \ll 1$.
