Delay is an important and ubiquitous aspect of many biochemical processes.
For example, delay plays a central role in the dynamics of genetic regulatory
networks as it stems from the sequential assembly of first mRNA and then
protein. Genetic regulatory networks are therefore frequently modeled as
stochastic birth-death processes with delay. Here we examine the relationship
between delay birth-death processes and their appropriate approximating delay
chemical Langevin equations. We prove that the distance between these two
descriptions, as measured by expectations of functionals of the processes,
converges to zero with increasing system size. Further, we prove that the delay
birth-death process converges to the thermodynamic limit as system size tends
to infinity. Our results hold for both fixed delay and distributed delay.
Simulations demonstrate that the delay chemical Langevin approximation is
accurate even at moderate system sizes. It captures dynamical features such as
the spatial and temporal distributions of transition pathways in metastable
systems, oscillatory behavior in negative feedback circuits, and
cross-correlations between nodes in a network. Overall, these results provide a
foundation for using delay stochastic differential equations to approximate the
dynamics of birth-death processes with delay.
