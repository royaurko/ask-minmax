Previously Chicone, Latushkin and Montgomery-Smith [\textbf{Comm. Math. Phys.
\textbf{173},(1995)}] have investigated the spectrum of the dynamo operator for
an ideally conducting fluid. More recently, Tang and Boozer [{\textbf{Phys.
Plasmas (2000)}}], have investigated the anisotropies in magnetic field dynamo
evolution, from finite-time, Lyapunov exponents, giving rise to a Riemann
metric tensor, in the Alfven twist in magnetic flux tubes (MFTs). In this paper
one investigate the role of Perelman Ricci flows constraints in twisted
magnetic flux tubes, where the Lyapunov eigenvalue spectra for the Ricci tensor
associated with the Ricci flow equation in MFTs leads to a finite-time Lyapunov
exponential stretching along the toroidal direction of the tube and a
contraction along the radial direction of the tube. It is shown that in the
case of MFTs, the sectional Ricci curvature of the flow, is negative as happens
in geodesic flows of Anosov type. Ricci flows constraints in MFTs substitute
the Thiffeault and Boozer [\textbf{Chaos}(2001)] have vanishing of Riemann
curvature constraint on the Lyapunov exponential stretching of chaotic flows.
Gauss curvature of the twisted MFT is also computed and the contraints on a
negative Gauss curvature are obtained.
