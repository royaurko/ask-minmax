Solving mazes is not just a fun pastime. Mazes are prototype models in graph
theory, topology, robotics, traffic optimization, psychology, and in many other
areas of science and technology. However, when maze complexity increases their
solution becomes cumbersome and very time consuming. Here, we show that a
network of memristors - resistors with memory - can solve such a non-trivial
problem quite easily. In particular, maze solving by the network of memristors
occurs in a massively parallel fashion since all memristors in the network
participate simultaneously in the calculation. The result of the calculation is
then recorded into the memristors' states, and can be used and/or recovered at
a later time. Furthermore, the network of memristors finds all possible
solutions in multiple-solution mazes, and sorts out the solution paths
according to their length. Our results demonstrate not only the first
application of memristive networks to the field of massively-parallel
computing, but also a novel algorithm to solve mazes which could find
applications in different research fields.
