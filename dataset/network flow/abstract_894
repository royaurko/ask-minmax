This paper discovers patterns of knowledge dissemination among scientific
disciplines. While the transfer of knowledge is largely unobservable, citations
from one discipline to another have been proven to be an effective proxy to
study disciplinary knowledge flow. This study constructs a knowledge flow
network in that a node represents a Journal Citation Report subject category
and a link denotes the citations from one subject category to another. Using
the concept of shortest path, several quantitative measurements are proposed
and applied to a knowledge flow network. Based on an examination of subject
categories in Journal Citation Report, this paper finds that social science
domains tend to be more self-contained and thus it is more difficult for
knowledge from other domains to flow into them; at the same time, knowledge
from science domains, such as biomedicine-, chemistry-, and physics-related
domains can access and be accessed by other domains more easily. This paper
also finds that social science domains are more disunified than science
domains, as three fifths of the knowledge paths from one social science domain
to another need at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate. This
paper contributes to discussions on disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity by
providing empirical analysis.
