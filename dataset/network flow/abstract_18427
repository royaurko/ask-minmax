Most existing work uses dual decomposition and subgradient methods to solve
Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problems in a distributed manner, which
suffer from slow rate of convergence properties. This work develops an
alternative distributed Newton-type fast converging algorithm for solving
network utility maximization problems with self-concordant utility functions.
By using novel matrix splitting techniques, both primal and dual updates for
the Newton step can be computed using iterative schemes in a decentralized
manner with limited information exchange. Similarly, the stepsize can be
obtained via an iterative consensus-based averaging scheme. We show that even
when the Newton direction and the stepsize in our method are computed within
some error (due to finite truncation of the iterative schemes), the resulting
objective function value still converges superlinearly to an explicitly
characterized error neighborhood. Simulation results demonstrate significant
convergence rate improvement of our algorithm relative to the existing
subgradient methods based on dual decomposition.
