We study the transition between the strong and weak disorder regimes in the
scaling properties of the average optimal path $\ell_{\rm opt}$ in a disordered
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) random network and scale-free (SF) network. Each link
$i$ is associated with a weight $\tau_i\equiv\exp(a r_i)$, where $r_i$ is a
random number taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and the
parameter $a$ controls the strength of the disorder. We find that for any
finite $a$, there is a crossover network size $N^*(a)$ at which the transition
occurs. For $N \ll N^*(a)$ the scaling behavior of $\ell_{\rm opt}$ is in the
strong disorder regime, with $\ell_{\rm opt} \sim N^{1/3}$ for ER networks and
for SF networks with $\lambda \ge 4$, and $\ell_{\rm opt} \sim
N^{(\lambda-3)/(\lambda-1)}$ for SF networks with $3 < \lambda < 4$. For $N \gg
N^*(a)$ the scaling behavior is in the weak disorder regime, with $\ell_{\rm
opt}\sim\ln N$ for ER networks and SF networks with $\lambda > 3$. In order to
study the transition we propose a measure which indicates how close or far the
disordered network is from the limit of strong disorder. We propose a scaling
ansatz for this measure and demonstrate its validity. We proceed to derive the
scaling relation between $N^*(a)$ and $a$. We find that $N^*(a)\sim a^3$ for ER
networks and for SF networks with $\lambda\ge 4$, and $N^*(a)\sim
a^{(\lambda-1)/(\lambda-3)}$ for SF networks with $3 < \lambda < 4$.
