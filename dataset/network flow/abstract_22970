In nanocontacts between normal and ferromagnetic metals (N--F) abrupt changes
of the order of 1% are detected in differential resistance, dV/dI(V), versus
bias voltage, V, on achieving of high current densities, ~10^9 A/cm^2. These
features in dV/dI(V) are observed when the electron flow is directed from the
nonmagnetic metal into the ferromagnet and connected with magnetization
excitations in the ferromagnet induced by the current. Applying an external
magnetic field leads to a shift of the observed features to higher biasing
current, confirming the magnetic nature of the effect. Such effects are
observed for the non-ballistic (not spectral) regime of current flow in the
nanocontacts. Thus, the current induced magneto-conductance effects in
multilayered N--F structures (nanopillars) extensively studied in the recent
literature have much more general character and can be stimulated by elastic
electron scattering at single N--F interfaces.
