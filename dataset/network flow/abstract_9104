For a general energy harvesting (EH) communication network, i.e., a network
where the nodes generate their transmit power through EH, we derive the
asymptotically optimal online power allocation solution which optimizes a
general utility function when the number of transmit time slots, $N$, and the
battery capacities of the EH nodes, $B_{\rm max}$, satisfy $N\to\infty$ and
$B_{\rm max}\to\infty$. The considered family of utility functions is general
enough to include the most important performance measures in communication
theory such as the ergodic information rate, outage probability, average bit
error probability, and average signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed power
allocation solution is very simple. Namely, the asymptotically optimal power
allocation for the EH network is identical to the optimal power allocation for
an equivalent non-EH network whose nodes have infinite energy available and
employ the same average transmit power as the corresponding nodes in the EH
network. Furthermore, the maximum average performance of a general EH network,
employing the proposed asymptotically optimal power allocation, converges to
the maximum average performance of an equivalent non-EH network, when
$N\to\infty$ and $B_{\rm max}\to\infty$. Although the proposed solution is
asymptotic in nature, it is applicable to EH systems transmitting in a large
but finite number of time slots and having a battery capacity much larger than
the average harvested power and/or the maximum average transmit power.
