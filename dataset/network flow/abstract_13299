We present the implementation of the Particle Flow Algorithm and the result
of the muon identification developed at the University of Iowa. We use Monte
Carlo samples generated for the benchmark LOI process with the Silicon Detector
design at the International Linear Collider. With the muon identification, an
improved jet energy resolution, good muon efficiency and purity are achieved.
