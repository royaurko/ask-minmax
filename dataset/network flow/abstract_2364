We present first results of three-dimensional (3D-) calculations of turbulent
and degenerate hydrogen-burning on top of a C+O white dwarf of one solar mass.
The simulations are carried out by means of a code which solves Euler's
equation for an arbitrary equation of state together with a nuclear reaction
network and the energy input from nuclear reactions on a Cartesian grid
covering a fraction of the white dwarf's surface and accreted atmosphere. The
flow patterns we obtain are very different from those of earlier 2D simulations
using the same initial conditions and the same numerical resolution. The
possibility of self-enrichment of the accreted hydrogen-rich atmosphere with
carbon and oxygen from the surface layers of the white dwarf during the violent
phase of the burning is investigated, and it is demonstrated that
self-enrichment proceeds too slowly if the accreted gas has near-solar
CNO-abundances at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. As a result, we do
not find a fast nova outburst. This conclusion remains valid if the initial
metallicity of the accreted gas is raised by a factor of five. Therefore we
conclude that fast nova outbursts indeed require huge enrichments of C and O,
as postulated from spherically symmetric models, and that the mechanism which
leads to such enhancements must operate prior to the outburst.
