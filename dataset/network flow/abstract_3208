We give a condition on a piecewise constant roof function and an irrational
rotation by $\alpha$ on the circle to give rise to a special flow having the
mild mixing property. Such flows will also satisfy Ratner's property. As a
consequence we obtain a class of mildly mixing singular flows on the two-torus
that arise from quasi-periodic Hamiltonians flows by velocity changes.
