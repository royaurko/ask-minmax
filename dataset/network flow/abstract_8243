A computer model of the feed-forward neural network with the hidden layer is
developed to reconstruct physical field investigated by the fiber-optic
measuring system. The Gaussian distributions of some physical quantity are
selected as learning patterns. Neural network is learned by error
back-propagation using the conjugate gradient and coordinate descent
minimization of deviation. Learned neural network reconstructs the
two-dimensional scalar physical field with distribution having one or two
Gaussian peaks.
