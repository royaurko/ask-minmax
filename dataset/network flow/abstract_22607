We give a detailed analytical description of the global dynamics of a point
mass moving on a sphere under the action of a logarithmic potential. After
performing a McGehee-type blow-up in order to cope with the singularity of the
potential, we investigate the rest-points of the flow, the invariant (stable
and unstable) manifolds and we give a complete dynamical description of the
motion.
