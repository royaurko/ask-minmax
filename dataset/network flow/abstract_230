Cumulation of shock snd detonation waves was considered. Computations were
carried out by use of second-order central-difference scheme. Cumulation of
waves in cone region with scales of 1 meter was studied. Pictures of flow in
shock and detonation waves during different time moments were obtained as well
as time dependences and maximum pressures for different corner angles.
