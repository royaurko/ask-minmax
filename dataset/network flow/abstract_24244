Given the increasing popularity of algorithms for overlapping clustering, in
particular in social network analysis, quantitative measures are needed to
measure the accuracy of a method. Given a set of true clusters, and the set of
clusters found by an algorithm, these sets of clusters must be compared to see
how similar or different the sets are. A normalized measure is desirable in
many contexts, for example assigning a value of 0 where the two sets are
totally dissimilar, and 1 where they are identical. A measure based on
normalized mutual information, [1], has recently become popular. We demonstrate
unintuitive behaviour of this measure, and show how this can be corrected by
using a more conventional normalization. We compare the results to that of
other measures, such as the Omega index [2].
