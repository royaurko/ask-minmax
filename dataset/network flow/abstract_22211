We present a scheme of self-propelling liquid droplets which closely mimics
the locomotion of some protozoal organisms, so-called squirmers. In contrast to
other schemes proposed earlier, locomotion paths are not self-avoiding, since
the effect of the squirmer on the surrounding medium is weak. Our results
suggest that not only the velocity, but also the mode of operation (i.e., the
spherical harmonics of the flow field) can be controlled by appropriate
variation of parameters.
