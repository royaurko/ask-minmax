The aim of this paper is to highlight and explore a traditional problem,
which is the minimum spanning tree, and finding the shortest-path in network
routing, by using Swarm Intelligence. This work to be considered as an
investigation topic with combination between operations research, discrete
mathematics, and evolutionary computing aiming to solve one of networking
problems.
