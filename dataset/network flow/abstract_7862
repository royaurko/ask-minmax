We analyze the disturbed flow in the supersonic laminar boundary layer when
local heated elements are placed on the surface. It is exhibited that these
flows are described in terms of free interaction theory for specific sizes of
thermal sources. We construct the numerical solution for flat supersonic
problem in the viscous asymptotic layer in which the flow is described by
nonlinear equations for vorticity, temperature with the interaction condition
which provides influence of perturbations to the pressure in the main order.
