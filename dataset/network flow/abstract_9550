The spreading of dangerous malware or faults in inter-dependent networks of
electronics devices has raised deep concern, because from the ICT networks
infections may propagate to other Critical Infrastructures producing the
well-known domino or cascading effect. Researchers are attempting to develop a
high level analysis of malware propagation discarding software details, in
order to generalize to the maximum extent the defensive strategies. For
example, it has been suggested that the maximum eigenvalue of the network
adjacency matrix could act as a threshold for the malware's spreading. This
leads naturally to use the spectral graph theory to identify the most critical
and influential nodes in technological networks. Many well-known graph
parameters have been studied in the past years to accomplish the task. Here we
test our AV11 algorithm showing that outperforms degree, closeness, betweenness
centrality and the dynamical importance
