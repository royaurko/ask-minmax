This paper investigates the issue of connectivity of a wireless adhoc network
in the presence of channel impairments. We derive analytical expressions for
the node isolation probability in an adhoc network in the presence of
Nakagami-m fading with superimposed lognormal shadowing. The node isolation
probability is the probability that a randomly chosen node is not able to
communicate with none of the other nodes in the network. An extensive
investigation into the impact of path loss exponent, lognormal shadowing,
Nakagami fading severity index, node density, and diversity order on the node
isolation probability is conducted. The presented results are beneficial for
the practical design of ad hoc networks.
