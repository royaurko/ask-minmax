We explore the effects of shear viscosity on the hydrodynamic evolution and
final hadron spectra of Cu+Cu collisions at ultrarelativistic collision
energies, using the newly developed (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic code
VISH2+1. Based on the causal Israel-Stewart formalism, this code describes the
transverse evolution of longitudinally boost-invariant systems without
azimuthal symmetry around the beam direction. Shear viscosity is shown to
decelerate the longitudinal and accelerate the transverse hydrodynamic
expansion. For fixed initial conditions, this leads to a longer quark-gluon
plasma (QGP) lifetime, larger radial flow in the final state, and flatter
transverse momentum spectra for the emitted hadrons compared to ideal fluid
dynamic simulations. We find that the elliptic flow coefficient v_2 is
particularly sensitive to shear viscosity: even the lowest value allowed by the
AdS/CFT conjecture, eta/s=1/4pi, suppresses v_2 enough to have significant
consequences for the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider. A comparison between our numerical results and earlier
analytic estimates of viscous effects within a blast-wave model parametrization
of the expanding fireball at freeze-out reveals that the full dynamical theory
leads to much tighter constraints for the specific shear viscosity eta/s,
thereby supporting the notion that the quark-gluon plasma created at RHIC
exhibits almost ``perfect fluidity''.
