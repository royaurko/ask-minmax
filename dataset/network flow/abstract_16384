The security of Android has been recently challenged by the discovery of a
number of vulnerabilities involving different layers of the Android stack. We
argue that such vulnerabilities are largely related to the interplay among
layers composing the Android stack. Thus, we also argue that such interplay has
been underestimated from a security point-of-view and a systematic analysis of
the Android interplay has not been carried out yet. To this aim, in this paper
we provide a simple model of the Android cross-layer interactions based on the
concept of flow, as a basis for analyzing the Android interplay. In particular,
our model allows us to reason about the security implications associated with
the cross-layer interactions in Android, including a recently discovered
vulnerability that allows a malicious application to make Android devices
totally unresponsive. We used the proposed model to carry out an empirical
assessment of some flows within the Android cross-layered architecture. Our
experiments indicate that little control is exercised by the Android Security
Framework (ASF) over cross-layer interactions in Android. In particular, we
observed that the ASF lacks in discriminating the originator of a flow and
sensitive security issues arise between the Android stack and the Linux kernel,
thereby indicating that the attack surface of the Android platform is wider
than expected.
