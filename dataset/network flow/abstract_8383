The Sznajd model is investigated in the directed Erdos--Renyi network with
the clusterization coefficient enhanced to 0.3 by the method of Holme and Kim
(Phys. Rev. E65 (2002) 026107). Within additional triangles, all six links are
present. In this network, some nodes preserve the minority opinion. The time
tau of getting equilibrium is found to follow the log-normal distribution and
it increases linearly with the system size. Its dependence on the initial
opinion distribution is different from the analytical results for fully
connected networks.
