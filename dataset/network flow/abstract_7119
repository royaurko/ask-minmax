This paper proposes an improved cellular automaton traffic flow model based
on the brake light model, which takes into account that the desired time gap of
vehicles is remarkably larger than one second. Although the hypothetical steady
state of vehicles in the deterministic limit corresponds to a unique
relationship between speeds and gaps in the proposed model, the traffic states
of vehicles dynamically span a two-dimensional region in the plane of speed
versus gap, due to the various randomizations. It is shown that the model is
able to well reproduce (i) the free flow, synchronized flow, jam as well as the
transitions among the three phases; (ii) the evolution features of disturbances
and the spatiotemporal patterns in a car-following platoon; (iii) the empirical
time series of traffic speed obtained from NGSIM data. Therefore, we argue that
a model can potentially reproduce the empirical and experimental features of
traffic flow, provided that the traffic states are able to dynamically span a
2D speed-gap region.
