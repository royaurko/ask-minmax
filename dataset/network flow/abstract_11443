Face-to-face interaction networks describe social interactions in human
gatherings, and are the substrate for processes such as epidemic spreading and
gossip propagation. The bursty nature of human behavior characterizes many
aspects of empirical data, such as the distribution of conversation lengths, of
conversations per person, or of inter-conversation times. Despite several
recent attempts, a general theoretical understanding of the global picture
emerging from data is still lacking. Here we present a simple model that
reproduces quantitatively most of the relevant features of empirical
face-to-face interaction networks. The model describes agents which perform a
random walk in a two dimensional space and are characterized by an
attractiveness whose effect is to slow down the motion of people around them.
The proposed framework sheds light on the dynamics of human interactions and
can improve the modeling of dynamical processes taking place on the ensuing
dynamical social networks.
