We investigate a hierarchy of eddy-viscosity terms in POD Galerkin models to
account for a large fraction of unresolved fluctuation energy. These Galerkin
methods are applied to Large Eddy Simulation data for a flow around the
vehicle-like bluff body call Ahmed body. This flow has three challenges for any
reduced-order model: a high Reynolds number, coherent structures with broadband
frequency dynamics, and meta-stable asymmetric base flow states. The Galerkin
models are found to be most accurate with modal eddy viscosities as proposed by
Rempfer & Fasel (1994). Robustness of the model solution with respect to
initial conditions, eddy viscosity values and model order is only achieved for
state-dependent eddy viscosities as proposed by Noack, Morzynski & Tadmor
(2011). Only the POD system with state-dependent modal eddy viscosities can
address all challenges of the flow characteristics. All parameters are
analytically derived from the Navier-Stokes based balance equations with the
available data. We arrive at simple general guidelines for robust and accurate
POD models which can be expected to hold for a large class of turbulent flows.
