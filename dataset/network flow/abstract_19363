Here we study the accretion process around a neutron star, especially for the
cases where shock does form in the accretion disk. In case of accretion flows
around a black hole, close to the horizon matter is supersonic. On the other
hand for the case of neutron stars and white dwarfs, matter must be subsonic
close to the inner boundary. So the nature of the inflowing matter around
neutron stars and white dwarfs are strictly different from that around black
holes in the inner region of the disk. Here we discuss a few phenomena and the
corresponding solutions of hydrodynamic equations of matter in an accretion
disk around a slowly rotating neutron star without magnetic field.
