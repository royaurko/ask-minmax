We suggest a theoretical picture for distributions of plastic deformations
experienced by a sliding Charge Density Wave in the course of the conversion
from the normal current at the contact to the collective one in the bulk.
Several mechanisms of phase slips via creation and proliferation of
dislocations are compared. The results are applied to space resolved X-ray,
multi-contact and optical studies. Numerical simulations are combined with
model independent relations.
