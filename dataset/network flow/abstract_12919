I review anomalous single and multi-fluxon properties of Stacked Josephson
junctions (SJJ's). Throughout the paper I compare analytical, numerical and
experimental results both for intrinsic HTSC and artificial low-$T_c$ SJJ's.

  3.1. Approximate fluxon solution,
  3.2. Decoupling of phase and field,
  3.3. N-dependence and assymptotics,
  3.4. Flux-flow characteristics,
  3.5. Cherenkov radiation.
  4. Multi-Fluxon Configurations:
  4.1. Quasi-equilibrium fluxon modes and submodes,
  4.2. Multiple-valued critical current,
  4.3. Magnetic field dependence of the critical current,
  4.4. Multiple flux-flow sub-branches.
  5. Conclusions.
