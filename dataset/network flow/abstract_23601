In this paper, we present a novel encryption-less algorithm to enhance
security in transmission of data in networks. The algorithm uses an intuitively
simple idea of a 'jigsaw puzzle' to break the transformed data into multiple
parts where these parts form the pieces of the puzzle. Then these parts are
packaged into packets and sent to the receiver. A secure and efficient
mechanism is provided to convey the information that is necessary for obtaining
the original data at the receiver-end from its parts in the packets, that is,
for solving the 'jigsaw puzzle'. The algorithm is designed to provide
information-theoretic (that is, unconditional) security by the use of a
one-time pad like scheme so that no intermediate or unintended node can obtain
the entire data. An authentication code is also used to ensure authenticity of
every packet.
