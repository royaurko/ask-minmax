How does political discourse spread in digital networks? Can we empirically
test if certain conceptual frames of social movements have a correlate on their
online discussion networks? Through an analysis of the Twitter data from the
Occupy movement, this paper describes the formation of political discourse over
time. Building on a previous set of concepts - derived from theoretical
discussions about the movement and its roots - we analyse the data to observe
when those concepts start to appear within the networks, who are those Twitter
users responsible for them, and what are the patterns through which those
concepts spread. Preliminary evidence shows that, although there are some signs
of opportunistic behaviour among activists, most of them are central nodes from
the onset of the network, and shape the discussions across time. These central
activists do not only start the conversations around given frames, but also
sustain over time and become key members of the network. From here, we aim to
provide a thorough account of the "travel" of political discourse, and the
correlate of online conversational networks with theoretical accounts of the
movement.
