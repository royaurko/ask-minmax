We develop cloud-assisted remote sensing techniques for enabling distributed
consensus estimation of unknown parameters in a given geographic area. We first
propose a distributed sensor network virtualization algorithm that searches
for, selects, and coordinates Internet-accessible sensors to perform a sensing
task in a specific region. The algorithm converges in linearithmic time for
large-scale networks, and requires exchanging a number of messages that is at
most linear in the number of sensors. Second, we design an uncoordinated,
distributed algorithm that relies on the selected sensors to estimate a set of
parameters without requiring synchronization among the sensors. Our simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm, when compared to conventional ADMM
(Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), reduces communication overhead
significantly without compromising the estimation error. In addition, the
convergence time, though increases slightly, is still linear as in the case of
conventional ADMM.
