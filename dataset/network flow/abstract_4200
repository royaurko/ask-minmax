This paper is concerned with the scaling of the number of hops in a large
scale wireless ad-hoc network (WANET), a quantity we call network latency. A
large network latency affects all aspects of data communication in a WANET,
including an increase in delay, packet loss, required processing power and
memory. We consider network management and data routing challenges in WANETs
with scalable network latency. On the physical side, reducing network latency
imposes a significantly higher power and bandwidth demand on nodes, as is
reflected in a set of new bounds. On the protocol front, designing distributed
routing protocols that can guarantee the delivery of data packets within
scalable number of hops is a challenging task. To solve this, we introduce
multi-resolution randomized hierarchy (MRRH), a novel power and bandwidth
efficient WANET protocol with scalable network latency. MRRH uses a randomized
algorithm for building and maintaining a random hierarchical network topology,
which together with the proposed routing algorithm can guarantee efficient
delivery of data packets in the wireless network. For a network of size $N$,
MRRH can provide an average latency of only $O(\log^{3} N)$. The power and
bandwidth consumption of MRRH are shown to be \emph{nearly} optimal for the
latency it provides. Therefore, MRRH, is a provably efficient candidate for
truly large scale wireless ad-hoc networking.
