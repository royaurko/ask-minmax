We analyze the effect of the Sun's gravitational field on a flow of cold dark
matter (CDM) through the solar system in the limit where the velocity
dispersion of the flow vanishes. The exact density and velocity distributions
are derived in the case where the Sun is a point mass. The results are extended
to the more realistic case where the Sun has a finite size spherically
symmetric mass distribution. We find that regions of infinite density, called
caustics, appear. One such region is a line caustic on the axis of symmetry,
downstream from the Sun, where the flow trajectories cross. Another is a
cone-shaped caustic surface near the trajectories of maximum scattering angle.
The trajectories forming the conical caustic pass through the Sun's interior
and probe the solar mass distribution, raising the possibility that the solar
mass distribution may some day be measured by a dark matter detector on Earth.
We generalize our results to the case of flows with continuous velocity
distributions, such as that predicted by the isothermal model of the Milky Way
halo.
