In recent years, wireless ad hoc sensor network becomes popular both in civil
and military jobs. However, security is one of the significant challenges for
sensor network because of their deployment in open and unprotected environment.
As cryptographic mechanism is not enough to protect sensor network from
external attacks, intrusion detection system needs to be introduced. Though
intrusion prevention mechanism is one of the major and efficient methods
against attacks, but there might be some attacks for which prevention method is
not known. Besides preventing the system from some known attacks, intrusion
detection system gather necessary information related to attack technique and
help in the development of intrusion prevention system. In addition to
reviewing the present attacks available in wireless sensor network this paper
examines the current efforts to intrusion detection system against wireless
sensor network. In this paper we propose a hierarchical architectural design
based intrusion detection system that fits the current demands and restrictions
of wireless ad hoc sensor network. In this proposed intrusion detection system
architecture we followed clustering mechanism to build a four level
hierarchical network which enhances network scalability to large geographical
area and use both anomaly and misuse detection techniques for intrusion
detection. We introduce policy based detection mechanism as well as intrusion
response together with GSM cell concept for intrusion detection architecture.
