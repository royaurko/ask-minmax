Network capacity region is an important character of mobile ad hoc networks.
Using cell-partitioned model, an expression of upper bound of delay-tolerant
hybrid mobile ad hoc network is deduced regardless of coverage of base
stations, types of mobile process, scheduling and routing algorithms. The
limitation of the upper bound is derived, Analysis of the limitation of upper
bound is carried out when the steady-state follows even-distribution law. The
relationship among limitation of capacity, the node density and coverage of
base station is analyzed.
