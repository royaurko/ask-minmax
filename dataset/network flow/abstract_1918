The ability to accurately forecast and control inpatient census, and thereby
workloads, is a critical and longstanding problem in hospital management. The
majority of current literature focuses on optimal scheduling of elective
inpatients, but largely ignores the process of accurate estimation of the
trajectory of patients throughout the treatment and recovery process. The
result is that current elective scheduling models are optimizing based on
inaccurate input data. In this paper, we develop a Clustering and Scheduling
Integrated (CSI) approach to capture patient flows through a network of
hospital services. CSI functions by clustering patients into groups based on
similarity of trajectory using a Semi-Markov model-based clustering scheme, as
opposed to clustering by admit type or condition as in previous literature. The
methodology is validated by simulation and then applied to real patient data
from a partner hospital where we see it outperforms current methods. Further,
we demonstrate that optimization methods achieve significantly better results
on key hospital performance measure under CSI, compared with traditional
estimation approaches, increasing elective admissions by 97% and utilization by
22% compared to 30% and 8% using traditional estimation techniques. From a
theoretical standpoint, the SMM-clustering is a novel approach applicable to
any temporal-spatial stochastic data that is prevalent in many industries.
