Recently two search algorithms, A* and breadth-first branch and bound
(BFBnB), were developed based on a simple admissible heuristic for learning
Bayesian network structures that optimize a scoring function. The heuristic
represents a relaxation of the learning problem such that each variable chooses
optimal parents independently. As a result, the heuristic may contain many
directed cycles and result in a loose bound. This paper introduces an improved
admissible heuristic that tries to avoid directed cycles within small groups of
variables. A sparse representation is also introduced to store only the unique
optimal parent choices. Empirical results show that the new techniques
significantly improved the efficiency and scalability of A* and BFBnB on most
of datasets tested in this paper.
