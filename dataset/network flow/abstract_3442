We present a study of the application of a variant of a recently introduced
heuristic algorithm for the optimization of transport routes on complex
networks to the problem of finding the optimal routes of communication between
nodes on wireless networks. Our algorithm iteratively balances network traffic
by minimizing the maximum node betweenness on the network. The variant we
consider specifically accounts for the broadcast restrictions imposed by
wireless communication by using a different betweenness measure. We compare the
performance of our algorithm to two other known algorithms and find that our
algorithm achieves the highest transport capacity both for minimum node degree
geometric networks, which are directed geometric networks that model wireless
communication networks, and for configuration model networks that are
uncorrelated scale-free networks.
