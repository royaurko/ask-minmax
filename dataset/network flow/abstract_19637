Let $(\mathbf{M}^{3},J,\theta_{0})$ be a closed pseudohermitian 3-manifold.
Suppose the associated torsion vanishes and the associated $Q$-curvature has no
kernel part with respect to the associated Paneitz operator. On such a
background pseudohermitian 3-manifold, we study the change of the contact form
according to a certain version of normalized $Q$-curvature flow. This is a
fourth order evolution equation. We prove that the solution exists for all time
and converges smoothly to a contact form of zero $Q$ -curvature. We also
consider other background conditions and obtain a priori bounds up to high
orders for the solution.
