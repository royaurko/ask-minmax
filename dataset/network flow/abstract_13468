We present phi-meson transverse momentum distribution as well as its elliptic
flow (v_{2}) measurements in Au + Au collisions at center-of-mass energy per
nucleon pair \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7, 11.5 and 39 GeV with the data taken from STAR
experiment at RHIC in the year 2010. We discuss the energy dependence of
phi-meson elliptic flow (v_{2}) and central-to-peripheral nuclear modification
factors (R_{CP}). The v_{2} of phi-mesons are compared to those from other
hadron species. The implications on partonic-hadronic phase transition are
discussed.
