In this paper, we define $C^1$-robust transitivity for actions of $\RR^2$ on
closed connected orientable manifolds. We prove that if the ambient manifold is
three dimensional and the dense orbit of a robustly transitive action is not
planar, then it is "degenerate" and the action is defined by an Anosov flow.
