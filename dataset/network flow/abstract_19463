We present a new numerical code, PLUTO, for the solution of hypersonic flows
in 1, 2 and 3 spatial dimensions and different systems of coordinates. The code
provides a multi-physics, multi-algorithm modular environment particularly
oriented towards the treatment of astrophysical flows in presence of
discontinuities. Different hydrodynamic modules and algorithms may be
independently selected to properly describe Newtonian, relativistic, MHD or
relativistic MHD fluids. The modular structure exploits a general framework for
integrating a system of conservation laws, built on modern Godunov-type
shock-capturing schemes. Although a plethora of numerical methods has been
successfully developed over the past two decades, the vast majority shares a
common discretization recipe, involving three general steps: a piecewise
polynomial reconstruction followed by the solution of Riemann problems at zone
interfaces and a final evolution stage. We have checked and validated the code
against several benchmarks available in literature. Test problems in 1, 2 and 3
dimensions are discussed.
