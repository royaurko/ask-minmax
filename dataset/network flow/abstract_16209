We discuss the role of elastic stress in the statistical properties of
elastic turbulence, realized by the flow of a polymer solution between two
disks. The dynamics of the elastic stress are analogous to those of a small
scale fast dynamo in magnetohydrodynamics, and to those of the turbulent
advection of a passive scalar in the Batchelor regime. Both systems are
theoretically studied in literature, and this analogy is exploited to explain
the statistical properties, the flow structure, and the scaling observed
experimentally. Several features of elastic turbulence are confirmed
experimentally and presented in this paper: (i) saturation of the rms of the
vorticity and of velocity gradients in the bulk, leading to the saturation of
the elastic stress; (ii) large rms of the velocity gradients in the boundary
layer, linearly growth with Wi; (iii) skewed PDFs of the injected power, with
exponential tails, which indicate intermittency; PDF of the acceleration
exhibit well-pronounced exponential tails too; (iv) a new length scale, i.e the
thickness of the boundary layer, as measured from the profile of the rms of the
velocity gradient, is found to be relevant and much smaller than the vessel
size; (v) the scaling of the structure functions of the vorticity, velocity
gradients, and injected power is found to be the same as that of a passive
scalar advected by an elastic turbulent velocity field.
