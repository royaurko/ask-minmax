The evolution of the interface between two ideal dielectric liquids in a
strong vertical electric field is studied. It is found that a particular flow
regime, for which the velocity potential and the electric field potential are
linearly dependent functions, is possible if the ratio of the permittivities of
liquids is inversely proportional to the ratio of their densities. The
corresponding reduced equations for interface motion are derived. In the limit
of small density ratio, these equations coincide with the well-known equations
describing the Laplacian growth.
