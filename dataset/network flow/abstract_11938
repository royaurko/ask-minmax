Energy disaggregation estimates appliance-by-appliance electricity
consumption from a single meter that measures the whole home's electricity
demand. Recently, deep neural networks have driven remarkable improvements in
classification performance in neighbouring machine learning fields such as
image classification and automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we adapt
three deep neural network architectures to energy disaggregation: 1) a form of
recurrent neural network called `long short-term memory' (LSTM); 2) denoising
autoencoders; and 3) a network which regresses the start time, end time and
average power demand of each appliance activation. We test the performance of
these algorithms on real aggregate power data from five appliances against
seven metrics. Tests are performed against houses seen during training and
houses not seen during training. We find that all three neural nets achieve
better F1 scores (averaged over all five appliances) than either combinatorial
optimisation or factorial hidden Markov models.
