We study the statistical properties of the network constructed from the
energy dissipation rate time series in the three dimensional developed
turbulence using the visibility algorithm. The degree distribution is found to
have a power-law tail with the tail exponent $\alpha=3.0$. The exponential
relationship between the number of the boxes $N_B$ and the box size $l_B$ in
the edge-covering box-counting method illustrates that the network is not
self-similar, which is also confirmed by the hub-hub attraction according to
the visibility algorithm. In addition, it is found that the skeleton of the
visibility network exhibits excellent allometric scaling with the scaling
exponent $\eta=1.163\pm0.005$.
