Robust network design refers to a class of optimization problems that occur
when designing networks to efficiently handle variable demands. The notion of
"hierarchical hubbing" was introduced (in the narrow context of a specific
robust network design question), by Olver and Shepherd [2010]. Hierarchical
hubbing allows for routings with a multiplicity of "hubs" which are connected
to the terminals and to each other in a treelike fashion. Recently, Fr\'echette
et al. [2013] explored this notion much more generally, focusing on its
applicability to an extension of the well-studied hose model that allows for
upper bounds on individual point-to-point demands. In this paper, we consider
hierarchical hubbing in the context of a previously studied (and extremely
natural) generalization of the hose model, and prove that the optimal
hierarchical hubbing solution can be found efficiently. This result is relevant
to a recently proposed generalization of the "VPN Conjecture".
