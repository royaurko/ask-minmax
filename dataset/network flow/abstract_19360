The nature of the `inner engine' that accelerate and collimate the
relativistic flow at the cores of GRBs is the most interesting current puzzle
concerning GRBs. Numerical simulations have shown that the internal shocks'
light curve reflects the activity of this inner engine. Using a simple analytic
toy model we clarify the relations between the observed $ \gamma $-rays light
curve and the inner engine's activity and the dependence of the light curves on
the inner engine's parameters. This simple model also explains the observed
similarity between the observed distributions of pulses widths and the
intervals between pulses and the correlation between the width of a pulse and
the length of the preceding interval. Our analysis suggests that the
variability in the wind's Lorentz factors arises due to a modulation of the
mass injected into a constant energy flow.
