Domain wall networks are studied in N=2 supersymmetric U(N_C) gauge theory
with N_F (>N_C) flavors. We find a systematic method to construct domain wall
networks in terms of moduli matrices. Normalizable moduli parameters of the
network are found to be sizes and phases of the loop. We obtain moduli space
metric which specifies the effective Lagrangian on the domain wall networks. It
is used to study dynamics of domain wall networks with the moduli
approximation.
