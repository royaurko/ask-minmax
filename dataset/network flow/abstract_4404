Cells sense the geometry and stiffness of their adhesive environment by
active contractility. For strong adhesion to flat substrates, two-dimensional
contractile network models can be used to understand how force is distributed
throughout the cell. Here we compare the shape and force distribution for
different variants of such network models. In contrast to Hookean networks,
cable networks reflect the asymmetric response of biopolymers to tension versus
compression. For passive networks, contractility is modeled by a reduced
resting length of the mechanical links. In actively contracting networks, a
constant force couple is introduced into each link in order to model
contraction by molecular motors. If combined with fixed adhesion sites, all
network models lead to invaginated cell shapes, but only actively contracting
cable networks lead to the circular arc morphology typical for strongly
adhering cells. In this case, shape and force distribution are determined by
local rather than global determinants and thus are suited to endow the cell
with a robust sense of its environment. We also discuss non-linear and adaptive
linker mechanics as well as the relation to tissue shape.
