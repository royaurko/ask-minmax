Many practical applications exploit an external local magnetic field --
magnetic obstacle -- as an essential part of their constructions. Recently, it
has been demonstrated that the flow of an electrically conducting fluid
influenced by an external field can show several kinds of recirculation. The
present paper reports a 3D numerical study whose some results are compared with
an experiment about such a flow in a rectangular duct.
