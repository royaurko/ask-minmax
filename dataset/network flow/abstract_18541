E-commerce in today's conditions has the highest dependence on network
infrastructure of banking. However, when the possibility of communicating with
the Banking network is not provided, business activities will suffer. This
paper proposes a new approach of digital wallet based on mobile devices without
the need to exchange physical money or communicate with banking network. A
digital wallet is a software component that allows a user to make an electronic
payment in cash (such as a credit card or a digital coin), and hides the
low-level details of executing the payment protocol that is used to make the
payment. The main features of proposed architecture are secure awareness, fault
tolerance, and infrastructure-less protocol.
