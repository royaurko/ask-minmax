Plasma flow is damped in stellarators because they are not intrinsically
ambipolar, unlike tokamaks, in which the flux-surface averaged radial electric
current vanishes for any value of the radial electric field. Only
quasisymmetric stellarators are intrinsically ambipolar, but exact
quasisymmetry is impossible to achieve in non-axisymmetric toroidal
configurations. By calculating the violation of intrinsic ambipolarity due to
deviations from quasisymmetry, one can derive criteria to assess when a
stellarator can be considered quasisymmetric in practice, i.e. when the flow
damping is weak enough. Let us denote by $\alpha$ a small parameter that
controls the size of a perturbation to an exactly quasisymmetric magnetic
field. Recently, it has been shown that if the gradient of the perturbation is
sufficiently small, the flux-surface averaged radial electric current scales as
$\alpha^2$ for any value of the collisionality. It was also argued that when
the gradient of the perturbation is large, the quadratic scaling is replaced by
a more unfavorable one. In this paper, perturbations with large gradients are
rigorously treated. In particular, it is proven that for low collisionality a
perturbation with large gradient yields, at best, an $O(|\alpha|)$ deviation
from quasisymmetry. Heuristic estimations in the literature incorrectly
predicted an $O(|\alpha|^{3/2})$ deviation.
