We study the statistics of the linear flow in a punctured honeycomb lattice,
or equivalently the free motion of a particle on a regular hexagonal billiard
table with holes of equal size at the corners and obeying the customary
reflection rules. In the small-scatterer limit we prove the existence of the
limiting distribution of the free path length with randomly chosen origin of
the trajectory and explicitly compute it.
