We consider the problem of designing a fair scheduling algorithm for
discrete-time constrained queuing networks. Each queue has dedicated exogenous
packet arrivals. There are constraints on which queues can be served
simultaneously. This model effectively describes important special instances
like network switches, interference in wireless networks, bandwidth sharing for
congestion control and traffic scheduling in road roundabouts. Fair scheduling
is required because it provides isolation to different traffic flows; isolation
makes the system more robust and enables providing quality of service. Existing
work on fairness for constrained networks concentrates on flow based fairness.
As a main result, we describe a notion of packet based fairness by establishing
an analogy with the ranked election problem: packets are voters, schedules are
candidates and each packet ranks the schedules based on its priorities. We then
obtain a scheduling algorithm that achieves the described notion of fairness by
drawing upon the seminal work of Goodman and Markowitz (1952). This yields the
familiar Maximum Weight (MW) style algorithm. As another important result we
prove that algorithm obtained is throughput optimal. There is no reason a
priori why this should be true, and the proof requires non-traditional methods.
