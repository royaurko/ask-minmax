Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are very popular tools to design and evolve
artificial neural networks (ANNs), especially to train them. These methods have
advantages over the conventional backpropagation (BP) method because of their
low computational requirement when searching in a large solution space. In this
paper, we employ Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO), a newly developed global
optimization method, to replace BP in training neural networks. CRO is a
population-based metaheuristics mimicking the transition of molecules and their
interactions in a chemical reaction. Simulation results show that CRO
outperforms many EA strategies commonly used to train neural networks.
