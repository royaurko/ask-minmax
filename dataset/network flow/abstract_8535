We consider the problem of sensor localization in a wireless network in a
multipath environment, where time and angle of arrival information are
available at each sensor. We propose a distributed algorithm based on belief
propagation, which allows sensors to cooperatively self-localize with respect
to one single anchor in a multihop network. The algorithm has low overhead and
is scalable. Simulations show that although the network is loopy, the proposed
algorithm converges, and achieves good localization accuracy.
