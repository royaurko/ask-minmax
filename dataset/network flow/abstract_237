I review the current status of Fermi acceleration theory at relativistic
shocks. I first discuss the relativistic shock jump conditions, then describe
the non-relativistic Fermi mechanism and the differences introduced by
relativistic flows. I present numerical calculations of the accelerated
particle spectrum, and examine the maximum energy attainable by this process. I
briefly consider the minimum energy for Fermi acceleration, and a possible
electron pre-acceleration mechanism.
