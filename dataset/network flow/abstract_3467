Network motifs are small building blocks of complex networks. Statistically
significant motifs often perform network-specific functions. However, the
precise nature of the connection between motifs and the global structure and
function of networks remains elusive. Here we show that the global structure of
some real networks is statistically determined by the probability of
connections within motifs of size at most 3, once this probability accounts for
node degrees. The connectivity profiles of node triples in these networks
capture all their local and global properties. This finding impacts methods
relying on motif statistical significance, and enriches our understanding of
the elementary forces that shape the structure of complex networks.
