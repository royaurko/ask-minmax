Viscous hydrodynamics is commonly used to model the evolution of the matter
created in an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision. It provides a good
description of transverse momentum spectra and anisotropic flow. These
observables, however, cannot be consistently derived using viscous
hydrodynamics alone, because they depend on the microscopic interactions at
freeze-out. We derive the ideal hydrodynamic limit and the first-order viscous
correction to anisotropic flow ($v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$) and momentum spectrum
using a transport calculation. The linear response coefficient to the initial
anisotropy, $v_n(p_T)/\varepsilon_n$, depends little on $n$ in the ideal
hydrodynamic limit. The viscous correction to the spectrum depends not only on
the differential cross section, but also on the initial momentum distribution.
This dependence is not captured by standard second-order viscous hydrodynamics.
The viscous correction to anisotropic flow increases with $p_T$, but this
increase is slower than usually assumed in viscous hydrodynamic calculations.
In particular, it is too slow to explain the observed maximum of $v_n$ at
$p_T\sim 3$ GeV/c.
