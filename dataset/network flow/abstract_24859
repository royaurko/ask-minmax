Existing methods to study intra-protein communication is computationally
intensive as it involves generating and analyzing Molecular Dynamics simulation
of the native dynamics for a protein. While such detailed studies are
essential, it may also be useful to have a quicker, albeit course-grained,
grasp of intra-protein communication from the PDB crystal structure so that
intra-protein communication studies can be done on a large scale in a
high-throughput manner. Towards this end, we examined paths constructed via a
greedy local search algorithm called EDS to evaluate how well EDS paths
represent intra-protein pathways. We find that EDS paths make more plausible
intra-protein communication pathways than the popular shortest or BFS paths.
EDS paths are more stable and have higher communication propensity. We were
also able to retrieve independent dynamic segments and recover hub residues
identified for the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (1T45) protein with information
from EDS paths.
