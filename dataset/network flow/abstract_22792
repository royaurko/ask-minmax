Here we present a Brownian ratchet based on plasmonic interactions. By
periodically turning on and off a laser beam that illuminates a periodic array
of plasmonic nanostructures with broken spatial symmetry, the random thermal
motion of a subwavelength dielectric bead is rectified into one direction. By
means of the Molecular Dynamics technique we show a statistical directed drift
in particle flow.
