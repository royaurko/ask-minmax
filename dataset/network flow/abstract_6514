We study the extreme events taking place on complex networks. The transport
on networks is modelled using random walks and we compute the probability for
the occurance and recurrence of extreme events on the network. We show that the
nodes with smaller number of links are more prone to extreme events than the
ones with larger number of links. We obtain analytical estimates and verify
them with numerical simulations. They are shown to be robust even when random
walkers follow shortest path on the network. The results suggest a revision of
design principles and can be used as an input for designing the nodes of a
network so as to smoothly handle an extreme event.
