Unlike many complex networks studied in the literature, social networks
rarely exhibit regular unanimous behavior, or consensus of opinions. This
requires a development of mathematical models that are sufficiently simple to
be examined and capture, at the same time, the complex behavior of real social
groups, where opinions and the actions related to them may form clusters of
different sizes. One such model, proposed in [1], deals with scalar opinions
and extends the idea in [2] of iterative pooling to take into account the
actors' prejudices, caused by some exogenous factors and leading to
disagreement in the final opinions. In this paper, we offer a novel
multidimensional extension, which represents the dynamics of agents' opinions
on several topics, and those topic-specific opinions are interdependent. As
soon as opinions on several topics are affected simultaneously by the same
influence networks, they automatically become related. However, we introduce an
additional relation, interdependent topics, by which the opinions being formed
on one topic are functions of the opinions held on other topics. We examine
rigorous convergence properties of the proposed model and find explicitly the
steady opinions of the agents. Although our model assumes synchronous
communication among the agents, we show that the same final opinion may be
reached "on average" via asynchronous gossip-based protocols.
