This paper establishes a blowup criterion for the three-dimensional viscous,
compressible, and heat conducting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows.
  It is essentially shown that for the Cauchy problem and the
initial-boundary-value one of the three-dimensional compressible MHD flows with
initial density allowed to vanish, the strong or smooth solution exists
globally if the density is bounded from above and the velocity satisfies the
Serrin's condition. Therefore, if the Serrin norm of the velocity remains
bounded, it is not possible for other kinds of singularities (such as vacuum
states vanish or vacuum appears in the non-vacuum region or even milder
singularities) to form before the density becomes unbounded. This criterion is
analogous to the well-known Serrin's blowup criterion for the three-dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, in particular, it is independent of the
temperature and magnetic field and is just the same as that of the barotropic
compressible Navier-Stokes equations.
  As a direct application, it is shown that the same result also holds for the
strong or smooth solutions to the three-dimensional full compressible
Navier-Stokes system describing the motion of a viscous, compressible, and heat
conducting fluid.
