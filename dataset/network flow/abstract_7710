We study the sensitivity of transverse flow towards the different density
dependence of symmetry energy in Fermi energy region. Our results show that
transverse flow shows sensitivity to different density dependence of symmetry
energy. The mechanism for sensitivity towards different density dependence of
symmetry energy is also discussed.
