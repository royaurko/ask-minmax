In this paper we study the Navier-Stokes equations with a Navier-type
boundary condition that has been proposed as an alternative to common near wall
models. The boundary condition we study, involving a linear relation between
the tangential part of the velocity and the tangential part of the Cauchy
stress-vector, is related to the vorticity seeding model introduced in the
computational approach to turbulent flows. The presence of a point-wise non
vanishing normal flux may be considered as a tool to avoid the use of
phenomenological near wall models, in the boundary layer region. Furthermore,
the analysis of the problem is suggested by recent advances in the study of
Large Eddy Simulation.
  In the two dimensional case we prove existence and uniqueness of weak
solutions, by using rather elementary tools, hopefully understandable also by
applied people working on turbulent flows. The asymptotic behaviour of the
solution, with respect to the averaging radius $\delta,$ is also studied. In
particular, we prove convergence of the solutions toward the corresponding
solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with the usual no-slip boundary
conditions, as the small parameter $\delta$ goes to zero.
