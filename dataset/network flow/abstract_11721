Boolean variables are such that they take only values on $ \mathbb{Z}_2 \cong
\left\{0, 1 \right\} $. \textit{NK}-Kauffman networks are dynamical
deterministic systems of $ N $ Boolean functions that depend only on $ K \leq N
$ Boolean variables. They were proposed by Kauffman as a first step to
understand cellular behaviour [Kauffman, S.A.; {\rm The Large Scale Structure
and Dynamics of Gene Control Circuits: An Ensemble Approach}. {\it J. Theoret.
Biol.} {\bf 44} (1974) 167.] with great success. Among the problems that still
have been not well understood in Kauffman networks, is the mechanism that
regulates the phase transition of the system from an ordered phase; where small
changes of the initial state decay, to a chaotic, where they grow
exponentially. We show, that this mechanism is regulated through \textsf{the
irreducible decomposition} of Boolean functions proposed in [ Zertuche, F. {\rm
On the robustness of NK-Kauffman networks against changes in their connections
and Boolean functions}, {\it J. Math. Phys.} {\bf 50} (2009) 043513]. This is
in contrast to previous knowledge that attributed it to \textsf{canalization}.
We also review other statistical properties of Kauffman networks that have been
shown that \textsf{Boolean irreducibility} explains.
