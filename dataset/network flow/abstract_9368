This paper is a quantitative analysis on packet switched network with a view
to generalize load balancing and determination of appropriate routing algorithm
in multipath environment. Several routing algorithms have been introduced for
routing of packets from source to destination. Some of them route packets
accurately with increased workload and some of them drastically cut down the
workload. A few of them can find out a minimum workload deviation for both UDP
and TCP packets. We simulated these approaches in a well defined simulator,
analyzed and evaluated their performance. After expanding our analysis with
varying weights and number of paths we found that the recently proposed routing
algorithm Mixed Weighted Fair Routing (MWFR) outperforms the existing routing
algorithms by reducing the routing and network overhead and saving the scarce
bandwidth as well as CPU consumption for packet switching networks.
