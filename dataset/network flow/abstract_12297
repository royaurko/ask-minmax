To ensure seamless communication in wireless multi-hop networks, certain
classes of routing protocols are defined. This vary paper, is based upon
proactive routing protocols for Wireless multihop networks. Initially, we
discuss Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV), Fish-eye State Routing
(FSR) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR), precisely followed by
mathematical frame work of control overhead regarding proactive natured routing
protocols. Finally, extensive simulations are done using NS 2 respecting above
mentioned routing protocols covering mobility and scalability issues. Said
protocols are compared under mobile and dense environments to conclude our
performance analysis.
