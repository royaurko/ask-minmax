In this article, we introduce a mass-decreasing flow for asymptotically flat
three-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature. This flow is defined by
iterating a suitable Ricci flow with surgery and conformal rescalings and has a
number of nice properties. In particular, wormholes pinch off and nontrivial
spherical space forms bubble off in finite time. Moreover, a noncompact variant
of the Perelman-energy is monotone along the flow. Assuming a certain
inequality between the mass and this Perelman-energy a priori, we can prove
that the flow squeezes out all the initial mass.
