The number of publicly available Web services (WS) is continuously growing,
and in parallel, we are witnessing a rapid development in semantic-related web
technologies. The intersection of the semantic web and WS allows the
development of semantic WS. In this work, we adopt a complex network
perspective to perform a comparative analysis of the syntactic and semantic
approaches used to describe WS. From a collection of publicly available WS
descriptions, we extract syntactic and semantic WS interaction networks. We
take advantage of tools from the complex network field to analyze them and
determine their properties. We show that WS interaction networks exhibit some
of the typical characteristics observed in real-world networks, such as short
average distance between nodes and community structure. By comparing syntactic
and semantic networks through their properties, we show the introduction of
semantics in WS descriptions should improve the composition process.
