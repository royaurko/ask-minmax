There has been intense interest in filtration and separation properties of
graphene-based materials that can have well-defined nanometer pores and exhibit
low frictional water flow inside them. Here we investigate molecular permeation
through graphene oxide laminates. They are vacuum-tight in the dry state but,
if immersed in water, act as molecular sieves blocking all solutes with
hydrated radii larger than 4.5A. Smaller ions permeate through the membranes
with little impedance, many orders of magnitude faster than the diffusion
mechanism can account for. We explain this behavior by a network of
nanocapillaries that open up in the hydrated state and accept only species that
fit in. The ultrafast separation of small salts is attributed to an 'ion
sponge' effect that results in highly concentrated salt solutions inside
graphene capillaries.
