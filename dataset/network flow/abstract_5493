Secured communication in ad hoc wireless networks is primarily important,
because the communication signals are openly available as they propagate
through air and are more susceptible to attacks ranging from passive
eavesdropping to active interfering. The lack of any central coordination and
shared wireless medium makes them more vulnerable to attacks than wired
networks. Nodes act both as hosts and routers and are interconnected by Multi-
hop communication path for forwarding and receiving packets to/from other
nodes. The objective of this paper is to propose a key exchange and encryption
mechanism that aims to use the MAC address as an additional parameter as the
message specific key[to encrypt]and forward data among the nodes. The nodes are
organized in spanning tree fashion, as they avoid forming cycles and exchange
of key occurs only with authenticated neighbors in ad hoc networks, where nodes
join or leave the network dynamically.
