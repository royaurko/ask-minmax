We consider soft gluon evolution in the colour flow basis. We give explicit
expressions for the colour structure of the (one-loop) soft anomalous dimension
matrix for an arbitrary number of partons, and show how the successive
exponentiation of classes of large-N contributions can be achieved to provide a
systematic expansion of the evolution in terms of colour supressed
contributions.
