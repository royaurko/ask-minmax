This paper begins to explore the determinants of the topological properties
of the international - trade network (ITN). We fit bilateral-trade flows using
a standard gravity equation to build a "residual" ITN where trade-link weights
are depurated from geographical distance, size, border effects, trade
agreements, and so on. We then compare the topological properties of the
original and residual ITNs. We find that the residual ITN displays, unlike the
original one, marked signatures of a complex system, and is characterized by a
very different topological architecture. Whereas the original ITN is
geographically clustered and organized around a few large-sized hubs, the
residual ITN displays many small-sized but trade-oriented countries that,
independently of their geographical position, either play the role of local
hubs or attract large and rich countries in relatively complex
trade-interaction patterns.
