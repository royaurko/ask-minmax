We generalize the gradient flow equation for field theories with nonlinearly
realized symmetry. Applying the formalism to super Yang-Mills theory, we
construct a supersymmetric extension of the gradient flow equation. It can be
shown that the super gauge symmetry is preserved in the gradient flow.
Furthermore, choosing an appropriate modification term to damp the gauge
degrees of freedom, we obtain a gradient flow equation which is closed within
the Wess-Zumino gauge.
