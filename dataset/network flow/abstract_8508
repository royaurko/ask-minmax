This paper describes an algorithm for discovery of convoys in database with
proximity log. Traditionally, discovery of convoys covers trajectories
databases. This paper presents a model for context-aware browsing application
based on the network proximity. Our model uses mobile phone as proximity sensor
and proximity data replaces location information. As per our concept, any
existing or even especially created wireless network node could be used as
presence sensor that can discover access to some dynamic or user-generated
content. Content revelation in this model depends on rules based on the
proximity. Discovery of convoys in historical user's logs provides a new class
of rules for delivering local content to mobile subscribers.
