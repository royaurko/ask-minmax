Understanding brain connectivity has become one of the most important issues
in neuroscience. But connectivity data can reflect either the functional
relationships of the brain activities or the anatomical properties between
brain areas. Although one should expect a clear relationship between both
representations it is not straightforward. Here we present a formalism that
allows for the comparison of structural (DTI) and functional (fMRI) networks by
embedding both in a common metric space. In this metric space one can then find
for which regions the two networks are significantly different. Our methodology
can be used not only to compare multimodal networks but also to extract
statistically significant aggregated networks of a set of subjects. Actually,
we use this procedure to aggregate a set of functional (fMRI) networks from
different subjects in an aggregated network that is compared with the
anatomical (DTI) connectivity. The comparison of the aggregated network reveals
some features that are not observed when the comparison is done with the
classical averaged network.
