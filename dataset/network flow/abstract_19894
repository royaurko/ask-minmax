When a binary fluid demixes under a slow temperature ramp, nucleation,
coarsening and sedimentation of droplets lead to an oscillatory evolution of
the phase separating system. The advection of the sedimenting droplets is found
to be chaotic. The flow is driven by density differences between the two
phases. Here, we show how image processing can be combined with particle
tracking to resolve droplet size and velocity simultaneously. Droplets are used
as tracer particles, and the sedimentation velocity is determined. Taking these
effects into account, droplets with radii in the range of 4 -- 40 micrometers
are detected and tracked. Based on this data we resolve the oscillations in the
droplet size distribution which are coupled to the convective flow.
