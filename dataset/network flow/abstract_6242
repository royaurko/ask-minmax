The World-Wide Web (WWW) is characterized by a strong community structure in
which communities of webpages (e.g. those sharing a common keyword) are densely
interconnected by hyperlinks. We study how such network architecture affects
the average Google ranking of individual webpages in the comunity. It is shown
that the Google rank of community webpages could either increase or decrease
with the density of inter-community links depending on the exact balance
between average in- and out-degrees in the community. The magnitude of this
effect is described by a simple analytical formula and subsequently verified by
numerical simulations of random scale-free networks with a desired level of the
community structure. A new algorithm allowing for generation of such networks
is proposed and studied. The number of inter-community links in such networks
is controlled by a temperature-like parameter with the strongest community
structure realized in "low-temperature" networks.
