We study Compton upscattering of low-frequency photons in a converging flow
of thermal plasma. The photons escape diffusively and electron scattering is
the dominant source of opacity. We solve numerically and approximately
analytically the equation of radiative transfer in the case of spherical,
steady state accretion into black holes. Unlike previous work on this subject,
we consider the inner boundary at a finite radius and this has a significant
effect on the emergent spectrum. It is shown that the bulk motion of the
converging flow is more efficient in upscattering photons than thermal
Comptonization, provided that the electron temperature in the flow is of order
a few keV or less. In this case, the spectrum observed at infinity consists of
a soft component coming from those input photons which escaped after a few
scatterings without any significant energy change and of a power law which
extends to high energies and is made of those photons which underwent
significant upscattering. The luminosity of the power law is relatively small
compared to that of the soft component. The more reflective the inner boundary
is, the flatter the power-law spectrum becomes. The spectral energy power-law
index for black-hole accretion is always higher than 1 and it is approximately
1.5 for high accretion rates. This result tempts us to say that bulk motion
Comptonization might be the mechanism behind the power-law spectra seen in
black-hole X-ray sources.
