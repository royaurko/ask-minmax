Receiver-initiated medium access control protocols for wireless sensor
networks are theoretically able to adapt to changing network conditions in a
distributed manner. However, existing algorithms rely on fixed beacon rates at
each receiver. We present a new received initiated MAC protocol that adapts the
beacon rate at each receiver to its actual traffic load. Our proposal uses a
computationally inexpensive formula for calculating the optimum beacon rate
that minimizes network energy consumption and, so, it can be easily adopted by
receivers. Simulation results show that our proposal reduces collisions and
diminishes delivery time maintaining a low duty cycle.
