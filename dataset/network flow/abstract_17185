We show that the maximum entropy hypothesis can successfully explain the
distribution of stresses on compact clusters of particles within disordered
mechanically stable packings of soft, isotropically stressed, frictionless
disks above the jamming transition. We show that, in our two dimensional case,
it becomes necessary to consider not only the stress but also the
Maxwell-Cremona force-tile area, as a constraining variable that determines the
stress distribution. The importance of the force-tile area had been suggested
by earlier computations on an idealized force-network ensemble.
