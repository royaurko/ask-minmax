Mobile operators commonly use macro cells with traditional wide beam antennas
for wider coverage in the cell, but future capacity demands cannot be achieved
by using them only. It is required to achieve maximum practical capacity from
macro cells by employing higher order sectorization and by utilizing all
possible antenna solutions including smart antennas. This paper presents
enhanced tessellation for 6-sector sites and proposes novel layout for
12-sector sites. The main target of this paper is to compare the performance of
conventional wide beam antenna, switched beam smart antenna, adaptive beam
antenna and different network layouts in terms of offering better received
signal quality and user throughput. Splitting macro cell into smaller micro or
pico cells can improve the capacity of network, but this paper highlights the
importance of higher order sectorization and advance antenna techniques to
attain high Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR), along with improved
network capacity. Monte Carlo simulations at system level were done for Dual
Cell High Speed Downlink Packet Access (DC-HSDPA) technology with multiple
(five) users per Transmission Time Interval (TTI) at different Intersite
Distance (ISD). The obtained results validate and estimate the gain of using
smart antennas and higher order sectorization with proposed network layout.
