Inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) measurements of the dynamic structure factor
in liquid Na57K43, sensitive to the atomic-scale coarse graining, reveal a
sound velocity value exceeding the long wavelength, continuum value and
indicate the coexistence of two phonon-like modes. Applying Generalized
Collective Mode (GCM) analysis scheme, we show that the positive dispersion of
the sound velocity occurs in a wavelength region below the crossover from
hydrodynamic to atom-type excitations and, therefore, it can not be explained
as sound propagation over the light specie (Na) network. The present result
experimentally proves the existence of positive dispersion in a binary mixture
due to a relaxation process, as opposed to fast sound phenomena.
