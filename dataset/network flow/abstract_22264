Self-interacting diffusions are solutions to SDEs with a drift term depending
on the process and its normalized occupation measure $\mu_t$ (via an
interaction potential and a confinement potential). We establish a relation
between the asymptotic behavior of $\mu_t$ and the asymptotic behavior of a
deterministic dynamical flow (defined on the space of the Borel probability
measures). We extend previous results on $\mathbb{R}^d$ or more generally a
smooth complete connected Riemannian manifold without boundary. We will also
give some sufficient conditions for the convergence of $\mu_t$. Finally, we
will illustrate our study with an example on $\mathbb{R}^2$.
