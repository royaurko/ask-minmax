Wireless network topologies change over time and maintaining routes requires
frequent updates. Updates are costly in terms of consuming throughput available
for data transmission, which is precious in wireless networks. In this paper,
we ask whether there exist low-overhead schemes that produce low-stretch
routes. This is studied by using the underlying geometric properties of the
connectivity graph in wireless networks.
