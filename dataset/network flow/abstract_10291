We study two well-known classes of dualities in three dimensional N=2
supersymmetric field theories. In the first class there are non trivial
interactions involving monopole operators while in the second class the dual
gauge theories have Chern-Simons terms in the action. An RG flows connecting
the first dual pair to the second one has been studied in the past and tested
on the partition function on the squashed three sphere. Recently an opposite RG
flow connecting the second dual pair to the first one has been studied in the
case of unitary gauge groups. In this paper we study this flow on the partition
function on the squashed three sphere. We verify that the equality between the
partition functions of the original dual models is preserved in the IR, where
the other dual pair is reached. We generalize the analysis to the case of
symplectic and of orthogonal groups.
