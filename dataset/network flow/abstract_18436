The Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS)
technology have attracted a considerable importance recently because of its
large number of solutions serving both military as well as civilian
applications. This paper aims to develop a more efficient and especially a
faster method for processing the GPS signal in case of INS signal loss without
losing the accuracy of the data. The conventional or usual method consists of
processing data through a neural network and obtaining accurate positioning
output data. The new or improved method adds selective filtering at the
low-band frequency, the mid-band frequency and the high band frquency, before
processing the GPS data through the neural network, so that the processing time
is decreased significantly while the accuracy remains the same.
