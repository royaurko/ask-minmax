In this paper we present an optimization-based view of distributed parameter
estimation and observational social learning in networks. Agents receive a
sequence of random, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) signals,
each of which individually may not be informative about the underlying true
state, but the signals together are globally informative enough to make the
true state identifiable. Using an optimization-based characterization of
Bayesian learning as proximal stochastic gradient descent (with
Kullback-Leibler divergence from a prior as a proximal function), we show how
to efficiently use a distributed, online variant of Nesterov's dual averaging
method to solve the estimation with purely local information. When the true
state is globally identifiable, and the network is connected, we prove that
agents eventually learn the true parameter using a randomized gossip scheme. We
demonstrate that with high probability the convergence is exponentially fast
with a rate dependent on the KL divergence of observations under the true state
from observations under the second likeliest state. Furthermore, our work also
highlights the possibility of learning under continuous adaptation of network
which is a consequence of employing constant, unit stepsize for the algorithm.
