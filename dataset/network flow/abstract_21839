The Lagrangian average (LA) of the ideal fluid equations preserves their
transport structure. This transport structure is responsible for the Kelvin
circulation theorem of the LA flow and, hence, for its convection of potential
vorticity and its conservation of helicity.
  Lagrangian averaging also preserves the Euler-Poincar\'e (EP) variational
framework that implies the LA fluid equations. This is expressed in the
Lagrangian-averaged Euler-Poincar\'e (LAEP) theorem proven here and illustrated
for the Lagrangian average Euler (LAE) equations.
