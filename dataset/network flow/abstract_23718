Sood and Grassberger studied in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 098701 (2007)] random
walks on random graphs that are biased towards a fixed target point. They put
forward a critical bias strength b_c such that a random walker on an infinite
graph eventually reaches the target with probability 1 when b>b_c, while a
finite fraction of walks drift off to infinity for b<b_c. They rely on rigorous
results obtained for biased walks on Galton-Watson (GW) trees to calculate b_c,
and give arguments indicating that this result should also hold for random
graphs such as Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs and Molloy-Reed (MR) graphs. To validate
their prediction, they show by numerical simulations that the mean return time
(MRT) on a finite ER graph, as a function of the graph size N, exhibits a
transition around the expected b_c.
  Here we show that the MRT on a GW tree can actually be computed analytically.
This allows us (i) to show analytically that indeed the MRT displays a
transition at b_c, (ii) to elucidate the N dependence of the MRT, which
contradicts the \propto N scaling expected in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 098701
(2007)] for b<b_c.
