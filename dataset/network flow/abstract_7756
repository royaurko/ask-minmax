I briefly review the properties of the gas flow in and around the region of
the bar in a disc galaxy and discuss the corresponding inflow and the loci of
star formation. I then review the flow of gas in barred galaxies which have an
additional secondary bar. Finally I discuss the signatures of bars in edge-on
galaxies.
