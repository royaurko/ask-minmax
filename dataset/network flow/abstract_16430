We find a further class of exact solutions to the Lighthill Whitham Richards
Payne (LWRP) traffic flow equations. As before, using two consecutive
Lagrangian transformations, a linearization is achieved. Next, depending on the
initial density, we either obtain exact formulae for the dependence of the car
density and velocity on x, t, or else, failing that, the same result in a
parametric representation. The calculation always involves two possible
factorizations of a consistency condition. Both must be considered. In physical
terms, the lineup usually separates into two offshoots at different velocities.
Each velocity soon becomes uniform. This outcome in many ways resembles not
only Rowlands, Infeld and Skorupski J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 46 (2013) 365202
(part I) but also the two soliton solution to the Korteweg-de Vries equation.
This paper can be read independently of part I. This explains unavoidable
repetitions. Possible uses of both papers in checking numerical codes are
indicated at the end. Since LWRP, numerous more elaborate models, including
multiple lanes, traffic jams, tollgates etc. abound in the literature. However,
we present an exact solution. These are few and far between, other then found
by inverse scattering. The literature for various models, including ours, is
given. The methods used here and in part I may be useful in solving other
problems, such as shallow water flow.
