In an autonomous wireless sensor network, self-organization of the nodes is
essential to achieve network wide characteristics. We believe that connectivity
in wireless autonomous networks can be increased and overall average path
length can be reduced by using beamforming and bio-inspired algorithms. Recent
works on the use of beamforming in wireless networks mostly assume the
knowledge of the network in aggregation to either heterogeneous or hybrid
deployment. We propose that without the global knowledge or the introduction of
any special feature, the average path length can be reduced with the help of
inspirations from the nature and simple interactions between neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm also reduces the number of disconnected components within the
network. Our results show that reduction in the average path length and the
number of disconnected components can be achieved using very simple local rules
and without the full network knowledge.
