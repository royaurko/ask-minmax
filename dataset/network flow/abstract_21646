We study color fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma produced at the early
stage of nucleus-nucleus collision at RHIC or LHC. The fluctuating color
current, which flows along the beam, can be very {\it large} due to the strong
anisotropy of the parton momentum distribution. A specific fluctuation, which
splits the parton system into the current filaments parallel to the beam
direction, is argued to grow exponentially. The physical mechanism responsible
for the phenomenon, which is known as a filamentation instability, is
discussed.
