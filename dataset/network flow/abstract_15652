This paper presents a new method for studying the electromechanical
transients in power systems using combined Transmission and Distribution (T&D)
models. Unlike the traditional dynamics analysis techniques which assume a
balanced electric network, the methodology presented in this paper models
individual phases of the power system and associated imbalances in load and
generation. Therefore, the impacts of load imbalance, single phase distributed
generation and line impedance imbalance on electromechanical transients can be
studied. Although other existing software can also be used to study
electromechanical transients in unbalanced networks, such software model
electric networks through differential equations, which makes the study of
large electric networks time consuming. Thus, the methodology presented
includes imbalance modeling and overcomes the system size limitations of
existing software tools, providing the means for studying electromechanical
transients in large, unbalanced T&D systems. The implementation of this
methodology in software is called the Three Phase Dynamics Analyzer (TPDA).
