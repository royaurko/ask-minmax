  Cheriyan and Hagerup developed a randomized algorithm to compute the maximum flow in a graph with n nodes and m edges in O ( mn + n 2 log 2 n ) expected time. The randomization is used to efficiently play a certain combinatorial game that arises during the computation. We give a version of their algorithm where a general version of their game arises. Then we give a strategy for the game that yields a deterministic algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a directed graph with n nodes and m edges that runs in time O ( mn (log m / n log n n )). Our algorithm gives an O ( mn ) deterministic algorithm for all m / n = Ω( n ϵ ) for any positive constant ϵ, and is currently the fastest deterministic algorithm for computing maximum flow as long as m / n = ω(log n ).
