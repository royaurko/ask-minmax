There exist several approaches that investigate the connectedness of
spacetime events through solutions of the Lorentz force equation. These
approaches separate into three categories, that consider different equations.
We clarify the physical meaning of each equation showing that only one method
is based on the Lorentz force equation. The other two approaches lead
respectively to a less restrictive equation that defines an electromagnetic
flow on the cotangent fiber bundle, or to an unphysical constraint between
charge-to-mass ratio and proper length of the solution. We outline the physical
meaning of each approach studying the variational formulations and clarifying
the results obtained in the explored directions.
