We present new parallel sorting networks for $17$ to $20$ inputs. For $17,
19,$ and $20$ inputs these new networks are faster (i.e., they require less
computation steps) than the previously known best networks. Therefore, we
improve upon the known upper bounds for minimal depth sorting networks on $17,
19,$ and $20$ channels. The networks were obtained using a combination of
hand-crafted first layers and a SAT encoding of sorting networks.
