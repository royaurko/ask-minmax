The paper describes a new CNC control unit for machining centres with
learning ability and automatic intelligent generating of NC programs on the
bases of a neural network, which is built-in into a CNC unit as special device.
The device performs intelligent and completely automatically the NC part
programs only on the bases of 2D, 2,5D or 3D computer model of prismatic part.
Intervention of the operator is not needed. The neural network for milling,
drilling, reaming, threading and operations alike has learned to generate NC
programs in the learning module, which is a part of intelligent CAD/CAM system.
