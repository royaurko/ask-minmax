In keeping with the definition that biotechnology is really no more than a
name given to a set of techniques and processes, the contributors apply some set of
fuzzy techniques to chemical industry problems such as finding the proper
proportion of raw mix to control pollution, to study flow rates, to find out
the better quality of products. We use fuzzy control theory, fuzzy neural
networks, fuzzy relational equations, genetic algorithms to these problems for
solutions. When the solution to the problem can have certain concepts or
attributes as indeterminate, the only model that can tackle such a situation is
the neutrosophic model. The contributors have also used these models in this book to
study the use of biotechnology in chemical industries.
  This book has six chapters. First chapter gives a brief description of
biotechnology. Second chapter deals will proper proportion of mix of raw
materials in cement industries to minimize pollution using fuzzy control
theory. Chapter three gives the method of determination of temperature set
point for crude oil in oil refineries. Chapter four studies the flow rates in
chemical industries using fuzzy neutral networks. Chapter five gives the method
of minimization of waste gas flow in chemical industries using fuzzy linear
programming. The final chapter suggests when in these studies indeterminancy is
an attribute or concept involved, the notion of neutrosophic methods can be
adopted.
