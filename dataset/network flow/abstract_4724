We present results of a flow analysis for the set of reactions of 124,129Xe
projectiles and 112,124Sn targets at incident energies 100 and 150 A MeV
studied with the INDRA detector at GSI. The dependence on centrality and on p_t
of the directed and elliptic flow are determined for isotopically selected
reaction products with Z \le 3. The flow parameters v_1 and v_2, in general,
follow expected trends but isotopic effects are small.
