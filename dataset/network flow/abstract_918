We analyze an idealized model for the transmission or flow of particles, or
discrete packets of information, in a weight bearing branching hierarchical 2-D
networks, and its variants. The capacities add hierarchically down the
clusters. Each node can accommodate a limited number of packets, depending on
its capacity and the packets hop from node to node, following the links between
the nodes. The statistical properties of this system are given by the Maxwell -
Boltzmann distribution. We obtain analytical expressions for the mean
occupation numbers as functions of capacity, for different network topologies.
The analytical results are shown to be in agreement with the numerical
simulations. The traffic flow in these models can be represented by the site
percolation problem. It is seen that the percolation transitions in the 2-D
model and in its variant lattices are continuous transitions, whereas the
transition is found to be explosive (discontinuous) for the V- lattice, the
critical case of the 2-D lattice. We discuss the implications of our analysis.
