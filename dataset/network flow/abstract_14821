We update two kinds of results obtained with the SWAN instrument on board
SOHO. First, we use H cell data recorded in 2001 and derive the H flow
direction in the same way we performed the study at solar minimum. We compare
with the Helium flow and doing so we correct for the coordinate system change
between the Ulysses and SOHO mission. The deflection plane we obtain is
compatible with the previous result within error bars, confirming the
predominant role of the interstellar magnetic field. Secondly, we extend the
derivation of solar wind ionization temporal evolution as a function of
heliolatitude. The pattern for the present solar minimum is strikingly
different from the previous minimum, with a much wider slow solar wind
equatorial belt which persists until at least 2008. Comparing with synoptic
LASCO/C2 electron densities we infer from a preliminary study that the
acceleration of the high speed solar wind occurs at a higher altitude during
this minimum, a change expansion models should be able to explain.
