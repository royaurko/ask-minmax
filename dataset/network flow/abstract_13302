We fit the observational data for M87 using two-component advective disk
model. We show that the flat spectrum from the nucleus of M87 is due to
synchrotron radiation produced by non-thermal electrons in the CENBOL. The
non-thermal distribution is produced due to acceleration of electrons across
the shock in a sub-Keplerian flow.
