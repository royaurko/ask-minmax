The well-known analytical solution of Burgers' equation is extended to
curvilinear coordinate systems in three-dimensions by a method which is much
simpler and more suitable to practical applications than that previously used.
The results obtained are applied to incompressible flow with cylindrical
symmetry, and also to the decay of an initially linearly increasing wind.
