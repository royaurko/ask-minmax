Using the relativistic transport model (ART), we predict the energy
dependence of the stopping power, maximum baryon and energy densities, the
population of resonance matter as well as the strength of the transverse and
radial flow for central Au+Au reactions at beam momentum from 2 to 12 GeV/c
available at Brookhaven's AGS. The maximum baryon and energy densities are
further compared to the predictions of relativistic hydrodynamics assuming the
formation of shock waves. We also discuss the Fermi-Landau scaling of the pion
multiplicity in these reactions.
