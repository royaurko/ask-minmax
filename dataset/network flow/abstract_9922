Threshold amplitude of disturbance for transition to turbulence in a pipe
Poiseuille flow is investigated. Based on the energy gradient theory, we argued
that the transition to turbulence depends on magnitudes of the energy gradient
of mean flow and the disturbance energy. Furthermore, the threshold disturbance
energy required for turbulence transition is expressed as a function of the
complementary angle to the energy angle which also characterizes the behaviour
of the energy gradient of mean flow. With some mathematical treatments, the
variation of the threshold energy of disturbance versus the Reynolds number is
obtained. Then, it is found for a fixed disturbance frequency that the
normalized amplitude of disturbance is scaled by Re with an exponent of -3/2
for the transition occurrence in a pipe. This value of exponent agrees well
with several recent results reported in the literature. Finally, the mechanism
of transition to turbulence is suggested for different disturbance levels.
