The common interpretation of $v_2$ in heavy ion collisions is that it is
produced by hydrodynamic flow at low transverse momentum and by parton energy
loss at high transverse momentum. In this talk we discuss this interpretation
in view of the dependence of $v_2$ with energy, rapidity and system size, and
show that it might not be trivial to reconcile these models with the relatively
simple scaling found in experiment
