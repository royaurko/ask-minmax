Deterministic equilibrium flows in transport networks can be investigated by
means of Markov's processes defined on the dual graph representations of the
network. Sustained movement patterns are generated by a subset of automorphisms
of the graph spanning the spatial network of a city naturally interpreted as
random walks. Random walks assign absolute scores to all nodes of a graph and
embed space syntax into Euclidean space.
