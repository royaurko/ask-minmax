The new frontier in cellular networks is harnessing the enormous spectrum
available in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies above 28 GHz. The challenging
radio propagation characteristics at these frequencies, and the use of highly
directional beamforming, lead to intermittent links between the base station
(BS) and the user equipment (UE). In this paper, we revisit the problem of cell
selection to maintain an acceptable level of service, despite the underlying
intermittent link connectivity typical of mmWave links. We propose a Markov
Decision Processe (MDP) framework to study the properties and performance of
our proposed cell selection strategy, which jointly considers several factors
such as dynamic channel load and link quality. We use the Value Iteration
Algorithm (VIA) to solve the MDP, and obtain the optimal set of associations.
We address the multi user problem through a distributed iterative approach, in
which each UE characterizes the evolution of the system based on stationary
channel distribution and cell selection statistics of other UEs. Through
simulation results, we show that our proposed technique makes judicious handoff
choices, thereby providing a significant improvement in the overall network
capacity. Further, our technique reduces the total number of handoffs, thus
lowering the signaling overhead, while providing a higher quality of service to
the UEs. We believe that this work takes us a step closer toward harnessing the
enormous spectrum available in mmWave cellular networks.
