General area-preserving motion of polygonal curves is formulated as a system
of ODEs. Solution polygonal curves belong to a prescribed polygonal class,
which is similar to the admissible class used in the crystalline curvature
flow. The ODEs are discretized implicitly in time keeping a given constant area
speed while solution polygonal curves keep belonging to the polygonal class.
