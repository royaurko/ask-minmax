In this paper, we construct global distributional solutions to the
volume-preserving mean-curvature flow using a variant of the time-discrete
gradient flow approach proposed independently by Almgren, Taylor and Wang (SIAM
J. Control Optim. 31(2): 387- 438, 1993) and Luckhaus and Sturzenhecker (Calc.
Var. Partial Differential Equations 3(2): 253-271, 1995).
