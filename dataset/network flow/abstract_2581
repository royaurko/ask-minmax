We perform an empirical study of the preferential attachment phenomenon in
temporal networks and show that on the Web, networks follow a nonlinear
preferential attachment model in which the exponent depends on the type of
network considered. The classical preferential attachment model for networks by
Barab\'asi and Albert (1999) assumes a linear relationship between the number
of neighbors of a node in a network and the probability of attachment. Although
this assumption is widely made in Web Science and related fields, the
underlying linearity is rarely measured. To fill this gap, this paper performs
an empirical longitudinal (time-based) study on forty-seven diverse Web network
datasets from seven network categories and including directed, undirected and
bipartite networks. We show that contrary to the usual assumption, preferential
attachment is nonlinear in the networks under consideration. Furthermore, we
observe that the deviation from linearity is dependent on the type of network,
giving sublinear attachment in certain types of networks, and superlinear
attachment in others. Thus, we introduce the preferential attachment exponent
$\beta$ as a novel numerical network measure that can be used to discriminate
different types of networks. We propose explanations for the behavior of that
network measure, based on the mechanisms that underly the growth of the network
in question.
