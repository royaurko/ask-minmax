We give a new application of the theory of holomorphic motions to the study
the distortion of level lines of harmonic functions and stream lines of ideal
planar fluid flow. In various settings, we show they are in fact quasilines -
the quasiconformal images of the real line. These methods also provide quite
explicit global estimates on the geometry of these curves.
