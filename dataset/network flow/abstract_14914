The distribution of superclusters in the Local Supercluster neighbourhood
presents such a remarkable periodicity that some kind of network must fit the
observed large scale structure. A three dimension chessboard has been
suggested$^{1}$. The existence of this network is really a challenge for
currently-suggested theoretical models. For instance, CDM models of the
formation of the large scale structure predict a random distribution of
superclusters$^{2}$. If the filaments of matter that are now observed building
up the network are fossil relics of over-dense regions of magnetic field energy
before Recombination, then it has been shown$^{3}$ that the simplest network
compatible with magnetic field constraints is made up of octahedra contacting
at their vertexes. This suggests a set of superimposed egg-carton structures.
Our aim in this paper is to show that the real large-scale structure is
actually fitted by the theoretical octahedron structure.
