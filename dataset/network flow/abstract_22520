We present a manifestly duality covariant formulation of the composite
non-BPS and almost-BPS systems of multi-centre black hole solutions in four
dimensions. The method of nilpotent orbits is used to define the two systems in
terms of first order flow equations that transform covariantly under the
duality group. Subsequently, we rewrite both systems of equations in terms of
real, manifestly duality covariant, linear systems of Poisson equations.
Somewhat unexpectedly, we find that the two systems are naturally described by
the same equations involving space dependent abelian isometries that are
conjugate to T-dualities by similarity transformations.
