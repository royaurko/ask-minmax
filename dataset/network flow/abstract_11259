We introduce a numerical method to study random Boolean networks with
asynchronous stochas- tic update. Each node in the network of states starts
with equal occupation probability and this probability distribution then
evolves to a steady state. Nodes left with finite occupation probability
determine the attractors and the sizes of their basins. As for synchronous
update, the basin entropy grows with system size only for critical networks,
where the distribution of attractor lengths is a power law. We determine
analytically the distribution for the number of attractors and basin sizes for
frozen networks with connectivity K = 1.
