Person-to-person evaluations are prevalent in all kinds of discourse and
important for establishing reputations, building social bonds, and shaping
public opinion. Such evaluations can be analyzed separately using signed social
networks and textual sentiment analysis, but this misses the rich interactions
between language and social context. To capture such interactions, we develop a
model that predicts individual A's opinion of individual B by synthesizing
information from the signed social network in which A and B are embedded with
sentiment analysis of the evaluative texts relating A to B. We prove that this
problem is NP-hard but can be relaxed to an efficiently solvable hinge-loss
Markov random field, and we show that this implementation outperforms text-only
and network-only versions in two very different datasets involving
community-level decision-making: the Wikipedia Requests for Adminship corpus
and the Convote U.S. Congressional speech corpus.
