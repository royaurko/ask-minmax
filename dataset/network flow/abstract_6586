Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks are significantly different from
terrestrial sensor networks due to peculiar characteristics of low bandwidth,
high latency, limited energy, node float mobility and high error probability.
These features bring many challenges to the network protocol design of UWSNs.
Several routing protocols have been developed in recent years for these
networks. One of the major difficulties in comparison and validation of the
performance of these proposals is the lack of a common standard to model the
acoustic propagation in the harsh underwater environment. In this paper we
analyze the evolution of certain underwater routing protocols like VBF, DBR,
H2-DAB, QELAR etc. in terms of their localization techniques, energy
minimization characteristics and holding time calculations. The design of each
protocol follows certain goals i.e. reduction of energy consumption,
improvement of communication latency, achievement of robustness and scalability
etc. This paper examines the main approaches and challenges in the design and
implementation of underwater sensor networks. The detailed descriptions of the
selected protocols contribute in understanding the direction of the current
research on routing layer in UWSN.
