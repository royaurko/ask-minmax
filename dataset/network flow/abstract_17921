The problem of incomplete data - i.e., data with missing or unknown values -
in multi-way arrays is ubiquitous in biomedical signal processing, network
traffic analysis, bibliometrics, social network analysis, chemometrics,
computer vision, communication networks, etc. We consider the problem of how to
factorize data sets with missing values with the goal of capturing the
underlying latent structure of the data and possibly reconstructing missing
values (i.e., tensor completion). We focus on one of the most well-known tensor
factorizations that captures multi-linear structure, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP). In
the presence of missing data, CP can be formulated as a weighted least squares
problem that models only the known entries. We develop an algorithm called
CP-WOPT (CP Weighted OPTimization) that uses a first-order optimization
approach to solve the weighted least squares problem. Based on extensive
numerical experiments, our algorithm is shown to successfully factorize tensors
with noise and up to 99% missing data. A unique aspect of our approach is that
it scales to sparse large-scale data, e.g., 1000 x 1000 x 1000 with five
million known entries (0.5% dense). We further demonstrate the usefulness of
CP-WOPT on two real-world applications: a novel EEG (electroencephalogram)
application where missing data is frequently encountered due to disconnections
of electrodes and the problem of modeling computer network traffic where data
may be absent due to the expense of the data collection process.
