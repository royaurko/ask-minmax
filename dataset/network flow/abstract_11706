Wireless networks are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in which a malicious node
poses as many identities in order to gain disproportionate influence. Many
defenses based on spatial variability of wireless channels exist, but depend
either on detailed, multi-tap channel estimation - something not exposed on
commodity 802.11 devices - or valid RSSI observations from multiple trusted
sources, e.g., corporate access points - something not directly available in ad
hoc and delay-tolerant networks with potentially malicious neighbors. We extend
these techniques to be practical for wireless ad hoc networks of commodity
802.11 devices. Specifically, we propose two efficient methods for separating
the valid RSSI observations of behaving nodes from those falsified by malicious
participants. Further, we note that prior signalprint methods are easily
defeated by mobile attackers and develop an appropriate challenge-response
defense. Finally, we present the Mason test, the first implementation of these
techniques for ad hoc and delay-tolerant networks of commodity 802.11 devices.
We illustrate its performance in several real-world scenarios.
