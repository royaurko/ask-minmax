The emergence of complex networks from evolutionary games is studied
occurring when agents are allowed to switch interaction partners. For this
purpose a coevolutionary iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game is defined on a
random network with agents as nodes and games along the links. The agents
change their neighborhoods to improve their payoff. The system relaxes to
stationary states corresponding to cooperative Nash equilibria with the
additional property that no agent can improve its payoff by changing its
neighborhood. Small perturbations of the system lead to avalanches of strategy
readjustments reestablishing equilibrium. As a result of the dynamics, the
network of interactions develops non-trivial topological properties as a broad
degree distribution suggesting scale-free behavior, small-world
characteristics, and assortative mixing.
