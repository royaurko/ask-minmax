Strain stiffening of protein networks is explored by means of a finite strain
analysis of a two-dimensional network model of cross-linked semiflexible
filaments. The results show that stiffening is caused by non-affine network
rearrangements that govern a transition from a bending dominated response at
small strains to a stretching dominated response at large strains.
Thermally-induced filament undulations only have a minor effect; they merely
postpone the transition.
