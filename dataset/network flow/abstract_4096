We study the transverse flow for systems having various N/Z ratios. We find
the transverse flow is sensitive to N/Z ratio and, in fact, increases with N/Z
of the system. The relative contribution of symmetry energy and isospin
dependence of nucleon-nucleon cross section is also investigated. We find the
greater sensitivity of symmetry energy in the lighter systems compared to
heavier ones.
