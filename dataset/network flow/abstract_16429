Most electrochemical processes, such as electrodialysis, are limited by
diffusion, but in porous media, surface conduction and electro-osmotic flow
also contribute to ionic fluxes. In this paper, we report experimental evidence
for surface-driven over-limiting current (faster than diffusion) and
deionization shocks (propagating salt removal) in a porous medium. The
apparatus consists of a silica glass frit (1 mm thick with 500 nm mean pore
size) in an aqueous electrolyte (CuSO$_4$ or AgNO$_3$) passing ionic current
from a reservoir to a cation-selective membrane (Nafion). The current-voltage
relation of the whole system is consistent with a proposed theory based on the
electro-osmotic flow mechanism over a broad range of reservoir salt
concentrations (0.1 mM - 1.0 M), after accounting for (Cu) electrode
polarization and pH-regulated silica charge. Above the limiting current,
deionized water ($\approx 10 \mu$ $M$) can be continuously extracted from the
frit, which implies the existence of a stable shock propagating against the
flow, bordering a depleted region that extends more than 0.5mm across the
outlet. The results suggest the feasibility of "shock electrodialysis" as a new
approach to water desalination and other electrochemical separations.
