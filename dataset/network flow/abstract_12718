We characterize the locally finite networks admitting non-constant harmonic
functions of finite energy. Our characterization unifies the necessary
existence criteria of Thomassen and of Lyons and Peres with the sufficient
criterion of Soardi. We also extend a necessary existence criterion for
non-elusive non-constant harmonic functions of finite energy due to
Georgakopoulos.
