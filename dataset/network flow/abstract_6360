In the first part in [12], we present and analyse a Sigmoid-based
"Signal-to-Interference Ratio, (SIR)" balancing dynamic network, called
Sgm"SIR"NN, which exhibits similar properties as traditional Hopfield NN does,
in continuous time. In this second part, we present the corresponding network
in discrete time: We show that in the proposed discrete-time network, called
D-Sgm"SIR"NN, the defined error vector approaches to zero in a finite step in
both synchronous and asynchronous work modes. Our investigations show that i)
Establishing an analogy to the distributed (sigmoid) power control algorithm in
[10] and [11] if the defined fictitious "SIR" is equal to 1 at the converged
eqiulibrium point, then it is one of the prototype vectors. ii) The
D-Sgm"SIR"NN exhibits similar features as discrete-time Hopfield NN does. iii)
Establishing an analogy to the traditional 1-bit fixed-step power control
algorithm, the corresponding "1-bit" network, called Sign"SIR"NN network, is
also presented.
