Wireless Multi-hop Networks (WMhNs) provide users with the facility to
communicate while moving with whatever the node speed, the node density and the
number of traffic flows they want, without any unwanted delay and/or
disruption. This paper contributes Linear Programming models (LP_models) for
WMhNs. In WMhNs, different routing protocols are used to facilitate users
demand(s). To practically examine constraints of respective LP_models over
different routing techniques, we select three proactive routing protocols;
Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV), Fish-eye State Routing (FSR) and
Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR). These protocols are simulated in two
important scenarios regarding to user demands; mobilities and different network
flows. To evaluate the performance, we further relate the protocols strategy
effects on respective constraints in selected network scenarios.
