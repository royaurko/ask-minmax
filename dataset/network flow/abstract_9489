Given a social network, which of its nodes have a stronger impact in
determining its structure? More formally: which node-removal order has the
greatest impact on the network structure? We approach this well-known problem
for the first time in a setting that combines both web graphs and social
networks, using datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than those
appearing in the previous literature, thanks to some recently developed
algorithms and software tools that make it possible to approximate accurately
the number of reachable pairs and the distribution of distances in a graph. Our
experiments highlight deep differences in the structure of social networks and
web graphs, show significant limitations of previous experimental results, and
at the same time reveal clustering by label propagation as a new and very
effective way of locating nodes that are important from a structural viewpoint.
