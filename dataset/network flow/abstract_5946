Aiming to understand real-world hierarchical networks whose degree
distributions are neither power law nor exponential, we construct a hybrid
clique network that includes both homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, and
introduce an inhomogeneity parameter to tune the ratio between the homogeneous
part and the inhomogeneous one. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to study
various properties of such a network, including the degree distribution, the
average shortest-path-length, the clustering coefficient, the clustering
spectrum, and the communicability.
