A large set of relevant deformations of the ABJM field theory on a stack of
M2 branes is captured holographically by D=4 N=8 SO(8)-gauged supergravity,
which has accordingly been applied to study renormalisation group (RG) flows of
the field theory between distinct superconformal phases. Recently, it has been
discovered that this supergravity is not unique, and that a one-parameter
family of gaugings of maximal supergravity exists. The parameter is an angle
that measures the mixture of electric and magnetic vectors that gauge SO(8)
dyonically. We construct and comprehensively characterise all domain walls
between the critical points of the new supergravities with at least SU(3)
invariance, which are expected to be dual to RG flows of new field theories
defined at least at large N. We also construct some walls running off to
infinity in scalar space, which we expect to be dual to Coulomb branch flows of
these field theories.
