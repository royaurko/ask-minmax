We propose a model to show the self-assembling of network-like structures
between a set of nodes without using preexisting positional information or
long-range attraction of the nodes. The model is based on Brownian agents that
are capable of producing different local (chemical) information and respond to
it in a non-linear manner. They solve two tasks in parallel: (i) the detection
of the appropriate nodes, and (ii) the establishment of stable links between
them. We present results of computer simulations that demonstrate the emergence
of robust network structures and investigate the connectivity of the network by
means of both analytical estimations and computer simulations. PACS: 05.65.+b,
