Given a semi-Hamiltonian system, we construct an $F$-manifold with a
connection satisfying a suitable compatibility condition with the product. We
exemplify this procedure in the case of the so-called $\epsilon$-system. The
corresponding connection turns out to be flat, and the flat coordinates give
rise to additional chains of commuting flows
