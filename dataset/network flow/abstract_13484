The holographic nonsupersymmetric renormalization group flows in four
dimensions are found. The mass-deformed N=2, 4 Chern-Simons matter theories can
be reproduced from N=1 Chern-Simons matter theory by putting some constraints
in the mass terms. We construct the geometric superpotential, from an eleven
dimensional M-theory lift, which provides M2-brane probe analysis for the
infrared ends of various supersymmetric or nonsupersymmetric flows.
