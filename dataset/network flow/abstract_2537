This paper addresses the problem of transferring useful knowledge from a
source network to predict node labels in a newly formed target network. While
existing transfer learning research has primarily focused on vector-based data,
in which the instances are assumed to be independent and identically
distributed, how to effectively transfer knowledge across different information
networks has not been well studied, mainly because networks may have their
distinct node features and link relationships between nodes. In this paper, we
propose a new transfer learning algorithm that attempts to transfer common
latent structure features across the source and target networks. The proposed
algorithm discovers these latent features by constructing label propagation
matrices in the source and target networks, and mapping them into a shared
latent feature space. The latent features capture common structure patterns
shared by two networks, and serve as domain-independent features to be
transferred between networks. Together with domain-dependent node features, we
thereafter propose an iterative classification algorithm that leverages label
correlations to predict node labels in the target network. Experiments on
real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can successfully
achieve knowledge transfer between networks to help improve the accuracy of
classifying nodes in the target network.
