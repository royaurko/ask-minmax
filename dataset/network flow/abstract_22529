Exploiting a relationship between closed geodesics on a generic closed
hyperbolic surface S and a certain unipotent flow on the product space T_1(S) x
T_1(S), we obtain a local asymptotic equidistribution result for long closed
geodesics on S. Applications include asymptotic estimates for the number of
pants immersions into S satisfying various geometric constraints. Also we show
that two uniformly random closed geodesics gamma_1, gamma_2 of length within
epsilon of L have a high probability of partially bounding an immersed 4-holed
sphere whose other boundary components also have length within epsilon of L.
