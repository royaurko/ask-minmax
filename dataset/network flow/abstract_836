Well known in the theory of network flows, Braess paradox states that in a
congested network, it may happen that adding a new path between destinations
can increase the level of congestion. In transportation networks the phenomenon
results from the decisions of network participants who selfishly seek to
optimize their own performance metrics. In an electric power distribution
network, an analogous increase in congestion can arise as a consequence
Kirchhoff's laws. Even for the simplest linear network of resistors and voltage
sources, the sudden appearance of congestion due to an additional conductive
line is a nonlinear phenomenon that results in a discontinuous change in the
network state. It is argued that the phenomenon can occur in almost any grid in
which they are loops, and with the increasing penetration of small-scale
distributed generation it suggests challenges ahead in the operation of
microgrids.
