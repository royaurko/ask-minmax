Both small world models of random networks with occasional long range
connections and gossip processes with occasional long range transmission of
information have similar characteristic behaviour. The long range elements
appreciably reduce the effective distances, measured in space or in time,
between pairs of typical points. In this paper, we show that their common
behaviour can be interpreted as a product of the locally branching nature of
the models. In particular, it is shown that both typical distances between
points and the proportion of space that can be reached within a given distance
or time can be approximated by formulae involving the limit random variable of
the branching process.
