Controllability and observability have long been recognized as fundamental
structural properties of dynamical systems, but have recently seen renewed
interest in the context of large, complex networks of dynamical systems. A
basic problem is sensor and actuator placement: choose a subset from a finite
set of possible placements to optimize some real-valued controllability and
observability metrics of the network. Surprisingly little is known about the
structure of such combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we show
that an important class of metrics based on the controllability and
observability Gramians has a strong structural property that allows efficient
global optimization: the mapping from possible placements to the trace of the
associated Gramian is a modular set function. We illustrate the results via
placement of power electronic actuators in a model of the European power grid.
