Diversity coding is a network restoration technique which offers near-hitless
restoration, while other state-of-the art techniques are signi?cantly slower.
Furthermore, the extra spare capacity requirement of diversity coding is
competitive with the others. Previously, we developed heuristic algorithms to
employ diversity coding structures in networks with arbitrary topology. This
paper presents two algorithms to solve the network design problems using
diversity coding in an optimal manner. The first technique pre-provisions
static traffic whereas the second technique carries out the dynamic
provisioning of the traffic on-demand. In both cases, diversity coding results
in smaller restoration time, simpler synchronization, and much reduced
signaling complexity than the existing techniques in the literature. A Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) formulation and an algorithm based on Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) are developed for pre-provisioning and dynamic provisioning,
respectively. Simulation results indicate that diversity coding has
signi?cantly higher restoration speed than Shared Path Protection (SPP) and
p-cycle techniques. It requires more extra capacity than the p-cycle technique
and SPP. However, the increase in the total capacity is negligible compared to
the increase in the restoration speed.
