We discuss a novel analysis method for reaction network systems with
polynomial or rational rate functions. This method is based on computing
tropical equilibrations defined by the equality of at least two dominant
monomials of opposite signs in the differential equations of each dynamic
variable. In algebraic geometry, the tropical equilibration problem is
tantamount to finding tropical prevarieties, that are finite intersections of
tropical hypersurfaces. Tropical equilibrations with the same set of dominant
monomials define a branch or equivalence class. Minimal branches are
particularly interesting as they describe the simplest states of the reaction
network. We provide a method to compute the number of minimal branches and to
find representative tropical equilibrations for each branch.
