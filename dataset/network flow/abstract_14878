We investigate timelike and null vector flows on closed Lorentzian manifolds
and their relationship to Ricci curvature. The guiding observation, first
observed for closed Riemannian 3-manifolds in Harris & Paternain (2013), is
that positive Ricci curvature tends to yield contact forms, namely, 1-forms
metrically equivalent to unit vector fields with geodesic flow. We carry this
line of thought over to the Lorentzian setting. First, we observe that the same
is true on a closed Lorentzian 3-manifold: if ${\boldsymbol k}$ is a global
timelike unit vector field with geodesic flow satisfying
$\text{Ric}({\boldsymbol k},{\boldsymbol k}) > 0$, then $g({\boldsymbol
k},\cdot)$ is a contact form with Reeb vector field ${\boldsymbol k}$, at least
one of whose integral curves is closed. Second, we show that on a closed
Lorentzian 4-manifold, if ${\boldsymbol k}$ is a global null vector field
satisfying $\nabla_{{\boldsymbol k}}{\boldsymbol k} = {\boldsymbol k}$ and
$\text{Ric}({\boldsymbol k},{\boldsymbol k}) > \text{div}\,{\boldsymbol k}-1$,
then $dg({\boldsymbol k},\cdot)$ is a symplectic form and ${\boldsymbol k}$ is
a Liouville vector field.
