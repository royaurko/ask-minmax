Wireless sensor nodes are powered by batteries, for which replacement is very
difficult. That is why, optimization of energy consumption is a major objective
in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs).On the other hand, noisy channel
has a prominent influence on the reliability of data transmission. Therefore,
an energy efficient transmission strategy should be considered on the
communication process of wireless nodes in order to obtain optimal energy
network consumption. Indeed, the choice of suitable modulation format with the
proper Error Correcting code (ECC) played a great responsibility to obtain
better energy conservation.In this work, we aim to evaluate the performance
analysis of Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation with several
combinations of coding strategies using various analysis metrics such as Bit
Error Rate (BER), energy consumption.Through extensive simulation, we disclose
that he gain achieved through GMSK modulation with suitable channel coding
mechanism is promising to obtain reliable communication and energy conservation
in WSN.
