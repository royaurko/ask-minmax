We present the first micro-architectural side-channel attack which runs
entirely in the browser. In contrast to other works in this genre, this attack
does not require the attacker to install any software on the victim's machine
-- to facilitate the attack, the victim needs only to browse to an untrusted
webpage with attacker-controlled content. This makes the attack model highly
scalable and extremely relevant and practical to today's web, especially since
most desktop browsers currently accessing the Internet are vulnerable to this
attack. Our attack, which is an extension of the last-level cache attacks of
Yarom et al., allows a remote adversary recover information belonging to other
processes, other users and even other virtual machines running on the same
physical host as the victim web browser. We describe the fundamentals behind
our attack, evaluate its performance using a high bandwidth covert channel and
finally use it to construct a system-wide mouse/network activity logger.
Defending against this attack is possible, but the required countermeasures can
exact an impractical cost on other benign uses of the web browser and of the
computer.
