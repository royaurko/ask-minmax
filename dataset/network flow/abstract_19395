We discuss different aspects of nested bar dynamics and its effect on the gas
flow and fueling of Active Galactic Nuclei. Specifically we focus on the
dynamical decoupling between the primary and secondary bars and the gas flow
across the bar-bar interface. We analyze the nuclear gaseous bar formation when
gas gravity can be neglected or when it dominates. Finally, we discuss the
possible effect of flat core, triaxial, dark halos on the formation of galactic
bulges and supermassive black holes (SBHs) and argue in favor of SBH-bulge-halo
correlation.
