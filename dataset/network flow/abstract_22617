The entrainment of air by advancing contact lines is studied by plunging a
solid plate into a very viscous liquid. Above a threshold velocity, we observe
the formation of an extended air film, typically 10 microns thick, which
subsequently decays into air bubbles. Exploring a large range of viscous
liquids, we find an unexpectedly weak dependence of entrainment speed on liquid
viscosity, pointing towards a crucial role of the flow inside the air film.
This induces a striking asymmetry between wetting and dewetting: while the
breakup of the air film strongly resembles the dewetting of a liquid film, the
wetting speeds are larger by orders of magnitude.
