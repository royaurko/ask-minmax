We consider a general class of low complexity distributed scheduling
algorithms in wireless networks, maximal scheduling with priorities, where a
maximal set of transmitting links in each time slot are selected according to
certain pre-specified static priorities. The proposed scheduling scheme is
simple, which is easily amendable for distributed implementation in practice,
such as using inter-frame space (IFS) parameters under the ubiquitous 802.11
protocols. To obtain throughput guarantees, we first analyze the case of
maximal scheduling with a fixed priority vector, and formulate a lower bound on
its stability region and scheduling efficiency. We further propose a low
complexity priority assignment algorithm, which can stabilize any arrival rate
that is in the union of the lower bound regions of all priorities. The
stability result is proved using fluid limits, and can be applied to very
general stochastic arrival processes. Finally, the performance of the proposed
prioritized maximal scheduling scheme is verified by simulation results.
