In this article, we demonstrate a dramatic decrease in nanosecond (ns) pulsed
laser induced transient absorption (TA) in a-GexAs35-xSe65 thin films by tuning
the network rigidity from floppy to rigid. We show that TA in these films are
due to the transient change in the amorphous network through bond
rearrangements by self trapped excitons. Taken together, a rigid system having
greater number of constraints than degrees of freedom unable to undergo such
bond rearrangement and consequently inflict weaker effects. Importantly, we
also demonstrate that with sufficient photon fluence, enough constraints could
be lifted up to introduce large TA even in over coordinated rigid glasses.
Indeed our experimental results provide the direct evidence of the role of
network rigidity and excitation fluence in controlling TA, which is consistent
with the network rigidity theory. In addition to this, we also show that these
bands are tunable as it blueshift with increase in x from 5 to 25.
