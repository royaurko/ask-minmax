A summary critique is presented of the topics discussed at a workshop
entitled ``Probing the Physics of Active Galactic Nuclei by Multi-wavelength
Monitoring'' held at Goddard Space Flight Center 21-23 June 2000. Particular
emphasis is placed on the larger astronomical context of research on active
galactic nuclei. An important goal is to use multi-wavelength monitoring to
produce ``engineering drawings'' of how gas flows in the vicinity of a black
hole, as well is in the associated accretion disk inflows and jet outflows.
Some of the clear choices that have to be made before formulating a model of a
particular class of source are outlined. Future observational possibilities are
briefly summarized.
