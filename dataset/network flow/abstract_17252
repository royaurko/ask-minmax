We consider a noncoherent wireless network, where the transmitters and
receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading coefficients, but are
ignorant of their realizations. We demonstrate that if the nodes do not
cooperate, if they transmit symbols that all follow the same distribution, and
if the variances of the fading coefficients decay exponentially or more slowly,
then the channel capacity is bounded in the SNR. This confirms a similar result
by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews.
