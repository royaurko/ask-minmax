The INFN (Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics) has approved a
national theoretical network on "Structure and Reactions with Exotic Nuclei".
The project involves the INFN branches of Laboratorio Nazionale del Sud, Padova
and Pisa. The aim of the project is to start coordinating and to homogenize the
research already performed in Italy in this field and to strengthen and improve
the Italian contribution on the international scenario. Furthermore it aims at
creating a solid theoretical structure to support future experimental
facilities at the INFN national laboratories such as SPES at LNL and EXCYT at
LNS. A review of present and future activities is presented.
