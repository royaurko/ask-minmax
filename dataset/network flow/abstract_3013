We consider a normalization of the Ricci flow on a closed Riemannian manifold
given by the evolution equation
$\partial_{t}g(t)=-2(Ric(g(t))-\frac{1}{2\tau}g(t))$ where $\tau$ is a fixed
positive number. Assuming that a solution for this equation exists for all
time, and that the full curvature tensor and the diameter of the manifold are
both uniformly bounded along the flow, we prove that up to the action of a
1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, the flow converges to a unique shrinking
gradient Ricci soliton using an idea of Sun and Wang to study the stability of
the K\"{a}ler Ricci flow near a K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric. This idea relies on
the monotonicity of the Ricci flow along Perelman's $\W$-functional and a
{\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality for the $\mu$-functional. Our result is an
extension of the main theorem in Sesum (2006), where convergence to a unique
soliton is proved assuming that the solution of the normalized Ricci flow in
consideration is sequentially convergent to a soliton which satisfies a certain
integrability condition.
