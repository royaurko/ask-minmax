The concept of physical-layer network coding (PNC) was proposed in 2006 for
application in wireless networks. Since then it has developed into a subfield
of network coding with wide followings. The basic idea of PNC is to exploit the
network coding operation that occurs naturally when electromagnetic (EM) waves
are superimposed on one another. This simple idea turns out to have profound
and fundamental ramifications. Subsequent works by various researchers have led
to many new results in the domains of 1) wireless communication; 2) wireless
information theory; and 3) wireless networking. The purpose of this paper is
fourfold. First, we give a brief tutorial on the basic concept of PNC. Second,
we survey and discuss recent key results in the three aforementioned areas.
Third, we examine a critical issue in PNC: synchronization. It has been a
common belief that PNC requires tight synchronization. Our recent results
suggest, however, that PNC may actually benefit from asynchrony. Fourth, we
propose that PNC is not just for wireless networks; it can also be useful in
optical networks. We provide an example showing that the throughput of a
passive optical network (PON) could potentially be raised by 100% with PNC.
