Plane-wave reflection and refraction at an interface with a double wire
medium is considered. The problem of additional boundary conditions (ABC) in
application to wire media is discussed and an ABC-free approach, known in the
solid state physics, is used. Expressions for the fields and Poynting vectors
of the refracted waves are derived. Directions and values of the power density
flow of the refracted waves are found and the conservation of the power flow
through the interface is checked. The difference between the results, given by
the conventional model of wire media and the model, properly taking into
account spatial dispersion, is discussed.
