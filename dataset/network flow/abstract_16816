In this paper, we consider a one-dimensional random geometric graph process
with the inter-nodal gaps evolving according to an exponential AR(1) process,
which may serve as a mobile wireless network model. The transition probability
matrix and stationary distribution are derived for the Markov chains in terms
of network connectivity and the number of components. We characterize an
algorithm for the hitting time regarding disconnectivity. In addition, we also
study topological properties for static snapshots. We obtain the degree
distributions as well as asymptotic precise bounds and strong law of large
numbers for connectivity threshold distance and the largest nearest neighbor
distance amongst others. Both closed form results and limit theorems are
provided.
