We consider network coding for networks experiencing worst-case bit-flip
errors, and argue that this is a reasonable model for highly dynamic wireless
network transmissions. We demonstrate that in this setup prior network
error-correcting schemes can be arbitrarily far from achieving the optimal
network throughput. We propose a new metric for errors under this model. Using
this metric, we prove a new Hamming-type upper bound on the network capacity.
We also show a commensurate lower bound based on GV-type codes that can be used
for error-correction. The codes used to attain the lower bound are non-coherent
(do not require prior knowledge of network topology). The end-to-end nature of
our design enables our codes to be overlaid on classical distributed random
linear network codes. Further, we free internal nodes from having to implement
potentially computationally intensive link-by-link error-correction.
