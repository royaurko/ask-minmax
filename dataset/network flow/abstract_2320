We study modular and integral flow polynomials of graphs by means of subgroup
arrangements and lattice polytopes. We introduce an Eulerian equivalence
relation on orientations, flow arrangements, and flow polytopes; and we apply
the theory of Ehrhart polynomials to obtain properties of modular and integral
flow polynomials. The emphasis is on the geometrical treatment through subgroup
arrangements and Ehrhart polynomials. Such viewpoint leads to a reciprocity law
for the modular flow polynomial, which gives rise to an interpretation on the
values of the modular flow polynomial at negative integers, and answers a
question by Beck and Zaslavsky.
