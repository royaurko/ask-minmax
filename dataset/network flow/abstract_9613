Device-to-device (D2D) communication enables the user equipments (UEs)
located in close proximity to bypass the cellular base stations (BSs) and
directly connect to each other, and thereby, offload traffic from the cellular
infrastructure. D2D communication can improve spatial frequency reuse and
energy efficiency in cellular networks. This paper presents a comprehensive and
tractable analytical framework for D2D-enabled uplink cellular networks with a
flexible mode selection scheme along with truncated channel inversion power
control. Different from the existing mode selection schemes where the decision
on mode selection is made based only on the D2D link distance (i.e., distance
between two UEs using D2D mode of communication), the proposed mode selection
scheme for a UE accounts for both the D2D link distance and cellular link
distance (i.e., distance between the UE and the BS). The developed framework is
used to analyze and understand how the underlaying D2D communication affects
the cellular network performance. Through comprehensive numerical analysis, we
investigate the expected performance gains and provide guidelines for selecting
the network parameters.
