There exists an injective, information-preserving function that maps a
semantic network (i.e a directed labeled network) to a directed network (i.e. a
directed unlabeled network). The edge label in the semantic network is
represented as a topological feature of the directed network. Also, there
exists an injective function that maps a directed network to an undirected
network (i.e. an undirected unlabeled network). The edge directionality in the
directed network is represented as a topological feature of the undirected
network. Through function composition, there exists an injective function that
maps a semantic network to an undirected network. Thus, aside from space
constraints, the semantic network construct does not have any modeling
functionality that is not possible with either a directed or undirected network
representation. Two proofs of this idea will be presented. The first is a proof
of the aforementioned function composition concept. The second is a simpler
proof involving an undirected binary encoding of a semantic network.
