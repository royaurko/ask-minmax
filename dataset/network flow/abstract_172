There has been interest in finding a general variational principle for
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We give evidence that Maximum Caliber
(Max Cal) is such a principle. Max Cal, a variant of Maximum Entropy, predicts
dynamical distribution functions by maximizing a path entropy subject to
dynamical constraints, such as average fluxes. We first show that Max Cal leads
to standard near-equilibrium results -including the Green-Kubo relations,
Onsager's reciprocal relations of coupled flows, and Prigogine's principle of
minimum entropy production -in a way that is particularly simple. More
importantly, because Max Cal does not require any notion of 'local
equilibrium', or any notion of entropy dissipation, or even any restriction to
material physics, it is more general than many traditional approaches. We
develop some generalizations of the Onsager and Prigogine results that apply
arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Max Cal is not limited to materials and
fluids; it also applies, for example, to flows and trafficking on networks more
broadly.
