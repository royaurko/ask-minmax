The concept of a temporal phylogenetic network is a mathematical model of
evolution of a family of natural languages. It takes into account the fact that
languages can trade their characteristics with each other when linguistic
communities are in contact, and also that a contact is only possible when the
languages are spoken at the same time. We show how computational methods of
answer set programming and constraint logic programming can be used to generate
plausible conjectures about contacts between prehistoric linguistic
communities, and illustrate our approach by applying it to the evolutionary
history of Indo-European languages.
