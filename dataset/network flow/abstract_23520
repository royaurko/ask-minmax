We have shortly reviewed the occurrence of the post-synaptic potentials
between neurons, the relation between EEG and neuron dynamics, as well as
methods of signal analysis. We supposed a simple stochastic model representing
electrical activity of neuronal systems. The model is constructed using the
Monte Carlo simulation technique. The results yielded EEG-like signals with
their phase portraits in three-dimensional space. The Lyapunov exponent was
positive, indicating a chaotic behavior. The correlation dimension of the
EEG-like signals was found to be .92, which was smaller than those reported by
others. It was concluded that this neuron model may provide valuable clues
about the dynamic behavior of neural systems.
