The object of this paper is to study the influence of dispersed micrometer
size particles on turbulent heat transfer mechanisms in wall-bounded flows. The
strategic target of the current research is to set up a methodology to size and
design new-concept heat transfer fluids with properties given by those of the
base fluid modulated by the presence of dynamically-interacting,
suitably-chosen, discrete micro- and nano- particles. We run Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) for hydrodynamically fully-developed, thermally-developing
turbulent channel flow at shear Reynolds number Re=150 and Prandtl number Pr=3,
and we tracked two large swarms of particles, characterized by different
inertia and thermal inertia. Preliminary results on velocity and temperature
statistics for both phases show that, with respect to single-phase flow, heat
transfer fluxes at the walls increase by roughly 2% when the flow is laden with
the smaller particles, which exhibit a rather persistent stability against
non-homogeneous distribution and near-wall concentration. An opposite trend
(slight heat transfer flux decrease) is observed when the larger particles are
dispersed into the flow. These results are consistent with previous
experimental findings and are discussed in the frame of the current research
activities in the field. Future developments are also outlined.
