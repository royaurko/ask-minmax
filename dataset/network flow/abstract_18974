In this paper, a nonlinear system aiming at reducing the signal transmission
rate in a networked control system is constructed by adding nonlinear
constraints to a linear feedback control system. Its stability is investigated
in detail. It turns out that this nonlinear system exhibits very interesting
dynamical behaviors: in addition to local stability, its trajectories may
converge to a non-origin equilibrium or be periodic or just be oscillatory.
Furthermore it exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions --- a sign
of chaos. Complicated bifurcation phenomena are exhibited by this system. After
that, control of the chaotic system is discussed. All these are studied under
scalar cases in detail. Some difficulties involved in the study of this type of
systems are analyzed. Finally an example is employed to reveal the
effectiveness of the scheme in the framework of networked control systems.
