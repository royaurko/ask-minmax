We analyze a solar active region observed by the Hinode CaII H line using the
time-distance helioseismology technique, and infer wave-speed perturbation
structures and flow fields beneath the active region with a high spatial
resolution. The general subsurface wave-speed structure is similar to the
previous results obtained from SOHO/MDI observations. The general subsurface
flow structure is also similar, and the downward flows beneath the sunspot and
the mass circulations around the sunspot are clearly resolved. Below the
sunspot, some organized divergent flow cells are observed, and these structures
may indicate the existence of mesoscale convective motions. Near the light
bridge inside the sunspot, hotter plasma is found beneath, and flows divergent
from this area are observed. The Hinode data also allow us to investigate
potential uncertainties caused by the use of phase-speed filter for short
travel distances. Comparing the measurements with and without the phase-speed
filtering, we find out that inside the sunspot, mean acoustic travel times are
in basic agreement, but the values are underestimated by a factor of 20-40%
inside the sunspot umbra for measurements with the filtering. The initial
acoustic tomography results from Hinode show a great potential of using
high-resolution observations for probing the internal structure and dynamics of
sunspots.
