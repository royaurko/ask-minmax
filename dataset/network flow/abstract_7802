We present a light formalism for proofs that encodes their inferential
structure, along with a system that transforms these representations into
flow-chart diagrams. Such diagrams should improve the comprehensibility of
proofs. We discuss language syntax, diagram semantics, and our goal of building
a repository of diagrammatic representations of proofs from canonical
mathematical literature. The repository will be available online in the form of
a wiki at proofflow.org, where the flow chart drawing software will be
deployable through the wiki editor. We also consider the possibility of a
semantic tagging of the assertions in a proof, to permit data mining.
