The effect of disorder is investigated in granular superconductive materials
with strong and weak links. The transition is controlled by the interplay of
the \emph{tunneling} $g$ and \emph{intragrain} $g_{intr}$ conductances, which
depend on the strength of the intergrain coupling. For $g \ll g_{intr}$, the
transition involves first the grain boundary, while for $g \sim g_{intr}$ the
transition occurs into the whole grain. The different intergrain coupling is
considered by modelling the superconducting material as a disordered network of
Josephson junctions. Numerical simulations show that on increasing the
disorder, the resistive transition occurs for lower temperatures and the curve
broadens. These features are enhanced in disordered superconductors with strong
links. The different behaviour is further checked by estimating the average
network resistance for weak and strong links in the framework of the effective
medium approximation theory. These results may be relevant to shed light on
long standing puzzles as: (i) enhancement of the superconducting transition
temperature of many metals in the granular states; (ii) suppression of
superconductivity in homogeneously disordered films compared to standard
granular systems close to the metal-insulator transition; (iii) enhanced
degradation of superconductivity by doping and impurities in strongly linked
materials, such as magnesium diboride, compared to weakly-linked
superconductors, such as cuprates.
