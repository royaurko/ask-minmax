Clustering techniques create hierarchal network structures, called clusters,
on an otherwise flat network. In a dynamic environment-in terms of node
mobility as well as in terms of steadily changing device parameters-the
clusterhead election process has to be re-invoked according to a suitable
update policy. Cluster re-organization causes additional message exchanges and
computational complexity and it execution has to be optimized. Our
investigations focus on the problem of minimizing clusterhead re-elections by
considering stability criteria. These criteria are based on topological
characteristics as well as on device parameters. This paper presents a weighted
clustering algorithm optimized to avoid needless clusterhead re-elections for
stable clusters in mobile ad-hoc networks. The proposed localized algorithm
deals with mobility, but does not require geographical, speed or distances
information.
