For the verification and validation of microscopic simulation models of
pedestrian flow, we have performed experiments for different kind of facilities
and sites where most conflicts and congestion happens e.g. corridors, narrow
passages, and crosswalks. The validity of the model should compare the
experimental conditions and simulation results with video recording carried out
in the same condition like in real life e.g. pedestrian flux and density
distributions. The strategy in this technique is to achieve a certain amount of
accuracy required in the simulation model. This method is good at detecting the
critical points in the pedestrians walking areas. For the calibration of
suitable models we use the results obtained from analyzing the video recordings
in Hajj 2009 and these results can be used to check the design sections of
pedestrian facilities and exits. As practical examples, we present the
simulation of pilgrim streams on the Jamarat bridge.
  The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to show through verification
and validation that simulation tools can be used to reproduce realistic
scenarios, and second, gather data for accurate predictions for designers and
decision makers.
