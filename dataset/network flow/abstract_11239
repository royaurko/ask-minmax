We study how the volatility, node- or link-based, affects the evolution of
social networks in simple models. The model describes the competition between
order -- promoted by the efforts of agents to coordinate -- and disorder
induced by volatility in the underlying social network. We find that when
volatility affects mostly the decay of links, the model exhibit a sharp
transition between an ordered phase with a dense network and a disordered phase
with a sparse network. When volatility is mostly node-based, instead, only the
symmetric (disordered) phase exists These two regimes are separated by a second
order phase transition of unusual type, characterized by an order parameter
critical exponent $\beta=0^+$. We argue that node volatility has the same
effect in a broader class of models, and provide numerical evidence in this
direction.
