We propose to interpret the stellar IMF as a property of the turbulence in
the star--forming gas. Gravitationally unstable density enhancements in the
turbulent flow collapse and form stars. Their mass distribution can be derived
analytically from the power spectrum of the turbulent flow and the isothermal
shock jump conditions in the magnetized gas. For a power spectrum index
\beta=1.74, consistent with Larson's velocity dispersion--size relation as well
as with new numerical and analytic results on supersonic turbulence, we obtain
a power law mass distribution of dense cores with a slope equal to
3/(4-\beta)=1.33, consistent with the slope of Salpeter's stellar IMF. Below
one solar mass, the mass distribution flattens and turns around at a fraction
of a solar mass, as observed for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar
clusters, because only the densest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass
distribution at low masses is determined by the Log--Normal distribution of the
gas density. The intermittent nature of this distribution is responsible for
the generation of a significant number of collapsing cores of brown dwarf mass.
