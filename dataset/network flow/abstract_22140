We present a new method to transform an expanded class of non-selfadjoint
advection-diffusion operators into self-adjoint operators. The transform is
based on a combination of a point transform and Lie transform in conjunction
with an asymptotic expansion in terms of the diffusivity. We illustrate the
method in the context of simple shear flow where the expansion is exact and all
transformation steps can be performed explicitly.
