A model of the identification of information tonality, based on Bayesian
approach and neural networks was described. In the context of this paper
tonality means positive or negative tone of both the whole information and its
parts which are related to particular concepts. The method, its application is
presented in the paper, is based on statistic regularities connected with the
presence of definite lexemes in the texts. A distinctive feature of the method
is its simplicity and versatility. At present ideologically similar approaches
are widely used to control spam.
