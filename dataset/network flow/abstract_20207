Bug localization in object oriented program ha s always been an important
issue in softeware engineering. In this paper, I propose a source level bug
localization technique for object oriented embedded programs. My proposed
technique, presents the idea of debugging an object oriented program in class
level, incorporating the object state information into the Class Dependence
Graph (ClDG). Given a program (having buggy statement) and an input that fails
and others pass, my approach uses concrete as well as symbolic execution to
synthesize the passing inputs that marginally from the failing input in their
control flow behavior. A comparison of the execution traces of the failing
input and the passing input provides necessary clues to the root-cause of the
failure. A state trace difference, regarding the respective nodes of the ClDG
is obtained, which leads to detect the bug in the program.
