The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) succesfully simulates drainage and shear in
foams. Here we use the CPM to investigate instabilities due to the flow of a
single large bubble in a dry, monodisperse two-dimensional flowing foam. As in
experiments in a Hele-Shaw cell, above a threshold velocity the large bubble
moves faster than the mean flow. Our simulations reproduce analytical and
experimental predictions for the velocity threshold and the relative velocity
of the large bubble, demonstrating the utility of the CPM in foam rheology
studies.
