In this paper, we present a nano-quantum photonic model for justification of
normal dispersion in a thin crystal film of NPP. In this method, we assume a
laser beam consists of a flow of energetic particles. By precise analyzing of
photon interaction with pi-electron system of benzene ring in NPP crystal, we
will attain refractive index (RI) in any wavelength and compare the results
with experimental data.
