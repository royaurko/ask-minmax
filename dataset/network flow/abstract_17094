This paper presents comparison of different hierarchical (position and
non-position based) protocols with respect to different mobility models.
Previous work mainly focuses on static networks or at most a single mobility
model. Using only one mobility model may not predict the behavior of routing
protocol accurately. Simulation results show that mobility has large impact on
the behavior of WSN routing protocols. Also, position based routing protocols
performs better in terms of packet delivery compared to non position based
routing protocols.
