We consider a calculus for multiparty sessions enriched with security levels
for messages. We propose a monitored semantics for this calculus, which blocks
the execution of processes as soon as they attempt to leak information. We
illustrate the use of our monitored semantics with various examples, and show
that the induced safety property implies a noninterference property studied
previously.
