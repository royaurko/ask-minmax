Controlling and analyzing cyberphysical and robotics systems is increasingly
becoming a Big Data challenge. Pushing this data to, and processing in the
cloud is more efficient than on-board processing. However, current cloud-based
solutions are not suitable for the latency requirements of these applications.
We present a new concept, Discretized Streams or D-Streams, that enables
massively scalable computations on streaming data with latencies as short as a
second.
  We experiment with an implementation of D-Streams on top of the Spark
computing framework. We demonstrate the usefulness of this concept with a novel
algorithm to estimate vehicular traffic in urban networks. Our online EM
algorithm can estimate traffic on a very large city network (the San Francisco
Bay Area) by processing tens of thousands of observations per second, with a
latency of a few seconds.
