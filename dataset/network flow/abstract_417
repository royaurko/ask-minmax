Understanding network flows such as commuter traffic in large transportation
networks is an ongoing challenge due to the complex nature of the
transportation infrastructure and of human mobility. Here we show a
first-principles based method for traffic prediction using a cost based
generalization of the radiation model for human mobility, coupled with a
cost-minimizing algorithm for efficient distribution of the mobility fluxes
through the network. Using US census and highway traffic data we show that
traffic can efficiently and accurately be computed from a range-limited,
network betweenness type calculation. The model based on travel time costs
captures the lognormal distribution of the traffic and attains a high Pearson
correlation coefficient (0.75) when compared to real traffic. Due to its
principled nature, this method can inform many applications related to human
mobility driven flows in spatial networks, ranging from transportation, through
urban planning to mitigation of the effects of catastrophic events.
