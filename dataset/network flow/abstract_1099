We have measured the average radial (cell center to network boundary) profile
of the continuum intensity contrast associated with supergranular flows using
data from the Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (PSPT) at the Mauna Loa
Solar Observatory (MLSO). After removing the contribution of the network flux
elements by the application of masks based on Ca II K intensity and averaging
over more than 10^5 supergranular cells, we find a ~ 0.1% decrease in red and
blue continuum intensity from the supergranular cell centers outward,
corresponding to a ~ 1.0 K decrease in brightness temperature across the cells.
The radial intensity profile may be caused either by the thermal signal
associated with the supergranular flows or a variation in the packing density
of unresolved magnetic flux elements. These are not unambiguously distinguished
by the observations, and we raise the possibility that the network magnetic
fields play an active role in supergranular scale selection by enhancing the
radiative cooling of the deep photosphere at the cell boundaries.
