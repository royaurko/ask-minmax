We investigate the influence of weak disorder on the fluctuation driven first
order transition found in a p-wave superconductor. The flow equations for the
disorder averaged effective theory is derived in an $4-\epsilon$ expansion. The
fixed point structure of these flow equations and their stability is discussed.
