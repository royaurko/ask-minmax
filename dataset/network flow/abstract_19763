A new scale-dependent dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) model based on Kolmogorov's
scaling hypothesis is presented. This SGS model is utilized in large-eddy
simulation of a well-known case study on shear-driven neutral atmospheric
boundary layer flows. The results are compared comprehensively with an
alternate scale-dependent dynamic SGS model based on the popular Smagorinsky
closure. Our results show that, in the context of this particular problem, the
scale-dependent dynamic modeling approach is extremely useful, and reproduces
several establised results (e.g., the surface layer similarity theory) with
fidelity. Results from both the SGS base models are generally in close
agreement, although we find a consistent superiority of the Smagorinsky-based
SGS model for predicting the inertial range scaling of spectra.
