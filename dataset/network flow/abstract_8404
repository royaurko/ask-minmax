Lattices are important as models for the node locations in wireless networks
for two main reasons: (1) When network designers have control over the
placement of the nodes, they often prefer a regular arrangement in a lattice
for coverage and interference reasons. (2) If nodes are randomly distributed or
mobile, good channel access schemes ensure that concurrent transmitters are
regularly spaced, hence the locations of the transmitting nodes are well
approximated by a lattice. In this paper, we introduce general interference
bounding techniques that permit the derivation of tight closed-form upper and
lower bounds for all lattice networks, and we present and analyze optimum or
near-optimum channel access schemes for one-dimensional, square, and triangular
lattices.
