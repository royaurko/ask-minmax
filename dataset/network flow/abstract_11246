Many real life networks present an average path length logarithmic with the
number of nodes and a degree distribution which follows a power law. Often
these networks have also a modular and self-similar structure and, in some
cases - usually associated with topological restrictions- their clustering is
low and they are almost planar. In this paper we introduce a family of graphs
which share all these properties and are defined by two parameters. As their
construction is deterministic, we obtain exact analytic expressions for
relevant properties of the graphs including the degree distribution, degree
correlation, diameter, and average distance, as a function of the two defining
parameters. Thus, the graphs are useful to model some complex networks, in
particular technological and biological networks.
