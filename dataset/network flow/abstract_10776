We carry out a time dependent numerical simulation where both the
hydrodynamics and the radiative transfer are coupled together. We consider a
two-component accretion flow in which the Keplerian disk is immersed inside an
accreting low angular momentum flow (halo) around a black hole. The injected
soft photons from the Keplerian disk are reprocessed by the electrons in the
halo. We show that in presence of an axisymmetric soft-photon source, the
spherically symmetric Bondi flow losses its symmetry and becomes axisymmetric.
The low angular momentum flow was observed to slow down close to the axis and
formed a centrifugal barrier which added new features into the spectrum. Using
the Monte Carlo method, we generated the radiated spectra as functions of the
accretion rates. We find that the transitions from a hard state to a soft state
is determined by the mass accretion rates of the disk and the halo. We separate
out the signature of the bulk motion Comptonization and discuss its
significance. We study how the net spectrum is contributed by photons suffering
different number of scatterings and spending different amounts of time inside
the Compton cloud. We study the directional dependence of the emitted spectrum
as well.
