Pion propagation in a hadronic fluid with a non-homogeneous relativistic flow
is studied in terms of the linear sigma model. The wave equation turns out to
be equivalent to the equation of motion for a massless scalar field propagating
in a curved spacetime geometry. The metric tensor depends locally on the soft
pion dispersion relation and the four-velocity of the fluid. For a relativistic
flow in curved spacetime the apparent and trapping horizons may be defined in
the same way as in general relativity. An expression for the analog surface
gravity is derived.
