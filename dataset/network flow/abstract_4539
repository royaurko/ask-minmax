Swarm stability is concerned for descriptor compartmental networks with
linear time-invariant protocol. Compartmental network is a specific type of
dynamical multi-agent system. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both
consensus and critical swarm stability are presented, which require a joint
matching between the interactive dynamics of nearest neighboring vertices and
the Laplacian spectrum of the overall network topology. Three numerical
instances are illustrated to verify the theoretical results.
