A rigorous method for introducing the variational principle describing
relativistic ideal hydrodynamic flows with all possible types of breaks
(including shocks) is presented in the framework of an exact Clebsch type
representation of the four-velocity field as a bilinear combination of the
scalar fields. The boundary conditions for these fields on the breaks are
found. We also discuss the local invariants caused by the symmetries of the
problem, including relabeling symmetry. In particular, the generalization of
the well-known nonrelativistic Ertel invariant is presented.
