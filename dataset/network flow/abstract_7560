The purpose of this paper is to discuss the relationship between commutative
and non-commutative integrability of Hamiltonian systems and to construct new
examples of integrable geodesic flows on Riemannian manifolds. In particular,
we prove that the geodesic flow of the bi-invariant metric on any bi-quotient
of a compact Lie group is integrable in non-commutative sense by means of
polynomial integrals, and therefore, in classical commutative sense by means of
$C^\infty$--smooth integrals.
