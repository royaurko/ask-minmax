We consider the problem of searching for a node on a labelled random graph
according to a greedy algorithm that selects a route to the desired node using
metric information on the graph. Motivated by peer-to-peer networks two types
of random graph are proposed with properties particularly amenable to this kind
of algorithm. We derive equations for the probability that the search is
successful and also study the number of hops required, finding both numerical
and analytic evidence of a transition as the number of links is varied.
