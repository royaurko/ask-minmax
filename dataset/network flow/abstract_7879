The time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation for a two-dimensional granular
shear flow is numerically solved, where we study both the transient dynamics
and the steady state of the order parameter. The structural changes of the
numerical solutions are qualitatively similar to the shear bands observed in
the discrete element method (DEM) simulation of the two-dimensional granular
shear flow.
