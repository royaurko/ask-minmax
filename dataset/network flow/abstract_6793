Evidence that the magnetic fields of extragalactic jets have a significant
fraction of their energy in a random component is briefly summarized, and a
detailed model of evolving, jet polarization structures is constructed, based
on this picture. The evolving magnetic field structure of an oblique shock
complex that forms in a relativistic jet simulation is explored by using
velocity data from the hydrodynamical simulation to advect an initially random
magnetic field distribution. Radiative transfer calculations reveal that
emission from a propagating region of magnetic field, `ordered' by the shock,
and lying approximately transverse to the flow direction, merges with that from
an evolving sheared region at the flow periphery. If such a flow were barely
resolved, observation would suggest evolution from a somewhat oblique, to a
more longitudinal, magnetic field structure with respect to the flow axis,
while higher resolution observations would infer a component following a
non-linear trajectory, and with a magnetic field orientation that rotates
during evolution. This result highlights the ambiguity in interpreting VLBP
data, and illustrates the importance of simulations in providing a framework
for proper interpretation of such data.
