We are briefly introducing the most important ingredients to study galactic
evolution. In particular the roles of star formation, nucleosynthesis and gas
flows. Then we are discussing the two different approaches to galactic
evolution: the stellar population approach (chemical evolution models) and the
hierarchical clustering scenario for galaxy formation. It is shown that there
are still some controversial points in the two approaches, as evident in the
brief summary of the discussion.
