We used 15 GHz VLBA observations of 366 sources having at least 5 epochs
within a time interval 1995-2013 from the MOJAVE program and/or its
predecessor, the 2 cm VLBA Survey. For each source we produced a corresponding
stacked image averaging all available epochs for a better reconstruction of the
cross section of the flow. We have analyzed jet profiles transverse to the
local jet ridge line and derived both apparent and intrinsic opening angles of
the parsec-scale outflows. The sources detected by the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT) during the first 24 months of operation show wider apparent jet
opening angle and smaller viewing angles on a very high level of significance
supporting our early findings. Analyzing transverse shapes of the outflows we
found that most sources have conical jet geometry at parsec scales, though
there are also sources that exhibit active jet collimation.
