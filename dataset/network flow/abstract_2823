Among the topological conjugacy classes of the continuous flows $\{\phi^t\}$
whose orbit foliations are the planar Reeb foliation, there is one class called
the standard Reeb flow. We show that $\{\phi^t\}$ is conjugate to the standard
Reeb flow if and only if $\{\phi^t\}$ is conjugate to $\{\phi^{\lambda t}\}$
for any $\lambda>0$.
