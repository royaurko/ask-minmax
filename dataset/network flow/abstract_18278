Traceroute is widely used: from the diagnosis of network problems to the
assemblage of internet maps. Unfortu- nately, there are a number of problems
with traceroute methodology, which lead to the inference of erroneous routes.
This paper studies particular structures arising in nearly all traceroute
measurements. We characterize them as "loops", "cycles", and "diamonds". We
iden- tify load balancing as a possible cause for the appear- ance of false
loops, cycles and diamonds, i.e., artifacts that do not represent the internet
topology. We pro- vide a new publicly-available traceroute, called Paris
traceroute, which, by controlling the packet header con- tents, provides a
truer picture of the actual routes that packets follow. We performed
measurements, from the perspective of a single source tracing towards multiple
destinations, and Paris traceroute allowed us to show that many of the
particular structures we observe are indeed traceroute measurement artifacts.
