Many online networks are not fully known and are often studied via sampling.
Random Walk (RW) based techniques are the current state-of-the-art for
estimating nodal attributes and local graph properties, but estimating global
properties remains a challenge. In this paper, we are interested in a
fundamental property of this type - the graph size N, i.e., the number of its
nodes. Existing methods for estimating N are (i) inefficient and (ii) cannot be
easily used with RW sampling due to dependence between successive samples. In
this paper, we address both problems. First, we propose IE (Induced Edges), an
efficient technique for estimating N from an independence sample of graph's
nodes. IE exploits the edges induced on the sampled nodes. Second, we introduce
SafetyMargin, a method that corrects estimators for dependence in RW samples.
Finally, we combine these two stand-alone techniques to obtain a RW-based graph
size estimator. We evaluate our approach in simulations on a wide range of
real-life topologies, and on several samples of Facebook. IE with SafetyMargin
typically requires at least 10 times fewer samples than the state-of-the-art
techniques (over 100 times in the case of Facebook) for the same estimation
error.
