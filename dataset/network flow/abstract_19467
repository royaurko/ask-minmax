The large deformations and break up of circular 2D liquid patches in a high
Reynolds number (Re=1000) gas flow are investigated numerically. The 2D, plane
flow Navier--Stokes equations are directly solved with explicit tracking of the
interface between the two phases and a new algorithm for surface tension. The
numerical method is able to pursue the simulation beyond the breaking or
coalescence of droplets. The simulations are able to unveil the intriguing
details of the non-linear interplay between the deforming droplets and the
vortical structures in the droplet's wake.
