In spite of the extensive previous efforts on traffic dynamics and epidemic
spreading in complex networks, the problem of traffic-driven epidemic spreading
on {\em correlated} networks has not been addressed. Interestingly, we find
that the epidemic threshold, a fundamental quantity underlying the spreading
dynamics, exhibits a non-monotonic behavior in that it can be minimized for
some critical value of the assortativity coefficient, a parameter
characterizing the network correlation. To understand this phenomenon, we use
the degree-based mean-field theory to calculate the traffic-driven epidemic
threshold for correlated networks. The theory predicts that the threshold is
inversely proportional to the packet-generation rate and the largest eigenvalue
of the betweenness matrix. We obtain consistency between theory and numerics.
Our results may provide insights into the important problem of
controlling/harnessing real-world epidemic spreading dynamics driven by traffic
flows.
