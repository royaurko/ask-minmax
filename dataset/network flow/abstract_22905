We present the irregular matrix model which has contains $\mathcal{W}_3$ and
Virasoro symmetry. The irregular matrix model is obtained using the colliding
limit of the Toda field theories and produces the inner product between
irregular modules of $\mathcal{W}_3$ symmetry. We evaluate the partition
function using the flow equation which is the realization of the Virasoro and
$\mathcal{W}$-symmetry.
