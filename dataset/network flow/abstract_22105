The Josephson current through a long s-wave superconductor/weak
ferromagnet/s-wave superconductor weak link is studied theoretically in the
regime of nonequilibrium spin-dependent occupation of electron states in the
ferromagnetic intelayer. While under the considered nonequilibrium condition
the standard supercurrent, carried by the singlet part of current-carrying
density of states, is not modified, the additional supercurrent flowing via the
triplet part of the current-carrying density of states appears. Depending on
voltage, controlling the particular form of spin-dependent nonequilibrium in
the interlayer, this additional current can enhance or reduce the usual current
of the singlet component and also switch the junction between 0- and
$\pi$-states.
