This paper introduces an efficient, non-linear image adaptive filtering as a
generalization of the standard spatial convolution of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). We build on the bilateral filtering operation, a commonly used
edge-aware image processing technique. Our implementation of bilateral filters
uses specialized data structures, and in this paper we demonstrate how these
lead to generalizations and make the filters amendable to learning. This
development enriches the convolutional operation found in CNNs, which becomes
image adaptive, can process sparse input data, and produce continuous output.
Our result also generalizes a class of densely connected graphical models with
tractable mean field inference. It has previously been shown that mean field
approximations in the subclass of models with Gaussian edge potentials reduce
to a bilateral filtering operation. Here, we generalize this to the
non-Gaussian case and allow highly parameterized potential functions. A diverse
set of experiments validates the empirical performance and highlights the
different aspects of the proposed operation.
