We review the broad band properties of X-ray detected hotspots in radio
galaxies and quasars. We show that their collective properties can be unified
in a framework involving frequency dependent relativistic beaming and varying
orientations to the observer's line of sight. The simplest dynamic model
consistent with this picture is a slowing-down relativistic flow downstream
from the hotspot shock, suggesting that the jet flow remains relativistic to
the hotspot distances.
