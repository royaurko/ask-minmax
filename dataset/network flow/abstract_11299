In this study we analyze the dynamics of the contact list evolution of
millions of users of the Skype communication network. We find that egocentric
networks evolve heterogeneously in time as events of edge additions and
deletions of individuals are grouped in long bursty clusters, which are
separated by long inactive periods. We classify users by their link creation
dynamics and show that bursty peaks of contact additions are likely to appear
shortly after user account creation. We also study possible relations between
bursty contact addition activity and other user-initiated actions like free and
paid service adoption events. We show that bursts of contact additions are
associated with increases in activity and adoption - an observation that can
inform the design of targeted marketing tactics.
