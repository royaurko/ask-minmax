In this paper, we study flows associated to Sobolev vector fields with
subexponentially integrable divergence. Our approach is based on the transport
equation following DiPerna-Lions [DPL89]. A key ingredient is to use a
quantitative estimate of solutions to the Cauchy problem of transport equation
to obtain the regularity of density functions.
