Logical formalisms such as first-order logic (FO) and fixpoint logic (FP) are
well suited to express in a declarative manner fundamental graph
functionalities required in distributed systems. We show that these logics
constitute good abstractions for programming distributed systems as a whole,
since they can be evaluated in a fully distributed manner with reasonable
complexity upper-bounds. We first prove that FO and FP can be evaluated with a
polynomial number of messages of logarithmic size. We then show that the
(global) logical formulas can be translated into rule programs describing the
local behavior of the nodes of the distributed system, which compute equivalent
results. Finally, we introduce local fragments of these logics, which preserve
as much as possible the locality of their distributed computation, while
offering a rich expressive power for networking functionalities. We prove that
they admit tighter upper-bounds with bounded number of messages of bounded
size. Finally, we show that the semantics and the complexity of the local
fragments are preserved over locally consistent networks as well as anonymous
networks, thus showing the robustness of the proposed local logical formalisms.
