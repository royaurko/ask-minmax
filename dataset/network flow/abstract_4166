We investigate the Chern-Ricci flow, an evolution equation of Hermitian
metrics, on Inoue surfaces. These are non-Kahler compact complex surfaces of
type Class VII. We show that, after an initial conformal change, the flow
always collapses the Inoue surface to a circle at infinite time, in the sense
of Gromov-Hausdorff.
