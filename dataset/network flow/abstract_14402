We consider magnetic geodesic flows of the normal metrics on a class of
homogeneous spaces, in particular (co)adjoint orbits of compact Lie groups. We
give the proof of the non-commutative integrability of flows and show, in
addition, for the case of (co)adjoint orbits, the usual Liouville integrability
by means of analytic integrals. We also consider the potential systems on
adjoint orbits, which are generalizations of the magnetic spherical pendulum.
The complete integrability of such system is proved for an arbitrary adjoint
orbit of a compact semisimple Lie group.
