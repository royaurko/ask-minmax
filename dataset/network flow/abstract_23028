Light nuclei can be produced in the central reaction zone via coalescence in
relativistic heavy ion collisions. E864 at BNL has measured the production of
ten stable light nuclei with nuclear number of A=1 to A=7 at rapidity
$y\simeq1.9$ and $p_{T}/A\leq300MeV/c$. Data were taken with a Au beam of
momentum of 11.5 A $GeV/c$ on a Pb or Pt target with different experimental
settings. The invariant yields show a striking exponential dependence on
nuclear number over ten orders of magnitudes with a penalty factor of about 50
per additional nucleon. This penalty factor is used to estimate the strange
quark matter (strangelet) production in the baryon rich and strangeness
enhanced environment. The measurements of the production of antiproton,
antideuteron, hypernuclei ($^{3}_{\Lambda}H$,$^{4}_{\Lambda}H$), and strongly
unstable nuclear states ($^{4}H$,$^{5}Li$, $^{5}Li^{*}$, $^{5}He$) are
presented as well. A model of local thermal equilibrium with radial flow at the
kinetic freeze-out with a temperature of $T=112\pm10MeV$, chemical potential of
$\mu_{B}=503\pm20MeV$ and flow velocity of about
$\sqrt{V_{\perp}^{2}}\simeq0.5c$ seems to be able to describe the data in the
gross scale with the exceptions of the production of antihyperons and
hypernuclei. The large antihyperon production and the extra penalty for
hypernuclei production are quite surprising.
