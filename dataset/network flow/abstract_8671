Virtualization enables the building of multiple virtual networks over a
shared substrate. One of the challenges to virtualisation is efficient resource
allocation. This problem has been found to be NP hard. Therefore, most
approaches to it have not only proposed static solutions, but have also made
many assumptions to simplify it. In this paper, we propose a distributed,
autonomic and artificial intelligence based solution to resource allocation.
Our aim is to obtain self-configuring, selfoptimizing, self-healing and context
aware virtual networks
