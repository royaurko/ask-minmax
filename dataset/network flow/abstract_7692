In this paper, we first discuss the regular level set of a nonsingular Smale
flow (NSF) on a 3-manifold. The main result about this topic is that a
3-manifold $M$ admits an NSF flow which has a regular level set homeomorphic to
$(n+1)T^{2}$ $(n\in \mathbb{Z}, n\geq 0)$ if and only if $M=M'\sharp n
S^{1}\times S^{2}$. Then we discuss how to realize a template as a basic set of
an NSF on a 3-manifold. We focus on the connection between the genus of the
template $T$ and the topological structure of the realizing 3-manifold $M$.
