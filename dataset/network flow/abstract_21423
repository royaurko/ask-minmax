Four quiescent elliptical galaxies were imaged with the NRAO VLA at 8.5 GHz.
Within the context of canonical advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs),
these VLA images plus published black hole masses constrain the accretion rates
to be $ <1.6\times10^{-4}$, $ <3.6\times10^{-4}$, $\le7.8\times10^{-4}$, and
$\le7.4\times10^{-4}$ of the Eddington rates. These ADAF accretion rates
derived at 8.5 GHz have important implications for the levels of soft and hard
X-rays expected from these quiescent galaxies.
