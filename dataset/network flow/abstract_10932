It is the purpose of the present article to show that so-called network
models, originally designed to describe static properties of disordered
electronic systems, can be easily generalized to quantum-{\em dynamical}
models, which then allow for an investigation of dynamical and spectral
aspects. This concept is exemplified by the Chalker-Coddington model for the
Quantum Hall effect and a three-dimensional generalization of it. We simulate
phase coherent diffusion of wave packets and consider spatial and spectral
correlations of network eigenstates as well as the distribution of
(quasi-)energy levels. Apart from that it is demonstrated how network models
can be used to determine two-point conductances. Our numerical calculations for
the three-dimensional model at the Metal-Insulator transition point delivers
among others an anomalous diffusion exponent of $\eta = 3 - D_2 = 1.7 \pm 0.1$.
The methods presented here in detail have been used partially in earlier work.
