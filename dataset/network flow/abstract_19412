We present high resolution (0.''12 x 0.''079) observations of the
ultracompact HII region G10.6-0.4 in 23 GHz radio continuum and the NH3(3,3)
line. Our data show that the infall in the molecular material is largely
spherical, and does not flatten into a molecular disk at radii as small as 0.03
pc. The spherical infall in the molecular gas matches in location and velocity
the infall seen in the ionized gas. We use a non-detection to place a stringent
upper limit on the mass of an expanding molecular shell associated with
pressure driven expansion of the HII region. These data support a scenario in
which the molecular accretion flow passes through an ionization front and
becomes an ionized accretion flow onto one or more main sequence stars, not the
classical pressure-driven expansion scenario. In the continuum emission we see
evidence for externally ionized clumps of molecular gas, and cavities evacuated
by an outflow from the central source.
