The bang-bang optimal control method was proposed for glow discharge plasma
actuators, taking account of practical issues, such as limited actuation states
with instantaneously varied aerodynamic control performance. Hence, the main
contribution of this Note is to integrate flight control with active flow
control in particular for plasma actuators. Flow control effects were examined
in wind tunnel experiments, which show that the plasma contributority for flow
control is limited. Flow control effects are only obvious at pitch angles near
stall. However, flight control simulations suggest that even those small
plasma-induced roll moments can satisfactorily fulfill the maneuver tasks and
meet flight quality specifications. In addition, the disturbance from volatile
plasma-induced roll moments can be rejected. Hence, the proposed bang-bang
control method is a promising candidate of control design methodology for
plasma actuators.
