Swimming microorganisms create flows that influence their mutual interactions
and modify the rheology of their suspensions. While extensively studied
theoretically, these flows have not been measured in detail around any
freely-swimming microorganism. We report such measurements for the microphytes
Volvox carteri and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The minute ~0.3% density excess
of V. carteri over water leads to a strongly dominant Stokeslet contribution,
with the widely-assumed stresslet flow only a correction to the subleading
source dipole term. This implies that suspensions of V. carteri have features
similar to suspensions of sedimenting particles. The flow in the region around
C. reinhardtii where significant hydrodynamic interaction is likely to occur
differs qualitatively from a "puller" stresslet, and can be described by a
simple three-Stokeslet model.
