We show that in a rapidly mixing flow with an invariant measure, the time
which is needed to hit a given section is related to a sort of conditional
dimension of the measure at the section. The result is applied to the geodesic
flow of compact variable negative sectional curvature manifolds, establishing a
logarithm law for such kind of flow.
