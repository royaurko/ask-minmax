The paper studies empirically the time-space trade-off between sampling and
inference in a sl cutset sampling algorithm. The algorithm samples over a
subset of nodes in a Bayesian network and applies exact inference over the
rest. Consequently, while the size of the sampling space decreases, requiring
less samples for convergence, the time for generating each single sample
increases. The w-cutset sampling selects a sampling set such that the
induced-width of the network when the sampling set is observed is bounded by w,
thus requiring inference whose complexity is exponential in w. In this paper,
we investigate performance of w-cutset sampling over a range of w values and
measure the accuracy of w-cutset sampling as a function of w. Our experiments
demonstrate that the cutset sampling idea is quite powerful showing that an
optimal balance between inference and sampling benefits substantially from
restricting the cutset size, even at the cost of more complex inference.
