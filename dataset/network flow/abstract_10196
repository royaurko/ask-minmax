We study both experimentally and numerically the steady zonal flow generated
by longitudinal librations of a spherical rotating container. This study
follows the recent weakly nonlinear analysis of Busse (2010), developed in the
limit of small libration frequency - rotation rate ratio, and large libration
frequency - spin-up time product. Using PIV measurements as well as results
from axisymmetric numerical simulations, we confirm quantitatively the main
features of Busse's analytical solution: the zonal flow takes the form of a
retrograde solid body rotation in the fluid interior, which does not depend on
the libration frequency nor on the Ekman number, and which varies as the square
of the amplitude of excitation. We also report the presence of an unpredicted
prograde flow at the equator near the outer wall.
