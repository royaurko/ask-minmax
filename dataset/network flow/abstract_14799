We investigate the influence of fluid flows on the propagation of chemical
fronts arising in FKPP type models. We develop an asymptotic theory for the
front speed in a cellular flow in the limit of small molecular diffusivity and
fast reaction, i.e., large P\'eclet ($Pe$) and Damk\"ohler ($Da$) numbers. The
front speed is expressed in terms of a periodic path -- an instanton -- that
minimizes a certain functional. This leads to an efficient procedure to
calculate the front speed, and to closed-form expressions for $(\log
Pe)^{-1}\ll Da\ll Pe$ and for $Da\gg Pe$. Our theoretical predictions are
compared with (i) numerical solutions of an eigenvalue problem and (ii)
simulations of the advection--diffusion--reaction equation.
