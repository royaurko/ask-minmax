Recent empirical work [Leskovec2009] has suggested the existence of a size
threshold for the existence of clusters within many real-world networks. We
give the first proof that this clustering size threshold exists within a
real-world random network model, and determine the asymptotic value at which it
occurs.
  More precisely, we choose the Community Guided Attachment (CGA) random
network model of Leskovek, Kleinberg, and Faloutsos [Leskovec2005]. The model
is non-uniform and contains self-similar communities, and has been shown to
have many properties of real-world networks. To capture the notion of
clustering, we follow Mishra et. al. [Mishra2007], who defined a type of
clustering for real-world networks: an (\alpha,\beta)-cluster is a set that is
both internally dense (to the extent given by the parameter \beta), and
externally sparse (to the extent given by the parameter \alpha) . With this
definition of clustering, we show the existence of a size threshold of (\ln
n)^{1/2} for the existence of clusters in the CGA model. For all \epsilon>0,
a.a.s. clusters larger than (\ln n)^{1/2-\epsilon} exist, whereas a.a.s.
clusters larger than (\ln n)^{1/2+\epsilon} do not exist. Moreover, we show a
size bound on the existence of small, constant-size clusters.
