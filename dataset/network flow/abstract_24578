In the last years the vertex enumeration problem of polyhedra has seen a
revival in the study of metabolic networks, which increased the demand for
efficient vertex enumeration algorithms for high-dimensional polyhedra given by
inequalities. In this paper we apply the concept of branch-decomposition to the
vertex enumeration problem of polyhedra $P = \{x : Sx = b, x \geq 0\}$.
Therefore, we introduce the concept of $k$-module and show how it relates to
the separators of the linear matroid generated by the columns of $S$. This then
translates structural properties of the matroidal branch-decomposition to the
context of polyhedra. We then use this to present a total polynomial time
algorithm for polytopes $P$ for which the branch-width of the linear matroid
generated by $S$ is bounded by a constant $k$.
