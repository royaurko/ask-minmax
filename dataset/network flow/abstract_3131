In this paper, we discuss different models for human logic systems and
describe a game with nature. G\"odel`s incompleteness theorem is taken into
account to construct a model of logical networks based on axioms obtained by
symmetry breaking. These classical logic networks are then coupled using rules
that depend on whether two networks contain axioms or anti-axioms. The social
lattice of axiom based logic networks is then placed with the environment
network in a game including entropy as a cost factor. The classical logical
networks are then replaced with ``preference axioms'' to the role of fuzzy
logic.
