Nuclear jets containing relativistic ``hot'' particles close to the central
engine cool dramatically by producing high energy radiation. The radiative
dissipation is similar to the famous Compton drag acting upon ``cold'' thermal
particles in a relativistic bulk flow. Highly relativistic protons induce
anisotropic showers raining electromagnetic power down onto the putative
accretion disk. Thus, the radiative signature of hot hadronic jets is x-ray
irradiation of cold thermal matter. The synchrotron radio emission of the
accelerated electrons is self-absorbed due to the strong magnetic fields close
to the magnetic nozzle.
