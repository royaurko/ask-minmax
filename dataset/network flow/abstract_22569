Soft Glassy Materials, Non Linear Rheology, Lattice Kinetic models,
frustrated phase separation} We present numerical simulations based on a
Boltzmann kinetic model with competing interactions, aimed at characterizating
the rheological properties of soft-glassy materials. The lattice kinetic model
is shown to reproduce typical signatures of driven soft-glassy flows in
confined geometries, such as Herschel-Bulkley rheology, shear-banding and
histeresys. This lends further credit to the present lattice kinetic model as a
valuable tool for the theoretical/computational investigation of the rheology
of driven soft-glassy materials under confinement.
