We describe algorithms for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of
user knowledge and statistical data. The algorithms have two components: a
scoring metric and a search procedure. The scoring metric takes a network
structure, statistical data, and a user's prior knowledge, and returns a score
proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the
data. The search procedure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring
metric. Previous work has concentrated on metrics for domains containing only
discrete variables, under the assumption that data represents a multinomial
sample. In this paper, we extend this work, developing scoring metrics for
domains containing all continuous variables or a mixture of discrete and
continuous variables, under the assumption that continuous data is sampled from
a multivariate normal distribution. Our work extends traditional statistical
approaches for identifying vanishing regression coefficients in that we
identify two important assumptions, called event equivalence and parameter
modularity, that when combined allow the construction of prior distributions
for multivariate normal parameters from a single prior Bayesian network
specified by a user.
