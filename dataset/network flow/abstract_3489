The wide-band code division multiple access (WCDMA) based 3G and beyond
cellular mobile wireless networks are expected to provide a diverse range of
multimedia services to mobile users with guaranteed quality of service (QoS).
To serve diverse quality of service requirements of these networks it
necessitates new radio resource management strategies for effective utilization
of network resources with coding schemes. Call admission control (CAC) is a
significant component in wireless networks to guarantee quality of service
requirements and also to enhance the network resilience. In this paper capacity
enhancement for WCDMA network with convolutional coding scheme is discussed and
compared with block code and without coding scheme to achieve a better balance
between resource utilization and quality of service provisioning. The model of
this network is valid for the real-time (RT) and non-real-time (NRT) services
having different data rate. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the network using convolutional code in terms of capacity enhancement and QoS
of the voice and video services.
