We present a novel formulation to calculate transport through disordered
superconductors connected between two metallic leads. An exact expression for
the current is derived, and is applied to a superconducting sample described by
the negative-$U$ Hubbard model. A Monte Carlo algorithm that includes thermal
phase and amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter is
employed, and a new efficient algorithm is described. This improved routine
allows access to relatively large systems, which we demonstrate by applying it
to several cases, including superconductor-normal interfaces and Josephson
junctions. The effects of decoherence and dephasing are shown to be included in
the formulation, which allows the unambiguous characterization of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in two-dimensional systems and the calculation
of the finite resistance due to vortex excitations in quasi one-dimensional
systems. Effects of magnetic fields can be easily included in the formalism,
and are demonstrated for the Little-Parks effect in superconducting cylinders.
Moreover, the formalism enables us to map the local super and normal currents,
and the accompanying electrical potentials, which we use to pinpoint and
visualize the emergence of resistance across the superconductor-insulator
transition.
