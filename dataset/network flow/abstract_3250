In this paper, we compare components of the horizontal flow below the solar
surface in and around regions consisting of rotating and non-rotating sunspots.
Our analysis suggests that there is a significant variation in both components
of the horizontal flow at the beginning of sunspot rotation as compared to the
non-rotating sunspot. In most cases, the flows in surrounding areas are
relatively small. However, there is a significant influence of the motion on
flows in an area closest to the sunspot rotation.
