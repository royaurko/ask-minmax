The complex spatiotemporal patterns of atmospheric flows resulting from the
cooperative existence of fluctuations ranging in size from millimeters to
thousands of kilometers are found to exhibit long-range spatial and temporal
correlations manifested as the selfsimilar fractal geometry to the global cloud
cover pattern and the inverse power law form for the atmospheric eddy energy
spectrum. Such long-range spatial and temporal correlations are ubiquitous to
extended natural dynamical systems and is a signature of the strange attractor
design characterizing deterministic chaos or self-organized criticality. The
unified network of global atmospheric circulations is analogous to the neural
networks of the human brain.
