Existing mobile devices have the capability to use multiple network
technologies simultaneously to help increase performance; but they rarely, if
at all, effectively use these technologies in parallel. We first present
empirical data to help understand the mobile environment when three
heterogeneous networks are available to the mobile device (i.e., a WiFi
network, WiMax network, and an Iridium satellite network). We then propose a
reliable, multi-path protocol called Multi-Path TCP with Network Coding
(MPTCP/NC) that utilizes each of these networks in parallel. An analytical
model is developed and a mean-field approximation is derived that gives an
estimate of the protocol's achievable throughput. Finally, a comparison between
MPTCP and MPTCP/NC is presented using both the empirical data and mean-field
approximation. Our results show that network coding can provide users in mobile
environments a higher quality of service by enabling the use of multiple
network technologies and the capability to overcome packet losses due to lossy,
wireless network connections.
