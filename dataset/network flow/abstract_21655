In a simplified model we study the hadronization of quark matter in an
expanding fireball, in particular the approach to a final hadronic composition
in equilibrium. Ideal hadron gas equilibrium constrained by conservation laws,
the fugacity parametrization, as well as linear and non-linear coalescence
approaches are recognized as different approximations to this in-medium quark
fusion process. It is shown that color confinement requires a dependence of the
hadronization cross section on quark density in the presence of flow (dynamical
confinement).
