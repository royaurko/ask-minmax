Observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) reveal ubiquitous episodic outflows (jets) with an
average speed around 120 km s-1 at temperatures often exceeding a million
degree in plume-like structures, rooted in magnetized regions of the quiet
solar atmosphere. These outflows are not restricted to the well-known plumes
visible in polar coronal holes, but are also present in plume-like structures
originating from equatorial coronal holes and quiet-Sun regions. Outflows are
also visible in the "interplume" regions throughout the atmosphere.
Furthermore, the structures traced out by these flows in both plume and
inter-plume regions continually exhibit transverse (Alfvenic) motion. Our
finding suggests that high-speed outflows originate mainly from the magnetic
network of the quiet Sun and coronal holes, and that the plume flows observed
are highlighted by the denser plasma contained therein. These outflows might be
an efficient means to provide heated mass into the corona and serve as an
important source of mass supply to the solar wind. We demonstrate that the
quiet-Sun plume flows can sometimes significantly contaminate the spectroscopic
observations of the adjacent coronal holes - greatly affecting the Doppler
shifts observed, thus potentially impacting significant investigations of such
regions.
