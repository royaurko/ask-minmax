We consider synchronization of weighted networks, possibly with asymmetrical
connections. We show that the synchronizability of the networks cannot be
directly inferred from their statistical properties. Small local changes in the
network structure can sensitively affect the eigenvalues relevant for
synchronization, while the gross statistical network properties remain
essentially unchanged. Consequently, commonly used statistical properties,
including the degree distribution, degree homogeneity, average degree, average
distance, degree correlation, and clustering coefficient, can fail to
characterize the synchronizability of networks.
