In Chapter 8 of the Book, ``Graphs and Networks: Transfinite and
Nonstandard'' (published by Birkhauser-Boston in 2004), nonstandard versions of
transfinite graphs and of electrical networks having such graphs were defined
and examined but only for the first two ranks, 0 and 1, of transfiniteness. In
the present work, these results are extended to higher ranks of transfinteness.
Such is done in detail for the natural-number ranks and also for the first
transfinite ordinal rank. Results for still higher ranks of transfiniteness can
be established in much the same way. Once the transfinite graphs of higher
ranks are established, theorems concerning the existence of hyperreal operating
points and the satisfaction of Kirchhoff's laws in nonstandard networks of
higher ranks can be proven just as they are for nonstandard networks of the
first rank.
