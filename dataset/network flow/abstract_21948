The Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible liquid is considered in the
limit of infinitely large Reynolds number. It is assumed that the flow
instability leads to generation of steady-state large-scale pulsations. The
excitation and evolution of the small-scale turbulence is investigated. It is
shown that the developed small-scale pulsations are intermittent. The maximal
amplitude of the vorticity fluctuations is reached along the vortex filaments.
Basing on the obtained solution, the pair correlation function in the limit
$r\to 0$ is calculated. It is shown that the function obeys the Kolmogorov law
$r^{2/3}$.
