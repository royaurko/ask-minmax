The effect of shear on the ordering-kinetics of a conserved order-parameter
system with O(n) symmetry and order-parameter-dependent mobility
\Gamma({\vec\phi}) \propto (1- {\vec\phi} ^2/n)^\alpha is studied analytically
within the large-n limit. In the late stage, the structure factor becomes
anisotropic and exhibits multiscaling behavior with characteristic length
scales (t^{2\alpha+5}/\ln t)^{1/2(\alpha+2)} in the flow direction and (t/\ln
t)^{1/2(\alpha+2)} in directions perpendicular to the flow. As in the \alpha=0
case, the structure factor in the shear-flow plane has two parallel ridges.
