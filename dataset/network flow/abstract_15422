The \'{I}slendinga s\"{o}gur - or Sagas of Icelanders - constitute a
collection of medieval literature set in Iceland around the late 9th to early
11th centuries, the so-called Saga Age. They purport to describe events during
the period around the settlement of Iceland and the generations immediately
following and constitute an important element of world literature thanks to
their unique narrative style. Although their historicity is a matter of
scholarly debate, the narratives contain interwoven and overlapping plots
involving thousands of characters and interactions between them. Here we
perform a network analysis of the \'{I}slendinga s\"{o}gur in an attempt to
gather quantitative information on interrelationships between characters and to
compare saga society to other social networks.
