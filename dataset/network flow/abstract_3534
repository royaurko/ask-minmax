Realistic network-like systems are usually composed of multiple networks with
interacting relations such as school-enterprise research and development
collaboration networks. Here we study the percolation properties of a special
kind of that R&D collaboration networks, namely institute-enterprise R&D
collaboration networks. We introduce two actual IERDCNs to show their
structural properties, and present a mathematical framework based on generating
functions for analyzing an interacting network with any connection probability.
Then we illustrate the percolation threshold and structural parameter
arithmetic in the sub-critical and supercritical regimes. We compare the
predictions of our mathematical framework and arithmetic to data for two real
R&D collaboration networks and a number of simulations, and we find that they
are in remarkable agreement with the data. We show applications of the
framework to electronics R&D collaboration networks.
