We study transient sequential dynamics of evolving dynamical networks, i.e.,
those having active nodes and links and activity-dependent topology. We show
that such networks can generate sequences of metastable cluster states where
each state is a cyclic sequence of clusters following each other in a certain
order. We found the way how the sequences generated by such networks can be
robust against background noise, small perturbations of initial conditions, and
parameter detuning, and at the same time, can be sensitive to input
information.
