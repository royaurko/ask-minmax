In this paper we introduce the concept of Direct Statistical Simulation (DSS)
for astrophysical flows. This technique may be appropriate for problems in
astrophysical fluids where the instantaneous dynamics of the flows are of
secondary importance to their statistical properties. We give examples of such
problems including mixing and transport in planets, stars and disks. The method
is described for a general set of evolution equations, before we consider the
specific case of a spectral method optimised for problems on a spherical
surface. The method is illustrated for the simplest non-trivial example of
hydrodynamics and MHD on a rotating spherical surface. We then discuss possible
extensions of the method both in terms of computational methods and the range
of astrophysical problems that are of interest.
