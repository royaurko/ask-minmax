Recent experiments performed on a variety of soft glassy materials have
demonstrated that any imposed shear flow serves to simultaneously fluidize
these systems in all spatial directions [Ovarlez \textit{et al.} (2010)]. When
probed with a second shear flow, the viscous response of the experimental
system is determined by the rate of the primary, fluidizing flow. Motivated by
these findings, we employ a recently developed schematic mode-coupling theory
[Brader \textit{et al.} (2009)] to investigate the three dimensional flow of a
colloidal glass, subject to a combination of simple shear and uniaxial
compression. Despite differences in the specific choice of superposed flow, the
flow curves obtained show good qualitative agreement with the experimental
findings and recover the observed power law describing the decay of the scaled
viscosity as a function of the dominant rate. We then proceed to perform a more
formal analysis of our constitutive equation for different kind of `mixed'
flows consisting of a dominant primary flow subject to a weaker perturbing
flow. Our study provides further evidence that the theory of Brader \textit{et
al.} (2009) reliably describes the dynamic arrest and mechanical fluidization
of dense particulate suspensions.
