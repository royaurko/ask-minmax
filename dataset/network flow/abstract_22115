We overview our recently introduced theory of n-fold integer programming
which enables the polynomial time solution of fundamental linear and nonlinear
integer programming problems in variable dimension. We demonstrate its power by
obtaining the first polynomial time algorithms in several application areas
including multicommodity flows and privacy in statistical databases.
