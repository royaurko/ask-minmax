Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is the new generation of computer and
communication networks that are being deployed throughout the telecommunication
industry as well as in campus backbones. ATM technology distinguishes itself
from the previous networking protocols in that it has the latest traffic
management technology and thus allows guaranteeing delay, throughput, and other
performance measures. This in turn, allows users to integrate voice, video, and
data on the same network. Available bit rate (ABR) service in ATM has been
designed to fairly distribute all unused capacity to data traffic and is
specified in the ATM Forum's Traffic Management (TM4.0) standard. This paper
will describe the OPNET models that have been developed for ATM and ABR design
and analysis.
