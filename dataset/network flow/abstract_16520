OPTICON, the ICN Optical Infrared Coordination Network for Astronomy, brings
together for the first time the operators of all Europe's medium to large
optical-infrared telescopes, the largest corresponding data archives, and
several user representatives. The OPTICON partners work with their communities
to identify those major challenges for the future development of European
optical-infrared astronomy which require Europe-wide collaboration. OPTICON
sponsors and coordinates developments towards these goals, involving the entire
astronomical community through workshops and meetings targeted towards these
agreed common goals of general importance.
