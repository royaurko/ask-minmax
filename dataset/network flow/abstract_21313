A different perspective on the long-standing problem of amorphous
solidification is offered, based on an alternative definition of a solid as a
porous medium. General, model-free results are obtained concerning the growing
dynamic length accompanying solidification and its relation to the growing
relaxation time. Criteria are derived for the dynamic length to diverge and for
its divergence to entail the arrest of particle motion.
