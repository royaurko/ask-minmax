We consider geometric flow equations for contracting and expanding normal
velocities, including powers of the Gauss curvature, of the mean curvature, and
of the norm of the second fundamental form, and ask whether - after appropriate
rescaling - closed strictly convex surfaces converge to spheres. To prove this,
many contributors use certain functions of the principal curvatures, which we call
maximum-principle functions. We show when such functions cease to exist and
exist, while presenting newly discovered maximum-principle functions.
