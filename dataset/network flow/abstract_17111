We solve the local and global structural identifiability problems for
viscoelastic mechanical models represented by networks of springs and dashpots.
We propose a very simple characterization of both local and global structural
identifiability based on identifiability tables, with the purpose of providing
a guideline for constructing arbitrarily complex, identifiable spring-dashpot
networks. We illustrate how to use our results in a number of examples and
point to some applications in cardiovascular modeling.
