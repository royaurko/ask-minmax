We explore the hypothesis that it is possible to obtain information about the
dynamics of a blog network by analysing the temporal relationships between
blogs at a semantic level, and that this type of analysis adds to the knowledge
that can be extracted by studying the network only at the structural level of
URL links. We present an algorithm to automatically detect fine-grained
discussion topics, characterized by n-grams and time intervals. We then propose
a probabilistic model to estimate the temporal relationships that blogs have
with one another. We define the precursor score of blog A in relation to blog B
as the probability that A enters a new topic before B, discounting the effect
created by asymmetric posting rates. Network-level metrics of precursor and
laggard behavior are derived from these dyadic precursor score estimations.
This model is used to analyze a network of French political blogs. The scores
are compared to traditional link degree metrics. We obtain insights into the
dynamics of topic participation on this network, as well as the relationship
between precursor/laggard and linking behaviors. We validate and analyze
results with the help of an expert on the French blogosphere. Finally, we
propose possible applications to the improvement of search engine ranking
algorithms.
