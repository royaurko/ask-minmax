We consider perfect fluid bodies ("stars") in general relativity that are
axisymmetric, asymptotically flat, and that admit a maximal hypersurface. We
show that configurations that extremize the total entropy at fixed ADM mass,
ADM angular momentum, and total particle number are stationary with circular
flow. For such stars, this establishes that thermodynamic equilibrium implies
dynamic equilibrium.
