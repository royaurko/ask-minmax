We report the measurement of the directed flow ($v_{1}$) for charged kaons in
Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV
as a function of rapidity and compare these results for pions, protons and
antiprotons. These new kaon results may help to constrain the medium properties
and collision dynamics including the in-medium kaon potential and baryon number
transport in these collisions.
