Given a metabolic network in terms of its metabolites and reactions, our goal
is to efficiently compute the minimal knock out sets of reactions required to
block a given behaviour. We describe an algorithm which improves the
computation of these knock out sets when the elementary modes (minimal
functional subsystems) of the network are given. We also describe an algorithm
which computes both the knock out sets and the elementary modes containing the
blocked reactions directly from the description of the network and whose
worst-case computational complexity is better than the algorithms currently in
use for these problems. Computational results are included.
