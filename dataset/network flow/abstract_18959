The network scale-up method enables researchers to estimate the size of
hidden populations, such as drug injectors and sex workers, using sampled
social network data. It offers advantages over other size estimation
techniques, but the basic scale-up estimator depends on problematic modeling
assumptions. We propose a new generalized scale-up estimator that does not
suffer from these problems. The new estimator can be used in settings with
non-random social mixing and imperfect awareness about membership in the hidden
population. Further, the new estimator can be used when data are collected via
complex sample designs and from incomplete sampling frames. However, the
generalized scale-up estimator also requires data from two samples: one from
the frame population and one from the hidden population. In some situations
these data from the hidden population can be collected by adding a small number
of questions to already planned studies. For other situations, we develop
interpretable adjustment factors that can be applied to the basic scale-up
estimator. We conclude with practical recommendations for the design and
analysis of future studies.
