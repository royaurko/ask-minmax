Our goal is to find a necessary and sufficient condition on the consensus
over a random network, generated by i.i.d. stochastic matrices. We show that
the consensus problem in three different convergence modes (almost surely, in
probability, and in L1) are equivalent, thus have the same necessary and
sufficient condition. We obtain the necessary and sufficient condition through
the stability in a projected subspace.
