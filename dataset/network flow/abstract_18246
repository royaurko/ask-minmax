The Bose-Einstein condensation of vacancies in a three-dimensional decorated
lattice is considered. The model describes possible scenario of superfluidity
of solid helium, caused by the presence of zero-point vacancies in a
dislocation network. It is shown that the temperature of Bose-Einstein
condensation decreases under increase of the length of the segments of the
network, and the law of decrease depends essentially on the properties of the
vertexes of the network. If the vertexes correspond to barriers with a small
transparency, the critical temperature is inversely as the square of the length
of the segment. On the contrary, if the vertexes correspond to traps for the
vacancies (it is energetically preferable for the vacancies to localize at the
vertexes), an exponential lowering of the temperature of transition takes
place. The highest temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation is reached in the
intermediate case of vertexes with large transparency, but in the absence of
tendency of localization in them. In the latter case the critical temperature
is inversely as the length of the segment.
