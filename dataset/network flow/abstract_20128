We consider the reduced Allen-Cahn action functional, which appears as the
sharp interface limit of the Allen-Cahn action functional and can be understood
as a formal action functional for a stochastically perturbed mean curvature
flow. For suitable evolutions of generalized hypersurfaces this functional
consists of the sum of the squares of the mean curvature and of the velocity
vector, integrated over time and space. For given initial and final conditions
we investigate the corresponding action minimization problem. We give a
generalized formulation and prove compactness and lower semicontinuity
properties of the action functional. Furthermore we characterize the
Euler-Lagrange equation for smooth stationary points and investigate conserved
quantities. Finally we present an explicit example and consider concentric
spheres as initial and final data and characterize in dependence of the given
time span the properties of the minimal rotationally symmetric connection.
