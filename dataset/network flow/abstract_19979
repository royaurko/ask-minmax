Vortex dynamics in molybdenum-germanium superconducting films were found to
well approximate the unpinned free limit even at low driving forces. This
provided an opportunity to empirically establish the intrinsic character of
free flux flow and to test in detail the validity of theories for this regime
beyond the Bardeen-Stephen approximation. Our observations are in good
agreement with the mean-field result of time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory.
