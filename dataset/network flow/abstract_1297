This paper establishes the continuity of the path delay operators for dynamic
network loading (DNL) problems based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model,
which explicitly captures vehicle spillback. This DNL aims at describing and
predicting the spatial-temporal evolution of traffic flow and congestion on a
network, which is consistent with established route and departure time choices
of travelers. We formulate this LWR-based DNL model as a system of partial
differential algebraic equations (PDAEs). Continuous dependence of a merge and
a diverge junction model with respect to their initial/boundary conditions is
investigated in detail, which leads to the continuity of the delay operator
through the wave-front tracking methodology and the generalized tangent vector
technique. As part of our analysis leading up to the main continuity result, we
also provide a novel method for estimating the minimum network supply without
resort to numerical computations. As a result, it is shown that gridlock can
never occur in finite time horizon.
