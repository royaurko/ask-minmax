Determining the relative importance of nodes in directed networks is
important in, for example, ranking websites, publications, and sports teams,
and for understanding signal flows in systems biology. A prevailing centrality
measure in this respect is the PageRank. In this work, we focus on another
class of centrality derived from the Laplacian of the network. We extend the
Laplacian-based centrality, which has mainly been applied to strongly connected
networks, to the case of general directed networks such that we can
quantitatively compare arbitrary nodes. Toward this end, we adopt the idea used
in the PageRank to introduce global connectivity between all the pairs of nodes
with a certain strength. Numerical simulations are carried out on some
networks. We also offer interpretations of the Laplacian-based centrality for
general directed networks in terms of various dynamical and structural
properties of networks. Importantly, the Laplacian-based centrality defined as
the stationary density of the continuous-time random walk with random jumps is
shown to be equivalent to the absorption probability of the random walk with
sinks at each node but without random jumps. Similarly, the proposed centrality
represents the importance of nodes in dynamics on the original network supplied
with sinks but not with random jumps.
