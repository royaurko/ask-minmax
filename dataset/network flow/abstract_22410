We study the designing principles of the simplest colloidal propeller, an
architecture built from four identical spheres that can couple translation with
rotation to produce controlled drift motion. By considering superparamagnetic
beads, we show that the simultaneous action of a magnetic field and a shear
flow leads to the migration of the cluster in the vorticity direction. We
investigate the dependence of the migration velocity on the geometrical
parameters of the cluster, and find that significant cluster separation can be
achieved under the typical operation conditions of microfluidic devices.
