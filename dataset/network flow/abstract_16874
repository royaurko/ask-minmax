We explore the generic motion of cosmic (super)strings when the internal
compact dimensions are warped, using the Klebanov-Strassler solution as a
prototypical throat geometry. We find that there is no dynamical mechanism
which localises the string at the tip of the throat, but rather that the motion
seems to explore both internal and external degrees of freedom democratically.
This indicates that cosmic (super)strings formed by inflationary
brane-antibrane annihilation will have sufficient internal motion for the
gravitational wave signals from the string network to be suppressed relative to
the signal from a `standard' cosmic string network.
