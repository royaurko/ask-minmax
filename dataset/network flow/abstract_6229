It appeared recently that the classical random network model used to
represent complex networks does not capture their main properties (clustering,
degree distribution). Since then, various attempts have been made to provide
network models having these properties. We propose here the first model which
achieves the following challenges: it produces networks which have the three
main wanted properties, it is based on some real-world observations, and it is
sufficiently simple to make it possible to prove its main properties. We first
give an overview of the field by presenting the main models introduced until
now, then we discuss some remarks on some complex networks which lead us to the
definition of our model. We then show that the model has the expected
properties and that it can actually be seen as a general model for complex
networks.
