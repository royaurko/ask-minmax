We investigate the orientational behaviour of a homeotropically aligned
nematic liquid crystal subjected to an oscillatory plane Poiseuille flow
produced by an alternating pressure gradient. For small pressure amplitudes the
director oscillates within the flow plane around the initial homeotropic
position, whereas for higher amplitudes a spatially homogeneous transition to
out-of-plane director motion was observed for the first time. The orientational
transition was found to be supercritical and the measured frequency dependence
of the critical pressure amplitude in the range between 2 and 20 Hz was in
quantitative agreement with a recent theory.
