This paper is divided in two parts. In the first part, a brief review of a
spectral element method for the numerical solution of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations is given. The method is then extended to compute
buoyant flows described by the Boussinesq approximation. Free convection in
closed two-dimensional cavities are computed and the results are in very good
agreement with the available reference solutions.
