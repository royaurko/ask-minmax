Function computation in directed acyclic networks is considered, where a sink
node wants to compute a target function with the inputs generated at multiple
source nodes. The network links are error-free but capacity-limited, and the
intermediate network nodes perform network coding. The target function is
required to be computed with zero error. The computing rate of a network code
is measured by the average number of times that the target function can be
computed for one use of the network. We propose a cut-set bound on the
computing rate using an equivalence relation associated with the inputs of the
target function. Our bound holds for general target functions and network
topologies. We also show that our bound is tight for some special cases where
the computing capacity can be characterized.
