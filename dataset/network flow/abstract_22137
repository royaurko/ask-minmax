We prove that the lubrication approximation is perturbed by a non-regular
roughness of the boundary. We show how the flow may be accelerated using
adequate rugosity profiles on the bottom. We explicit the possible effects of
some abrupt changes in the profile. The limit system is mathematically
justified through a variant of the notion of two-scale convergence. Finally, we
present some numerical results, illustrating the limit system in the
three-dimensional case.
