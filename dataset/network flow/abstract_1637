Raman spectroscopy is a useful experimental tool to investigate local
deformation and structural changes in SiO$_2$-based glasses. Using a
semi-classical modelling of Raman spectra in large samples of silica glasses,
we show in this paper that shear plastic flow affects the Raman measurement in
the upper part of the spectrum. We relate these changes to structural
modifications, as well as a detailed analysis of the vibration modes computed
in the same frequency range. These results opens the door to in situ monitoring
of plastic damage in silica-based structures.
