We find a new monotone increasing quantity along smooth solutions to the
inverse mean curvature flow in $\mathbb R^n$. As an application, we derive a
sharp geometric inequality for mean convex, star-shaped hypersurfaces which
relates the volume enclosed by a hypersurface to a weighted total mean
curvature of the hypersurface.
