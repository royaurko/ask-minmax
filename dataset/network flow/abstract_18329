Speaker identification is the process of determining which registered speaker
provides a given utterance. Speaker identification required to make a claim on
the identity of speaker from the Ns trained speaker in its user database. In
this study, we propose the combination of clustering algorithm and the
classification technique - subtractive and Radial Basis Function (RBF). The
proposed technique is chosen because RBF is a simpler network structures and
faster learning algorithm. RBF finds the input to output map using the local
approximators which will combine the linear of the approximators and cause the
linear combiner have few weights. Besides that, RBF neural network model using
subtractive clustering algorithm for selecting the hidden node centers, which
can achieve faster training speed. In the meantime, the RBF network was trained
with a regularization term so as to minimize the variances of the nodes in the
hidden layer and perform more accu-rate prediction.
