From the sandpoint of neural network dynamics we consider dynamical system of
special type pesesses gradient (symmetric) and Hamiltonian (antisymmetric)
flows. The conditions when Hamiltonian flow properties are dominant in the
system are considered. A simple Hamiltonian has been studied for establishing
oscillatory patern conditions in system under consideration.
