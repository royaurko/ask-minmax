In order to efficiently study the characteristics of network domains and
support development of network systems (e.g. algorithms, protocols that operate
on networks), it is often necessary to sample a representative subgraph from a
large complex network. Although recent subgraph sampling methods have been
shown to work well, they focus on sampling from memory-resident graphs and
assume that the sampling algorithm can access the entire graph in order to
decide which nodes/edges to select. Many large-scale network datasets, however,
are too large and/or dynamic to be processed using main memory (e.g., email,
tweets, wall posts). In this work, we formulate the problem of sampling from
large graph streams. We propose a streaming graph sampling algorithm that
dynamically maintains a representative sample in a reservoir based setting. We
evaluate the efficacy of our proposed methods empirically using several
real-world data sets. Across all datasets, we found that our method produce
samples that preserve better the original graph distributions.
