We study scaling laws characterizing the inter-diffusive zone between two
miscible fluids flowing side by side in a Y-shape laminar micromixer using the
lattice Boltzmann method. The lattice Boltzmann method solves the coupled 3D
hydrodynamics and mass transfer equations and incorporates intrinsic features
of 3D flows related to this problem. We observe the different power law regimes
occurring at the center of the channel and close to the top/bottom wall. The
extent of the inter-diffusive zone scales as square root of the axial distance
at the center of the channel. At the top/bottom wall, we find an exponent 1/3
at early stages of mixing as observed in the experiments of Ismagilov and
coworkers [Appl. Phys. Lett. 76, 2376 (2000)]. At a larger distance from the
entrance, the scaling exponent close to the walls changes to 1/2 [J.-B. Salmon
et al J. Appl. Phys. 101, 074902 (2007)]. Here, we focus on the effect of
finite aspect ratio on diffusive broadening. Interestingly, we find the same
scaling laws regardless of the channel's aspect ratio. However,the point at
which the exponent 1/3 characterizing the broadening at the top/bottom wall
reverts to the normal diffusive behavior downstream strongly depends on the
aspect ratio. We propose an interpretation of this observation in terms of
shear rate at the side walls. A criterion for the range of aspect ratios with
non-negligible effect on diffusive broadening is also provided.
