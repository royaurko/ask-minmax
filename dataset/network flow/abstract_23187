We investigate heat and charge transport through a diffusive SIF1F2N tunnel
junction, where N (S) is a normal (superconducting) electrode, I is an
insulator layer and F1,2 are two ferromagnets with arbitrary direction of
magnetization. The flow of an electric current in such structures at subgap
bias is accompanied by a heat transfer from the normal metal into the
superconductor, which enables refrigeration of electrons in the normal metal.
We demonstrate that the refrigeration efficiency depends on the strength of the
ferromagnetic exchange field h and the angle {\alpha} between the
magnetizations of the two F layers. As expected, for values of h much larger
than the superconducting order parameter \Delta, the proximity effect is
suppressed and the efficiency of refrigeration increases with respect to a NIS
junction. However, for h \sim \Delta the cooling power (i.e. the heat flow out
of the normal metal reservoir) has a non-monotonic behavior as a function of h
showing a minimum at h \approx \Delta. We also determine the dependence of the
cooling power on the lengths of the ferromagnetic layers, the bias voltage, the
temperature, the transmission of the tunneling barrier and the magnetization
misalignment angle {\alpha}.
