In asymptotic regimes, both in time and space (network size), the derivation
of network capacity results is grossly simplified by brushing aside queueing
behavior in non-Jackson networks. This simplifying double-limit model, however,
lends itself to conservative numerical results in finite regimes. To properly
account for queueing behavior beyond a simple calculus based on average rates,
we advocate a system theoretic methodology for the capacity problem in finite
time and space regimes. This methodology also accounts for spatial correlations
arising in networks with CSMA/CA scheduling and it delivers rigorous
closed-form capacity results in terms of probability distributions. Unlike
numerous existing asymptotic results, subject to anecdotal practical concerns,
our transient one can be used in practical settings: for example, to compute
the time scales at which multi-hop routing is more advantageous than single-hop
routing.
