We study the information dynamics in a network of spin-$1/2$ particles when
edges representing $XY$ interactions are randomly added to a disconnected graph
accordingly to a probability distribution characterized by a "weighting"
parameter. In this way we model dissipation of information initially localized
in single or two qubits all over the network. We then show the dependence of
this phenomenon from weighting parameter and size of the network.
