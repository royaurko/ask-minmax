This paper suggests the use of intelligent network-aware processing agents in
wireless local area network drivers to generate metrics for bandwidth
estimation based on real-time channel statistics to enable wireless multimedia
application adaptation. Various configurations in the wireless digital home are
studied and the experimental results with performance variations are presented.
