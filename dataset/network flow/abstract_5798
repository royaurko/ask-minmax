We study network traffic dynamics in a two dimensional communication network
with regular nodes and hubs. If the network experiences heavy message traffic,
congestion occurs due to finite capacity of the nodes. We discuss strategies to
manipulate hub capacity and hub connections to relieve congestion and define a
coefficient of betweenness centrality (CBC), a direct measure of network
traffic, which is useful for identifying hubs which are most likely to cause
congestion. The addition of assortative connections to hubs of high CBC
relieves congestion very efficiently.
