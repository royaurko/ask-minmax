We consider networks of anonymous sensors and address the problem of
constructing routes for the delivery of information from a group of sensors in
response to a query by a sink. In order to circumvent the restrictions imposed
by anonymity, we rely on using the power level perceived by the sensors in the
query from the sink. We introduce a simple distributed algorithm to achieve the
building of routes to the sink and evaluate its performance by means of
simulations.
