We show that the two-component Hunter-Saxton system with negative coupling
constant describes the geodesic flow on an infinite-dimensional pseudosphere.
This approach yields explicit solution formulae for the Hunter-Saxton system.
Using this geometric intuition, we conclude by constructing global weak
solutions. The main novelty compared with similar previous studies is that the
metric is indefinite.
