This paper focuses on the prediction of real-world talk attendances at
academic conferences with respect to different influence factors. We study the
predictability of talk attendances using real-world tracked face-to-face
contacts. Furthermore, we investigate and discuss the predictive power of user
interests extracted from the users' previous publications. We apply Hybrid
Rooted PageRank, a state-of-the-art unsupervised machine learning method that
combines information from different sources. Using this method, we analyze and
discuss the predictive power of contact and interest networks separately and in
combination. We find that contact and similarity networks achieve comparable
results, and that combinations of different networks can only to a limited
extend help to improve the prediction quality. For our experiments, we analyze
the predictability of talk attendance at the ACM Conference on Hypertext and
Hypermedia 2011 collected using the conference management system Conferator.
