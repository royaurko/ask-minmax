State estimation is necessary in diagnosing anomalies in Water Demand Systems
(WDS). In this paper we present a neural network performing such a task. State
estimation is performed by using optimization, which tries to reconcile all the
available information. Quantification of the uncertainty of the input data
(telemetry measures and demand predictions) can be achieved by means of robust
estate estimation. Using a mathematical model of the network, fuzzy estimated
states for anomalous states of the network can be obtained. They are used to
train a neural network capable of assessing WDS anomalies associated with
particular sets of measurements.
