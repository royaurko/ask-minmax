This paper presents results on event-by-event elliptic flow fluctuations in
Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200Gev, where the contribution from non-flow
correlations has been subtracted. An analysis method is introduced to measure
non-flow correlations, relying on the assumption that non-flow correlations are
most prominent at short ranges (Delta eta < 2). Assuming that non-flow
correlations are of the order that is observed in p+p collisions for long range
correlations (Delta eta > 2), relative elliptic flow fluctuations of
approximately 30-40% are observed. These results are consistent with
predictions based on spatial fluctuations of the participating nucleons in the
initial nuclear overlap region. It is found that the long range non-flow
correlations in Au+Au collisions would have to be more than an order of
magnitude stronger compared to the p+p data to lead to the observed azimuthal
anisotropy fluctuations with no intrinsic elliptic flow fluctuations.
