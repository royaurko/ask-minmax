We present an experimental study of transition to turbulence in a plane
Poiseuille flow. Using a well-controlled perturbation, we analyse the flow
using extensive Particule Image Velocimetry and flow visualisation (using Laser
Induced Fluorescence) measurements and use the deformation of the mean velocity
profile as a criterion to characterize the state of the flow. From a large
parametric study, four different states are defined depending on the values of
the Reynolds number and the amplitude of the perturbation. We discuss the role
of coherent structures, like hairpin vortices, in the transition. We find that
the minimal amplitude of the perturbation triggering transition scales like
Re^-1.
