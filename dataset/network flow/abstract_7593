We report on the first analysis of directed and elliptic flow with the new
method of Lee--Yang zeroes. Experimental data are presented for Ru+Ru reactions
at 1.69 AGeV measured with the FOPI detector at SIS/GSI. The results obtained
with several methods, based on the event-plane reconstruction, on Lee--Yang
zeroes, and on multi-particle cumulants (up to 5th order) applied for the first
time at SIS energies, are compared. They show conclusive evidence that
azimuthal correlations between nucleons and composite particles at this energy
are largely dominated by anisotropic flow.
