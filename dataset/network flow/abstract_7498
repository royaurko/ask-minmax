The holographic description of supersymmetric RG flows in supergravity is
considered from both the five-dimensional and ten-dimensional perspectives. An
N=1* flow of N=4 super-Yang Mills is considered in detail, and the infra-red
limit is studied in terms of IIB supergravity in ten dimensions. Depending on
the vevs and the direction of approach to the core, the supergravity solution
can be interpreted in terms of either 5-branes or 7-branes. Generally, it is
shown that it is essential to use the ten-dimensional description in order to
study the infra-red asymptotics in supergravity.
