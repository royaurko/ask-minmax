In order to understand why the inter- and intra-granular current densities of
polycrystalline superconducting oxypnictides differ by three orders of
magnitude, we have conducted combined magneto-optical and microstructural
examinations of representative randomly oriented polycrystalline Nd and Sm
single-layer oxypnictides. Magneto optical images show that the highest Jc
values are observed within single grains oriented with their c axes
perpendicular to the observation plane, implying that the intragranular current
is anisotropic. The much lower intergranular Jc is at least partially due to
many extrinsic factors, because cracks and a ubiquitous wetting As-Fe phase are
found at many grain boundaries. However, some grain boundaries are structurally
clean under high resolution transmission electron microscopy examination.
Because the whole-sample global Jc(5K) values of the two samples examined are
1000-4000 A/cm2, some 10-40 times that found in random, polycrystalline
YBa2Cu3O7-x, it appears that the dominant obstruction to intergranular current
flow of many present samples is extrinsic, though some intrinsic limitation of
current flow across grain boundaries cannot yet be ruled out.
