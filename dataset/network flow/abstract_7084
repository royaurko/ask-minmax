This paper demonstrates the maintenance of self-sustaining turbulence in a
restricted nonlinear (RNL) model of plane Couette flow. The RNL system is
derived directly from the Navier Stokes equations and permits computationally
tractable studies of the dynamical system obtained using stochastic structural
stability theory (S3T), which is a second order approximation of the
statistical state dynamics of the flow. The RNL model shares the dynamical
restrictions of the S3T model but can be easily implemented through reducing a
DNS code to the equations governing the RNL system. Comparisons of turbulence
arising from DNS and RNL simulations demonstrate that the RNL system supports
self-sustaining turbulence with a mean flow as well as structural and dynamical
features that are consistent with DNS. These results demonstrate that the
simplified RNL/S3T system captures fundamental aspects of fully developed
turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows and motivates use of the RNL/S3T system
for further study of wall turbulence.
