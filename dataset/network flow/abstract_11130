Traditional key management techniques, such as public key cryptography or key
distribution center (e.g., Kerberos), are often not effective for wireless
sensor networks for the serious limitations in terms of computational power,
energy supply, network bandwidth. In order to balance the security and
efficiency, we propose a new scheme by employing LU Composition techniques for
mutual authenticated pairwise key establishment and integrating LU Matrix with
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for anonymous pathkey establishment. At the
meantime, it is able to achieve efficient group key agreement and management.
Analysis shows that the new scheme has better performance and provides
authenticity and anonymity for sensor to establish multiple kinds of keys,
compared with previous related works.
