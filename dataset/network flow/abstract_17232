In this paper, we discuss one approach for development and deployment of web
sites (web pages) devoted to the description of objects (events) with a
precisely delineated geographic scope. This article describes the usage of
context-aware programming models for web development. In our paper, we propose
mechanisms to create mobile web applications which content links to some
predefined geographic area. The accuracy of such a binding allows us to
distinguish individual areas within the same indoor space. Target areas for
such development are applications for Smart Cities and retail.
