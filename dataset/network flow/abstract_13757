It has been suggested that optically thin and geometrically thick accretion
flows are responsible for the observed radio/X-ray luminosity relation of the
X-ray bright galactic nuclei. If this is the case then central supermassive
black hole masses can be estimated directly from measurements of the core radio
luminosity and the X-ray luminosity, provided that properties of such accretion
flows are known. Calculated ratios of the luminosities are presented in cases
of the standard ADAF model and modified ADAF models, in which a truncation of
inner parts of the flows and winds causing a reduction of the infalling matter
are included. We compare the observed ratio of the luminosities with
predictions from models of optically thin accretion flows. We also discuss the
possible effects of the convection in ADAFs. We confirm that the supermassive
black hole (SMBH) mass estimate is possible with the radio/X-ray luminosity
relation due to ADAF models in the absence of a radio jet. We find that
observational data are insufficient to distinguish the standard ADAF model from
its modified models. However, the ADAF model with convection is inconsistent
with observations, unless microphysics parameters are to be substantially
changed. High resolution radio observations are required to avoid the
contamination of other components, such as, a jet component. Otherwise, the
SMBH mass is inclined to be over-estimated.
