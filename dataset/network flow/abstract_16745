In this paper we extend the investigation of cooperation in some classical
evolutionary games on populations were the network of interactions among
individuals is of the scale-free type. We show that the update rule, the payoff
computation and, to some extent the timing of the operations, have a marked
influence on the transient dynamics and on the amount of cooperation that can
be established at equilibrium. We also study the dynamical behavior of the
populations and their evolutionary stability.
