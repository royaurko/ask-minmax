In this work, we consider a model of forced axisymmetric flows which is
derived from the inviscid Boussinesq equations. What makes these equations
unusual is the boundary conditions they are expected to satisfy and the fact
that the boundary is part of the unknown. We show that these flows give rise to
an unusual Monge-Ampere equations for which we prove the existence and the
uniqueness of a variational solution. We take advantage of these Monge-Ampere
equations and construct a solution to the model.
