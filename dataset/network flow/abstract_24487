In this paper, we address the issue of threshold yield pressure of
yield-stress materials in rigid networks of interconnected conduits and porous
structures subject to a pressure gradient. We compare the results as obtained
dynamically from solving the pressure field to those obtained statically from
tracing the path of the minimum sum of threshold yield pressures of the
individual conduits by using the threshold path algorithms. We refute
criticisms directed recently to our previous findings that the pressure field
solution generally produces a higher threshold yield pressure than the one
obtained by the threshold path algorithms. Issues related to the solidification
of yield stress materials in their transition from fluid phase to solid state
have also been investigated and assessed as part of the investigation of the
yield point.
