In this work, we propose a game theoretic framework to analyze the behavior
of cognitive radios for distributed adaptive channel allocation. We define two
different objective functions for the spectrum sharing games, which capture the
utility of selfish users and cooperative users, respectively. Based on the
utility definition for cooperative users, we show that the channel allocation
problem can be formulated as a potential game, and thus converges to a
deterministic channel allocation Nash equilibrium point. Alternatively, a
no-regret learning implementation is proposed for both scenarios and it is
shown to have similar performance with the potential game when cooperation is
enforced, but with a higher variability across users. The no-regret learning
formulation is particularly useful to accommodate selfish users.
Non-cooperative learning games have the advantage of a very low overhead for
information exchange in the network.
  We show that cooperation based spectrum sharing etiquette improves the
overall network performance at the expense of an increased overhead required
for information exchange.
