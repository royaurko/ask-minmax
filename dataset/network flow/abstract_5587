Boolean networks are special types of finite state time-discrete dynamical
systems. A Boolean network can be described by a function from an n-dimensional
vector space over the field of two elements to itself. A fundamental problem in
studying these dynamical systems is to link their long term behaviors to the
structures of the functions that define them. In this paper, a method for
deriving a Boolean network's dynamical information via its disjunctive normal
form is explained. For a given Boolean network, a matrix with entries 0 and 1
is associated with the polynomial function that represents the network, then
the information on the fixed points and the limit cycles is derived by
analyzing the matrix. The described method provides an algorithm for the
determination of the fixed points from the polynomial expression of a Boolean
network. The method can also be used to construct Boolean networks with
prescribed limit cycles and fixed points. Examples are provided to explain the
algorithm.
