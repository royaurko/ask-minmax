In this paper, we address the issue on measuring the transport difficulty of
data dissemination in online social networks (OSNs). We define a new metric,
called \emph{transport complexity}, as one of the fundamental limits on the
data dissemination in OSNs. It involves two key factors: data arrival process
at users and transport distance of messages, which are also both significant
factors for the network's transport capacity. To model the data dissemination
in OSNs, we formulate the geographical distribution feature of dissemination
sessions in OSNs by introducing a three-layered system model that consists of
physical deployment layer, social relationship layer, and application session
layer. We discover and validate the mutual relevances among these three layers
as the preconditions for bounding the transport complexity. Moreover, we
introduce the Zipf's distribution to describe the friendship degree by
considering the scale-free property of user degree centrality in OSNs.
Furthermore, in order to model the diversity of session patterns, we assume
that: for the session with a source node, say $v$, the number of chosen
destinations from all friends of $v$ follows a special Zipf's distribution
whose parameters depend on the degree of $v$. Based on this system model, we
derive the lower bound on transport complexity for the novel data dissemination
in a large-scale OSN.
