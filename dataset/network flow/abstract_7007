We introduce certain spherically symmetric singular Ricci solitons and study
their stability under the Ricci flow from a dynamical PDE point of view. The
solitons in question exist for all dimensions $n+1\ge 3$, and all have a point
singularity where the curvature blows up; their evolution under the Ricci flow
is in sharp contrast to the evolution of their smooth counterparts. In
particular, the family of diffeomorphisms associated with the Ricci flow
"pushes away" from the singularity causing the evolving soliton to open up
immediately becoming an incomplete (but non-singular) metric. In the second
part of this paper we study the local-in time stability of this dynamical
evolution, under spherically symmetric perturbations of the initial soliton
metric. We prove a local well-posedness result for the Ricci flow near the
singular initial data, which in particular implies that the "opening up" of the
singularity persists for the perturbations also.
