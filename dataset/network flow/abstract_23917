We consider the evolutionary dynamics of a cooperative game on an adaptive
network, where the strategies of agents (cooperation or defection) feed back on
their local interaction topology. While mutual cooperation is the social
optimum, unilateral defection yields a higher payoff and undermines the
evolution of cooperation. Although no a priori advantage is given to
cooperators, an intrinsic dynamical mechanism can lead asymptotically to a
state of full cooperation. In finite systems, this state is characterized by
long periods of strong cooperation interrupted by sudden episodes of
predominant defection, suggesting a possible mechanism for the systemic failure
of cooperation in real-world systems.
