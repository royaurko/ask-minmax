We discuss the signature of the anomalous breaking of the superconformal
symmetry in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang Mills theory and its manifestation in
the form of anomaly poles. Moreover, we describe the massive deformations of
the $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory and the spectral densities of the corresponding
anomaly form factors. These are characterized by spectral densities which flow
with the mass deformation and turn the continuum contributions from the
two-particle cuts of the intermediate states into poles, with a single sum rule
satisfied by each component. The poles can be interpreted as signaling the
exchange of a composite axion/dilaton/dilatino (ADD) multiplet in the effective
Lagrangian. We conclude that global anomalous currents characterized by a
single flow in the perturbative picture always predict the existence of
composite interpolating fields.
