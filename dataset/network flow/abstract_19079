The heterogeneity of reaction fluxes present in metabolic networks can be
exploited to construct high-flux fluctuation backbones as reduced versions of
metabolism. These backbones maintain all relevant information while displaying
a substantially decreased number of interconnections and, hence, they become a
useful tool to extract main metabolic highways and so to unveil important
biological information. Here, we disclose the metabolic backbone of Escherichia
coli using computationally predicted fluxes that maximize the growth rate in
glucose medium, and we contrast it with the backbone of Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
a much simpler organism. We find that the core of both backbones are mainly
composed of reactions in ancient pathways, meaning that those reactions still
remain at present significant for biomass production. At the same time, a
comparative analysis of E. coli backbones in different media leads to the
identification of pathways sensitive to environmental changes. Backbones, as
networks of metabolites connected by the most relevant fluxes, are thus useful
to trace simultaneously both evolution and adaptation fingerprints in cell
metabolism.
