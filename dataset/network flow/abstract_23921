This paper introduces a new model for node behavior namely Correlated Node
Behavior Model which is an extension of Node Behavior Model. The model adopts
semi Markov process in continuous time which clusters the node that has
correlation. The key parameter of the process is determined by five
probabilistic parameters based on the Markovian model. Computed from the
transition probabilities of the semi-Markov process, the node correlation
impact on network survivability and resilience can be measure quantitatively.
From the result, the quantitative analysis of correlated node behavior on the
survivability is obtained through mathematical description, and the
effectiveness and rationality of the proposed model are verified through
numerical analysis. The analytical results show that the effect from correlated
failure nodes on network survivability is much severer than other misbehaviors.
