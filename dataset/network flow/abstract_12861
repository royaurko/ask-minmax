The processes in nonequilibrium dissipative media caused by coherent
structure formation and lead to the complicated dynamics are of interest for
nonlinear physics. Here we consider a model of the flow of interacting
electronics patterns. Under electronic pattern we understand a small volume of
active media, containing electron oscillators. The superradiation phenomenon
takes place due to the evolving radiation instability within each small volume
of the flow. It is numerically shown that the dynamics of radiation is changed
from spatio-temporal complex oscillations to arising of spatial disorder, i. e.
chaotic spatial pattern formation.
