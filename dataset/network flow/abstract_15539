Fault control and tolerance in wireless sensor network is a challenging
problem because of limited energy, bandwidth, and computational complexity.
While facing numerous threats these severely resource constrained nodes are
responsible for data collection, data processing, localization, time
synchronization aggregation and data forwarding. One of the effective
approaches to control and tolerate these threats is through clustering. In this
paper we present a new method called Efficient Fault Control Mechanism for
fault controlling in wireless sensor networks based on clustering and
cluster-head selection. Simulation results show Efficient Fault Control
Mechanism has better performance over state of art methods.
