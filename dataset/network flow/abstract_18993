We demonstrate an innovative multifunctional artificial material that
combines exotic metamaterial properties and the environmentally responsive
nature of phase change media. The tunable metamaterial is designed with the aid
of two interwoven coordinate-transformation equations and implemented with a
network of thin film resistors and vanadium dioxide ($VO_{2}$). The strong
temperature dependence of $VO_{2}$ electrical conductivity results in a
relevant modification of the resistor network behavior, and we provide
experimental evidence for a reconfigurable metamaterial electric circuit (MMEC)
that not only mimics a continuous medium but is also capable of responding to
thermal stimulation through dynamic variation of its spatial anisotropy. Upon
external temperature change the overall effective functionality of the material
switches between a "truncated-cloak" and "concentrator" for electric currents.
Possible applications may include adaptive matching resistor networks,
multifunctional electronic devices, and equivalent artificial materials in the
magnetic domain. Additionally, the proposed technology could also be relevant
for thermal management of integrated circuits
