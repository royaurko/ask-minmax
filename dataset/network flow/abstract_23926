The enhanced Bayesian network (eBN) methodology described in the companion
paper facilitates the assessment of reliability and risk of engineering systems
when information about the system evolves in time. We present the application
of the eBN (a) to the assessment of the life-cycle reliability of a structural
system, (b) to the optimization of a decision on performing measurements in
that structural system, and (c) to the risk assessment of an infrastructure
system subject to natural hazards and deterioration of constituent structures.
In all applications, observations of system performances or the hazards are
made at various points in time and the eBN efficiently includes these
observations in the analysis to provide an updated probabilistic model of the
system at all times.
