Using pseudoholomorphic curves techniques from symplectic geometry, Barney
Bramham proved recently that every smooth irrational pseudo-rotation of the
unit disk is the limit, for the $C^0$ topology, of a sequence of smooth
periodic diffeomorphisms. We give here a finite dimensional proof of this
result that works in the case where the pseudo-rotation is smoothly conjugate
to a rotation on the boundary circle. The proof extends to $C^1$ pseudo
rotations and is based on the dynamical study of the gradient flow associated
to a generating family of functions given by Chaperon's broken geodesics
method.
