To improve the capacity and coverage of current cellular networks, many
advanced technologies such as massive MIMO, inter-cell coordination, small
cells, device-to-device communications, and so on, are under studying. Many
proposed techniques have been shown to offer significant performance
improvement. Thus, the enabler of those techniques is of great importance. That
is the necessary signaling which guarantee the operation of those techniques.
The design and transmission of those signaling, especially the over-the-air
(OTA) signaling, is challenging. In this article, we provide an overview of the
OTA signaling in cellular networks to provide insights on the design of OTA
signaling. Specifically, we first give a brief introduction of the OTA
signaling in long term evolution (LTE), and then we discuss the challenges and
requirements in designing the OTA signaling in cellular networks in detail. To
better understand the OTA signaling, we give two important classifications of
OTA signaling and address their properties and applications. Finally, we
propose a signature-based signaling named (single-tone signaling, STS) which
can be used for inter-cell OTA signaling and is especially useful and robust in
multi-signal scenario. Simulation results are given to compare the detection
performance of different OTA signaling.
