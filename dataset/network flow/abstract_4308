The paper is concerned with the interplay between network structure and
traffic dynamics in a communications network, from the viewpoint of end-to-end
performance of packet transfer. We use a model of network generation that
allows the transition from random to scale-free networks. Specifically, we are
able to consider three different topologycal types of networks: (a) random; (b)
scale-free with \gamma=3; (c) scale free with \gamma=2. We also use an LRD
traffic generator in order to reproduce the fractal behavior that is observed
in real world data communication. The issue is addressed of how the traffic
behavior on the network is influenced by the variable factors of the
transmission rates and queue length restrictions at the network vertices. We
show that these factors can induce drastic changes in the throughput and
delivery time of network performance and are able to counter-balance some
undesirable effects due to the topology.
