We study, in random sparse networks, finite size scaling of the spin glass
susceptibility $\chi_{\rm SG}$, which is a proper measure of the de
Almeida-Thouless (AT) instability of spin glass systems. Using a
phenomenological argument regarding the band edge behavior of the Hessian
eigenvalue distribution, we discuss how $\chi_{\rm SG}$ is evaluated in
infinitely large random sparse networks, which are usually identified with
Bethe trees, and how it should be corrected in finite systems. In the high
temperature region, data of extensive numerical experiments are generally in
good agreement with the theoretical values of $\chi_{\rm SG}$ determined from
the Bethe tree. In the absence of external fields, the data also show a scaling
relation $\chi_{\rm SG}=N^{1/3}F(N^{1/3}|T-T_c|/T_c)$, which has been
conjectured in the literature, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature. In the
presence of external fields, on the other hand, the numerical data are not
consistent with this scaling relation. A numerical analysis of Hessian
eigenvalues implies that strong finite size corrections of the lower band edge
of the eigenvalue distribution, which seem relevant only in the presence of the
fields, are a major source of inconsistency. This may be related to the known
difficulty in using only numerical methods to detect the AT instability.
