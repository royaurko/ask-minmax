Two component advective flows are the most physical accretion disks which
arise from theoretical consideration. Since viscosity is the determining
factor, we investigate the effects of viscous stresses on accretion flows
around a nonrotating black hole. As a consequence of angular momentum transfer
by viscosity in an accretion flow, the angular momentum distribution is
modified. We include cooling effects and found that a Keplerian disk is
produced on the equatorial plane and the flow above and below remains sub
Keplerian. This gives a complete picture to date, of the formation of a Two
component advective flow around a black hole.
