The properties of a standard hydraulic jump depend critically on a Froude
number Fr defined as the ratio of the flow velocity to the gravity waves speed.
In the case of a horizontal circular jump, the question of the Froude number is
not well documented. Our experiments show that Fr measured just after the jump
is locked on a constant value that does not depend on flow rate Q, kinematic
viscosity {\nu} and surface tension {\gamma}. Combining this result to a
lubrication description of the outer flow yields, under appropriate conditions,
a new and simple law ruling the jump radius RJ : $R_J (ln
(\frac{R_\infty}{R_J}))^{3/8} \sim Q^{5/8}\nu ^{-3/8}$, in excellent agreement
with our experimental data. This unexpected RJ result asks an unsolved question
to all available models.
