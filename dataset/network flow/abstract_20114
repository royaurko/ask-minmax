When a real fluid is expelled quickly from a tube, it forms a jet separated
from the surrounding fluid by a thin, turbulent layer. On the other hand, when
the same fluid is sucked into the tube, it comes in from all directions,
forming a sink-like flow. We show that, even for the ideal flow described by
the time-reversible Euler equation, an experimenter who only controls the
pressure in a pump attached to the tube would see jets form in one direction
exclusively. The asymmetry between outflow and inflow therefore does not depend
on viscous dissipation, but rather on the experimenter's limited control of
initial and boundary conditions. This illustrates, in a rather different
context from the usual one of thermal physics, how irreversibility may arise in
systems whose microscopic dynamics are fully reversible.
