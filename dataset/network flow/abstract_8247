How does one make acquaintances? A simple observation from everyday
experience is that often one of our acquaintances introduces us to one of his
acquaintances. Such a simple triangle interaction may be viewed as the basis of
the evolution of many social networks. Here, it is demonstrated that this
assumption is sufficient to reproduce major non-trivial features of social
networks: Short path length, high clustering, and scale-free or exponential
link distributions.
