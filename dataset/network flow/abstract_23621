The rise of the social media sites, such as blogs, wikis, Digg and Flickr
among others, underscores the transformation of the Web to a participatory
medium in which users are collaboratively creating, evaluating and distributing
information. The innovations introduced by social media has lead to a new
paradigm for interacting with information, what we call 'social information
processing'. In this paper, we study how social news aggregator Digg exploits
social information processing to solve the problems of document recommendation
and rating. First, we show, by tracking stories over time, that social networks
play an important role in document recommendation. The second contribution of
this paper consists of two mathematical models. The first model describes how
collaborative rating and promotion of stories emerges from the independent
decisions made by many users. The second model describes how a user's
influence, the number of promoted stories and the user's social network,
changes in time. We find qualitative agreement between predictions of the model
and user data gathered from Digg.
