As a test bed for the growth of protoplanetary bodies in a turbulent
circumstellar disk we examine the fate of a boulder using direct numerical
simulations of particle seeded gas flowing around it. We provide an accurate
description of the flow by imposing no-slip and non-penetrating boundary
conditions on the boulder surface using the immersed boundary method pioneered
by Peskin (2002). Advected by the turbulent disk flow, the dust grains collide
with the boulder and we compute the probability density function (PDF) of the
normal component of the collisional velocity. Through this examination of the
statistics of collisional velocities we test the recently developed concept of
collisional fusion which provides a physical basis for a range of collisional
velocities exhibiting perfect sticking. A boulder can then grow sufficiently
rapidly to settle into a Keplerian orbit on disk evolution time scales.
