In this paper, we propose ART1 neural network clustering algorithm to group
users according to their Web access patterns. We compare the quality of
clustering of our ART1 based clustering technique with that of the K-Means and
SOM clustering algorithms in terms of inter-cluster and intra-cluster
distances. The results show the average inter-cluster distance of ART1 is high
compared to K-Means and SOM when there are fewer clusters. As the number of
clusters increases, average inter-cluster distance of ART1 is low compared to
K-Means and SOM which indicates the high quality of clusters formed by our
approach.
