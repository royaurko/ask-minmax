If we perturb a completely integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees of
freedom, the perturbed flow might display, on every energy level, invariant
sets that are laminations over Aubry-Mather sets of a Poincar\'e section of the
flow. Each one of these laminations carry a unique invariant probability
measure for the flow on which mixing is impossible in this low dimensional
frame. We prove that if the Aubry-Mather set has exactly one orbit of gaps and
is hyperbolic then the special flow over it with any smooth ceiling function
will be conjugate to a suspension with a constant ceiling function, failing
hence to be weak mixing or even topologically weak mixing. To the contrary, if
the Aubry-Mather set has more than one orbit of gaps with at least two in a
general position then the special flow over it will in general be weak mixing.
