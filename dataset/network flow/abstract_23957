We have applied two different automatic classifier algorithms to the BATSE
Current GRB Catalog data and we obtain three different classes of GRBs. Our
results confirm the existence of a third, intermediate class of GRBs, with mean
duration \sim 25-50 s, as deduced from a cluster analysis and from a neural
network algorithm. Our analyses imply longer durations than those found by
Mukherjee et al. (1998) and Horvath (1998), whose intermediate class had
durations \sim 2-10 s. From the neural network analysis no difference in
hardness between the two longest classes is found, and from both methods we
find that the intermediate-duration class constitutes the most homogeneous
sample of GRBs in its space distribution while the longest-duration class
constitutes the most inhomogeneous one with <V/V_max> \sim 0.1, being thus the
deepest population of GRBs with z_max \sim 10. The trend previously found in
long bursts, of spatial inhomogeneity increasing with hardness, only holds for
this new longest-duration class.
