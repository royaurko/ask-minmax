Numerical solutions of 2-D steady incompressible flow inside a triangular
cavity are presented. For the purpose of comparing our results with several
different triangular cavity studies with different triangle geometries, a
general triangle mapped onto a computational domain is considered. The
Navier-Stokes equations in general curvilinear coordinates in streamfunction
and vorticity formulation are numerically solved. Using a very fine grid mesh,
the triangular cavity flow is solved for high Reynolds numbers. The results are
compared with the numerical solutions found in the literature and also with
analytical solutions as well. Detailed results are presented.
