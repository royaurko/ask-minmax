We test a subgrid-scale spectral model of rotating turbulent flows against
direct numerical simulations. The particular case of Taylor-Green forcing at
large scale is considered, a configuration that mimics the flow between two
counter rotating disks as often used in the laboratory. We perform computations
in the presence of moderate rotation down to Rossby numbers of 0.03, as can be
encountered in the Earth atmosphere and oceans. We provide several classical
measures of the degree of anisotropy of the small scales of the flows under
study and conclude that an isotropic model may suffice at moderate Rossby
numbers. The model, developed previously (Baerenzung et al., Phys. Rev. E 77,
046303 (2008)), incorporates eddy viscosity that depends dynamically on the
inertial index of the energy spectrum, as well as eddy noise. We show that the
model reproduces satisfactorily all large-scale properties of the direct
numerical simulations up to Reynolds numbers of the order of 10000 and for long
times after the onset of the inverse cascade of energy at low Rossby number.
