We use a first-order energy quantity to prove a strengthened statement of
uniqueness for the Ricci flow. One consequence of this statement is that if a
complete solution on a noncompact manifold has uniformly bounded Ricci
curvature, then its sectional curvature will remain bounded for a short time if
it is bounded initially. In other words, the Weyl curvature tensor of a
complete solution to the Ricci flow cannot become unbounded instantaneously if
the Ricci curvature remains bounded.
