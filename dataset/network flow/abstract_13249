The program of understanding inverse-power law corrections to event shapes
and energy flow observables in e+ e- annihilation to two jets and DIS (1+1)
jets has been a significant success of QCD phenomenology over the last decade.
The important extension of this program to similar observables in hadron
collisions is not straightforward, being obscured by both conceptual and
technical issues. In this paper we shed light on some of these issues by
providing an estimate of power corrections to the inter-jet E_t flow
distribution in hadron collisions using the techniques that were employed in
the e+ e- annihilation and DIS cases.
