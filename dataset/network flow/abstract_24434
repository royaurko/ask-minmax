Decentralized monitoring (DM) refers to a monitoring technique, where each
component must infer, based on a set of partial observations if the global
property is satisfied. Our work is inspired by the theoretical results
presented by Baurer and Falcone at FM 2012, where the contributors introduced an
algorithm for distributing and monitoring LTL formulae, such that satisfaction
or violation of specifications can be detected by local monitors alone.
However, their work is based on the main assumption that neither the
computation nor communication take time, hence it does not take into account
how to set a sampling time among the components such that their local traces
are consistent. In this work we provide a timed model in UPPAAL and we show a
case study on a networked embedded systems board.
