The instability of ideal non-divergent zonal flows on the sphere is
determined numerically by the instability criterion of Arnol'd (1966) for the
sectional curvature. Zonal flows are unstable for all perturbations besides for
a small set which are in approximate resonance. The sectional curvature scales
with $m/\ell$ for large total and zonal wave numbers $\ell$ and $m$ of the
perturbations. The planetary rotation is stable and the presence of rotation
reduces the instability of perturbations.
