The purpose of this work in to demonstrate the initial results of a research
project having as its goal to develop dynamic models of the brain network
involved in aggressive behavior. In this way, the complex neural process
correlated to basic anger emotions and resulting in aggressive behaviors is
purportedly schematized by the use of Petri nets, a work-flow computational
tool. Initially, the modeling technique is introduced taking into account the
most recent and accepted notion of the neural substrates of emotions,
particularly the brain structures involved in the aggression neural network,
including their inputs, outputs, and internal connectivity. In order to
optimally represent these structures, their connections, and temporal dynamics,
the Petri net foundations employed in the simulation theory are defined.
Finally, the model and dynamic simulation of the neural process associated with
aggressive behavior is presented and evaluated as a feasible in silico
experimental support of the Patterned-Process Theory.
