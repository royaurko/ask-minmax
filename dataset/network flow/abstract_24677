This paper presents results on the typical number of simultaneous
point-to-point transmissions above a minimum rate that can be sustained in a
network with $n$ transmitter-receiver node pairs when all transmitting nodes
can potentially interfere with all receivers. In particular we obtain a scaling
law when the fading gains are independent Rayleigh distributed random variables
and the transmitters over different realizations are located at the points of a
stationary Poisson field in the plane. We show that asymptotically with
probability approaching 1, the number of simultaneous transmissions (links that
can transmit at greater than a minimum rate) is of the order of
$O(n^{\frac{1}{4}})$. These asymptotic results are confirmed from simulations.
