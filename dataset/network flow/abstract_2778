Like any large system development effort, the construction of a complex
belief network model requires systems engineering to manage the design and
construction process. We propose a rapid prototyping approach to network
engineering. We describe criteria for identifying network modules and the use
of "stubs" to represent not-yet-constructed modules. We propose an object
oriented representation for belief networks which captures the semantics of the
problem in addition to conditional independencies and probabilities. Methods
for evaluating complex belief network models are discussed. The ideas are
illustrated with examples from a large belief network construction problem in
the military intelligence domain.
