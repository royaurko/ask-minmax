A hyperaccretion disk around a stellar-mass black hole is a plausible model
for the central engine that powers gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We estimate the
luminosity of a jet driven by magnetohydrodynamic processes such as the
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism as a function of mass accretion rate, the black
hole mass, and other accretion parameters. We show that the jet is most
efficient when the accretion flow is cooled via optically-thin neutrino
emission, and that its luminosity is much larger than the energy deposition
rate through neutrino annihilation provided that the black hole is spinning
rapidly enough. Also, we find a significant jump in the jet luminosity at the
transition mass accretion rate between the advection dominated accretion flow
(ADAF) regime and the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) regime. This may
cause the large variability observed in the prompt emission of GRBs.
