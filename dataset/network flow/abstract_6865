Please note that after these results were reported at Quark Matter 2006 and
posted on the preprint server it was found that what is reported here as
\textit{elliptic flow fluctuations}, should rather be taken as an upper limit
on the fluctuations. Further analysis has shown that fitting the multiplicity
dependence of the q-distribution does not enable one to disentangle non-flow
and fluctuations. The data from the q-vector distrubution does not, therefore,
exclude the case of zero fluctuations. The remainder of these proceedings we
leave as they were originally reported.
