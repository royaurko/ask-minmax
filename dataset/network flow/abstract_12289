Starting from Axelrod's model of cultural dissemination, we introduce a
rewiring probability, enabling agents to cut the links with their unfriendly
neighbors if their cultural similarity is below a tolerance parameter. For low
values of tolerance, rewiring promotes the convergence to a frozen monocultural
state. However, intermediate tolerance values prevent rewiring once the network
is fragmented, resulting in a multicultural society even for values of initial
cultural diversity in which the original Axelrod model reaches globalization.
