We argue that the intracluster medium (ICM) of the cooling flow galaxy group
NGC 5813 is more likely to be heated by mixing of post-shock jets' gas residing
in hot bubbles with the ICM, than by shocks or turbulent-heating. Efficient
shocks-heating of the inner cooling flow region would have caused overheating
of the rest of the ICM, leading to its ejection from the group. Heating by
mixing, that was found to be much more efficient than turbulent-heating and
shocks-heating, hence, rescues the outer ICM of NGC 5813 from its predestined
fate according to cooling flow feedback scenarios that are based on heating by
shocks.
