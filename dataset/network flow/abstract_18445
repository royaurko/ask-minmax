Random multiple-access protocols of type ALOHA are used to regulate networks
with a star configuration where client nodes talk to the hub node at the same
frequency (finding a wide range of applications among telecommunication
systems, including mobile telephone networks and WiFi networks). Such protocols
control who talks at what time sharing the common idea "try to send your data
and, if your message collides with another transmission, try resending later".
  In the present paper, we consider a time-slotted ALOHA model where users are
allowed to renege before transmission completion. We focus on the scenario that
leads to overload in the absence of impatience. Under mild assumptions, we show
that the fluid (or law-of-large-numbers) limit of the system workload coincides
a.s. with the unique solution to a certain integral equation. We also
demonstrate that the fluid limits for distinct initial conditions converge to
the same value as time tends to infinity.
