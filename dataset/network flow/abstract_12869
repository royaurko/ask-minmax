Randomly-forced fluid flow in the presence of scale-unselective dissipation
develops mean currents following topographic contours. Known mechanisms based
on the scale-selective action of damping processes are not at work in this
situation. Coarse-graining reveals that the phenomenon is a kind of
noise-rectification mechanism, in which lack of detailed balance and the
symmetry-breaking provided by topography play an important role.
