We discuss hadron production in heavy ion collisions at RHIC. We argue that
hadrons at transverse momenta P_T < 5 GeV are formed by recombination of
partons from the dense parton phase created in central collisions at RHIC. We
provide a theoretical description of the recombination process for P_T > 2 GeV.
Below P_T = 2 GeV our results smoothly match a purely statistical description.
At high transverse momentum hadron production is well described in the language
of perturbative QCD by the fragmentation of partons. We give numerical results
for a variety of hadron spectra, ratios and nuclear suppression factors. We
also discuss the anisotropic flow v_2 and give results based on a flow in the
parton phase. Our results are consistent with the existence of a parton phase
at RHIC hadronizing at a temperature of 175 MeV and a radial flow velocity of
0.55c.
