Recent renormalization group results predict non self averaging behaviour at
criticality for relevant disorder. However, we find strong self averaging(SA)
behaviour in the critical region of a quenched Ising model on an ensemble of
small-world networks, despite the relevance of the random bonds at the pure
critical point.
