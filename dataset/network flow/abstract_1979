In a noncooperative dynamic game, multiple agents operating in a changing
environment aim to optimize their utilities over an infinite time horizon.
Time-varying environments allow to model more realistic scenarios (e.g., mobile
devices equipped with batteries, wireless communications over a fading channel,
etc.). However, solving a dynamic game is a difficult task that requires
dealing with multiple coupled optimal control problems. We focus our analysis
on a class of problems, named \textit{dynamic potential games}, whose solution
can be found through a single multivariate optimal control problem. Our
analysis generalizes previous studies by considering that the set of
environment's states and the set of players' actions are constrained, as it is
required by most of the applications. And the theoretical results are the
natural extension of the analysis for static potential games. We apply the
analysis and provide numerical methods to solve four key example problems, with
different features each: energy demand control in a smart-grid network, network
flow optimization in which the relays have bounded link capacity and limited
battery life, uplink multiple access communication with users that have to
optimize the use of their batteries, and two optimal scheduling games with
nonstationary channels.
