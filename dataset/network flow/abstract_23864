This paper presents the results of computational experiments on the effects
of social influence on individual and systemic behavior of situated cognitive
agents in a product-consumer environment. Paired experiments were performed
with identical initial conditions to compare social agents with non- social
agents. Experiment results show that social agents are more productive in
consuming available products, both in terms of aggregate unit consumption and
aggregate utility. But this comes at a cost of individual average utility per
unit consumed. In effect, social interaction achieved higher productivity by
'lowering the standards' of individual consumers. While still at an early stage
of development, such an agent-based model laboratory is shown to be an
effective research tool to investigate rich collective behavior in the context
of demanding cognitive tasks.
