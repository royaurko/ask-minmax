We define a new state-space for the coalescing Brownian flow, also known as
the Brownian web, on the circle. The elements of this space are families of
order-preserving maps of the circle, depending continuously on two time
parameters and having a certain weak flow property. The space is equipped with
a complete separable metric. A larger state-space, allowing jumps in time, is
also introduced, and equipped with a Skorokhod-type metric, also complete and
separable. We prove that the coalescing Brownian flow is the weak limit in this
larger space of a family of flows which evolve by jumps, each jump arising from
a small localized disturbance of the circle. A local version of this result is
also obtained, in which the weak limit law is that of the coalescing Brownian
flow on the line. Our set-up is well adapted to time-reversal and our weak
limit result provides a new proof of time-reversibility of the coalescing
Brownian flow. We also identify a martingale associated with the coalescing
Brownian flow on the circle and use this to make a direct calculation of the
Laplace transform of the time to complete coalescence.
