A variational principle for determining unstable periodic orbits of flows as
well as unstable spatio-temporally periodic solutions of extended systems is
proposed and implemented. An initial loop approximating a periodic solution is
evolved in the space of loops toward a true periodic solution by a minimization
of local errors along the loop. The ``\descent'' partial differential equation
that governs this evolution is an infinitesimal step version of the damped
Newton-Raphson iteration. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by its
application to the H\'enon-Heiles system, the circular restricted three-body
problem, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system in a weakly turbulent regime.
