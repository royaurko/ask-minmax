We review observations on the chemical enrichment of the intracluster medium
(ICM) performed using BeppoSAX MECS data. The picture emerging is that
non-cooling flow clusters have flat metallicity profiles, whereas a strong
enhancement in the abundance is found in the central regions of the cooling
flow clusters. All the non-cooling flow clusters present evidence of recent
merger activity suggesting that the merger events redistributes efficiently the
metal content of the ICM. The observed abundance excess in the central regions
of cooling flow clusters is probably due to metals ejected from the cD galaxy
located in the cluster core. Cooling flow cluster have also enhanced Nickel
abundances in their cores with respect to the non cooling flow clusters.
