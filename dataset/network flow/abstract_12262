In this paper we present a system for monitoring and controlling dynamic
network circuits inside the USLHCNet network. This distributed service system
provides in near real-time complete topological information for all the
circuits, resource allocation and usage, accounting, detects automatically
failures in the links and network equipment, generate alarms and has the
functionality to take automatic actions. The system is developed based on the
MonALISA framework, which provides a robust monitoring and controlling service
oriented architecture, with no single points of failure.
