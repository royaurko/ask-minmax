We have observed the ultracompact HII region G10.6-0.4 with the VLA in 23 GHz
continuum and the NH3(3,3) inversion line. By analyzing the optical depth of
the line as well as the kinematics, we have detected a flattened, rotating,
molecular accretion flow. We detect the fact that the highest column density
gas is more flattened, that is, distributed more narrowly, than the lower
column density gas, and that there is some inclination of the rotation axis.
The rotation is sub-Keplerian, and the molecular gas is not in a rotationally
supported disk. We do not find a single massive (proto)star forming in a scaled
up version of low mass star formation. Instead, our observations suggest a
different mode of clustered massive star formation, in which the accretion flow
flattens but does not form an accretion disk. Also in this mode of star
formation the central object can be a group of massive stars rather than a
single massive star.
