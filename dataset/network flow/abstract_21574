We have carried out nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a system
of crosslinked particles under shear flow conditions. As the fraction of
crosslinks $p$ is increased the system approaches a gel point at which the
shear viscosity $\eta$ and the first and second normal stress coefficients
$\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$ diverge. All three quantities seem to diverge with a
power law form: $\eta\sim \epsilon^{-s}$, $\Psi_{1,2}\sim\epsilon^{-\lambda}$
where $\epsilon =p_c-p$ and $s\approx 0.7$ and $\lambda\approx 3.15$ in three
dimensions and $s\approx 2.0$ and $\lambda\approx 6.0$ in two dimensions.
