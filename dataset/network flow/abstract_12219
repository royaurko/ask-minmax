We investigate research and development collaborations under the EU Framework
Programs (FPs) for Research and Technological Development. The collaborations
in the FPs give rise to bipartite networks, with edges existing between
projects and the organizations taking part in them. A version of the modularity
measure, adapted to bipartite networks, is presented. Communities are found so
as to maximize the bipartite modularity. Projects in the resulting communities
are shown to be topically differentiated.
