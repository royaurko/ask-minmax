Interdependent networks are ubiquitous in our society, ranging from
infrastructure to economics, and the study of their cascading behaviors using
percolation theory has attracted much attention in the recent years. To analyze
the percolation phenomena of these systems, different mathematical frameworks
have been proposed including generating functions, eigenvalues among some
others. These different frameworks approach the phase transition behaviors from
different angles, and have been very successful in shaping the different
quantities of interest including critical threshold, size of the giant
component, order of phase transition and the dynamics of cascading. These
methods also vary in their mathematical complexity in dealing with
interdependent networks that have additional complexity in terms of the
correlation among different layers of networks or links. In this work, we
review a particular approach of simple self-consistent probability equations,
and illustrate that it can greatly simplify the mathematical analysis for
systems ranging from single layer network to various different interdependent
networks. We give an overview on the detailed framework to study the nature of
the critical phase transition, value of the critical threshold and size of the
giant component for these different systems.
