Recent advances in biochemical computing, i.e., information processing with
cascades of primarily enzymatic reactions realizing computing gates, such as
AND, OR, etc., as well as progress in networking these gates and coupling of
the resulting systems to smart/responsive electrodes for output readout, have
opened new biosensing opportunities. Here we survey existing enabling research
results, as well as ideas and research avenues for future development of a new
paradigm of digitally operating biosensors logically processing multiple
biochemical signals through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular
reactions, yielding the final output signals as YES/NO responses. Such systems
can lead to high-fidelity biosensing compared to common single or parallel
sensing devices.
