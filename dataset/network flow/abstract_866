Honey bees use optical flow to avoid obstacles effectively. In this research
work similar methodology was tested on a simulated mobile robot. Simulation
framework was based on VRML and Simulink in a 3D world. Optical flow vectors
were calculated from a video scene captured by a virtual camera which was used
as inputs to a fuzzy logic controller. Fuzzy logic controller decided the
locomotion of the robot. Different fuzzy logic rules were evaluated. The robot
was able to navigate through complex static and dynamic environments
effectively, avoiding obstacles on its path.
