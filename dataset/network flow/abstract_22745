Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of hyperbolic type, i.e M is a
manifold admitting another metric of strictly negative curvature. In this paper
we study the geodesic flow restricted to the set of geodesics which are minimal
on the universal covering. In particular for surfaces we show that the
topological entropy of the minimal geodesics coincides with the volume entropy
of (M, g) generalizing work of Freire and Mane.
