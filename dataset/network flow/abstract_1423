Using the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database
[http://comtrade.un.org/db/] we construct the Google matrix of the world trade
network and analyze its properties for various trade commodities for all
countries and all available years from 1962 to 2009. The trade flows on this
network are classified with the help of PageRank and CheiRank algorithms
developed for the World Wide Web and other large scale directed networks. For
the world trade this ranking treats all countries on equal democratic grounds
independent of country richness. Still this method puts at the top a group of
industrially developed countries for trade in {\it all commodities}. Our study
establishes the existence of two solid state like domains of rich and poor
countries which remain stable in time, while the majority of countries are
shown to be in a gas like phase with strong rank fluctuations. A simple random
matrix model provides a good description of statistical distribution of
countries in two-dimensional rank plane. The comparison with usual ranking by
export and import highlights new features and possibilities of our approach.
