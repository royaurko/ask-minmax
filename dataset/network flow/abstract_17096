The conditional posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) is an effective
sensor resource management criteria for large, geographically distributed
sensor networks. Existing algorithms for distributed computation of the PCRLB
(dPCRLB) are based on raw observations leading to significant communication
overhead to the estimation mechanism. This letter derives distributed
computational techniques for determining the conditional dPCRLB for quantized,
decentralized sensor networks (CQ/dPCRLB). Analytical expressions for the
CQ/dPCRLB are derived, which are particularly useful for particle filter-based
estimators. The CQ/dPCRLB is compared for accuracy with its centralized
counterpart through Monte-Carlo simulations.
