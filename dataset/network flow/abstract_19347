We describe an efficient method of calculating the radiation pressure due to
spectral lines, including all the terms in the velocity gradient tensor. We
apply this method to calculate the two-dimensional, time-dependent structure of
winds from luminous disks. Qualitative features of our new models are very
similar to those we calculated including only the dominant terms in the tensor
(Proga, Stone & Drew 1998, hereafter PSD). In particular, we find that models
which displayed unsteady behaviour in PSD are also unsteady with the new
method, and gross properties of the winds, such as mass-loss rate and
characteristic velocity are not changed by the more accurate approach. The
largest change caused by the new method is in the disk-wind opening angle:
winds driven only by the disk radiation are more polar with the new method
while winds driven by the disk and central object radiation are typically more
equatorial. In the closing discussion, we provide further insight into the way
the geometry of the radiation field and consequent flow determines the time
properties of the flow.
