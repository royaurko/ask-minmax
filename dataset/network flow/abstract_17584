The Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem is equivalently formulated as a
convex optimization problem for a potential function. In the light of this
formulation an interative algorithm is developed for determining the solution.
It is a gradient flow algorithm and each iterate solves a linear elliptic
equation. Well-posedness and convergence of the proposed method are analyzed
and numerical findings are presented.
