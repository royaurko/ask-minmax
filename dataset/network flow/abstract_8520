We conceptualized a straightforward and flexible approach for random spatial
inhomogeneity by proposing the area-specific deployment (ASD) algorithm, which
takes into account the clustering tendency of users. In fact, the ASD method
has the advantage of achieving a more realistic heterogeneous deployment based
on limited planning inputs, while still preserving the stochastic character of
users position. We then applied this technique to different circumstances, and
developed spatial-level network algorithms for controlled and uncontrolled
cellular network deployments. Overall, the derived simulator tools will
effectively and easily be useful for designers and deployment planners modeling
a host of multi-coverage and multi-scale wireless network situations.
