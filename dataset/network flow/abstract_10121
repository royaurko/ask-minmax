Let $G$ be a connected nilpotent Lie group. Given probability-preserving
$G$-actions $(X_i,\S_i,\mu_i,u_i)$, $i=0,1,...,k$, and also polynomial maps
$\phi_i:\bbR\to G$, $i=1,...,k$, we consider the trajectory of a joining $\l$
of the systems $(X_i,\S_i,\mu_i,u_i)$ under the `off-diagonal' flow
  [(t,(x_0,x_1,x_2,...,x_k))\mapsto
(x_0,u_1^{\phi_1(t)}x_1,u_2^{\phi_2(t)}x_2,...,u_k^{\phi_k(t)}x_k).]
  It is proved that any joining $\l$ is equidistributed under this flow with
respect to some limit joining $\l'$. This is deduced from the stronger fact of
norm convergence for a system of multiple ergodic averages, related to those
arising in Furstenberg's approach to the study of multiple recurrence. It is
also shown that the limit joining $\l'$ is invariant under the subgroup of
$G^{k+1}$ generated by the image of the off-diagonal flow, in addition to the
diagonal subgroup.
