A novel mechanism for the sign change of the Hall effect in the flux flow
region is proposed. The difference $\delta n $ between the electron density at
the center of the vortex core and that far outside the vortex causes the
additional contribution to the Hall conductivity $\delta\sigma_{xy}=-\delta n
ec/B$. This contribution can be larger than the conventional one in the dirty
case $\Delta(T)\tau <1$. If the carrier density inside the core exceeds that
far outside, a double sign change may occur as a function of temperature.
