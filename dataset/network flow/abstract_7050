Statically reasoning in the presence of and about exceptions is challenging:
exceptions worsen the well-known mutual recursion between data-flow and
control-flow analysis. The recent development of pushdown control-flow analysis
for the {\lambda}-calculus hints at a way to improve analysis of exceptions: a
pushdown stack can precisely match catches to throws in the same way it matches
returns to calls. This work generalizes pushdown control-flow analysis to
object-oriented programs and to exceptions. Pushdown analysis of exceptions
improves precision over the next best analysis, Bravenboer and Smaragdakis's
Doop, by orders of magnitude. By then generalizing abstract garbage collection
to object-oriented programs, we reduce analysis time by half over pure pushdown
analysis. We evaluate our implementation for Dalvik bytecode on standard
benchmarks as well as several Android applications.
