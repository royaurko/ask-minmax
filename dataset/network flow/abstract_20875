Frequent topological changes due to high mobility is one of the main issues
in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs). In this paper, we model transmission
probabilities of 802.11p for VANETs and effect of these probabilities on
average transmission time. To evaluate the effect of these probabilities of
VANETs in routing protocols, we select Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Fish-eye
State Routing (FSR) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR). Framework of these
protocols with respect to their packet cost is also presented in this work. A
novel contribution of this work is enhancement of chosen protocols to obtain
efficient behavior. Extensive simulation work is done to prove and compare the
efficiency in terms of high throughput of enhanced versions with default
versions of protocols in NS-2. For this comparison, we choose three performance
metrics; throughput, End-to-End Delay (E2ED) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL)
in different mobilities and scalabilities. Finally, we deduce that enhanced DSR
(DSR-mod) outperforms other protocols by achieving 16% more packet delivery for
all scalabilities and 28% more throughput in selected mobilities than original
version of DSR (DSR-orig).
