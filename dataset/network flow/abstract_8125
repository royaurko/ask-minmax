Upflows observed at the edges of active regions have been proposed as the
source of the slow solar wind. In the particular case of Active Region (AR)
10942, where such an upflow has been already observed, we want to evaluate the
part of this upflow that actually remains confined in the magnetic loops that
connect AR10942 to AR10943. Both active regions were visible simultaneously on
the solar disk and were observed by STEREO/SECCHI EUVI. Using Hinode/EIS
spectra, we determine the Doppler shifts and densities in AR10943 and AR10942,
in order to evaluate the mass flows. We also perform magnetic field
extrapolations to assess the connectivity between AR10942 and AR10943. AR10943
displays a persistent downflow in Fe XII. Magnetic extrapolations including
both ARs show that this downflow can be connected to the upflow in AR10942. We
estimate that the mass flow received by AR10943 areas connected to AR10942
represents about 18% of the mass flow from AR10942. We conclude that the
upflows observed on the edge of active regions represent either large-scale
loops with mass flowing along them (accounting for about one-fifth of the total
mass flow in this example) or open magnetic field structures where the slow
solar wind originates.
