The stability of a long cylindrical domain in a phase-separating binary fluid
in an external shear flow is investigated by linear stability analysis. Using
the coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Stokes equations, the stability eigenvalues are
derived analytically for long wavelength perturbations, for arbitrary viscosity
contrast between the two phases. The shear flow is found to suppress and
sometimes completely stabilize both the hydrodynamic Rayleigh instability and
the thermodynamic instability of the cylinder against varicose perturbations,
by mixing with nonaxisymmetric perturbations. The results are consistent with
recent observations of a ``string phase'' in phase-separating fluids in shear.
