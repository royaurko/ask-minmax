Many partitioning methods may be used to partition a network into smaller
clusters while minimizing the number of cuts needed. However, other
considerations must also be taken into account when a network represents a real
system such as a power grid. In this paper we use a simulated annealing Monte
Carlo (MC) method to optimize initial clusters on the Florida high-voltage
power-grid network that were formed by associating each load with its "closest"
generator. The clusters are optimized to maximize internal connectivity within
the individual clusters and minimize the power deficiency or surplus that
clusters may otherwise have.
