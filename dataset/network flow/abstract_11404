This paper analyzes a nuclear reactor power signal that suffers from network
induced random delays in the shared data network while being fed-back to the
Reactor Regulating System (RRS). A detailed study is carried out to investigate
the self similarity of random delay dynamics due to the network traffic in
shared medium. The fractionality or selfsimilarity in the network induced delay
that corrupts the measured power signal coming from Self Powered Neutron
Detectors (SPND) is estimated and analyzed. As any fractional order randomness
is intrinsically different from conventional Gaussian kind of randomness, these
delay dynamics need to be handled efficiently, before reaching the controller
within the RRS. An attempt has been made to minimize the effect of the
randomness in the reactor power transient data with few classes of smoothing
filters. The performance measure of the smoothers with fractional order noise
consideration is also investigated into.
