Experimental data on K+ meson and proton sideward flow measured with the FOPI
detector at SIS/GSI in the reactions Ru+Ru at 1.69 AGeV and Ni+Ni at 1.93 AGeV
are presented. The K+ sideward flow is found to be anti-correlated (correlated)
with the one of protons at low (high) transverse momenta. When compared to the
predictions of a transport model, the data favour the existence of an in-medium
repulsive K+ nucleon potential.
