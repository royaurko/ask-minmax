Let $M$ be a closed oriented surface of negative Gaussian curvature and let
$\Omega$ be a non-exact 2-form. Let $\lambda$ be a small positive real number.
We show that the longitudinal KAM-cocycle of the magnetic flow given by $\la
\Omega$ is a coboundary if and only if the Gaussian curvature is constant and
$\Omega$ is a constant multiple of the area form.
