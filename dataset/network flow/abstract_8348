This brief paper further investigates the locally and globally adaptive
synchronization of an uncertain complex dynamical network. Several network
synchronization criteria are deduced. Especially, our hypotheses and designed
adaptive controllers for network synchronization are rather simple in form. It
is very useful for future practical engineering design. Moreover, numerical
simulations are also given to show the effectiveness of our synchronization
approaches.
