We considered the Edwards-Wilkinson model on a small-world network. We
studied the finite-size behavior of the surface width by performing exact
numerical diagonalization for the underlying coupling matrix. We found that the
spectrum exhibits a gap or a pseudo-gap, which is responsible for a finite
width in the thermodynamic limit for an arbitrarily weak but nonzero magnitude
of the random interactions.
