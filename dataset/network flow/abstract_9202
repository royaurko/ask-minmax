We study the tolerance of random networks to intentional attack, whereby a
fraction p of the most connected sites is removed. We focus on scale-free
networks, having connectivity distribution of P(k)~k^(-a) (where k is the site
connectivity), and use percolation theory to study analytically and numerically
the critical fraction p_c needed for the disintegration of the network, as well
as the size of the largest connected cluster. We find that even networks with
a<=3, known to be resilient to random removal of sites, are sensitive to
intentional attack. We also argue that, near criticality, the average distance
between sites in the spanning (largest) cluster scales with its mass, M, as
sqrt(M), rather than as log_k M, as expected for random networks away from
criticality. Thus, the disruptive effects of intentional attack become relevant
even before the critical threshold is reached.
