We study the problem of wireless network resilience to node failures from a
percolation-based perspective. In practical wireless networks, it is often the
case that the failure probability of a node depends on its degree (number of
neighbors). We model this phenomenon as a degree-dependent site percolation
process on random geometric graphs. In particular, we obtain analytical
conditions for the existence of phase transitions within this model.
Furthermore, in networks carrying traffic load, the failure of one node can
result in redistribution of the load onto other nearby nodes. If these nodes
fail due to excessive load, then this process can result in a cascading
failure. Using a simple but descriptive model, we show that the cascading
failure problem for large-scale wireless networks is equivalent to a
degree-dependent site percolation on random geometric graphs. We obtain
analytical conditions for cascades in this model.
