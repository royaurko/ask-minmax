The goal of this article is to obtain bounds on the coefficients of modular
and integral flow and tension polynomials of graphs. To this end we make use of
the fact that these polynomials can be realized as Ehrhart polynomials of
inside-out polytopes. Inside-out polytopes come with an associated relative
polytopal complex and, for a wide class of inside-out polytopes, we show that
this complex has a convex ear decomposition. This leads to the desired bounds
on the coefficients of these polynomials.
