The most promising mechanism acting towards damping the kink oscillations of
coronal loops is resonant absorption. In this context most of previous studies
neglected the effect of the obvious equilibrium flow along magnetic field
lines. The flows are in general sub-Alfv\'enic and hence comparatively slow.
Here we investigate the effect of an equilibrium flow on the resonant
absorption of linear kink MHD waves in a cylindrical magnetic flux tube with
the aim of determining the changes in the frequency of the forward and backward
propagating waves and in the modification of the damping times due to the flow.
A loop model with both the density and the longitudinal flow changing in the
radial direction is considered. We use the thin tube thin boundary (TTTB)
approximation in order to calculate the damping rates. The full resistive
eigenvalue problem is also solved without assuming the TTTB approximation.
Using the small ratio of flow and Alfv\'en speeds we derive simple analytical
expressions to the damping rate. The analytical expressions are in good
agreement with the resistive eigenmode calculations. Under typical coronal
conditions the effect of the flow on the damped kink oscillations is small when
the characteristic scale of the density layer is similar or smaller than the
characteristic width of the velocity layer. However, in the opposite situation
the damping rates can be significantly altered, specially for the backward
propagating wave which is undamped while the forward wave is overdamped.
