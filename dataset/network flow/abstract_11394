Now a day's Heterogeneous wireless network is a promising field of research
interest. Various challenges exist in this hybrid combination like load
balancing, resource management and so on. In this paper we introduce a reliable
load balancing architecture for heterogeneous wireless communications to ensure
certain level of quality of service. To conquer the problem of centralized and
distributed design, a semi distributed load balancing architecture for multiple
access networks is introduced. In this grid based design multiple Load and
Mobile Agent Management Units is incorporated. To prove the compactness of the
design, integrated reliability, signalling overhead and total processing time
is calculated. And finally simulation result shows that overall system
performance is improved by enhancing reliability, reducing signalling overhead
and processing time.
