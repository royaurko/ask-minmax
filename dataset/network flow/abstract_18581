Many methods have been developed to secure the network infrastructure and
communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection is a relatively new
addition to such techniques. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to find
out if someone has intrusion into or is trying to get it the network. One big
problem is amount of Intrusion which is increasing day by day. We need to know
about network attack information using IDS, then analysing the effect. Due to
the nature of IDSs which are solely signature based, every new intrusion cannot
be detected; so it is important to introduce artificial intelligence (AI)
methods / techniques in IDS. Introduction of AI necessitates the importance of
normalization in intrusions. This work is focused on classification of AI based
IDS techniques which will help better design intrusion detection systems in the
future. We have also proposed a support vector machine for IDS to detect Smurf
attack with much reliable accuracy.
