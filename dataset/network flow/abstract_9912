Effective potential of a charged dusty particle moving in homogeneous plasma
has a negative part that provides attraction between similarly charged dusty
particles. A depth of this potential well is great enough to ensure both
stability of crystal structure of dusty plasma and sizable value of surface
tension of a boundary surface of dusty region. The latter depends on the
orientation of the surface relative to the counter-ion flow, namely, it is
maximal and positive for the surface normal to the flow and minimal and
negative for the surface along the flow. For the most cases of dusty plasma in
a gas discharge, a value of the first of them is more than sufficient to ensure
stability of lenticular dusty phase void oriented across the counter-ion flow.
