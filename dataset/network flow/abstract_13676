Our study of abstract quasi-linear parabolic problems in time-weighted
L_p-spaces, begun in [17], is extended in this paper to include singular lower
order terms, while keeping low initial regularity. The results are applied to
reaction-diffusion problems, including Maxwell-Stefan diffusion, and to
geometric evolution equations like the surface-diffusion flow or the Willmore
flow. The method presented here will be applicable to other parabolic systems,
including free boundary problems.
