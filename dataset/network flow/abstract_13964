The existence of outflow and magnetic field in the inner region of hot
accretion flows have been confirmed by observations and numerical
magnetohydrodynamic simulations (MHD). We present self-similar solutions for
radiation inefficiently accretion flows (RIAF) around black holes in the
presence of outflow and global magnetic field. The influence of outflow is
taken into account by adopting a radius dependent of mass accretion rate $
\dot{M} = \dot{M}_{0}(r/r_{0})^{s} $ with $ s > 0 $. Also we consider
convection through a mixing length formalism to calculate convection parameter
$ \alpha_{con} $. Moreover we consider the additional magnetic field parameters
$ \beta_{r,\varphi,z}\big[= c^2_{r,\varphi,z}/(2 c^2_{s}) \big] $, where $
c^2_{r,\varphi,z} $ are the Alfv$\acute{e}$n sound speeds in three direction of
cylindrical coordinate. Our numerical results show that by increasing all
components of magnetic field, the surface density and rotational velocity
increase although the sound speed and radial infall velocity of the disc
decrease. Also we have found out that the existence of wind will lead to
reduction of surface density as well as rotational velocity. Moreover the
radial velocity, sound speed, advection parameter and the vertical thickness of
the disc will increase when outflow becomes important in the radiation
inefficiently accretion flow.
