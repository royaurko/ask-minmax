Higher flows of the Heisenberg ferromagnet equation and the
Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa equation are generalized into multi-component systems on
the basis of the Lax formulation. It is shown that there is a correspondence
between the multi-component systems through a gauge transformation. An
integrable semi-discretization of the multi-component higher Heisenberg
ferromagnet system is obtained.
