A simulation study using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory is
performed for the vortex state in two-component superconductors, such as
PrOs_4_Sb_12_. We investigate the flux flow and the pinning of the vortex sheet
structure. We find domain wall that traps half flux-quantum vortices and moves
with the flux flow. In the pinning case, we observe an emitting process of a
conventional vortex from the vortex sheet by combining a pair of half
flux-quantum vortices.
