Alterations of charges density on membranes (potentials) of plant cells by
ion currents lead to disbalance of Coulomb forces compressing membranes and
counteracting Hookean elastic forces. It should results in membrane vibrations
till establishment new equilibrium with generation of ultrasound and
electromagnetic radiations. Such vibrations lead to acoustical flows, power of
which is sufficient for water lift in trees, its degassing, for cycloses and
some electric phenomena in plants and so on. This phenomenon explains the known
observations of ultrasound noises in trees and redistribution of particles in
the phloem flow. Known supervisions and consideration of anatomy of plants
result in estimations of frequencies of the order of 150-200 kHz for acoustical
flows in xilem and three times bigger in phloem. The checking of offered
mechanism can be carrying out via investigation of acoustic and electromagnetic
radiation of plants.
