Modeling Internet growth is important both for understanding the current
network and to predict and improve its future. To date, Internet models have
typically attempted to explain a subset of the following characteristics:
network structure, traffic flow, geography, and economy. In this paper we
present a discrete, agent-based model, that integrates all of them. We show
that the model generates networks with topologies, dynamics, and (more
speculatively) spatial distributions that are similar to the Internet.
