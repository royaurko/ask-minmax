The Principal Component Analysis Network (PCANet), which is one of the
recently proposed deep learning architectures, achieves the state-of-the-art
classification accuracy in various databases. However, the performance of
PCANet may be degraded when dealing with color images. In this paper, a
Quaternion Principal Component Analysis Network (QPCANet), which is an
extension of PCANet, is proposed for color images classification. Compared to
PCANet, the proposed QPCANet takes into account the spatial distribution
information of color images and ensures larger amount of intra-class invariance
of color images. Experiments conducted on different color image datasets such
as Caltech-101, UC Merced Land Use, Georgia Tech face and CURet have revealed
that the proposed QPCANet achieves higher classification accuracy than PCANet.
