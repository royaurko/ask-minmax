To better understand the overlapping modular organization of large networks
with respect to flow, here we introduce the map equation for overlapping
modules. In this information-theoretic framework, we use the correspondence
between compression and regularity detection. The generalized map equation
measures how well we can compress a description of flow in the network when we
partition it into modules with possible overlaps. When we minimize the
generalized map equation over overlapping network partitions, we detect modules
that capture flow and determine which nodes at the boundaries between modules
should be classified in multiple modules and to what degree. With a novel
greedy search algorithm, we find that some networks, for example, the neural
network of C. Elegans, are best described by modules dominated by hard
boundaries, but that others, for example, the sparse European road network,
have a highly overlapping modular organization.
