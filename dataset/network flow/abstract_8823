We construct non-Lipshitz flow in $H^s$ for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation on the 2-torus of revolution with a Lipshitz or smooth metric . The
non-Lipshitz property holds for all $s<2/3$ for Lipshitz metric and $s<1/2$ for
smooth metric. Both coincide with the Sobolev exponents for uniform local
well-posedness.
