An 8.3 hour observation of the Abell 2256 galaxy cluster using the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer proportional counter array produced a high quality
spectrum in the 2 - 30 keV range. Joint fitting with the 0.7 - 11 keV spectrum
obtained with the Advanced Satellite for Astrophysics and Cosmology gas imaging
spectrometer gives an upperlimit of 2.3x10^-7 photons/cm^2/sec/keV for
non-thermal emission at 30 keV. This yields a lower limit to the mean magnetic
field of 0.36 micro Gauss (uG) and an upperlimit of 1.8x10^-13 ergs/cm^3 for
the cosmic-ray electron energy density. The resulting lower limit to the
central magnetic field is ~1 - 3 uG While a magnetic field of ~0.1 - 0.2 uG can
be created by galaxy wakes, a magnetic field of several uG is usually
associated with a cooling flow or, as in the case of the Coma cluster, a
subcluster merger. However, for A2256, the evidence for a merger is weak and
the main cluster shows no evidence of a cooling flow. Thus, there is presently
no satisfactory hypothesis for the origin of an average cluster magnetic field
as high as >0.36 uG in the A2256 cluster.
