More and more large data collections are gathered worldwide in various IT
systems. Many of them possess the networked nature and need to be processed and
analysed as graph structures. Due to their size they require very often usage
of parallel paradigm for efficient computation. Three parallel techniques have
been compared in the paper: MapReduce, its map-side join extension and Bulk
Synchronous Parallel (BSP). They are implemented for two different graph
problems: calculation of single source shortest paths (SSSP) and collective
classification of graph nodes by means of relational influence propagation
(RIP). The methods and algorithms are applied to several network datasets
differing in size and structural profile, originating from three domains:
telecommunication, multimedia and microblog. The results revealed that
iterative graph processing with the BSP implementation always and
significantly, even up to 10 times outperforms MapReduce, especially for
algorithms with many iterations and sparse communication. Also MapReduce
extension based on map-side join usually noticeably presents better efficiency,
although not as much as BSP. Nevertheless, MapReduce still remains the good
alternative for enormous networks, whose data structures do not fit in local
memories.
