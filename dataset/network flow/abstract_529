Statistical network calculus is the probabilistic extension of network
calculus, which uses a simple envelope approach to describe arrival traffic and
service available for the arrival traffic in a node. One of the key features of
network calculus is the possibility to describe the service available in a
network using a network service envelope constructed from the service envelopes
of the individual nodes constituting the network. It have been shown that the
end-to-end worst case performance measures computed using the network service
envelope is bounded by $ {\cal O} (H) $, where $H$ is the number of nodes
traversed by a flow. There have been many attempts to achieve a similar linear
scaling for end-to-end probabilistic performance measures but with limited
success. In this paper, we present a simple general proof of computing
end-to-end probabilistic performance measures using network calculus that grow
linearly in the number of nodes ($H$).
