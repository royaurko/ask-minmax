We discuss averaged turbulence modeling of multi-scales of length for an
incompressible Newtonian fluid, with the help of the maximum information
principle. We suppose that there exists a function basis to decompose the
turbulent fluctuations in a flow of our concern into the components associated
with various spatial scales and that there is a probability density function
$\pdf$ of these fluctuation components. The unbiased form for $\pdf$ is
determined and the turbulence model is closed, with the multi-scale
correlations up to the fourth order, through maximizing the information under
the constraints of equality and inequality for that flow. Due to the
computational difficulty to maximize the information, a closely related but
simple alternative objective is sought, like the determinant or the trace of
the second order correlations of the turbulent flow. Some preliminary results
and implications from the application to homogeneous turbulence are presented.
Some issues yet to be resolved are indicated.
