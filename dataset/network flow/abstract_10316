We consider the scattering of acoustic perturbations in a presence of a flow.
We suppose that the space can be split into a zone where the flow is uniform
and a zone where the flow is potential. In the first zone, we apply a
Prandtl-Glauert transformation to recover the Helmholtz equation. The
well-known setting of boundary element method for the Helmholtz equation is
available. In the second zone, the flow quantities are space dependent, we have
to consider a local resolution, namely the finite element method. Herein, we
carry out the coupling of these two methods and present various applications
and validation test cases. The source term is given through the decomposition
of an incident acoustic field on a section of the computational domain's
boundary.
