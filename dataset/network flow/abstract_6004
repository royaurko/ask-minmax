Data traffic over cellular networks is exhibiting an ongoing exponential
growth, increasing by an order of magnitude every year and has already
surpassed voice traffic. This increase in data traffic demand has led to a need
for solutions to enhance capacity provision, whereby traffic offloading to
Wi-Fi is one means that can enhance realised capacity. Though offloading to
Wi-Fi networks has matured over the years, a number of challenges are still
being faced by operators to its realization. In this article, we carry out a
survey of the practical challenges faced by operators in data traffic
offloading to Wi-Fi networks. We also provide recommendations to successfully
address these challenges.
