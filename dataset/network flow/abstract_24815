Multi-target tracking is an important problem in civilian and military
applications. This paper investigates distributed multi-target tracking using
autonomous sensor networks. Data association, which arises particularly in
multi-object scenarios, can be tackled by various solutions. We consider
sequential Monte Carlo implementations of the Probability Hypothesis Density
(PHD) filter based on random finite sets. This approach circumvents the data
association issue by jointly estimating all targets in the region of interest.
To this end, we develop the Multi-Sensor Particle PHD Filter (MS-PPHDF) as well
as a distributed version, called Diffusion Particle PHD Filter (D-PPHDF). Their
performance is evaluated in terms of the Optimal Subpattern Assignment (OSPA)
metric, benchmarked against a distributed extension of the Posterior
Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB), and compared to the performance of an
existing distributed PHD Particle Filter.
