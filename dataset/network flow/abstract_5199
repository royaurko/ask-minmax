We consider stagnation point flow away from a wall for creeping flow of
dilute polymer solutions. For a simplified flow geometry, we explicitly show
that a narrow region of strong polymer extension (a birefringent strand) forms
downstream of the stagnation point in the UCM model and extensions, like the
FENE-P model. These strands are associated with the existence of an essential
singularity in the stresses, which is induced by the fact that the stagnation
point makes the convective term in the constitutive equation into a singular
point. We argue that the mechanism is quite general, so that all flows that
have a separatrix going away from the stagnation point exhibit some singular
behaviour. These findings are the counterpart for wall stagnation points of the
recently discovered singular behaviour in purely elongational flows: the
underlying mechanism is the same while the different nature of the singular
stress behaviour reflects the different form of the velocity expansion close to
the stagnation point.
