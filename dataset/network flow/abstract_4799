We present a classification of energy flow variables for highly collimated
jets. Observables are constructed by taking moments of the energy flow and
forming scalars of a suitable Lorentz subgroup. The jet shapes are naturally
arranged in an expansion in both angular and energy resolution, allowing us to
derive the natural observables for describing an N-particle jet. We classify
the leading variables that characterize jets with up to 4 particles. We
rediscover the familiar jet mass, angularities, and planar flow, which dominate
the lowest order substructure variables. We also discover several new
observables and we briefly discuss their physical interpretation.
