This paper addresses the problems of disparity and optical flow partitioning
based on the brightness invariance assumption. We investigate new variational
approaches to these problems with Potts priors and possibly box constraints.
For the optical flow partitioning, our model includes vector-valued data and an
adapted Potts regularizer. Using the notation of asymptotically level stable
functions we prove the existence of global minimizers of our functionals. We
propose a modified alternating direction method of minimizers. This iterative
algorithm requires the computation of global minimizers of classical univariate
Potts problems which can be done efficiently by dynamic programming. We prove
that the algorithm converges both for the constrained and unconstrained
problems. Numerical examples demonstrate the very good performance of our
partitioning method.
