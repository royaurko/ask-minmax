Many physical systems exhibit plastic flow when subjected to slow steady
shear. A unified picture of plastic flow is still lacking; however, there is an
emerging theoretical understanding of such flows based on irreversible motions
of the constituent ``particles'' of the material. Depending on the specific
system, various irreversible events have been studied, such as T1 events in
foam and shear transformation zones (STZ's) in amorphous solids. This paper
presents an experimental study of the T1 events in a model, two-dimensional
foam: bubble rafts. In particular, I report on the connection between the
distribution of T1 events and the behavior of the average stress and average
velocity profiles during both the initial elastic response of the bubble raft
and the subsequent plastic flow at sufficiently high strains.
