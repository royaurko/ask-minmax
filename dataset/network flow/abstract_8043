We present a numerical study of the statistical properties of
three-dimensional dissipative turbulent flows at scales larger than the forcing
scale. Our results indicate that the large scale flow can be described to a
large degree by the truncated Euler equations with the predictions of the zero
flux solutions given by absolute equilibrium theory, both for helical and
non-helical flows. Thus, the functional shape of the large scale spectra can be
predicted provided that scales sufficiently larger than the forcing length
scale but also sufficiently smaller than the box size are examined. Deviations
from the predictions of absolute equilibrium are discussed.
