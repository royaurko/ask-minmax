Network of Information (NetInf) is a term coined for networks which unlike
contemporary network are not node centric. As the name indicates, information
supersedes nodes in the network. In this report, we propose an architecture of
mobile node for NetInf. We call it NetInf Mobile Node. It is an extension of
the basic node architecture proposed for NetInf. It is compatible to NetInf and
TCP/IP based networks. The Virtual Node Layer modules in the architecture
provide support for managing mobility, power consumption of the node as well
data relaying/storing services. In- ner/Outer Locator Construction Routers (I/O
LCTR) are two functions introduced in NetInf mobile nodes to operate between
NetInf and non- NetInf sites. The basic purpose of NetInf mobile node is to
maintain the QoS during mobility events. The handoff/handover are critical
situations during mobility where chances of QoS degradation of an ongoing
session are high. This report presents one such scenario in which QoS of an
appli- cation is maintained during a handoff situations in heterogeneous
wireless network environment through our proposed algorithm.
