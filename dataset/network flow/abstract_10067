We studied the relation between the initial geometry anisotropy and the
anisotropic flow in a multiphase transport model (AMPT) for both Au+Au and
Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. It is found that unlike the
elliptic flow $v_2$, little centrality dependence of the triangular flow $v_3$
is observed. After removing the initial geometry effect, $v_3/\epsilon_3$
increases with the transverse particle density, which is similar to
$v_2/\epsilon_2$. The transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence of $v_3$ from
identified particles is qualitatively similar to the $p_T$ dependence of $v_2$.
