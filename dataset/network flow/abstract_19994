We develop a family of expanded mixed Multiscale Finite Element Methods
(MsFEMs) and their hybridizations for second-order elliptic equations. This
formulation expands the standard mixed Multiscale Finite Element formulation in
the sense that four unknowns (hybrid formulation) are solved simultaneously:
pressure, gradient of pressure, velocity and Lagrange multipliers. We use
multiscale basis functions for the both velocity and gradient of pressure. In
the expanded mixed MsFEM framework, we consider both cases of separable-scale
and non-separable spatial scales. We specifically analyze the methods in three
categories: periodic separable scales, $G$- convergence separable scales, and
continuum scales. When there is no scale separation, using some global
information can improve accuracy for the expanded mixed MsFEMs. We present
rigorous convergence analysis for expanded mixed MsFEMs. The analysis includes
both conforming and nonconforming expanded mixed MsFEM. Numerical results are
presented for various multiscale models and flows in porous media with shales
to illustrate the efficiency of the expanded mixed MsFEMs.
