In this paper we study an approximation scheme for an Hamilton-Jacobi
equation of Eikonal type defined on a network. We introduce an appropriate
notion of viscosity solution for this class of equations (see \cite{sc}) and we
prove that an approximation scheme of semi-Lagrangian type converges to the
unique solution of the problem.
