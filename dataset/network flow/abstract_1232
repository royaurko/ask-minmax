Multipath routing is the use of multiple potential paths through a network in
order to enhance fault tolerance, optimize bandwidth use, and improve security.
Selecting data flow paths based on cost addresses performance issues but
ignores security threats. Attackers can disrupt the data flows by attacking the
links along the paths. Denial-of-service, remote exploitation, and other such
attacks launched on any single link can severely limit throughput. Networks can
be secured using a secure quality of service approach in which a sender
disperses data along multiple secure paths. In this secure multi-path approach,
a portion of the data from the sender is transmitted over each path and the
receiver assembles the data fragments that arrive. One of the largest
challenges in secure multipath routing is determining the security threat level
along each path and providing a commensurate level of encryption along that
path. The research presented explores the effects of real-world attack
scenarios in systems, and gauges the threat levels along each path. Optimal
sampling and compression of network data is provided via compressed sensing.
The probability of the presence of specific attack signatures along a network
path is determined using machine learning techniques. Using these
probabilities, information assurance levels are derived such that security
measures along vulnerable paths are increased.
