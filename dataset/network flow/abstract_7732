The fluid dynamics video that is presented here outlines recent advances in
the simulation of multiphase cellular blood flow through the direct numerical
simulations of deformable red blood cells (RBCs) demonstrated through several
numerical experiments. Videos show particle deformation, shear stress on the
particle surface, and the formation of particle clusters in both
Hagen-Poiseuille and shear flow.
