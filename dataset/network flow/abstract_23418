The boundary conditions for the ideal MHD equations on a plane dis-
continuity surface are investigated. It is shown that, for a given mass flux
through a discontinuity, its type depends only on the relation between inclina-
tion angles of a magnetic field. Moreover, the conservation laws on a surface
of discontinuity allow changing a discontinuity type with gradual (continu-
ous) changes in the conditions of plasma flow. Then there are the so-called
transition solutions that satisfy simultaneously two types of discontinuities.
We obtain all transition solutions on the basis of the complete system of
boundary conditions for the MHD equations. We also found the expression
describing a jump of internal energy of the plasma flowing through the dis-
continuity. Firstly, this allows constructing a generalized scheme of possible
continuous transitions between MHD discontinuities. Secondly, it enables the
examination of the dependence of plasma heating by plasma density and
configuration of the magnetic field near the discontinuity surface, i.e., by
the type of the MHD discontinuity. It is shown that the best conditions for
heating are carried out in the vicinity of a reconnecting current layer near
the areas of reverse currents. The result can be helpful in explaining the
temperature distributions inside the active regions in the solar corona during
flares observed by modern space observatories in soft and hard X-rays.
