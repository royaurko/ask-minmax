Combining scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron-beam-induced
current (EBIC) imaging with transport measurements, it is shown that the
current flowing across a two-terminal oxide-based capacitor-like structure is
preferentially confined in areas localized at defects. As the thin-film device
switches between two different resistance states, the distribution and
intensity of the current paths, appearing as bright spots, change. This implies
that switching and memory effects are mainly determined by the conducting
properties along such paths. A model based on the storage and release of charge
carriers within the insulator seems adequate to explain the observed memory
effect.
