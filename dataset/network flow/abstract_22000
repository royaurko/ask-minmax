We performed high resolution numerical simulations of homogenous and
isotropic compressible turbulence, with an average 3D Mach number close to 0.3.
We study the statistical properties of intermittency for velocity, density and
entropy. For the velocity field, which is the primary quantity that can be
compared to the isotropic incompressible case, we find no statistical
differences in its behavior in the inertial range due either to the slight
compressibility or to the different dissipative mechanism. For the density
field, we find evidence of ``front-like'' structures, although no shocks are
produced by the simulation.
