Network penetration testing identifies the exploits and vulnerabilities those
exist within computer network infrastructure and help to confirm the security
measures. The objective of this paper is to explain methodology and methods
behind penetration testing and illustrate remedies over it, which will provide
substantial value for network security Penetration testing should model real
world attacks as closely as possible. An contributorized and scheduled penetration
testing will probably detected by IDS (Intrusion Detection System). Network
penetration testing is done by either or manual automated tools. Penetration
test can gather evidence of vulnerability in the network. Successful testing
provides indisputable evidence of the problem as well as starting point for
prioritizing remediation. Penetration testing focuses on high severity
vulnerabilities and there are no false positive.
