State-of-the-art techniques for probability sampling of users of online
social networks (OSNs) are based on random walks on a single social relation
(typically friendship). While powerful, these methods rely on the social graph
being fully connected. Furthermore, the mixing time of the sampling process
strongly depends on the characteristics of this graph. In this paper, we
observe that there often exist other relations between OSN users, such as
membership in the same group or participation in the same event. We propose to
exploit the graphs these relations induce, by performing a random walk on their
union multigraph. We design a computationally efficient way to perform
multigraph sampling by randomly selecting the graph on which to walk at each
iteration. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through (i) simulation
in synthetic graphs, and (ii) measurements of Last.fm - an Internet website for
music with social networking features. More specifically, we show that
multigraph sampling can obtain a representative sample and faster convergence,
even when the individual graphs fail, i.e., are disconnected or highly
clustered.
