Parker problem in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is considered. Poloidal
shear into the toroidal flow generated by the Hall effect is incorporated. This
is found to lead to a {\it triple deck} structure for the Parker problem in
Hall MHD, with the magnetic field falling off in the intermediate
Hall-resistive region more steeply (like \normalfont $1/x^3$) than that (like
\normalfont$1/x$) in the outer ideal MHD region.
