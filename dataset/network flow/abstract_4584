In social networks, link prediction predicts missing links in current
networks and new or dissolution links in future networks, is important for
mining and analyzing the evolution of social networks. In the past decade, many
works have been done about the link prediction in social networks. The goal of
this paper is to comprehensively review, analyze and discuss the
state-of-the-art of the link prediction in social networks. A systematical
category for link prediction techniques and problems is presented. Then link
prediction techniques and problems are analyzed and discussed. Typical
applications of link prediction are also addressed. Achievements and roadmaps
of some active research groups are introduced. Finally, some future challenges
of the link prediction in social networks are discussed.
