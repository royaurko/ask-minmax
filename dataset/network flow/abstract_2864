We study the area preserving curve shortening flow with Neumann free boundary
conditions outside of a convex domain in the Euclidean plane. Under certain
conditions on the initial curve the flow does not develop any singularity, and
it subconverges smoothly to an arc of a circle sitting outside of the given
fixed domain and enclosing the same area as the initial curve.
