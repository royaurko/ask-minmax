Coarse-grained simulations are used to demonstrate that knotted filaments in
shear flow at zero Reynolds number exhibit remarkably rich dynamic behaviour.
For stiff filaments that are weakly deformed by the shear forces, the knotted
filaments rotate like rigid objects in the flow. But away from this regime the
interplay between between shear forces and the flexibility of the filament
leads to intricate regular and chaotic modes of motion that can be divided into
distinct families. The set of accessible mode families depends to first order
on a dimensionless number that relates the filament length, the elastic
modulus, the friction per unit length and the shear rate.
