A non-static solution of Einstein's field equations of General Relativity
representing the gravitational field of an axisymmetric radiation flow is
obtained using the Eddington or the Kerr-Schild form for the metric. A solution
obtained here manifestly corresponds to the Kerr metric with its
mass-parameter, $m$, being an arbitrary function of the advanced (retarded)
null-time coordinate. Then, when $m$ is constant, the solution reduces to the
standard Kerr metric expressed in terms of the used null coordinate. Further,
when the angular momentum parameter, $a$, a constant here, is set to zero, the
solution reduces to the Vaidya metric expressed in terms of the used
null-coordinate.
