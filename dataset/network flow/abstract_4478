Our general motivation is to answer the question: "What is a model of
concurrent computation?". As a preliminary exercise, we study dataflow
networks. We develop a very general notion of model for asynchronous networks.
The "Kahn Principle", which states that a network built from functional nodes
is the least fixpoint of a system of equations associated with the network, has
become a benchmark for the formal study of dataflow networks. We formulate a
generalized version of the Kahn Principle, which applies to a large class of
non-deterministic systems, in the setting of abstract asynchronous networks;
and prove that the Kahn Principle holds under certain natural assumptions on
the model. We also show that a class of models, which represent networks that
compute over arbitrary event structures, generalizing dataflow networks which
compute over streams, satisfy these assumptions.
