Several approaches have been proposed to the problem of provisioning traffic
engineering between core network nodes in Internet Service Provider (ISP)
networks. Such approaches aim to minimize network delay, increase capacity, and
enhance security services between two core (relay) network nodes, an ingress
node and an egress node. MATE (Multipath Adaptive Traffic Engineering) has been
proposed for multipath adaptive traffic engineering between an ingress node
(source) and an egress node (destination) to distribute the network flow among
multiple disjoint paths. Its novel idea is to avoid network congestion and
attacks that might exist in edge and node disjoint paths between two core
network nodes.
  This paper proposes protection schemes over asymmetric channels. Precisely,
the paper aims to develop an adaptive, robust, and reliable traffic engineering
scheme to improve performance and reliability of communication networks. This
scheme will also provision Quality of Server (QoS) and protection of traffic
engineering to maximize network efficiency. Specifically, S-MATE (secure MATE)
is proposed to protect the network traffic between two core nodes (routers,
switches, etc.) in a cloud network. S-MATE secures against a single link
attack/failure by adding redundancy in one of the operational redundant paths
between the sender and receiver nodes. It is also extended to secure against
multiple attacked links. The proposed scheme can be applied to secure core
networks such as optical and IP networks.
