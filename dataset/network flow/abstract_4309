The entirely orbital self-organized dopant percolative filamentary model
describes many counter-intuitive chemical trends in oxide superconductors
quantitatively, especially the high superconductive transition temperatures Tc.
According to rules previously used successfully for network glasees, the host
networks are marginally stable mechanically, and the high Tc's are caused by
network softening, which produces large electron-phonon interactions at
interlayer dopants for states near the Fermi energy.
