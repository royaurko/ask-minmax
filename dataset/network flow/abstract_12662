A general notion of algebraic conditional plausibility measures is defined.
Probability measures, ranking functions, possibility measures, and (under the
appropriate definitions) sets of probability measures can all be viewed as
defining algebraic conditional plausibility measures. It is shown that
algebraic conditional plausibility measures can be represented using Bayesian
networks.
