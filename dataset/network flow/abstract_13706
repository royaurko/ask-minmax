We study the formation of caustics in vortex-dominated \flows. We \find that
only particles starting within a critical distance of a vortex which scales as
the square roots of the particle inertia and the circulation can form sling
caustics. We show that particles starting in an annular region around this
critical radius contribute the densest clusters in the \flow. The large density
spikes occurring for such particles, even at small inertia, are indicative that
these particles will experience large collision rates.
