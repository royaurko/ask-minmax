Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci at
very stringent levels of statistical significance across many different human
traits. However, it is now clear that very large samples (n~10^4-10^5) are
needed to find the majority of genetic variants underlying risk for most human
diseases. Therefore, the field has engaged itself in a race to increase study
sample sizes with some studies yielding very successful results but also
studies which provide little or no new insights. This project started early on
in this new wave of studies and I decided to use an alternative approach that
uses prior biological knowledge to improve both interpretation and power of
GWAS. The project aimed to a) implement and develop new gene-based methods to
derive gene-level statistics to use GWAS in well established system biology
tools; b) use of these gene-level statistics in networks and gene-set analyses
of GWAS data; c) mine GWAS of neuropsychiatric disorders using gene, gene-sets
and integrative biology analyses with gene-expression studies; and d) explore
the ability of these methods to improve the analysis GWAS on disease
sub-phenotypes which usually suffer of very small sample sizes.
