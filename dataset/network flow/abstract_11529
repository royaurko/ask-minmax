Manipulation is an important issue for both developed and emerging stock
markets. For the study of manipulation, it is critical to analyze investor
behavior in the stock market. In this paper, an analysis of the full
transaction records of over a hundred stocks in a one-year period is conducted.
For each stock, a trading network is constructed to characterize the relations
among its investors. In trading networks, nodes represent investors and a
directed link connects a stock seller to a buyer with the total trade size as
the weight of the link, and the node strength is the sum of all edge weights of
a node. For all these trading networks, we find that the node degree and node
strength both have tails following a power-law distribution. Compared with
non-manipulated stocks, manipulated stocks have a high lower bound of the
power-law tail, a high average degree of the trading network and a low
correlation between the price return and the seller-buyer ratio. These findings
may help us to detect manipulated stocks.
