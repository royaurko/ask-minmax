Synthetic biology brings together concepts and techniques from engineering
and biology. In this field, computer-aided design (CAD) is necessary in order
to bridge the gap between computational modeling and biological data. An
application named TinkerCell has been created in order to serve as a CAD tool
for synthetic biology. TinkerCell is a visual modeling tool that supports a
hierarchy of biological parts. Each part in this hierarchy consists of a set of
attributes that define the part, such as sequence or rate constants. Models
that are constructed using these parts can be analyzed using various C and
Python programs that are hosted by TinkerCell via an extensive C and Python
API. TinkerCell supports the notion of a module, which are networks with
interfaces. Such modules can be connected to each other, forming larger modular
networks. Because TinkerCell associates parameters and equations in a model
with their respective part, parts can be loaded from databases along with their
parameters and rate equations. The modular network design can be used to
exchange modules as well as test the concept of modularity in biological
systems. The flexible modeling framework along with the C and Python API allows
TinkerCell to serve as a host to numerous third-party algorithms. TinkerCell is
a free and open-source project under the Berkeley Software Distribution
license. Downloads, documentation, and tutorials are available at
