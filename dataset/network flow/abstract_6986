The dynamics of fluctuating electric field structures in the edge of the
TJ-II stellarator, that display zonal flow-like traits, is studied. These
structures have been shown to be global and affect particle transport
dynamically [J.A. Alonso et al., Nucl. Fus. 52 063010 (2012)]. In this article
we discuss possible drive (Reynolds stress) and damping (Neoclassical
viscosity, geodesic transfer) mechanisms for the associated ExB velocity. We
show that: (a) while the observed turbulence-driven forces can provide the
necessary perpendicular acceleration, a causal relation could not be firmly
established, possibly because of the locality of the Reynolds stress
measurements, (b) the calculated neoclassical viscosity and damping times are
comparable to the observed zonal flow relaxation times, and (c) although an
accompanying density modulation is observed to be associated to the zonal flow,
it is not consistent with the excitation of pressure side-bands, like those
present in geodesic acoustic oscillations, caused by the compression of the ExB
flow field.
