We compute the one-loop beta functions of the cosmological constant, Newton's
constant and the topological mass in topologically massive supergravity in
three dimensions. We use a variant of the proper time method supplemented by a
simple choice of cutoff function. We find that the dimensionless coefficient of
the Chern-Simons term, $\nu$, has vanishing beta function. The flow of the
cosmological constant and Newton's constant depends on $\nu$; we study
analytically the structure of the flow and its fixed points in the limits of
small and large $\nu$.
