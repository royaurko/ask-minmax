We make several improvements on the results of M.-T. Wang in [8] and his
joint paper with M.-P. Tsui [7] concerning the long time existence and
convergence for solutions of mean curvature flow in higher co-dimension. Both
the curvature condition and lower bound of $*\Omega$ are weakened. New
applications are also obtained.
