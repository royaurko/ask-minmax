We address the problem of Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) and describe
centralized Self Organizing Network (SON) solutions that can optimize
connected-mode mobility Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Our solution extends
the earlier work of eICIC parameter optimization [7], to heterogeneous networks
with mobility, and outline methods of progressive complexity that optimize the
Retaining/Offloading Bias which are macro/pico views of Cell Individual Offset
parameters. Simulation results under real LTE network deployment assumptions of
a US metropolitan area demonstrate the effects of such solutions on the
mobility KPIs. To our knowledge, this solution is the first that demonstrates
the joint optimization of eICIC and MRO.
