We introduce a toy model displaying the avalanche dynamics of failure in
scale-free networks. In the model, the network growth is based on the
Barab\'asi and Albert model and each node is assigned a capacity or tolerance,
which is constant irrespective of node index. The degree of each node increases
over time. When the degree of a node exceeds its capacity, it fails and each
link connected to it is is rewired to other unconnected nodes by following the
preferential attachment rule. Such a rewiring edge may trigger another failure.
This dynamic process can occur successively, and it exhibits a self-organized
critical behavior in which the avalanche size distribution follows a power law.
The associated exponent is $\tau \approx 2.6(1)$. The entire system breaks down
when any rewired edges cannot locate target nodes: the time at which this
occurs is referred to as the breaking time. We obtain the breaking time as a
function of the capacity. Moreover, using extreme value statistics, we
determine the distribution function of the breaking time.
