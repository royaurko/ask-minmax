This research explores the role and representation of network structure for
LTI Systems. We demonstrate that transfer functions contain no structural
information without more assumptions being made about the system, assumptions
that we believe are unreasonable when dealing with truly complex systems. We
then introduce Dynamical Structure Functions as an alternative, graphical-model
based representation of LTI systems that contain both dynamical and structural
information of the system. We use Dynamical Structure to prove necessary and
sufficient conditions for estimating structure from data, and demonstrate, for
example, the danger of attempting to use steady-state information to estimate
network structure.
