We investigate the effect of using different distance estimators on the
recovery of the peculiar velocity field of galaxies using Potent. An
inappropriate choice of distance estimator will give rise to spurious flows. We
discuss methods of minimising these biases and the levels of accuracy required
of distance estimators to retrieve velocity fields to a given standard.
