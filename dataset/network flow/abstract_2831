In this paper we have constructed an approximation for the Harris flow and
the Arratia flow using a sequence of independent stationary Gaussian processes
as a perturbation. We have established what should be the relationship between
the step of approximation and smoothness of the covariance of the perturbing
processes in order to have convergence of the approximating functions to the
Arratia flow.
