A simple agent-based model (ABM) of the evolution of faith-based systems
(FBS) in human social networks is presented. In the model, each agent
subscribes to a single FBS, and may be converted to share a different agent's
FBS during social interactions. FBSs and agents each possess heritable
quantitative traits that affect the probability of transmission of FBSs. The
influence of social network conditions on the intermediate and final
macroscopic states is examined.
