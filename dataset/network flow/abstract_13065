We classify quasiconformal Anosov flows whose strong stable and unstable
distributions are at least two dimensional and the sum of these two
distributions is smooth. We deduce from this classification result the complete
classification of volume-preserving quasiconformal diffeomorphisms whose stable
and unstable distributions are at least two dimensional. Our central idea is to
take a good time change so that perodic orbits are equi-distributed with
respect to a lebesgue measure.
