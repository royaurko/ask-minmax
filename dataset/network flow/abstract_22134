We examine the statistics of active scalar fluctuations in high-Rayleigh
number fingering convection with high-resolution three-dimensional numerical
experiments. The one-point distribution of buoyancy fluctuations is found to
present significantly non-Gaussian tails.
  A modified theory based on an original approach by Yakhot (1989) is used to
model the active scalar distributions as a function of the conditional
expectation values of scalar dissipation and fluxes in the flow. Simple models
for these two quantities highlight the role of blob-like coherent structures
for scalar statistics in fingering convection.
