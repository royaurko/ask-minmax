A method to couple interparticle contact models with Stokesian dynamics (SD)
is introduced to simulate colloidal aggregates under flow conditions. The
contact model mimics both the elastic and plastic behavior of the cohesive
connections between particles within clusters. Owing to this, clusters can
maintain their structures under low stress while restructuring or even breakage
may occur under sufficiently high stress conditions. SD is an efficient method
to deal with the long-ranged and many-body nature of hydrodynamic interactions
for low Reynolds number flows. By using such a coupled model, the restructuring
of colloidal aggregates under stepwise increasing shear flows was studied.
Irreversible compaction occurs due to the increase of hydrodynamic stress on
clusters. Results show that the greater part of the fractal clusters are
compacted to rod-shaped packed structures, while the others show isotropic
compaction.
