On directed and undirected Barabasi-Albert networks the Ising model with spin
S=1/2 in the presence of a kind of noise is now studied through Monte Carlo
simulations. The noise spectrum P(n) follows a power law, where P(n) is the
probability of flipping randomly select n spins at each time step. The noise
spectrum P(n) is introduced to mimic the self-organized criticality as a model
influence of a complex environment. In this model, different from the square
lattice, the order-disorder phase transition of the order parameter is not
observed. For directed Barabasi-Albert networks the magnetisation tends to zero
exponentially and for undirected Barabasi-Albert networks, it remains constant.
