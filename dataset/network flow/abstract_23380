The toe pads of frogs consist of soft hexagonal structures and a viscous
liquid contained between and within the hexagonal structures. It has been
hypothesized that this configuration creates adhesion by allowing for long
range capillary forces, or alternatively, by allowing for exit of the liquid
and thus improving contact of the toe pad. In this work we suggest interaction
between viscosity and elasticity as a mechanism to create temporary adhesion,
even in the absence of capillary effects or van der Waals forces. We initially
illustrate this concept experimentally by a simplified configuration consisting
of two surfaces connected by a liquid bridge and elastic springs. We then
utilize poroelastic mixture theory and model frog's toe pads as an elastic
porous medium, immersed within a viscous liquid and pressed against a rigid
rough surface. The flow between the surface and the toe pad is modeled by the
lubrication approximation. Inertia is neglected and analysis of the
elastic-viscous dynamics yields a governing partial differential equation
describing the flow and stress within the porous medium. Several solutions of
the governing equation are presented and show a temporary adhesion due to
stress created at the contact surface between the solids. This work thus may
explain how some frogs (such as the torrent frog) maintain adhesion underwater
and the reason for the periodic repositioning of frogs' toe pads during
adhesion to surfaces.
