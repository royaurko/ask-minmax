A new physical mechanism of the parallel acceleration of a turbulent
magnetized plasma is discovered by using a Fokker-Planck phase space stochastic
transport equation. It is found that the random walk of a charged particle is
correlated with the random change of the parallel velocity due to the radial
electric field and the magnetic moment conservation. This correlation leads to
a parallel acceleration of the plasma with a finite parallel fluid flow.
