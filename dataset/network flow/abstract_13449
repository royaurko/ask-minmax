The locus of probability flow in Quantum Mechanics and information is
explored. We explore loops, loop sequences and loop surfaces in the statistical
geodesics. Having known about the loop character of the statistical geodesics
in probability space, we discuss wider physical aspects of consequences of the
geometry of the probabilities in the form of loop sequences and loop surfaces.
These are interpreted as the locus of probability flow. A deeper philosophical
observation reveals that these loops, loop sequences and loop surfaces are the
information grids. These investigations in many ways could be significant not
only in the research in Statistics, but also in Mathematics, and Physics in
general, and entropy, gravity and information theory in specific.
