We introduce a method to transform multivariate time series into multiplex
networks, and we illustrate how to extract important information on high
dimensional dynamical systems from the topological analysis of the derived
networks. In particular, we focus on both diffusively and globally coupled
chaotic maps, showing that multiplex measures such as the interlayer mutual
information accurately describe and quantify: (i) the information flow among
degrees of freedom, (ii) the transition between different dynamical phases, and
(iii) the onset of various types of synchronization. The method is general and
scalable, and can be efficiently used for the analysis of multivariate time
series deriving from physical, biological or socio-economic systems.
