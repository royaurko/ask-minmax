This lecture deals with glassy dynamics and aging in disordered systems.
Special emphasis is put on dynamic mean field theory. In the first part I
present some of the systems of interest, in particular spin-glasses,
supercooled liquids and glasses, drift, creep and pinning of a particle in a
random potential, neural networks, graph partitioning as an example of
combinatorial optimisation, the K-sat problem and the minority game as a model
for the behaviour of agents on markets. The second part deals with the dynamics
of the spherical p-spin-glass with long ranged interactions. This model is a
prototype for glassy dynamics. The equations of motion for correlation- and
response-functions are derived and solutions above and below the freezing
temperature are investigated. At the end I discuss the so called crossover
region and aging in glasses. The commonly used mode coupling theory results in
equations of motion identical to those of the $p$-spin model above the
dynamical transition temperature. The p-spin model is extended introducing the
random interactions as slow dynamical variables as well. This takes changes in
the configuration of cages into account. This is an activated process.
Depending on the waiting time, equilibrium or aging is found.
