New measurements of short-range and long-range two-particle correlations,
azimuthal anisotropy, and event-by-event fluctuations from the STAR experiment
for sqrt{s_{NN}}= 130 and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions are summarized. Striking
evidence is presented for large, non-statistical fluctuations in mean
transverse momentum. Descriptions of the data in terms of phenomenological
source function models are also presented.
