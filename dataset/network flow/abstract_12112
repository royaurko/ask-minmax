The phase ordering dynamics of coupled chaotic maps on fractal networks are
investigated. The statistical properties of the systems are characterized by
means of the persistence probability of equivalent spin variables that define
the phases. The persistence saturates and phase domains freeze for all values
of the coupling parameter as a consequence of the fractal structure of the
networks, in contrast to the phase transition behavior previously observed in
regular Euclidean lattices. Several discontinuities and other features found in
the saturation persistence curve as a function of the coupling are explained in
terms of changes of stability of local phase configurations on the fractals.
