We investigate two types of chimera states, i.e., patterns consisting of
coexisting spatially separated domains with coherent and incoherent dynamics,
in ring networks of Stuart-Landau oscillators with symmetry-breaking coupling,
under the influence of noise. Amplitude chimeras are characterized by
temporally periodic dynamics throughout the whole network, but spatially
incoherent behavior with respect to the amplitudes in a part of the system;
they are long-living transients. Chimera death states generalize chimeras to
stationary inhomogeneous patterns (oscillation death), which combine spatially
coherent and incoherent domains. We analyze the impact of random perturbations,
addressing the question of robustness of chimera states in the presence of
white noise. We further consider the effect of symmetries applied to random
initial conditions.
