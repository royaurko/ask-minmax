As the most competitive solution for next-generation network,
software-defined network (SDN) and its dominant implementation OpenFlow, are
attracting more and more interests. But besides convenience and flexibility,
SDN/OpenFlow also introduces new kinds of limitations and security issues. Of
these limitations, the most obvious and maybe the most neglected one, is the
flow table capacity of SDN/OpenFlow switches.
  In this paper, we proposed a novel inference attack targeting at SDN/OpenFlow
network, which is motivated by the limited flow table capacities of
SDN/OpenFlow switches and the following measurable network performance decrease
resulting from frequent interactions between data plane and control plane when
the flow table is full. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposed
inference attack model of this kind for SDN/OpenFlow. We also implemented an
inference attack framework according to our model and examined its efficiency
and accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our framework can infer
the network parameters(flow table capacity and flow table usage) with an
accuracy of 80% or higher. These findings give us a deeper understanding of
SDN/OpenFlow limitations and serve as guidelines to future improvements of
SDN/OpenFlow.
