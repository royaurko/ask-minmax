The discrete Lax operators with the spectral parameter on an algebraic curve
are defined. A hierarchy of commuting flows on the space of such operators is
constructed. It is shown that these flows are linearized by the spectral
transform and can be explicitly solved in terms of the theta-functions of the
spectral curves. The Hamiltonian theory of the corresponding systems is
analyzed. The new type of completely integrable Hamiltonian systems associated
with the space of rank $r=2$ discrete Lax operators on a {\it variable} base
curve is found.
