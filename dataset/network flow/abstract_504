The paper investigates epistemic properties of information flow under
communication protocols with a given topological structure of the communication
network. The main result is a sound and complete logical system that describes
all such properties. The system consists of a variation of the multi-agent
epistemic logic S5 extended by a new network-specific Gateway axiom.
