The statistical properties of the length of the cycles and of the weights of
the attraction basins in fully asymmetric neural networks (i.e. with completely
uncorrelated synapses) are computed in the framework of the annealed
approximation which we previously introduced for the study of Kauffman
networks. Our results show that this model behaves essentially as a Random Map
possessing a reversal symmetry. Comparison with numerical results suggests that
the approximation could become exact in the infinite size limit.
