Wide implementation of IEEE 802.11 based networks could lead to deployment of
localized wireless data communication environments with a limited number of
mobile hosts, called ad hoc networks. Implementation of a proper routing
methodology in ad hoc networks makes it efficient in terms of performance. A
wide spectrum of routing protocols has been contributed by several researchers.
Real time applications have been most popular among the applications, run by ad
hoc networks. Such applications strictly adhere to the Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements such as overall throughput, end-toend delay and power level.
Support of QoS requirements becomes more challenging due to dynamic nature of
MANETs, where mobility of nodes results in frequent change in topology. QoS
aware routing protocols can serve to the QoS support, which concentrate on
determining a path between source and destination with the QoS requirements of
the flow being satisfied. We propose a protocol, called Power and Delay aware
Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (PDTORA), based on Temporally Ordered
Routing Algorithm (TORA) Protocol, where verification of power and delay
requirements is carried out with a query packet at each node along the path
between source and destination. Simulations justify better performance of the
proposed new protocol in terms of network lifetime, end-to-end delay and packet
delivery ratio as compared to TORA.
