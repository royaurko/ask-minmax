This paper deals with a comparison of Fractional Derivative and Monte carlo
approaches to the modelling of anomalous diffusion in the field of particle
transport. The goal of this research is to provide a better insight on the
behavior of (radioactive) contaminant tracers when flowing through
heterogeneous media.
