Determining the achievable rate region for networks using routing, linear
coding, or non-linear coding is thought to be a difficult task in general, and
few are known. We describe the achievable rate regions for four interesting
networks (completely for three and partially for the fourth). In addition to
the known matrix-computation method for proving outer bounds for linear coding,
we present a new method which yields actual characteristic-dependent linear
rank inequalities from which the desired bounds follow immediately.
