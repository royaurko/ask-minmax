In a graph, a community may be loosely defined as a group of nodes that are
more closely connected to one another than to the rest of the graph. While
there are a variety of metrics that can be used to specify the quality of a
given community, one common theme is that flows tend to stay within
communities. Hence, we expect cycles to play an important role in community
detection. For undirected graphs, the importance of triangles -- an undirected
3-cycle -- has been known for a long time and can be used to improve community
detection. In directed graphs, the situation is more nuanced. The smallest
cycle is simply two nodes with a reciprocal connection, and using information
about reciprocation has proven to improve community detection. Our new idea is
based on the four types of directed triangles that contain cycles. To identify
communities in directed networks, then, we propose an undirected edge-weighting
scheme based on the type of the directed triangles in which edges are involved.
We also propose a new metric on quality of the communities that is based on the
number of 3-cycles that are split across communities. To demonstrate the impact
of our new weighting, we use the standard METIS graph partitioning tool to
determine communities and show experimentally that the resulting communities
result in fewer 3-cycles being cut. The magnitude of the effect varies between
a 10 and 50% reduction, and we also find evidence that this weighting scheme
improves a task where plausible ground-truth communities are known.
