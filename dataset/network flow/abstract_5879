The synchronization of chaotic lasers and the optical phase synchronization
of light originating in multiple coupled lasers have both been extensively
studied, however, the interplay between these two phenomena, especially at the
network level is unexplored. Here we experimentally compare chaos
synchronization of laser networks with heterogeneous coupling delay times to
phase synchronization of similar networks. While chaotic lasers exhibit
deterioration in synchronization as the network time delay heterogeneity
increases, phase synchronization is found to be independent of heterogeneity.
The experimental results are found to be in agreement with numerical
simulations for semiconductor lasers.
