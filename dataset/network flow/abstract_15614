Vehicular energy network (VEN) is a vehicular network which can transport
energy over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs). In
the near future, an abundance of EVs, plentiful generation of the renewables,
and mature wireless energy transfer and vehicular communication technologies
will expedite the realization of VEN. To transmit energy from a source to a
destination, we need to establish energy paths, which are composed of segments
of vehicular routes, while satisfying various design objectives. In this paper,
we develop a method to construct all energy paths for a particular energy
source-destination pair, followed by some analytical results of the method. We
describe how to utilize the energy paths to develop optimization models for
different design goals and propose two solutions. We also develop a heuristic
for the power loss minimization problem. We compare the performance of the
three solution methods with artificial and real-world traffic networks and
provide a comprehensive comparison in terms of solution quality, computation
time, solvable problem size, and applicability. This paper lays the foundations
of VEN routing.
