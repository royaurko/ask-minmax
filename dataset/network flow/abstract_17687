We discuss the scaling laws for the flow generated in a viscous fluid by a
wave propagating along a solid boundary. This has applications to the
displacement of tiny objects on solids, under the effect of progressive surface
waves and for the swimming of microanimals by undulation of ciliae along their
body surface.
