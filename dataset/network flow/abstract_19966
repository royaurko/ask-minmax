Hot Jupiters, with atmospheric temperatures T ~ 1000 K, have residual thermal
ionization levels sufficient for the interaction of the ions with the planetary
magnetic field to result in a sizable magnetic drag on the (neutral)
atmospheric winds. We evaluate the magnitude of magnetic drag in a
representative three-dimensional atmospheric model of the hot Jupiter HD
209458b and find that it is a plausible mechanism to limit wind speeds in this
class of atmospheres. Magnetic drag has a strong geometrical dependence, both
meridionally and from the day to the night side (in the upper atmosphere),
which could have interesting consequences for the atmospheric flow pattern. By
extension, close-in eccentric planets with transiently heated atmospheres will
experience time-variable levels of magnetic drag. A robust treatment of
magnetic drag in circulation models for hot atmospheres may require iterated
solutions to the magnetic induction and Saha equations as the hydrodynamical
flow is evolved.
