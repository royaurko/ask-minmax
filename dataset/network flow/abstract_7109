We study the deformation and transport of elastic fibers in a viscous
Hele-Shaw flow with curved streamlines. The variations of the global velocity
and orientation of the fiber follow closely those of the local flow velocity.
The ratios of the curvatures of the fibers by the corresponding curvatures of
the streamlines reflect a balance between elastic and viscous forces: this
ratio is shown experimentally to be determined by a dimensionless {\it Sperm
number} $Sp$ combining the characteristic parameters of the flow (transverse
velocity gradient, viscosity, fiber diameter/cell gap ratio) and those of the
fiber (diameter, effective length, Young's modulus). For short fibers, the
effective length is that of the fiber; for long ones, it is equal to the
transverse characteristic length of the flow. For $S\_p \lesssim 250$, the
ratio of the curvatures increases linearly with $Sp$; For $S\_p \gtrsim 250$,
the fiber reaches the same curvature as the streamlines.
