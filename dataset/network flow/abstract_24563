A number of biological rhythms originate from networks comprised of multiple
cellular oscillators. But analytical results are still lacking on the
collective oscillation period of inter-coupled gene regulatory oscillators,
which, as has been reported, may be different from that of an autonomous
oscillator. Based on cyclic feedback oscillators, we analyze the collective
oscillation pattern of coupled cellular oscillators. First we give a condition
under which the oscillator network exhibits oscillatory and synchronized
behavior. Then we estimate the collective oscillation period based on a novel
multivariable harmonic balance technique. Analytical results are derived in
terms of biochemical parameters, thus giving insight into the basic mechanism
of biological oscillation and providing guidance in synthetic biology design.
