A simple model of activatory-inhibitory interactions controlling the activity
of agents (substrates) through a "saturated response" dynamical rule in a
scale-free network is thoroughly studied. After discussing the most remarkable
dynamical features of the model, namely fragmentation and multistability, we
present a characterization of the temporal (periodic and chaotic) fluctuations
of the quasi-stasis asymptotic states of network activity. The double (both
structural and dynamical) source of entangled complexity of the system temporal
fluctuations, as an important partial aspect of the Correlation
Structure-Function problem, is further discussed to the light of the numerical
results, with a view on potential applications of these general results.
