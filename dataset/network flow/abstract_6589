The nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) contain limited energy
resources, which are needed to transmit data to base station (BS). Routing
protocols are designed to reduce the energy consumption. Clustering algorithms
are best in this aspect. Such clustering algorithms increase the stability and
lifetime of the network. However, every routing protocol is not suitable for
heterogeneous environments. AM-DisCNT is proposed and evaluated as a new energy
efficient protocol for wireless sensor networks. AM-DisCNT uses circular
deployment for even consumption of energy in entire wireless sensor network.
Cluster-head selection is on the basis of energy. Highest energy node becomes
CH for that round. Energy is again compared in the next round to check the
highest energy node of that round. The simulation results show that AM-DisCNT
performs better than the existing heterogeneous protocols on the basis of
network lifetime, throughput and stability of the system.
