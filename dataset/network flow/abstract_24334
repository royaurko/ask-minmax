The new era of information and communication technology (ICT) calls for a
greater understanding of the environmental impacts of recent technology. With
increasing energy cost and growing environmental concerns, green IT is
receiving more and more attention. Network and system design play a crucial
role in both computing and telecommunication systems. Significant part of this
energy cost goes to system update by downloading regularly patches and bug
fixes to solve security problems and to assure that the operating system and
other systems function properly. This paper describes a new design of Windows
Server Update Services (WSUS), system responsible of downloads of the mentioned
patches and updates from Microsoft Update website and then distributes them to
computers on a network. The general idea behind our proposed design is simple.
Instead of the periodical check done by the WSUS servers to ensure update form
Microsoft main servers, we rather propose to reverse the scenario in order to
reduce energy consumption. In the proposed design, the Microsoft main server(s)
sends signal to all WSUS servers to inform them about new updates. Once the
signal received, WSUS can contact the main server to start downloading.
