The column Hamming distance of a convolutional code determines the error
correction capability when streaming over a class of packet erasure channels.
We show that the column sum rank parallels column Hamming distance when
streaming over a network with link failures. We prove rank analogues of several
known column Hamming distance properties and introduce a new family of
convolutional codes that maximize the column sum rank up to the code memory.
Our construction involves finding a class of super-regular matrices that
preserve this property after multiplication with non-singular block diagonal
matrices in the ground field.
