We show that unstable fingering patterns of two dimensional flows of viscous
fluids with open boundary are described by a dispersionless limit of the KdV
hierarchy. In this framework, the fingering instability is linked to a known
instability leading to regularized shock solutions for nonlinear waves, in
dispersive media. The integrable structure of the flow suggests a dispersive
regularization of the finite-time singularities.
