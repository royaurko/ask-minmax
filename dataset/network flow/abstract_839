Cybercrime is increasing at a faster pace and sometimes causes billions of
dollars of business- losses so investigating attackers after commitment is of
utmost importance and become one of the main concerns of network managers.
Network forensics as the process of Collecting, identifying, extracting and
analyzing data and systematically monitoring traffic of network is one of the
main requirements in detection and tracking of criminals. In this paper, we
propose an architecture for network forensic system. Our proposed architecture
consists of five main components: collection and indexing, database management,
analysis component, SOC communication component and the database. The main
difference between our proposed architecture and other systems is in analysis
component. This component is composed of four parts: Analysis and investigation
subsystem, Reporting subsystem, Alert and visualization subsystem and the
malware analysis subsystem. The most important differentiating factors of the
proposed system with existing systems are: clustering and ranking of malware,
dynamic analysis of malware, collecting and analysis of network flows and
anomalous behaviour analysis.
