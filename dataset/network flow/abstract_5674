Energy efficiency has gained its significance when service providers'
operational costs burden with the rapidly growing data traffic demand in
cellular networks. In this paper, we propose an energy efficiency model for
Poisson-Voronoi tessellation (PVT) cellular networks considering spatial
distributions of traffic load and power consumption. The spatial distributions
of traffic load and power consumption are derived for a typical PVT cell, and
can be directly extended to the whole PVT cellular network based on the Palm
theory. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of PVT cellular networks is
evaluated by taking into account traffic load characteristics, wireless channel
effects and interference. Both numerical and Monte Carlo simulations are
conducted to evaluate the performance of the energy efficiency model in PVT
cellular networks. These simulation results demonstrate that there exist
maximal limits for energy efficiency in PVT cellular networks for given
wireless channel conditions and user intensity in a cell.
