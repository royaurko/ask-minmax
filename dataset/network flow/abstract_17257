We present $\mathcal{MEL}^{++}$ (M denotes Markov logic networks) an
extension of the log-linear description logics $\mathcal{EL}^{++}$-LL with
concrete domains, nominals, and instances. We use Markov logic networks (MLNs)
in order to find the most probable, classified and coherent $\mathcal{EL}^{++}$
ontology from an $\mathcal{MEL}^{++}$ knowledge base. In particular, we develop
a novel way to deal with concrete domains (also known as datatypes) by
extending MLN's cutting plane inference (CPI) algorithm.
