This paper presents the design and implementation of the naming mechanism
(NAME), a resource discovery and service location approach for
Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Network (DTN). First discuss the architecture of NAME
mainly including Name Knowledge Base, Name Dissemination, Name Resolution and
Name-based Routing. In the design and implementation of NAME, we introduce the
simple namespecifiers to describe name, the name-tree for name storage and the
efficient predicate-based routing algorithm. Future work is finally discussed
for completing NAME and providing APIs for abundant applications.
