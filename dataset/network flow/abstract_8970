These lecture notes are based on a mini-course given by the contributor at the
sixth KAWA Winter School on March 23-26, 2015 at the Centro De Giorgi of Scuola
Normale Superiore in Pisa. They provide an introduction to the study of the
Kahler-Ricci flow on compact Kahler manifolds, and a detailed exposition of
some recent developments.
