The outburst cycles of black hole X-ray transients are now generally
understood as caused by a thermal instability in the accretion disk, the same
mechanism as in dwarf novae outbursts. During quiescence the accretion occurs
via a cool disk in the outer region but changes to a coronal flow/ADAF in the
inner region. The transition to the coronal flow is caused by evaporation of
matter from the cool disk. This process is an important feature for the disk
evolution. We point out that if the disk is depleted during the outburst, e.g.
by irradiation, its evolution during quiescence is independent of the detailed
outburst luminosity decline. The mass accumulation during quiescence has to
meet several constraints as the accretion rate, the recurrence time and the
total outburst energy. We present a critical discussion of different ways to
model X-ray transient outburst cycles and compare with the requirements from
observations. For the case of only little mass left over after the outburst the
observations indicate a frictional parameter in the cool disk of order
alpha(cold) =0.05, similar to that in dwarf nova disks during quiescence, with
no need to resort to much lower alpha values of order 0.005.
