Differential elliptic flow out to p_T ~ 5 GeV/c and particle spectra are
calculated using the MPC elastic parton cascade model for Au+Au at Ecm ~ 130A
GeV. The evolution is computed from parton transport theory, followed by
hadronization either via independent fragmentation or by imposing parton-hadron
duality. With pQCD elastic cross sections, very large initial gluon densities
dN/deta > 7000 are required to reproduce the data measured by the STAR
collaboration. In addition, elliptic flow and the p_T spectra are shown to be
very sensit ive to particle subdivision.
