In this talk we describe the recently discovered rich phenomenology of
elliptic flow of electromagnetic probes of the hot matter created in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using a hydrodynamic model for the
space-time dynamics of the collision fireball created in Au+Au collisions at
RHIC, we compute the transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow of thermal
photons and dileptons. These observables are shown to provide differential
windows into various stages of the fireball expansion.
