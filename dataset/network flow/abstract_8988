The fluid model has proven to be one of the most effective tools for the
analysis of stochastic queueing networks, specifically for the analysis of
stability. It is known that stability of a fluid model implies positive
(Harris) recurrence (stability) of a corresponding stochastic queueing network,
and weak stability implies rate stability of a corresponding stochastic
network. These results have been established both for cases of specific
scheduling policies and for the class of all work conserving policies.
  However, only partial converse results have been established and in certain
cases converse statements do not hold. In this paper we close one of the
existing gaps. For the case of networks with two stations we prove that if the
fluid model is not weakly stable under the class of all work conserving
policies, then a corresponding queueing network is not rate stable under the
class of all work conserving policies. We establish the result by building a
particular work conserving scheduling policy which makes the associated
stochastic process transient. An important corollary of our result is that the
condition $\rho^*\leq 1$, which was proven in \cite{daivan97} to be the exact
condition for global weak stability of the fluid model, is also the exact
global rate stability condition for an associated queueing network. Here
$\rho^*$ is a certain computable parameter of the network involving virtual
station and push start conditions.
