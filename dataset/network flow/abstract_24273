Subscriber satisfaction and maximum radio resource utilization are the
pivotal criteria in communication system design. In multi-Carrier CDMA system,
different paging algorithms are used for locating user within the shortest
possible time and best possible utilization of radio resources. Different
paging algorithms underscored different techniques based on the different
purposes. However, low servicing time of sequential search and better
utilization of radio resources of concurrent search can be utilized
simultaneously by swapping of the algorithms. In this paper, intelligent
mechanism has been developed for dynamic algorithm assignment basing on
time-varying traffic demand, which is predicted by radial basis neural network;
and its performance has been analyzed are based on prediction efficiency of
different types of data. High prediction efficiency is observed with a good
correlation coefficient (0.99) and subsequently better performance is achieved
by dynamic paging algorithm assignment. This claim is substantiated by the
result of proposed intelligent paging strategy.
