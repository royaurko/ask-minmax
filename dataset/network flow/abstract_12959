In this paper a spatial homogeneous vehicular traffic flow model based on a
stochastic master equation of Boltzmann type in the acceleration variable is
solved numerically for a special driver interaction model. The solution is done
by a modified direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) well known in non
equilibrium gas kinetic. The velocity and acceleration distribution functions
in stochastic equilibrium, mean velocity, traffic density, ACN, velocity
scattering and correlations between some of these variables and their car
density dependences are discussed.
