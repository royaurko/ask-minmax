We study properties of an attractive-repulsive energy functional based on
power-kernels, which can be used for halftoning of images. In the first part of
this work, using a variational framework for probability measures, we examine
existence and behavior of minimizers to the functional and to a regularization
of it by a total variation term. Moreover, we introduce particle approximations
to the functional and to its regularized version and prove their consistency in
terms of Gamma-convergence, which we additionally illustrate by numerical
examples. In the second part, we consider the gradient flow of the functional
in the 2-Wasserstein space and prove statements about its asymptotic behavior
for large times, for which we employ the pseudo-inverse technique for
probability measures in 1D. Depending on the parameter range, this includes
existence of a subsequence converging to a steady state or even convergence of
the whole trajectory to a limit which we can specify explicitly. For both parts
of the work, a key ingredient is the generalized Fourier transform, which
allows us to verify the conditional positive definiteness of the interaction
kernel for coinciding attractive and repulsive exponents.
