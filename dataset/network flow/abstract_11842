In this paper, we examine the problem of how to schedule the migrations and
how to allocate network resources for migration when multiple VMs need to be
migrated at the same time. We consider the problem in the Software-defined
Network (SDN) context since it provides flexible control on routing. More
specifically, we propose a method that computes the optimal migration sequence
and network bandwidth used for each migration. We formulate this problem as a
mixed integer programming, which is NP-hard. To make it computationally
feasible for large scale data centers, we propose an approximation scheme via
linear approximation plus fully polynomial time approximation, and obtain its
theoretical performance bound. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate
that our fully polynomial time approximation (FPTA) algorithm has a good
performance compared with the optimal solution and two state of-the-art
algorithms. That is, our proposed FPTA algorithm approaches to the optimal
solution with less than 10% variation and much less computation time.
Meanwhile, it reduces the total migration time and the service downtime by up
to 40% and 20% compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, respectively.
