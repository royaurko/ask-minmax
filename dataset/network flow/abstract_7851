In Part I, we construct a class of examples of initial velocities for which
the unique solution to the Euler equations in the plane has an associated flow
map that lies in no Holder space of positive exponent for any positive time. In
Part II, we explore inverse problems that arise in attempting to construct an
example of an initial velocity producing an arbitrarily poor modulus of
continuity of the flow map.
