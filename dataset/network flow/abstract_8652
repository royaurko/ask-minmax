Recognition of objects using Deep Neural Networks is an active area of
research and many breakthroughs have been made in the last few years. The paper
attempts to indicate how far this field has progressed. The paper briefly
describes the history of research in Neural Networks and describe several of
the recent advances in this field. The performances of recently developed
Neural Network Algorithm over benchmark datasets have been tabulated. Finally,
some the applications of this field have been provided.
