We consider a scheduler for the downlink of a wireless channel when only
partial channel-state information is available at the scheduler. We
characterize the network stability region and provide two throughput-optimal
scheduling policies. We also derive a deterministic bound on the mean packet
delay in the network. Finally, we provide a throughput-optimal policy for the
network under QoS constraints when real-time and rate-guaranteed data traffic
may be present.
