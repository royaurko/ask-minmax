A fluid motion through the flow element is presented in the kind of an
autooscillating system with the distributed parameters: mass, elasticity,
viscosity. The system contains a self-excited oscillator and possesses a
self-regulation on base of the intrinsic voluntary negative servo output
feedback. The interaction dynamics of the submerged jet, out-flowing out of a
flow element, with the homogeneous for it surrounding medium as well as
dynamics of evolution of the spiral-vortex structures, appearing at the
relative motion of fluids, are described for the first time. The conceptual
model of a flow in the kind of the completed system of the cause and effect
relationship, that presents the fluid motion process as a result in interaction
of the motive power, applied from without, and the internal wave mechanism,
selfregulating the flow structure and its intensity, is created.
