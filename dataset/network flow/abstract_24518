P4 is a high-level language for programming protocol-independent packet
processors. P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like OpenFlow.
In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it
operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing
the complexity of the specification while still not providing the flexibility
to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how
OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1)
Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way
switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence:
Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target
independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing
functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an
example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new
hierarchical label.
