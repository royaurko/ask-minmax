A review of the theoretical approach for calculating the resistance between
two arbitrary lattice points in an infinite square lattice (perfect and
perturbed cases)is carried out using the Lattice Green's Function. We show how
to calculate the resistance between the origin and any other site using the
Lattice Green's Function at the origin, and its derivatives. Experimental
results are obtained for a finite square network consisting 30x30 identical
resistors, and a comparison with those obtained theoretically is presented.
