Black holes are usually studied without including effects of the expanding
universe. However in some recent studies black holes have been embedded in an
expanding universe, in order to determine the interplay, if any, of these two
dynamical processes. Dynamical 3-space theory contains time independent
solutions for black holes, which are spatial in-flows, and separately the time
dependent Hubble expansion. This theory has explained numerous puzzles in
observational astrophysics and contains 3 constants; G, alpha - which from
experimental data turns out to be the fine structure constant, and delta -
which is a small but nonzero distance, possibly a Planck-type length. The
Hubble expansion in the dynamical 3-space theory cannot be `switched off',
forcing the study, first, of isolated black holes coexisting with the expanding
universe. It is shown that a time dependent black hole and expanding universe
solution exists. The nature and implications of these solutions are discussed
as they evolve over time. A dynamical network of black holes and induced
linking cosmic filaments forming bubble structures is discussed, as a
consequence of dynamical 3-space undergoing a dynamical breakdown of
homogeneity and isotropy, even in the absence of baryonic matter.
