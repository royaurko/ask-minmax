We consider a hyperbolic system of three conservation laws in one space
variable. The system is a model for fluid flow allowing phase transitions; in
this case the state variables are the specific volume, the velocity and the
mass density fraction of the vapor in the fluid. For a class of initial data
having large total variation we prove the global existence of solutions to the
Cauchy problem.
