In preparation for an experimental study of magnetorotational instability
(MRI) in liquid metal, we explore Couette flows having height comparable to the
gap between cylinders, centrifugally stable rotation, and high Reynolds number.
Experiments in water are compared with numerical simulations. Simulations show
that endcaps corotating with the outer cylinder drive a strong poloidal
circulation that redistributes angular momentum. Predicted azimuthal flow
profiles agree well with experimental measurements. Spin-down times scale with
Reynolds number as expected for laminar Ekman circulation; extrapolation from
two-dimensional simulations at $Re\le 3200$ agrees remarkably well with
experiment at $Re\sim 10^6$. This suggests that turbulence does not dominate
the effective viscosity. Further detailed numerical studies reveal a strong
radially inward flow near both endcaps. After turning vertically along the
inner cylinder, these flows converge at the midplane and depart the boundary in
a radial jet. To minimize this circulation in the MRI experiment, endcaps
consisting of multiple, differentially rotating rings are proposed. Simulations
predict that an adequate approximation to the ideal Couette profile can be
obtained with a few rings.
