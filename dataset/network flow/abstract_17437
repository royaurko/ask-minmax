We report on the application of chaos control to the irregular motion of an
electron under the combined influence of a Coulomb and a magnetic field, the
so-called ``diamagnetic Kepler problem'' (DKP). We show how to stabilize the
classical chaotic orbits into regular motion and present a new method to follow
the unstable orbits as the energy is increased from the regular to the chaotic
regime.
