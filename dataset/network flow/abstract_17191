We investigate the dynamic relaxation of random walks on temporal networks by
focusing in the recently proposed activity driven model [Perra \textit{et al.}
Sci. Rep. srep00469 (2012)]. For realistic activity distributions with a
power-law form, we observe the presence of a very slow relaxation dynamics
compatible with aging effects. A theoretical description of this processes in
achieved by means of a mapping to Bouchaud's trap model. The mapping highlights
the profound difference in the dynamics of the random walks according to the
value of the exponent $\gamma$ in the activity distribution.
