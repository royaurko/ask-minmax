We investigate random walks on complex networks and derive an exact
expression for the mean first passage time (MFPT) between two nodes. We
introduce for each node the random walk centrality $C$, which is the ratio
between its coordination number and a characteristic relaxation time, and show
that it determines essentially the MFPT. The centrality of a node determines
the relative speed by which a node can receive and spread information over the
network in a random process. Numerical simulations of an ensemble of random
walkers moving on paradigmatic network models confirm this analytical
prediction.
