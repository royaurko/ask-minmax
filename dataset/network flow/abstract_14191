We report the discovery of a system of unusual HI filaments which appear to
be associated with molecular clouds in the Perseus spiral arm of our Galaxy. We
investigate the hypothesis that this system is the result of a directed flow of
dissociated gas from clouds trapped within an extended wind flow from massive
stars. The Wolf-Rayet star WR 5 and the OIb(f) star HD 17603 are identified as
candidate driving sources. However, an examination of this hypothesis within
the context of the theory of mass-loaded winds shows that these two stars alone
cannot account for the energetics and kinematics of the required spherically
symmetric wind flow. Unless the apparent association between HI, molecular gas,
and stars is an accidental one, we suggest that other as-yet unidentified stars
must have contributed to driving the filaments.
