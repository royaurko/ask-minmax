We study the generalized point-vortex problem and the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation on surfaces of revolution. We find rotating periodic solutions to the
generalized point-vortex problem, which have two two rings of $n$ equally
spaced vortices with degrees $\pm 1$. In particular we prove the existence of
such solutions when the surface is longitudinally symmetric. Then we seek a
rotating solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation having vortices that follow
those of the point-vortex flow for $\varepsilon$ sufficiently small.
