We study the dynamics of localised perturbations in plane Couette flow with
periodic lateral boundary conditions. For small Reynolds number and small
amplitude of the initial state the perturbation decays on a viscous time scale
$t \propto Re$. For Reynolds number larger than about 200, chaotic transients
appear with life times longer than the viscous one. Depending on the type of
the perturbation isolated initial conditions with infinite life time appear for
Reynolds numbers larger than about 270--320. In this third regime, the life
time as a function of Reynolds number and amplitude is fractal. These results
suggest that in the transition region the turbulent dynamics is characterised
by a chaotic repeller rather than an attractor.
