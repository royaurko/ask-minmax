We analyze the microscopic dynamics of vortex motion through channels that
form river-like fractal networks in a variety of superconducting samples, and
relate it to macroscopic measurable quantities such as the power spectrum. As a
function of pinning strength, we calculate the fractal dimension, tortuosity,
and the corresponding voltage noise spectrum. Above a certain pinning strength,
a remarkable universal drop in both tortuosity and noise power occurs when the
vortex motion changes from shifting braiding channels to unbraided channels. We
compare our results with experiments.
