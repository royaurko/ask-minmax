Space-time information about the Au-Au collisions produced at RHIC are key
tools to understand the evolution of the system and especially assess the
presence of collective behaviors. Using a parameterization of the system's
final state relying on collective expansion, we show that pion source radii can
be tied together with transverse mass spectra and elliptic flow within the same
framework. The consistency between these different measures provide a solid
ground to understand the characteristics of collective flow and especially the
possible peculiar behavior of particles such as Xi, Omega or phi. The validity
of the short time scales that are extracted from fits to the pion source size
is also addressed. The wealth of new data that will soon be available from
Au-Au collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV, will provide a stringet test of the
space-time analysis framework developped in these proceedings.
