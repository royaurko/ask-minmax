We study the flow forced by precession in rigid non-axisymmetric ellipsoidal
containers. To do so, we revisit the inviscid and viscous analytical models
that have been previously developed for the spheroidal geometry by,
respectively, Poincar\'e (Bull. Astronomique, vol. XXVIII, 1910, pp. 1-36) and
Busse (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 33, 1968, pp. 739-751), and we report the first
numerical simulations of flows in such a geometry. In strong contrast with
axisymmetric spheroids, where the forced flow is systematically stationary in
the precessing frame, we show that the forced flow is unsteady and periodic.
Comparisons of the numerical simulations with the proposed theoretical model
show excellent agreement for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric containers.
Finally, since the studied configuration corresponds to a tidally locked
celestial body such as the Earth's Moon, we use our model to investigate the
challenging but planetary-relevant limit of very small Ekman numbers and the
particular case of our Moon.
