We produce longtime solutions to the K\"ahler-Ricci flow for complete
K\"ahler metrics on $\Bbb C ^n$ without assuming the initial metric has bounded
curvature, thus extending results in [3]. We prove the existence of a longtime
bounded curvature solution emerging from any complete $U(n)$-invariant K\"ahler
metric with non-negative holomorphic bisectional curvature, and that the
solution converges as $t\to \infty$ to the standard Euclidean metric after
rescaling. We also prove longtime existence results for more general K\"ahler
metrics on $\Bbb C ^n$ which are not necessarily $U(n)$-invariant.
