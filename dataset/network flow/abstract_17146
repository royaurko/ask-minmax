Many applications in networked control require intermittent access of a
controller to a system, as in event-triggered systems or information
constrained control applications. Motivated by such applications and extending
previous work on Lyapunov-theoretic drift criteria, we establish both
subgeometric and geometric rates of convergence for Markov chains under state
dependent random time drift criteria. We quantify how the rate of ergodicity,
nature of Lyapunov functions, their drift properties, and the distributions of
stopping times are related. We finally study an application in networked
control.
