We study scale-free networks constructed via a cooperative Achlioptas growth
process. Links between nodes are introduced in the network in order to produce
a scale-free graph with given exponent lambda for the degree distribution, but
the choice of each new link depends on the mass of the clusters that this link
will merge. Networks constructed via this biased procedure show a percolation
transition which strongly differs from the one observed in standard
percolation, where links are introduced just randomly. The different growth
process leads to a phase transition with a non-vanishing percolation threshold
already for lambda > lambda_c ~ 2.2. More interestingly, the transition is
continuous when lambda <= 3 but becomes discontinuous when lambda > 3. This may
have important consequences both for the structure of networks and for the
dynamics of processes taking place on them.
