We use Clebsch potentials and an action principle to derive a closed system
of gauge invariant equations for sound superposed on a general background flow.
Our system reduces to the Unruh (1981) and Pierce (1990) wave equations when
the flow is irrotational, or slowly varying. We illustrate our formalism by
applying it to waves propagating in a uniformly rotating fluid where the sound
modes hybridize with inertial waves.
