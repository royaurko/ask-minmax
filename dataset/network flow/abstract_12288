Cognitive Radio (CR) aims to increase the spectrum utilization by allowing
secondary users (SU) to access unused licensed spectrum bands. To maximize the
throughput given limited sensing capability, SUs need to strike a balance
between sensing the channels that are not heavily used by primary users (PU)
and avoiding collisions with other SUs. To randomize sensing decisions without
resorting to multiuser sensing policies, it is proposed to exploit the
spatially-variant fading channel conditions on different links by adapting the
reward to the channel state information (CSI). Moreover, the proposed
channel-adaptive policy favors links with high achievable transmission rate and
thus further improves the network throughput.
