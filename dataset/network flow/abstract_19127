In this paper, we develop an optimization framework to optimize phase
synchronization in tree networks of coupled Kuramoto oscillators. We consider
the \emph{phase cohesiveness} metric, that accounts for the maximum phase
difference across all the edges in the network. we address three different
optimization problems: (\emph{i}) The \emph{optimal critical coupling problem}
in which we design the natural frequency of each oscillator to minimize the
required coupling for synchronization (\emph{ii}) the \emph{nodal-frequency
design problem}, in which we design the natural frequencies to optimize the
phase cohesiveness, and (\emph{iii}) the \emph{edge-weight design problem}, in
which we design the link weights. We assume that tuning the natural frequencies
and/or modifying the link weights have an associated cost and develop an
optimization framework to find the optimal allocation of resources under
certain assumptions. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach via
numerical simulations.
