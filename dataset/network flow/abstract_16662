We address the problem of the development of representations and their
relationship to the environment. We study a software agent which develops in a
network a representation of its simple environment which captures and
integrates the relationships between agent and environment through a closure
mechanism. The inclusion of a variable behavior modifier allows better
representation development. This can be confirmed with an internal description
of the closure mechanism, and with an external description of the properties of
the representation network.
