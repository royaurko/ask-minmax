The topic of this paper is the presentation of a new network model designed
for networks consisting of spatial objects. This model allows the development
of more advance representations of systems of networked objects and the study
of geographical phenomena propagated through networks. The capabilities of the
model in simulation of geographical phenomena propagation are also studied and
relevant algorithms are presented. As examples of use, modeling of water supply
network and the simulation of traffic flow in road networks are presented.
