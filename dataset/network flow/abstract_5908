This paper considers the problem of information capacity of a random neural
network. The network is represented by matrices that are square and
symmetrical. The matrices have a weight which determines the highest and lowest
possible value found in the matrix. The examined matrices are randomly
generated and analyzed by a computer program. We find the surprising result
that the capacity of the network is a maximum for the binary random neural
network and it does not change as the number of quantization levels associated
with the weights increases.
