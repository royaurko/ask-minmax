Voice over IP (VoIP) is a technology to transport media over IP networks such
as the Internet. VoIP has the capability of connecting people over packet
switched networks instead of traditional circuit switched networks. Recently,
the InterAsterisk Exchange Protocol (IAX) has emerged as a new VoIP which is
gaining popularity among VoIP products. IAX is known for its simplicity, NAT
friendliness, efficiency, and robustness. More recently, the Real time
Switching (RSW) control criterion has emerged as a multimedia conferencing
protocol. In this paper, we made a comparative evaluation and analysis of IAX
and RSW using Mean Opinion Score rating (MOS) and found that they both perform
well under different network packet delays in ms.
