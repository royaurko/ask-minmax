When Cold Dark Matter (CDM) power spectrum normalized by COBE results, its
amplitude at smaller scales can be parametrized by $\Gamma\sim\Omega_0h$. The
expected variations of Hubble flows in two samples, the sample of 36 clusters
in the Mark III catalogue, and the sample of 20 Type Ia supernovae (SNe), are
calculated for the power spectrum in critical-density CDM models (including
tilted CDM models and vacuum-dominated CDM models). The comparison between the
expectations and the real variations in the data offers a bias-free way to
constrain the power spectrum. The cluster sample yields $\Gamma\le
0.30-0.88(n_{ps}-1)+1.9 (n_{ps}-1)^2$ at 95% C.L., with best fits $\Gamma =
0.15-0.39(n_{ps}-1)+0.37(n_{ps}-1)^2$, where $n_{ps}$ is the spectral index of
the power spectrum. The Type Ia SN sample yields $\Gamma\le
0.25-0.80(n_{ps}-1)+1.6 (n_{ps}-1)^2$ at 95% C.L., strongly favoring lower
$\Gamma$'s. The results are inconsistent with a critical-density
matter-dominated universe with $n_{ps}\ga 0.8$ and $H_0\ga 50$ km/sec/Mpc.
