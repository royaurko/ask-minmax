Intense laser pulses excite a nonlinear polarisation response that may create
an effective flowing medium and, under appropriate conditions, a blocking
horizon for light. Here we analyse in detail the interaction of light with such
laser-induced flowing media, fully accounting for the medium dispersion
properties. An analytical model based on a first Born-approximation is found to
be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations based on Maxwell's
equations and shows that when a blocking horizon is formed, the stimulated
medium scatters light with a blackbody emission spectrum. Based on these
results, diamond is proposed as a promising candidate medium for future studies
of Hawking emission from artificial, dispersive horizons.
