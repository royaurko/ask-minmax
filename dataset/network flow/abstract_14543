In this paper we initiate the study of minimizing power consumption in the
broadcast scheduling model. In this setting there is a wireless transmitter.
Over time requests arrive at the transmitter for pages of information. Multiple
requests may be for the same page. When a page is transmitted, all requests for
that page receive the transmission simulteneously. The speed the transmitter
sends data at can be dynamically scaled to conserve energy. We consider the
problem of minimizing flow time plus energy, the most popular scheduling metric
considered in the standard scheduling model when the scheduler is energy aware.
We will assume that the power consumed is modeled by an arbitrary convex
function. For this problem there is a $\Omega(n)$ lower bound. Due to the lower
bound, we consider the resource augmentation model of Gupta \etal
\cite{GuptaKP10}. Using resource augmentation, we give a scalable algorithm.
Our result also gives a scalable non-clairvoyant algorithm for minimizing
weighted flow time plus energy in the standard scheduling model.
