Using micromagnetic simulations, we have investigated spin dynamics in a
spin-valve bi-layer in the presence of a thermal gradient. The direction and
the intensity of the gradient allow to excite the spin wave modes of each layer
selectively. This permits to synchronize the magnetization precession of the
two layers and to rectify the flows of energy and magnetization through the
system. Our study yields promising opportunities for applications in spin
caloritronics and nanophononics devices.
