The flux flow regime of high-T$_{\rm c}$ samples of different normal state
resistivities is studied in the temperature range where the sign of the Hall
effect is reversed. The scaling of the vortex viscosity with normal state
resistivity is consistent with the Bardeen-Stephen theory. Estimates of the
influence of possible mechanisms suggested for the sign reversal of the Hall
effect are also given.
