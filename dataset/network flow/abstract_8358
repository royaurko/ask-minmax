We review recent results on the dynamics of social networks which suggest
that the interplay between the network formation process and volatility may
lead to the occurrence of discontinuous phase transitions and phase coexistence
in a large class of models. We then investigate the effects of negative links
-- links inhibiting local growth of the network -- and of a geographical
distribution of the agents in such models. We show, by extensive numerical
simulations, that both effects enhance this phenomenology, i.e. it increases
the size of the coexistence region.
