We apply the boundary-element method to Stokes flows with helical symmetry,
such as the flow driven by an immersed rotating helical flagellum. We show that
the two-dimensional boundary integral method can be reduced to one dimension
using the helical symmetry. The computational cost is thus much reduced while
spatial resolution is maintained. We review the robustness of this method by
comparing the simulation results with the experimental measurement of the
motility of model helical flagella of various ratios of pitch to radius, along
with predictions from resistive-force theory and slender-body theory. We also
show that the modified boundary integral method provides reliable convergence
if the singularities in the kernel of the integral are treated appropriately.
