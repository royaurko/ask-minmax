Vehicle-to-vehicle communications can be used effectively for intelligent
transport systems (ITS) and location-aware services. The ability to disseminate
information in an ad-hoc fashion allows pertinent information to propagate
faster through the network. In the realm of ITS, the ability to spread warning
information faster and further is of great advantage to the receivers of this
information. In this paper we propose and present a message-dissemination
procedure that uses vehicular wireless protocols for influencing traffic flow,
reducing congestion in road networks. The computational experiments presented
in this paper show how an intelligent driver model (IDM) and car-following
model can be adapted to 'react' to the reception of information. This model
also presents the advantages of coupling together traffic modelling tools and
network simulation tools.
