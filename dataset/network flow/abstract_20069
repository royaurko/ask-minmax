Our goal is the mathematical analysis of a two phase (liquid and gas) two
components (water and hydrogen) system modeling the hydrogen displacement in a
storage site for radioactive waste. We suppose that the water is only in the
liquid phase and is incompressible. The hydrogen in the gas phase is supposed
compressible and could be dissolved into the water with the Henry's law. The
flow is described by the conservation of the mass of each components. The model
is treated without simplified assumptions on the gas density. This model is
degenerated due to vanishing terms. We establish an existence result for the
nonlinear degenerate parabolic system based on new energy estimate on
pressures.
