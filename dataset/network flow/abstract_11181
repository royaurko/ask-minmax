We consider the task of detecting a salient cluster in a sensor network, that
is, an undirected graph with a random variable attached to each node. Motivated
by recent research in environmental statistics and the drive to compete with
the reigning scan statistic, we explore alternatives based on the percolative
properties of the network. The first method is based on the size of the largest
connected component after removing the nodes in the network with a value below
a given threshold. The second method is the upper level set scan test
introduced by Patil and Taillie [Statist. Sci. 18 (2003) 457-465]. We establish
the performance of these methods in an asymptotic decision- theoretic framework
in which the network size increases. These tests have two advantages over the
more conventional scan statistic: they do not require previous information
about cluster shape, and they are computationally more feasible. We make
abundant use of percolation theory to derive our theoretical results, and
complement our theory with some numerical experiments.
