IP eXchange or IPX is GSMA proposal for IP interconnection model which
supports multi services to offer end-to-end QoS, security, interoperability,
SLAs through a dedicated connection. There are some possible partnership
schemes between IPX providers such as peering mode, semi-hosted mode,
full-hosted mode, or combination between these modes. The implementation of the
schemes will be case-by-case basis with some considerations based on, but not
limited to, IPX Providers network asset, coverage, services, features offer,
commercial offer, and customers. For an IPX provider to become competitive in
IPX business and become a global IPX hub, some value added should be considered
such as cost efficiency and great network performance. To achieve it, an IPX
provider could implement some strategies such as build network sinergy between
them and partners to develop IPX Service as single offering, offer their
customers with bundled access network and services. An IPX provider should also
consider their existing customer-based that can be a benefit to their
bargaining position to other potential IPX provider partners to determine price
and business scheme for partnership.
