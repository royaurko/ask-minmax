We study the stability of two-dimensional inviscid flows in an annulus
between two permeable cylinders with respect to three-dimensional
perturbations. The basic flow is irrotational, and both radial and azimuthal
components of the velocity are non-zero. The direction of the radial flow can
be from the inner cylinder to the outer one (the diverging flow) or from the
outer cylinder to the inner one (the converging flow). It had been shown
earlier in \citet{IM2013a} that, independent of the direction of the radial
flow, the basic flow can be unstable to small two-dimensional perturbations. In
the present paper, we prove first that purely radial flow is stable and that
flows with both radial and azimuthal components are always stable to
axisymmetric perturbations. Then we show that both the diverging and converging
flows are unstable with respect to non-axisymmetric three-dimensional
perturbations provided that the ratio of the azimuthal component of the
velocity to the radial one is sufficiently large. Neutral curves in the space
of parameters of the problem are computed and it is demonstrated that for any
ratio of the radii of the cylinders, the most unstable modes (corresponding to
the smallest ratio of the azimuthal velocity to the radial one) are the
two-dimensional ones.
