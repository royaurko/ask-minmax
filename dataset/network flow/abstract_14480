Pulsed high current experiments in single crystals of the high-$T_{c}$
superconductor Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ in c-axis directed
magnetic field $H$ reveal that the $ab$-face resistance in the free flux flow
regime is a solely logarithmic function of H, devoid of any power law
component. Re-analysis of published data confirms this result and leads to
empirical analytic forms for the $ab$-plane and c-axis resistivities:
$\rho_{ab}\propto$ $H^{3/4}$, which does not obey the expected Bardeen-Stephen
result for free flux flow, and $\rho_{c} \propto H^{-3/4} \log^{2}H$.
