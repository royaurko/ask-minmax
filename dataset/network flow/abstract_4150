By means of dual convex bodies, we obtain regularity of solutions to the
expanding Gauss curvature flows with homogeneity degrees $-p$, $0<p<1$. At the
end, we remark that our method can also be used to obtain regularity of
solutions to the shrinking Gauss curvature flows with homogeneity degrees less
than one.
