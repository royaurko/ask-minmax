We propose a possible relation between complex networks and gravity. Our
guide in our proposal is the power-law distribution of the node degree in
network theory and the information approach to gravity. The established bridge
may allow us to carry geometric mathematical structures, which are considered
in gravitational theories, to probabilistic aspects studied in the framework of
complex networks and vice versa.
