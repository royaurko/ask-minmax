We develop further a recent dynamical replica theory to describe the dynamics
of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass in terms of closed evolution
equations for macroscopic order parameters. We show how microscopic memory
effects can be included in the formalism through the introduction of a dynamic
order parameter function: the joint spin-field distribution. The resulting
formalism describes very accurately the relaxation phenomena observed in
numerical simulations, including the typical overall slowing down of the flow
that was missed by the previous simple two-parameter theory. The advanced
dynamical replica theory is either exact or a very good approximation.
