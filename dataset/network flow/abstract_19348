We compute the mass loss rate from a disk orbiting a stellar mass black hole
assuming the flow is guided along magnetic field lines attached to the disk. We
then estimate the Lorentz factor of the wind at infinity. We find that the
Lorentz factor can reach high values only if severe constraints on the field
geometry and the conditions of energy injection are satisfied. We discuss our
results in the context of different scenarios for gamma-ray bursts. We mention
a risk of 'contamination' of the Blandford-Znajek process by wind material
emitted from the disk.
