This paper is focused on the computational analysis of collective discourse,
a collective behavior seen in non-expert content contributions in online social
media. We collect and analyze a wide range of real-world collective discourse
datasets from movie user reviews to microblogs and news headlines to scientific
citations. We show that all these datasets exhibit diversity of perspective, a
property seen in other collective systems and a criterion in wise crowds. Our
experiments also confirm that the network of different perspective
co-occurrences exhibits the small-world property with high clustering of
different perspectives. Finally, we show that non-expert contributions in
collective discourse can be used to answer simple questions that are otherwise
hard to answer.
