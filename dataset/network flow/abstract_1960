The deployment of small cell base stations(SCBSs) overlaid on existing
macro-cellular systems is seen as a key solution for offloading traffic,
optimizing coverage, and boosting the capacity of future cellular wireless
systems. The next-generation of SCBSs is envisioned to be multi-mode, i.e.,
capable of transmitting simultaneously on both licensed and unlicensed bands.
This constitutes a cost-effective integration of both WiFi and cellular radio
access technologies (RATs) that can efficiently cope with peak wireless data
traffic and heterogeneous quality-of-service requirements. To leverage the
advantage of such multi-mode SCBSs, we discuss the novel proposed paradigm of
cross-system learning by means of which SCBSs self-organize and autonomously
steer their traffic flows across different RATs. Cross-system learning allows
the SCBSs to leverage the advantage of both the WiFi and cellular worlds. For
example, the SCBSs can offload delay-tolerant data traffic to WiFi, while
simultaneously learning the probability distribution function of their
transmission strategy over the licensed cellular band. This article will first
introduce the basic building blocks of cross-system learning and then provide
preliminary performance evaluation in a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) simulator
overlaid with WiFi hotspots. Remarkably, it is shown that the proposed
cross-system learning approach significantly outperforms a number of benchmark
traffic steering policies.
