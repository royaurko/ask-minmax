Satellite communication systems are the means of realizing a global broadband
integrated services digital network. Due to the statistical nature of the
integrated services traffic, the resulting rate fluctuations and burstiness
render congestion control a complicated, yet indispensable function. The long
propagation delay of the earth-satellite link further imposes severe demands
and constraints on the congestion control schemes, as well as the media access
control techniques and retransmission protocols that can be employed in a
satellite network. The problems in designing satellite network protocols, as
well as some of the solutions proposed to tackle these problems, will be the
primary focus of this survey.
