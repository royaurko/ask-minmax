We investigate the dynamics of pairs of drops in microfluidic ladder networks
with slanted bypasses, which break the fore-aft structural symmetry. Our
analytical results indicate that unlike symmetric ladder networks, structural
asymmetry introduced by a single slanted bypass can be used to modulate the
relative drop spacing, enabling them to contract, synchronize, expand, or even
flip at the ladder exit. Our experiments confirm all these behaviors predicted
by theory. Numerical analysis further shows that while ladder networks
containing several identical bypasses are limited to nearly linear
transformation of input delay between drops, mixed combination of bypasses can
cause significant non-linear transformation enabling coding and decoding of
input delays.
