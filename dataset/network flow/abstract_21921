We implement the level set method for numerical simulation of the motion of a
suspended particle convected by the fluid flow in a microchannel. The method
automatically cope with the interactions between the particle and the channel
walls. We apply the method in a study of particles moving in a channel with
obstacles of different shapes. The generality of the method also makes it
applicable for simulations of motion of particles under influence of external
forces.
