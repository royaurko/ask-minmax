We introduce a model for capturing the effects of beam misdirection on
coverage and throughput in a directional wireless network using stochastic
geometry. In networks employing ideal sector antennas without sidelobes, we
find that concavity of the orientation error distribution is sufficient to
prove monotonicity and quasi-concavity (both with respect to antenna beamwidth)
of spatial throughput and transmission capacity, respectively. Additionally, we
identify network conditions that produce opposite extremal choices in beamwidth
(absolutely directed versus omni-directional) that maximize the two related
throughput metrics. We conclude our paper with a numerical exploration of the
relationship between mean orientation error, throughput-maximizing beamwidths,
and maximum throughput, across radiation patterns of varied complexity.
