We analyze the limits inherent to the inverse reconstruction of a pairwise
Ising spin glass based on susceptibility propagation. We establish the
conditions under which the susceptibility propagation algorithm is able to
reconstruct the characteristics of the network given first- and second-order
local observables, evaluate eventual errors due to various types of noise in
the originally observed data, and discuss the scaling of the problem with the
number of degrees of freedom.
