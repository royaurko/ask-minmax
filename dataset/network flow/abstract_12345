Motivated by the large expansion in the study of social networks, this paper
deals with the problem of multiple messages spreading over the same network
using gossip algorithms. Given two messages distributed over some nodes of the
graph, we first investigate the final distribution of the messages given an
initial state. Then, an algorithm is presented to achieve consensus over one of
the messages. Finally, a game theoretical application and an analogy with
word-of-mouth marketing are outlined.
