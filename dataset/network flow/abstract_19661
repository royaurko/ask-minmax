We report on the distribution spectra of the fluctations in the amount of
power injected into a liquid crystal undergoing electroconvective flow. The
probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the fluctuations as well as the
magnitude of the fluctuations have been determined in a wide range of imposed
stress both for `unconfined' and `confined' flow geometries. These spectra are
compared to those found in other systems held far from equilibrium, and find
that in certain conditions we obtain the ''universal'' PDF form reported in
[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 84}, 3744 (2000)]. Moreover, the PDF approaches this
universal form via an interesting mechanism whereby the distribution's negative
tail evolves towards form in a different manner than the positive tail.
