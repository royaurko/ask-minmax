We study analytically the dynamics of a network of sparsely connected
inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons in a regime where individual neurons emit
spikes irregularly and at a low rate. In the limit when the number of neurons N
tends to infinity,the network exhibits a sharp transition between a stationary
and an oscillatory global activity regime where neurons are weakly
synchronized. The activity becomes oscillatory when the inhibitory feedback is
strong enough. The period of the global oscillation is found to be mainly
controlled by synaptic times, but depends also on the characteristics of the
external input. In large but finite networks, the analysis shows that global
oscillations of finite coherence time generically exist both above and below
the critical inhibition threshold. Their characteristics are determined as
functions of systems parameters, in these two different regimes. The results
are found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations.
