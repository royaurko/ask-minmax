Using coordinates that manifest the S^2-S^3 split of the base, we study
D3-branes localized on the three-sphere in the Klebanov-Strassler background.
We find a numerical solution for the warp factor and show the emergence of the
AdS throat near the stack. In the dual gauge theory, this corresponds to an RG
flow along the mesonic branch. We demonstrate how the cubic superpotential of
the N=4 SYM theory emerges at the end of the RG flow.
