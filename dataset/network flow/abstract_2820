In this note we prove the backwards uniqueness of the mean curvature flow in
codimension one case. More precisely,let $F_t, \widetilde{F}_t:M^n \to
\overline{M}^{n+1}$ be two complete solutions of the mean curvature flow on
$M^n \times [0,T]$ with bounded second fundamental form in a complete ambient
manifold with bounded geometry. Suppose $F_T=\widetilde{F}_T$, then
$F_t=\widetilde{F}_t$ on $M^n \times [0,T]$. This is an analog of a recent
result of Kotschwar on Ricci flow.
