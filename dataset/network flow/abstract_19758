This paper studies the nature of the effective velocity boundary conditions
for liquid flow over a plane boundary on which small free-slip islands are
randomly distributed. It is found that, to lowest order in the area fraction
$\beta$ covered by free-slip regions with characteristic size $a$, a
macroscopic Navier-type slip condition emerges with a slip length of the order
of $a\beta$. The study is motivated by recent experiments which suggest that
gas nano-bubbles may form on solid walls and may be responsible for the
appearance of a partial slip boundary conditions for liquid flow. The results
are also relevant for ultra-hydrophobic surfaces exploiting the so-called
``lotus effect''.
