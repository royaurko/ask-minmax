We describe a cloud based infrastructure that we have developed that is
optimized for wide area, high performance networks and designed to support data
mining applications. The infrastructure consists of a storage cloud called
Sector and a compute cloud called Sphere. We describe two applications that we
have built using the cloud and some experimental studies.
