In this paper, we investigate the problem of spectrum access decision-making
for the Secondary Users (SUs) in the cognitive radio networks. When the Primary
Users (PUs) are absent on certain frequency bandwidth, SUs can formulate a
queue and wait for the Base Station (BS) to serve. The queue of the SUs will be
dismissed if the PU is emerging in the system. Leveraging the queueing game
approaches, the decision-making process of the SUs that whether to queue or not
is studied. Both individual equilibrium and social optimization strategies are
derived analytically. Moreover, the optimal pricing strategy of the service
provider is investigated as well. Our proposed algorithms and corresponding
analysis are validated through simulation studies.
