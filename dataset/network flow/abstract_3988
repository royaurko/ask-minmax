A substantial volume of research has been devoted to studies of community
structure in networks, but communities are not the only possible form of
large-scale network structure. Here we describe a broad extension of community
structure that encompasses traditional communities but includes a wide range of
generalized structural patterns as well. We describe a principled method for
detecting this generalized structure in empirical network data and demonstrate
with real-world examples how it can be used to learn new things about the shape
and meaning of networks.
