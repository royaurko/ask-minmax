In this work we study a Hebbian neural network, where neurons are arranged
according to a hierarchical architecture such that their couplings scale with
their reciprocal distance. As a full statistical mechanics solution is not yet
available, after a streamlined introduction to the state of the art via that
route, the problem is consistently approached through signal- to-noise
technique and extensive numerical simulations. Focusing on the low-storage
regime, where the amount of stored patterns grows at most logarithmical with
the system size, we prove that these non-mean-field Hopfield-like networks
display a richer phase diagram than their classical counterparts. In
particular, these networks are able to perform serial processing (i.e. retrieve
one pattern at a time through a complete rearrangement of the whole ensemble of
neurons) as well as parallel processing (i.e. retrieve several patterns
simultaneously, delegating the management of diff erent patterns to diverse
communities that build network). The tune between the two regimes is given by
the rate of the coupling decay and by the level of noise affecting the system.
The price to pay for those remarkable capabilities lies in a network's capacity
smaller than the mean field counterpart, thus yielding a new budget principle:
the wider the multitasking capabilities, the lower the network load and
viceversa. This may have important implications in our understanding of
biological complexity.
