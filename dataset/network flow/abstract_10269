Israel-Stewart theory is a causal, stable formulation of relativistic
dissipative fluid dynamics. This theory has been shown to give a decent
description of the dynamical behavior of a relativistic fluid in cases where
shear stress becomes important. In principle, it should also be applicable to
situations where heat flow becomes important. However, it has been shown that
there are cases where Israel-Stewart theory cannot reproduce phenomena
associated with heat flow. In this paper, we derive a relativistic dissipative
fluid-dynamical theory from kinetic theory which provides a good description of
all dissipative phenomena, including heat flow. We explicitly demonstrate this
by comparing this theory with numerical solutions of the relativistic Boltzmann
equation.
