We consider a nonlinear dynamical system on a signed graph, which can be
interpreted as a mathematical model of social networks in which the links can
have both positive and negative connotations. In accordance with a concept from
social psychology called structural balance, the negative links play a key role
in both the structure and dynamics of the network. Recent research has shown
that in a nonlinear dynamical system modeling the time evolution of
"friendliness levels" in the network, two opposing factions emerge from almost
any initial condition. Here we study active external influence in this
dynamical model and show that any agent in the network can achieve any desired
structurally balanced state from any initial condition by perturbing its own
local friendliness levels. Based on this result, we also introduce a new
network centrality measure for signed networks. The results are illustrated in
an international relations network using United Nations voting record data from
1946 to 2008 to estimate friendliness levels amongst various countries.
