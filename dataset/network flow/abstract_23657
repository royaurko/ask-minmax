We prove new probabilistic upper bounds on generalization error of complex
classifiers that are combinations of simple classifiers. Such combinations
could be implemented by neural networks or by voting methods of combining the
classifiers, such as boosting and bagging. The bounds are in terms of the
empirical distribution of the margin of the combined classifier. They are based
on the methods of the theory of Gaussian and empirical processes (comparison
inequalities, symmetrization method, concentration inequalities) and they
improve previous results of Bartlett (1998) on bounding the generalization
error of neural networks in terms of l_1-norms of the weights of neurons and of
Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee (1998) on bounding the generalization error
of boosting. We also obtain rates of convergence in Levy distance of empirical
margin distribution to the true margin distribution uniformly over the classes
of classifiers and prove the optimality of these rates.
