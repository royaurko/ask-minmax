This paper presents an application of evolutionary search procedures to
artificial neural networks. Here, we can distinguish among three kinds of
evolution in artificial neural networks, i.e. the evolution of connection
weights, of architectures, and of learning rules. We review each kind of
evolution in detail and analyse critical issues related to different
evolutions. This article concentrates on finding the suitable way of using
evolutionary algorithms for optimizing the artificial neural network
parameters.
