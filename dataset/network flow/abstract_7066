We consider a closed orientable Riemannian 3-manifold $(M,g)$ and a vector
field $X$ with unit norm whose integral curves are geodesics of $g$. Any such
vector field determines naturally a 2-plane bundle contained in the kernel of
the contact form of the geodesic flow of $g$. We study when this 2-plane bundle
remains invariant under two natural almost complex structures. We also provide
a geometric condition that ensures that $X$ is the Reeb vector field of the
1-form $\lambda$ obtained by contracting $g$ with $X$. We apply these results
to the case of great circle flows on the 3-sphere with two objectives in mind:
one is to recover the result in \cite{GG} that a volume preserving great circle
flow must be Hopf and the other is to characterize in a similar fashion great
circle flows that are conformal relative to the almost complex structure in the
kernel of $\lambda$ given by rotation by $\pi/2$ according to the orientation
of $M$.
