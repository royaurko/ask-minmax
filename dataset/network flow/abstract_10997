Social networks transmitting covert or sensitive information cannot use all
ties for this purpose. Rather, they can only use a subset of ties that are
strong enough to be ``trusted''. In this paper we consider transitivity as
evidence of strong ties, requiring that each tie can only be used if the
individuals on either end also share at least one other contact in common. We
examine the effect of removing all non-transitive ties in two real social
network data sets. We observe that although some individuals become
disconnected, a giant connected component remains, with an average shortest
path only slightly longer than that of the original network. We also evaluate
the cost of forming transitive ties by deriving the conditions for the
emergence and the size of the giant component in a random graph composed
entirely of closed triads and the equivalent Erdos-Renyi random graph.
