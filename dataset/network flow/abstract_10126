We study the relationship between microscopic structure and viscosity in
non-Brownian suspensions. We argue that the formation and opening of contacts
between particles in flow effectively leads to a negative selection of the
contacts carrying weak forces. We show that an analytically tractable model
capturing this negative selection correctly reproduces scaling properties of
flows near the jamming transition. In particular, we predict that (i) the
viscosity {\eta} diverges with the coordination z as {\eta} ~
(z_c-z)^{-(3+{\theta})/(1+{\theta})}, (ii) the operator that governs flow
displays a low-frequency mode that controls the divergence of viscosity, at a
frequency {\omega}_min\sim(z_c-z)^{(3+{\theta})/(2+2{\theta})}, and (iii) the
distribution of forces displays a scale f* that vanishes near jamming as
f*/<f>\sim(z_c-z)^{1/(1+{\theta})} where {\theta} characterizes the
distribution of contact forces P(f)\simf^{\theta} at jamming, and where z_c is
the Maxwell threshold for rigidity.
