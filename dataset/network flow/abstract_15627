In this paper we analyze a novel diffusion strategy for adaptive networks
called Decoupled Adapt-then-Combine, which keeps a fully local estimate of the
solution for the adaptation step. Our strategy, which is specially convenient
for heterogeneous networks, is compared with the standard Adapt-then-Combine
scheme and theoretically analyzed using energy conservation arguments. Such
comparison shows the need of implementing adaptive combiners for both schemes
to obtain a good performance in case of heterogeneous networks. Therefore, we
propose two adaptive rules to learn the combination coefficients that are
useful for our diffusion strategy. Several experiments simulating both
stationary estimation and tracking problems show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques, becoming a competitive approach in different
scenarios.
