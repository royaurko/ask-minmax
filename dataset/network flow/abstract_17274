The dynamics of short-lived mRNA results in bursts of protein production in
gene regulatory networks. We investigate the propagation of bursting noise
between different levels of mathematical modelling, and demonstrate that
conventional approaches based on diffusion approximations can fail to capture
bursting noise. An alternative coarse-grained model, the so-called piecewise
deterministic Markov process (PDMP), is seen to outperform the diffusion
approximation in biologically relevant parameter regimes. We provide a
systematic embedding of the PDMP model into the landscape of existing
approaches, and we present analytical methods to calculate its stationary
distribution and switching frequencies.
