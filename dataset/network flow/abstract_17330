The rotational dynamics of a supercooled molecular liquid is investigated by
a molecular-dynamics numerical study. We detect rotational jumps with a
waiting-time distribution which is well fitted by a truncated power law. At
lower temperatures the rotational correlation times are decoupled from the
viscosity.
