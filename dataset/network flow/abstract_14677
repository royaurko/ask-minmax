We study the perturbative behavior of the Yang-Mills gradient flow in the
Schr\"odinger Functional, both in the continuum and on the lattice. The energy
density of the flow field is used to define a running coupling at a scale given
by the size of the finite volume box. From our perturbative computation we
estimate the size of cutoff effects of this coupling to leading order in
perturbation theory. On a set of Nf=2 gauge field ensembles in a physical
volume of L ~ 0.4 fm we finally demonstrate the suitability of the coupling for
a precise continuum limit due to modest cutoff effects and high statistical
precision.
