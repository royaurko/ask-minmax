In this paper consensus in second-order multi-agent systems with a
non-periodic sampled-data exchange among agents is investigated. The sampling
is random with bounded inter-sampling intervals. It is assumed that each agent
has exact knowledge of its own state at any time instant. The considered local
interaction rule is PD-type. Sufficient conditions for stability of the
consensus protocol to a time-invariant value are derived based on LMIs. Such
conditions only require the knowledge of the connectivity of the graph modeling
the network topology. Numerical simulations are presented to corroborate the
theoretical results.
