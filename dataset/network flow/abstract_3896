We experimentally demonstrate a novel optical physical-layer network coding
(PNC) scheme over time-division multiplexing (TDM) passive optical network
(PON). Full-duplex error-free communications between optical network units
(ONUs) at 2.5 Gb/s are shown for all-optical virtual private network (VPN)
applications. Compared to the conventional half-duplex communications set-up,
our scheme can increase the capacity by 100% with power penalty smaller than 3
dB. Synchronization of two ONUs is not required for the proposed VPN scheme
