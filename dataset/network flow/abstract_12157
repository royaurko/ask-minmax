We extend the previously observed scaling equation connecting the internode
distances and nodes' degrees onto the case of weighted networks. We show that
the scaling takes a similar form in the empirical data obtained from networks
characterized by different relations between node's strength and its degree. In
the case of explicit equation for s(k) (e.g. linear or scale-free), the new
coefficients of scaling equation can be easily obtained. We support our
analysis with numerical simulations for Erdos-Renyi random graphs with
different weight distributions.
