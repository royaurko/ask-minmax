We use series expansions to study dynamics of equilibrium and non-equilibrium
systems on networks. This analytical method enables us to include detailed
non-universal effects of the network structure. We show that even low order
calculations produce results which compare accurately to numerical simulation,
while the results can be systematically improved. We show that certain commonly
accepted analytical results for the critical point on networks with a broad
degree distribution need to be modified in certain cases due to
disassortativity; the present method is able to take into account the
assortativity at sufficiently high order, while previous results correspond to
leading and second order approximations in this method. Finally, we apply this
method to real-world data.
