The introduction of physical layer network coding gives rise to the concept
of turning a collision of transmissions on a wireless channel useful. In the
idea of physical layer network coding, two synchronized simultaneous packet
transmissions are carefully encoded such that the superimposed transmission can
be decoded to produce a packet which is identical to the bitwise binary sum of
the two transmitted packets. This paper explores the decoding of superimposed
transmission resulted by multiple synchronized simultaneous transmissions. We
devise a coding scheme that achieves the identification of individual
transmission from the synchronized superimposed transmission. A mathematical
proof for the existence of such a coding scheme is given.
