This paper argues for the adoption of a information centric system model
instead of the current service-oriented one. We present an architecture for a
global information storage and dissemination network which provides for
efficient interaction and coordination among autonomous actors through a shared
information space. We believe that the resulting, loosely coupled systems,
while probabilistic in nature, will lead to robust outcomes at large scales.
