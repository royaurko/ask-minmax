We study a mathematical model of biological neuronal networks composed by any
finite number $N \geq 2$ of non necessarily identical cells. The model is a
deterministic dynamical system governed by finite-dimensional impulsive
differential equations. The statical structure of the network is described by a
directed and weighted graph whose nodes are certain subsets of neurons, and
whose edges are the groups of synaptical connections among those subsets.
First, we prove that among all the possible networks such that their respective
graphs are mutually isomorphic, there exists a dynamical optimum. This optimal
network exhibits the richest dynamics: namely, it is capable to show the most
diverse set of responses (i.e. orbits in the future) under external stimulus or
signals. Second, we prove that all the neurons of a dynamically optimal
neuronal network necessarily satisfy Dale's Principle, i.e. each neuron must be
either excitatory or inhibitory, but not mixed. So, Dale's Principle is a
mathematical necessary consequence of a theoretic optimization process of the
dynamics of the network. Finally, we prove that Dale's Principle is not
sufficient for the dynamical optimization of the network.
