We report on Domain Wall solution of Calabi-Yau compactifications with
general fluxes and their application to the study of mirror symmetry in
generalized backgrounds. We address, in particular, to the issue of magnetic
NSNS fluxes. We show that the Domain Wall gradient flow equations can be
interpreted as a set of generalized Hitchin's flow equations of a manifold with
SU(3)x SU(3) structure fibered along the direction transverse to the Domain
wall.
