Bounds of cavitation inception are experimentally determined in a creeping
flow between eccentric cylinders, the inner one being static and the outer
rotating at a constant angular velocity, {\Omega}. The geometric configuration
is additionally specified by a small minimum gap between cylinders, H, as
compared with the radii of the inner and outer cylinders. For some values H and
{\Omega}, cavitation bubbles are observed, which are collected on the surface
of the inner cylinder and equally distributed over the line parallel to its
axis near the downstream minimum gap position. Cavitation occurs for the
parameters {H,{\Omega}} within a region bounded on the right by the cavitation
inception curve that passes through the plane origin and cannot exceed the
asymptotic threshold value of the minimum gap, Ha, in whose vicinity cavitation
may occur at H<Ha only for high angular rotation velocities.
