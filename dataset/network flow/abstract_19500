We study the critical properties of the weakly disordered $p$-component
ferromagnet in terms of the renormalization group (RG) theory generalized to
take into account the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) effects coming from the
multiple local minima solutions of the mean-field equations. It is shown that
for $p < 4$ the traditional RG flows at dimensions $D=4-\epsilon$, which are
usually considered as describing the disorder-induced universal critical
behavior, are unstable with respect to the RSB potentials as found in spin
glasses. It is demonstrated that for a general type of the Parisi RSB
structures there exists no stable fixed points, and the RG flows lead to the
{\it strong coupling regime} at the finite scale $R_{*} \sim \exp(1/u)$, where
$u$ is the small parameter describing the disorder. The physical concequences
of the obtained RG solutions are discussed. In particular, we argue, that
discovered RSB strong coupling phenomena indicate on the onset of a new spin
glass type critical behaviour in the temperature interval $\tau < \tau_{*} \sim
\exp(-1/u)$ near $T_{c}$. Possible relevance of the considered RSB effects for
the Griffith phase is also discussed.
