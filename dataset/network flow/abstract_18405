We study message transport on a $1-d$ ring of nodes and randomly distributed
hubs. Messages are deposited on the network at a constant rate. When the rate
at which messages are deposited on the lattice is very high, messages start
accumulating after a critical time and the average load per node starts
increasing. The power-spectrum of the load time-series shows $1/f$ like noise
similar to the scenario of the Internet traffic. The inter-arrival time
distribution of messages for the $1-d$ ring network shows stretched exponential
behavior, which crosses over to power-law behavior if assortative connections
are added to the hubs. The distribution of travel times in a related double
ring geometry is shown to be bimodal with one peak corresponding to initial
congestion and another peak to later decongestion.
