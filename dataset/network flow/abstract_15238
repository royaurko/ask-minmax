Modularity is a desirable characteristic for software systems. In this
article we propose to use a quantitative method from complex network sciences
to estimate the coherence between the modularity of the dependency network of
large open source Java projects and their decomposition in terms of Java
packages. The results presented in this article indicate that our methodology
offers a promising and reasonable quantitative approach with potential impact
on software engineering processes.
