Using a model of wealth distribution where traders are characterized by
quenched random saving propensities and trade among themselves by bipartite
transactions, we mimic the enhanced rates of trading of the rich by introducing
the preferential selection rule using a pair of continuously tunable
parameters. The bipartite trading defines a growing trade network of traders
linked by their mutual trade relationships. With the preferential selection
rule this network appears to be highly heterogeneous characterized by the
scale-free nodal degree and the link weight distributions and presents
signatures of non-trivial strength-degree correlations. With detailed numerical
simulations and using finite-size scaling analysis we present evidence that the
associated critical exponents are continuous functions of the tuning
parameters. However the wealth distribution has been observed to follow the
well-known Pareto law robustly for all positive values of the tuning
parameters.
