A two-dimensional small bias model has been developed for a patterned metal
current collector $|$ mixed oxygen ion and electronic conductor (MIEC) $|$
patterned metal current collector electrochemical cell in a symmetric gas
environment. Specifically, we compute the electrochemical potential
distributions of oxygen vacancies and electrons in the bulk and near the
surface for $\text{Pt} | \text{Sm}_{0.15}\text{Ce}_{0.85}\text{O}_{1.925} |
\text{Pt}$ symmetric cell in a $\text{H}_2-\text{H}_2\text{O}-\text{Ar}$
(reducing) atmosphere from 500 to $650^o C$. Using a two-dimensional
finite-element model, we show that two types of electronic current exist within
the cell: an in-plane drift-diffusion current that flows between the gas $|$
ceria chemical reaction site and the metal current collector, and a cross-plane
current that flows between the two metal electrodes on the opposite side of the
cell. By fitting the surface reaction constant $\tilde k_f^0$ to experimental
electrode resistance values while fixing material properties such as bulk ionic
and electronic equilibrium defect concentrations and mobilities, we are able to
separate the electrode polarization into the surface reaction component and the
in-plane electron drift-diffusion component. We show that for mixed conductors
with a low electronic conductivity (a function of oxygen partial pressure) or a
high surface reaction rate constant, the in-plane electron drift-diffusion
resistance can become rate-limiting in the electrode reaction.
