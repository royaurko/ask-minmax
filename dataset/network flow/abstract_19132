Large antenna arrays can be used to generate highly focused beams that
support very high data rates and reduced energy consumption. However, optimal
beam focusing requires large amount of feedback from the users in order to
choose the best beam, especially in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode. This
paper develops a methodology for designing a multilevel codebook of beams in an
environment with low number of multipaths. The antenna design supporting the
focused beams is formulated as an optimization problem. A multilevel codebook
of beams is constructed according to the coverage requirements. An iterative
beam scheduling is proposed that searches through the codebook to select the
best beam for a given user. The methodology is applied to a mass event and to a
rural scenario, both analyzed using an event-based network simulator. Very
significant gains are obtained for both scenarios. It is shown that the more
dominant the Line of Sight (LoS) component, the higher the gain achieved by the
multilevel beamforming.
