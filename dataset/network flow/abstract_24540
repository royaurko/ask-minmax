Streaming applications often tolerate bit errors in their received data well.
This is contrasted by the enforcement of correctness of the packet headers and
payload by network protocols. We investigate a solution for the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) that is tolerant to errors by accepting erroneous
data. It passes potentially corrupted stream data payloads to the codecs. If
errors occur in the header, our solution recovers from these by leveraging the
known state and expected header values for each stream. The solution is fully
receiver-based and incrementally deployable, and as such requires neither
support from the sender nor changes to the RTP specification. Evaluations show
that our header error recovery scheme can recover from almost all errors, with
virtually no erroneous recoveries, up to bit error rates of about 10%.
