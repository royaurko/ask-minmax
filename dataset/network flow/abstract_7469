The Gross-Pitaevski (GP) equation describing helium superfluids is extended
to non-Riemannian spacetime background where torsion is shown to induce the
splitting in the potential energy of the flow. A cylindrically symmetric
solution for Minkowski background with constant torsion is obtained which shows
that torsion induces a damping on the superfluid flow velocity. The Sagnac
phase shift is computed from the superfluid flow velocity obtained from the
solution of GP equations.
