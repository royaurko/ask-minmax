While standard meta-analysis pools the results from randomized trials that
compare two specific treatments, network meta-analysis aggregates the results
of randomized trials comparing a wider variety of treatment options. However,
it is unclear whether the aggregation of effect estimates across heterogeneous
populations will be consistent for a meaningful parameter. Drawing from
counterfactual theory and the causal inference framework, we define the
population of interest in a network meta-analysis and define the target
parameter under a series of a priori nonparametric structural assumptions. This
allows us to determine the requirements for identifiability of this parameter,
enabling a description of the conditions under which network meta-analyses are
feasible. We then propose several modeling strategies, including a novel
Bayesian hierarchical random effects model, for consistent estimation of the
intervention-specific mean outcome and model-independent contrasts between
treatments.
