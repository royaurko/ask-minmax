We study the temperature profile, pion spectra and HBT radii in central
symmetric and boost-invariant nuclear collisions using a super hybrid model for
heavy-ion collisions (SONIC) combining pre-equilibrium flow with viscous
hydrodynamics and late-stage hadronic rescatterings. In particular, we simulate
Pb+Pb collisions at Sqrt(s)=2.76 TeV, Au+Au, Cu+Cu, Al+Al, and C+C collisions
at Sqrt(s)=200 GeV and Au+Au, Cu+Cu collisions at Sqrt(s)=62.4 GeV. We find
that SONIC provides a good match to the pion spectra and HBT radii for all
collision systems and energies, confirming earlier work that a combination of
pre-equilibrium flow, viscosity and QCD equation of state can resolve the
so-called HBT puzzle. For reference, we also show p+p collisions at Sqrt(s)=7
TeV. We make tabulated data for the 2+1 dimensional temperature evolution of
all systems publicly available for the use in future jet energy loss or similar
studies.
