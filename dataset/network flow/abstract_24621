One of the key challenges in current Internet routing is the application of
improved bio-inspired algorithms in deriving the path towards the destination.
Current routing trends determine the optimal path based on throughput, delay or
combination of these two metric. Here in this paper, we compare the performance
of the two algorithms, AntHocNet (AHN) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) for
determining the routing path. We introduce the goodput factor as one of the
metric for determining the path. Goodput is the number of useful information
bits, delivered by the network to a certain destination per unit time .The
results show that AHN outperformed DSR in terms of end-to-end delay and
overhead. Also the simulation results showed that overhead of AHN was 20.67%
lesser than DSR.
