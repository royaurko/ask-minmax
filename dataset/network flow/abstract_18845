We discuss Bayesian methods for learning Bayesian networks when data sets are
incomplete. In particular, we examine asymptotic approximations for the
marginal likelihood of incomplete data given a Bayesian network. We consider
the Laplace approximation and the less accurate but more efficient BIC/MDL
approximation. We also consider approximations proposed by Draper (1993) and
Cheeseman and Stutz (1995). These approximations are as efficient as BIC/MDL,
but their accuracy has not been studied in any depth. We compare the accuracy
of these approximations under the assumption that the Laplace approximation is
the most accurate. In experiments using synthetic data generated from discrete
naive-Bayes models having a hidden root node, we find that the CS measure is
the most accurate.
