Nowadays control systems are mostly implemented on digital platforms and,
increasingly, over shared communication networks. Reducing resources (processor
utilization, network bandwidth, etc.) in such implementations increases the
potential to run more applications on the same hardware. We present a
self-triggered implementation of linear controllers that reduces the amount of
controller updates necessary to retain stability of the closed-loop system.
Furthermore, we show that the proposed self-triggered implementation is robust
against additive disturbances and provide explicit guarantees of performance.
The proposed technique exhibits an inherent trade-off between computation and
potential savings on actuation.
