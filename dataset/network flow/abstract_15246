In this paper we argue that contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms could
open avenues for designing self-learning security modules for computer networks
and related tasks. The paper has two contributions: a conceptual one and an
algorithmical one. The conceptual contribution is to formulate -- as an example
-- the real-world problem of preventing SPIT (Spam in VoIP networks), which is
currently not satisfyingly addressed by standard techniques, as a sequential
learning problem, namely as a contextual multi-armed bandit. Our second
contribution is to present CMABFAS, a new algorithm for general contextual
multi-armed bandit learning that specifically targets domains with finite
actions. We illustrate how CMABFAS could be used to design a fully
self-learning SPIT filter that does not rely on feedback from the end-user
(i.e., does not require labeled data) and report first simulation results.
