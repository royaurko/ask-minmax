X-ray observations of hot gas in galaxy clusters often show steeper
temperature gradients across cold fronts -- contact discontinuities, driven by
the differential gas motions. These sharp (a few kpc wide) surface
brightness/temperature discontinuities would be quickly smeared out by the
electron thermal conduction in unmagnetized plasma, suggesting significant
suppression of the heat flow across the discontinuities. In fact, the character
of the gas flow near cold fronts is favorable for suppression of conduction by
aligning magnetic field lines along the discontinuities. We argue that a
similar mechanism is operating in the bulk of the gas. Generic 3D random
isotropic and incompressible motions increase the temperature gradients (in
some places) and at the same time suppress the local conduction by aligning the
magnetic field lines perpendicular to the local temperature gradient. We show
that the suppression of the effective conductivity in the bulk of the gas can
be linked to the increase of the frozen magnetic field energy density. On
average the rate of decay of the temperature fluctuations $\mathrm{d}\langle
\delta T^2 \rangle /\mathrm{d}t$ decreases as $\langle B^2 \rangle ^{-1/5}$.
