In this paper, we consider the problem of modelling the average delay in an
IEEE 802.11 DCF wireless mesh network with a single root node under light
traffic. We derive expression for mean delay for a co-located wireless mesh
network, when packet generation is homogeneous Poisson process with rate
\lambda. We also show how our analysis can be extended for non-homogeneous
Poisson packet generation. We model mean delay by decoupling queues into
independent M/M/1 queues. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the
analytical results.
