Analysis and prediction of network traffic has applications in wide
comprehensive set of areas and has newly attracted significant number of
studies. Different kinds of experiments are conducted and summarized to
identify various problems in existing computer network applications. Network
traffic analysis and prediction is a proactive approach to ensure secure,
reliable and qualitative network communication. Various techniques are proposed
and experimented for analyzing network traffic including neural network based
techniques to data mining techniques. Similarly, various Linear and non-linear
models are proposed for network traffic prediction. Several interesting
combinations of network analysis and prediction techniques are implemented to
attain efficient and effective results.
  This paper presents a survey on various such network analysis and traffic
prediction techniques. The uniqueness and rules of previous studies are
investigated. Moreover, various accomplished areas of analysis and prediction
of network traffic have been summed.
