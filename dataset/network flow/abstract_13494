Using Huisken results about the mean curvature flow on a strictly convex
hypersurface, and Kendall-Cranston coupling, we will build a stochastic process
without birth, and show that there exists a unique law of such process. This
process has many similarities with the circular Brownian motions studied by
\'Emery, Schachermayer, and Arnaudon. In general, this process is not a
stationary process, it is linked with some differential equation without
initial condition. We will show that this differential equation has a unique
solution up to a multiplicative constant.
