We consider a network in the Euclidean plane that consists of three distinct
half-lines with common start points. From that network as initial condition,
there exists a network that consists of three curves that all start at one
point, where they form 120 degree angles, and expands homothetically under
curve shortening flow. We also prove uniqueness of these networks.
