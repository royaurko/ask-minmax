According to FCC's ruling for white-space spectrum access, white-space
devices are required to query a database to determine the spectrum
availability. In this paper, we study the database-assisted distributed
white-space access point (AP) network design. We first model the cooperative
and non-cooperative channel selection problems among the APs as the system-wide
throughput optimization and non-cooperative AP channel selection games,
respectively, and design distributed AP channel selection algorithms that
achieve system optimal point and Nash equilibrium, respectively. We then
propose a state-based game formulation for the distributed AP association
problem of the secondary users by taking the cost of mobility into account. We
show that the state-based distributed AP association game has the finite
improvement property, and design a distributed AP association algorithm that
can converge to a state-based Nash equilibrium. Numerical results show that the
algorithm is robust to the perturbation by secondary users' dynamical leaving
and entering the system.
