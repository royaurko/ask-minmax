Many naturally occurring materials can change their shape in response to
external stimuli or internal stresses. Inspired by such materials, as well as
recent experiments, we consider a three- dimensional network of aqueous
droplets joined by single lipid bilayers to form a cohesive, tissue- like
material. The droplets in these self-assembled networks can be programmed to
have distinct osmolarities. The resultant osmotic gradients generate internal
stresses via local fluid flows, causing the network to deform in shape. We
study, using molecular dynamics simulations, the formation of a variety of
shapes ranging from rings to spirals to tetrahedra and determine the optimal
range of parameters for each structure. We also realize a reversible
folding-unfolding process by adding an osmotic interaction with the surrounding
environment which necessarily evolves dynamically as the shape of the network
changes. Such reversible processes may well be important for the development of
osmotic robotics in synthetic and bio-inspired materials.
