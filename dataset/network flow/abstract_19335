A new numerical algorithm for calculating isothermal wind accretion flows has
been developed and is applied here to the analysis of the hydrodynamics of
two-dimensional plane symmetric accretion flows in wind-fed sources. Polar
coordinates are used to ensure fine resolution near the object. It is found
that a thin accretion column is formed which shows wave-like oscillations.
Small accretion disks are formed temporarily around the object. Mass accretion
rate and angular momentum accretion rate exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations.
The amplitudes of the oscillations depend on the size of the inner boundary,
the number of grid points and the method of calculation. For a smaller size of
the inner boundary, finer grids and more accurate numerical schemes, the
amplitudes of the oscillation become larger.
