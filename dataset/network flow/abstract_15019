We examine some characteristic properties of reaction-diffusion processes of
the A+A->0 type on scale-free networks. Due to the inhomogeneity of the
structure of the substrate, as compared to usual lattices, we focus on the
characteristics of the nodes where the annihilations occur. We show that at
early times the majority of these events take place on low-connectivity nodes,
while as time advances the process moves towards the high-connectivity nodes,
the so-called hubs. This pattern remarkably accelerates the annihilation of the
particles, and it is in agreement with earlier predictions that the rates of
reaction-diffusion processes on scale-free networks are much faster than the
equivalent ones on lattice systems.
