The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), connecting dielectric
susceptibility and polarization noise was studied in glycerol below its glass
transition temperature Tg. Weak FDT violations were observed after a quench
from just above to just below Tg, for frequencies above the alpha peak.
Violations persisted up to 10^5 times the thermal equilibration time of the
configurational degrees of freedom under study, but comparable to the average
relaxation time of the material. These results suggest that excess energy flows
from slower to faster relaxing modes.
