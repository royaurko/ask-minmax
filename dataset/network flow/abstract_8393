In this paper we construct and analyse strongly connected sparse directed
networks with an enhanced propensity for synchronization (PFS). Two types of
PFS-enhanced networks are considered: (i) an eigenratio minimizing ensemble
with non-vanishing complex parts of the spectrum and (ii) a class of networks
with real spectrum but slightly larger eigenratios than (i). We relate the
superior PFSs to a strongly skewed out-degree distribution, the density of
double links and a hierarchical periphery-core organization. Ensembles (i) and
(ii) are found to differ in the density of double links and the particular
organization of the core and the periphery-core linkage.
