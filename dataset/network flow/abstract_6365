Leaf venation is a pervasive example of a complex biological network,
endowing leaves with a transport system and mechanical resilience. Transport
networks optimized for efficiency have been shown to be trees, i.e. loopless.
However, dicotyledon leaf venation has a large number of closed loops, which
are functional and able to transport fluid in the event of damage to any vein,
including the primary veins. Inspired by leaf venation, we study two possible
reasons for the existence of a high density of loops in transport networks:
resilience to damage and fluctuations in load. In the first case, we seek the
optimal transport network in the presence of random damage by averaging over
damage to each link. In the second case, we seek the network that optimizes
transport when the load is sparsely distributed: at any given time most sinks
are closed. We find that both criteria lead to the presence of loops in the
optimum state.
