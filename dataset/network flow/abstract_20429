Using in-situ synchrotron tomography, we investigate the coarsening dynamics
of barium borosilicate melts during phase separation. The 3-D geometry of the
two interconnected phases is determined thanks to image processing. We observe
a linear growth of the size of domains with time, at odds with the sublinear
diffusive growth usually observed in phase-separating glasses or alloys. Such
linear coarsening is attributed to viscous flow inside the bicontinuous phases,
and quantitative measurements show that the growth rate is well explained by
the ratio of surface tension over viscosity. The geometry of the domains is
shown to be statistically similar at different times, provided that the
microstructure is rescaled by the average domain size. Complementary
experiments on melts with a droplet morphology demonstrate that viscous flow
prevails over diffusion in the large range of domain sizes measured in our
experiments (1 - 80 microns).
