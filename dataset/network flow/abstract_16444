Star formation can be triggered by compression from wind or supernova driven
shock waves that sweep over molecular clouds. Because these shocks will likely
contain processed elements, triggered star formation has been proposed as an
explanation for short lived radioactive isotopes (SLRI) in the Solar System.
Previous studies have tracked the triggering event to the earliest phases of
collapse and have focused on the shock properties required for both successful
star formation and mixing of SLRI's. In this paper, we use Adaptive Mesh
Refinement (AMR) simulation methods, including sink particles, to simulate the
full collapse and subsequent evolution of a stable Bonnor-Ebert sphere
subjected to a shock and post-shock wind. We track the flow of the cloud
material after a star (a sink particle) has formed. For non-rotating clouds we
find robust triggered collapse and little bound circumstellar material
remaining around the post-shock collapsed core. When we add initial cloud
rotation we observe the formation of disks around the collapsed core which then
interact with the post-shock flow. Our results indicate that these
circumstellar disks are massive enough to form planets and are long-lived, in
spite of the ablation driven by post-shock flow ram pressure. As a function of
the initial conditions, we also track the time evolution of the accretion rates
and particle mixing between between the ambient wind and cloud material. The
latter is maximized for cases of highest mach number.
