We consider a single class open queueing network, also known as a generalized
Jackson network (GJN). A classical result in heavy-traffic theory asserts that
the sequence of normalized queue length processes of the GJN converge weakly to
a reflected Brownian motion (RBM) in the orthant, as the traffic intensity
approaches unity. However, barring simple instances, it is still not known
whether the stationary distribution of RBM provides a valid approximation for
the steady-state of the original network. In this paper we resolve this open
problem by proving that the re-scaled stationary distribution of the GJN
converges to the stationary distribution of the RBM, thus validating a
so-called ``interchange-of-limits'' for this class of networks. Our method of
proof involves a combination of Lyapunov function techniques, strong
approximations and tail probability bounds that yield tightness of the sequence
of stationary distributions of the GJN.
