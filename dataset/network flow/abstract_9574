With increasing number of autonomous heterogeneous devices in future mobile
networks, an efficient resource allocation scheme is required to maximize
network throughput and achieve higher spectral efficiency. In this paper,
performance of network-integrated device-to-device (D2D) communication is
investigated where D2D traffic is carried through relay nodes. An optimization
problem is formulated for allocating radio resources to maximize end-to-end
rate as well as conversing QoS requirements for cellular and D2D user equipment
under total power constraint. Numerical results show that there is a distance
threshold beyond which relay-assisted D2D communication significantly improves
network performance when compared to direct communication between D2D peers.
