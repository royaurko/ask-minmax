We demonstrate a new fiber-based radio frequency dissemination scheme for
branching networks. Without any phase controls on RF signals or usages of
active feedback locking components, the highly stable reference frequency
signal can be delivered to several remote sites simultaneously and
independently. Relative frequency stability of 6E-15/s and 7E-17/1E4s is
obtained for 10km dissemination. The proposed low cost and scalable method can
be applied to some large-scale frequency synchronization networks.
