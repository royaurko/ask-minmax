The pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used to locate
syntactic constituents of natural language. This paper describes a fully
automated hybrid system, using neural nets operating within a grammatic
framework. It addresses the representation of language for connectionist
processing, and describes methods of constraining the problem size. The
function of the network is briefly explained, and results are given.
