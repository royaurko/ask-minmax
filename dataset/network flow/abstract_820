The widespread relevance of complex networks is a valuable tool in the
analysis of a broad range of systems. There is a demand for tools which enable
the extraction of meaningful information and allow the comparison between
different systems. We present a novel measure of similarity between nodes in
different networks as a generalization of the concept of self-similarity. A
similarity matrix is assembled as the distance between feature vectors that
contain the in and out paths of all lengths for each node. Hence, nodes
operating in a similar flow environment are considered similar regardless of
network membership. We demonstrate that this method has the potential to be
influential in tasks such as assigning identity or function to uncharacterized
nodes. In addition an innovative application of graph partitioning to the raw
results extends the concept to the comparison of networks in terms of their
underlying role-structure.
