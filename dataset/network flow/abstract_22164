Large-scale atmospheric flows may not be so nonlinear as to preclude their
statistical description by systematic expansions in cumulants. I extend
previous work by examining a two-layer baroclinic model of the general
circulation. The fixed point of the cumulant expansion describes the
statistically steady state of the out-of-equilibrium model. Equal-time
statistics so obtained agree well with those accumulated by direct numerical
simulation.
