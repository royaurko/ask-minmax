We consider the problem of finding a feasible single-commodity flow in a
strongly connected network with fixed supplies and demands, provided that the
sum of supplies equals the sum of demands and the minimum arc capacity is at
least this sum. A fast algorithm for this problem improves the worst-case time
bound of the Goldberg-Rao maximum flow method by a constant factor. Erlebach
and Hagerup gave an linear-time feasible flow algorithm. We give an arguably
simpler one.
