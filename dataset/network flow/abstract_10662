Advances in materials science have led to physical instantiations of
self-assembled networks of memristive devices and demonstrations of their
computational capability through reservoir computing. Reservoir computing is an
approach that takes advantage of collective system dynamics for real-time
computing. A dynamical system, called a reservoir, is excited with a
time-varying signal and observations of its states are used to reconstruct a
desired output signal. However, such a monolithic assembly limits the
computational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated
readouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of
interconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir. We use signal
amplification and restoration to reduce reservoir state correlation, which
improves the feature extraction from the input signals. Using the same number
of output signals, such a hierarchical composition of heterogeneous small
networks outperforms monolithic memristive networks by at least 20% on waveform
generation tasks. On the NARMA-10 task, we reduce the error by up to a factor
of 2 compared to homogeneous reservoirs with sigmoidal neurons, whereas single
memristive networks are unable to produce the correct result. Hierarchical
composition is key for solving more complex tasks with such novel nano-scale
hardware.
