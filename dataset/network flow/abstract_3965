We introduce a simple class of distribution networks which withstand damage
by being repairable instead of redundant. We prove a lower bound for the
expected cost of repair, and show that for networks on the square and
triangular lattice, this bound is achievable and results in a network with
exactly three levels of structural hierarchy. We extend our results to networks
subject to repeated attacks, in which the repairs themselves must be
repairable. We find that, in exchange for a modest increase in repair cost,
such networks are able to withstand any number of attacks.
