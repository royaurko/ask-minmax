Random teleportation is a necessary evil for ranking and clustering directed
networks based on random walks. Teleportation enables ergodic solutions, but
the solutions must necessarily depend on the exact implementation and
parametrization of the teleportation. For example, in the commonly used
PageRank algorithm, the teleportation rate must trade off a heavily biased
solution with a uniform solution. Here we show that teleportation to links
rather than nodes enables a much smoother trade-off and effectively more robust
results. We also show that, by not recording the teleportation steps of the
random walker, we can further reduce the effect of teleportation with dramatic
effects on clustering.
