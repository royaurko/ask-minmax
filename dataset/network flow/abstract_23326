A substantial number of algorithms exists for the simulation of moving
particles suspended in fluids. However, finding the best method to address a
particular physical problem is often highly non-trivial and depends on the
properties of the particles and the involved fluid(s) together. In this report
we provide a short overview on a number of existing simulation methods and
provide two state of the art examples in more detail. In both cases, the
particles are described using a Discrete Element Method (DEM). The DEM solver
is usually coupled to a fluid-solver, which can be classified as grid-based or
mesh-free (one example for each is given). Fluid solvers feature different
resolutions relative to the particle size and separation. First, a
multicomponent lattice Boltzmann algorithm (mesh-based and with rather fine
resolution) is presented to study the behavior of particle stabilized fluid
interfaces and second, a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics implementation
(mesh-free, meso-scale resolution, similar to the particle size) is introduced
to highlight a new player in the field, which is expected to be particularly
suited for flows including free surfaces.
