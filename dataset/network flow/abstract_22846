Employing a spin-parameterized Kleldysh-Usadel technique for the diffusive
regime, we demonstrate that even in the low proximity limit, considerable
long-ranged triplet supercurrents can be effectively generated by spin-singlet
supercurrents flowing \textit{parallel} to the interfaces of uniform double
ferromagnet interlayers with noncollinear exchange fields "{\it independent}"
of actual junction geometry. The triplet supercurrents are found to be most
pronounced when the thicknesses of the ferromagnet strips are unequal. To
experimentally verify this generic phenomenon, we propose an accessible and
well-controlled structure that can fully isolate the long-range triplet
effects.
