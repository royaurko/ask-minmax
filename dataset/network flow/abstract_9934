The paper presents a preliminary analysis of traffic flow data collected in
the Lefortovo tunnel located on the 3-rd circular highway of Moscow.
  It is shown that the observed tunnel congested traffic in fact exhibits
cooperative phenomena in vehicle motion, namely, there is a region of widely
scatted states on the fundamental diagrams which is related typically to the
appearance of synchronized traffic. Besides, the spatial autocorrelations in
the occupancy, vehicle velocity, and flow rate measured by different detectors
are found to be essential. Especially it concerns the correlations in the
velocity and occupancy, their correlation length gets values about 1 km.
  The phase portrait of the vehicle ensemble dynamics on the occupancy-velocity
plane is also studied. It is demonstrated that there are two substantially
different region on it. One matches actually the cooperative vehicle motion and
contains some kernel where the dynamics is pure chaotic. The other part of the
phase plane corresponds to the irreversible stage of jam formation.
