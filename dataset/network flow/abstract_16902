A new procedure based on layered feed-forward neural networks for the
microplane material model parameters identification is proposed in the present
paper. Novelties are usage of the Latin Hypercube Sampling method for the
generation of training sets, a systematic employment of stochastic sensitivity
analysis and a genetic algorithm-based training of a neural network by an
evolutionary algorithm. Advantages and disadvantages of this approach together
with possible extensions are thoroughly discussed and analyzed.
