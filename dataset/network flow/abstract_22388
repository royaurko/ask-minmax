We approach the non-perturbative regime in finite temperature QCD within a
formulation in Polyakov gauge. The construction is based on a complete gauge
fixing. Correlation functions are then computed from Wilsonian renormalisation
group flows. First results for the confinement-deconfinement phase transition
for SU(2) are presented. Within a simple approximation we obtain a second order
phase transition within the Ising universality class. The critical temperature
is computed as T_c = 305 MeV.
