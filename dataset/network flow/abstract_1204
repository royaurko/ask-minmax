Traffic modeling of communication networks such as Internet has become a very
important field of research. A number of interesting phenomena are found in
measurements and traffic simulations. One of them is the propagation of
congestion waves opposite to the main packet flow direction. The purpose of
this paper is to model and analyze packet congestion on a given route and to
give a possible explanation to this phenomenon.
