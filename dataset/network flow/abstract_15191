Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can
be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic
programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. In
addition to locating publications, it contains cocontributor and coeditor
relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat
these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the
community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis
discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation
reveals many similarities between GP and cocontributorship networks in other
scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central
network component and a high clustering.
