Random key predistribution scheme of Eschenauer and Gligor (EG) is a typical
solution for ensuring secure communications in a wireless sensor network (WSN).
Connectivity of the WSNs under this scheme has received much interest over the
last decade, and most of the existing work is based on the assumption of
unconstrained sensor-to-sensor communications. In this paper, we study the
k-connectivity of WSNs under the EG scheme with physical link constraints;
k-connectivity is defined as the property that the network remains connected
despite the failure of any (k - 1) sensors. We use a simple communication
model, where unreliable wireless links are modeled as independent on/off
channels, and derive zero-one laws for the properties that i) the WSN is
k-connected, and ii) each sensor is connected to at least k other sensors.
These zero-one laws improve the previous results by Rybarczyk on the
k-connectivity under a fully connected communication model. Moreover, under the
on/off channel model, we provide a stronger form of the zero-one law for the
1-connectivity as compared to that given by Ya\u{g}an. We also discuss the
applicability of our results in a different network application, namely in a
large-scale, distributed publish-subscribe service for online social networks.
