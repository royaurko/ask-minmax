We apply the Symanzik improvement programme to the 4+1-dimensional local
re-formulation of the gradient flow in pure $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theories. We
show that the classical nature of the flow equation allows to eliminate all
cutoff effects at $\mathcal O(a^2)$ which originate either from the discretized
gradient flow equation or from the gradient flow observable. All the remaining
$\mathcal O(a^2)$ effects can be understood in terms of local counterterms at
the zero flow time boundary. We classify these counterterms and provide a
complete set as required for on-shell improvement. Compared to the
4-dimensional pure gauge theory only a single additional counterterm is
required, which corresponds to a modified initial condition for the flow
equation. A consistency test in perturbation theory is passed and allows to
determine all counterterm coefficients to lowest non-trivial order in the
coupling.
