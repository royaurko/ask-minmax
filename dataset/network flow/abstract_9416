A critical need in Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (MWSN) is to achieve energy
efficiency during routing as the sensor nodes have scarce energy resource. The
nodes' mobility in MWSN poses a challenge to design an energy efficient routing
protocol. Clustering helps to achieve energy efficiency by reducing the
organization complexity overhead of the network which is proportional to the
number of nodes in the network. This paper proposes a novel hybrid multipath
routing algorithm with an efficient clustering technique. A node is selected as
cluster head if it has high surplus energy, better transmission range and least
mobility. The Energy Aware (EA) selection mechanism and the Maximal Nodal
Surplus Energy estimation technique incorporated in this algorithm improves the
energy performance during routing. Simulation results can show that the
proposed clustering and routing algorithm can scale well in dynamic and energy
deficient mobile sensor network.
