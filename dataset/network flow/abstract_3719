We construct a sequence of commuting central affine curve flows on
$R^n\backslash 0$ invariant under the action of $SL(n,R)$ and prove the
following results:
  (a) The central affine curvatures of a solution of the j-th central affine
curve flow is a solution of the j-th flow of Gelfand-Dickey (GD$_n$) hierarchy
on the space of n-th order differential operators. (b) We use the solution of
the Cauchy problems of the GD$_n$ flow to solve the Cauchy problems for the
central affine curve flows with periodic initial data and also with initial
data whose central affine curvatures are rapidly decaying. (c) We obtain a
bi-Hamiltonian structure for the central affine curve flow hierarchy and prove
that it arises naturally from the Poisson structures of certain co-adjoint
orbits.
