A noise-tolerant data communications fabric has been developed to meet the
real-time data acquisition and control requirements of fast feedback loops,
machine protection systems, pulse-to-pulse sequencing, and machine-experiment
communications at next-generation pulsed accelerators such as the Next Linear
Collider ("NLC"). The fabric is constructed from "platform" or
"system-on-a-chip" field programmable gate arrays ("FPGAs") containing embedded
processors, block memory, and multi-gigabit serial transceivers interconnected
via an array of point-to-point fiber-optic physical links for standard networks
such as gigabit Ethernet. The FPGA-based link hardware segments messages of
varying priorities into a continuous sequence of fixed-length data cells,
interrupting the cell stream of lower priority messages with those comprising
higher priority traffic. A high level of noise-tolerance is provided by
dedicating almost half the contents of each cell to Reed-Solomon forward error
correcting code ("ECC") data. Further reliability is achieved by hardware
implementation of algorithms for cell-by-cell receipt acknowledgment, receipt
timeout and retransmission after a tunable round-trip propagation delay, and
separate backpressure flow control for each priority.
