J. Streets and G. Tian recently introduced symplectic curvature flow, a
geometric flow on almost K\"ahler manifolds generalising K\"ahler-Ricci flow.
The present article gives examples of explicit solutions to this flow of
non-K\"ahler structures on several nilmanifolds and on twistor fibrations over
hyperbolic space studied by J. Fine and D. Panov. The latter lead to examples
of non-K\"ahler static solutions of symplectic curvature flow which can be seen
as analogues of K\"ahler-Einstein manifolds in K\"ahler-Ricci flow.
