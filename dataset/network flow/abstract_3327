Recently, we have studied evolution of a family of Finsler metrics along
Finsler Ricci flow and proved its convergence in short time. Here, existence of
solutions to the so called Hamilton Ricci flow on Finsler spaces is studied and
a short time solution is found. To this end the Finslerian Ricci-DeTurck flow
on Finsler spaces is defined and existence of its solution in short time is
proved. Next, this solution is pulled back to determine a short time solution
to the Hamilton Ricci flow on underlying Finsler space.
