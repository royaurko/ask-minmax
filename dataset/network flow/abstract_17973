Operating in the ISM band, the wireless sensor network (WSN) risks being
interfered by other concurrent networks. Our concerns are the technologies that
do not perform listening before transmission such as Bluetooth, and the ones
that do not detect other technologies due to their channel sensing techniques
like WIFI. To overcome this issue a WSN node should be able to identify the
presence of such technologies. This will allow deducing the characteristics of
the generated traffic of these technologies, and thus the behavior of the
channel can be predicted. These predictions would help to trigger adequate
reactions as to avoid or synchronize with the concurrent net- works. Many works
exist on link adaptation, but they concern blind adaptations which are
unintelligent and solve momentarily the problem that may reappear over time.
  In this paper, we perform several experiments on a real testbed to categorize
the model of the bit errors in corrupted received packets. These experiments
are performed under different conditions of channel noise and interferences.
This allows us to identify each corruption pattern as a fingerprint for the
interfering technology. Then we propose the mechanism FIM to identify on the
fly the source of the corruption. With an implementation on "Tmote Sky" motes
using Tinyos1.x, We demonstrate the use of FIM for link adaptation in a
coexistence environment. Our mechanism led to throughput improvements of
87%-100% depending on the transmission rate and channel quality.
