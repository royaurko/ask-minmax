We prove that the Ricci flow g(t) starting at any metric on the euclidean
space that is invariant by a transitive nilpotent Lie group N, can be obtained
by solving an ODE for a curve of nilpotent Lie brackets. By using that this ODE
is the negative gradient flow of a homogeneous polynomial, we obtain that g(t)
is type-III, and, up to pull-back by time-dependent diffeomorphisms, that g(t)
converges to the flat metric, and the rescaling |R(g(t))|g(t) converges
smoothly to a Ricci soliton, uniformly on compact sets. The Ricci soliton limit
is also invariant by some transitive nilpotent Lie group, though possibly
non-isomorphic to N.
