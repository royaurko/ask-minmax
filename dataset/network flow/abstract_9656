Wireless networks are becoming the key building block of our communications
infrastructure. Examples range from cellular networks to ad hoc and sensor
networks in wildlife monitoring and environmental scenarios. With the rise of
the Internet of Things (IoT) millions of physical and virtual objects will
communicate wireless and enhance the daily life. The adaptivity and scalability
of wireless networks in the IoT is one of the most challenging tasks.
Bio-inspired networking algorithms are a way to tackle these issues. In this
paper we present a simulation framework based on OMNeT++ to implement ant
routing algorithms to study and compare them on the algorithmic level and an
approach to run large simulation studies in a comprehensive way.
