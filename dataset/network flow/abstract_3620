We have studied the effects of Compton cooling on cooling flow by performing
numerical hydrodynamic calculations of the time evolution of hot gas in
clusters of galaxies with luminous quasars. We assumed various temperatures for
the hot intracluster gas. We have shown that the Compton cooling due to very
luminous quasar is effective in inducing cooling flow, before radiative cooling
flow is realized. The mass flux due to the cooling flow increases with time, as
the Compton cooled region expands. However, the mass flux of the Compton
cooling flow is not large, less than 1 M_sun/yr in our model, since Compton
cooled region is limited in an inner galactic region around a quasar. Even
though the quasar active phase ceased, the cooling flow will continue for at
least 10^9 yr. The accreted mass is enough to explain X-ray absorption lines in
high red shift quasars, if the Compton cooled gas is compressed by high
pressure intracluster gas.
