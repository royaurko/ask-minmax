There is significant benefit to be gained by pursuing multi-messenger
astronomy with gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations. In order to
undertake electromagnetic follow-ups of gravitational wave signals, it will be
necessary to accurately localize them in the sky. Since gravitational wave
detectors are not inherently pointing instruments, localization will occur
primarily through triangulation with a network of detectors. We investigate the
expected timing accuracy for observed signals and the consequences for
localization. In addition, we discuss the effect of systematic uncertainties in
the waveform and calibration of the instruments on the localization of sources.
We provide illustrative results of timing and localization accuracy as well as
systematic effects for coalescing binary waveforms.
