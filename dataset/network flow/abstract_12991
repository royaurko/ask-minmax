The actor model eases the definition of concurrent programs with non uniform
behaviors. Static analysis of such a model was previously done in a data-flow
oriented way, with type systems. This approach was based on constraint set
resolution and was not able to deal with precise properties for communications
of behaviors. We present here a new approach, control-flow oriented, based on
the abstract interpretation framework, able to deal with communication of
behaviors. Within our new analyses, we are able to verify most of the previous
properties we observed as well as new ones, principally based on occurrence
counting.
