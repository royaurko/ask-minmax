We derive the RG-flow equations of the sliding Luttinger liquid perturbed by
charge-density-wave (CDW) and superconducting (SC) operators. Using them we
study the phase diagram of an array of XXZ spin chains coupled by Ising terms.
In the weak coupling regime we find a new class of non-gaussian and unstable
fixed points whose existence is due to a balance between the CDW, SC and
sliding Luttinger couplings.
