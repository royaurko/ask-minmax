We consider perturbations of the Hamiltonian flow associated with the
geodesic flow on a surface of constant negative curvature. We prove that, under
a small perturbation, not necessarely of Hamiltonian character, the SRB measure
associated to the flow exists and is analytic in the strength of the
perturbation. An explicit example of "thermostatted" dissipative dynamics is
constructed.
