In the present paper, the transmission performance analysis of digital wire
and wireless optical links in local and wide areas optical networks have been
modeled and parametrically investigated over wide range of the affecting
parameters. Moreover, we have analyzed the basic equations of the comparative
study of the performance of digital fiber optic links with wire and wireless
optical links. The development of optical wireless communication systems is
accelerating as a high cost effective to wire fiber optic links. The optical
wireless technology is used mostly in wide bandwidth data transmission
applications. Finally, we have investigated the maximum transmission distance
and data transmission bit rates that can be achieved within digital wire and
wireless optical links for local and wide areas optical network applications.
