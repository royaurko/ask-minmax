For $C^2$ weak mixing Axiom A flow $\phi_t: M \longrightarrow M$ on a
Riemannian manifold $M$ and a basic set $\Lambda$ for $\phi_t$ we consider the
Ruelle transfer operator $L_{f - s \tau + z g}$, where $f$ and $g$ are
real-valued H\"older functions on $\Lambda$, $\tau$ is the roof function and
$s, z$ are complex parameters. Under some assumptions about $\phi_t$ we
establish estimates for the iterations of this Ruelle operator in the spirit of
the estimates for operators with one complex parameter (see \cite{D},
\cite{St2}, \cite{St3}). Two cases are covered: (i) for arbitrary H\"older
$f,g$ when $|\Im z| \leq B |\Im s|^\mu$ for some constants $B > 0$, $0 < \mu <
1$ ($\mu = 1$ for Lipschitz $f,g$), (ii) for Lipschitz $f,g$ when $|\Im s| \leq
B_1 |\Im z|$ for some constant $B > 0$ . Applying these estimates, we obtain a
non zero analytic extension of the zeta function $\zeta(s, z)$ for $P_f -
\epsilon < \Re (s) < P_f$ and $|z|$ small enough with simple pole at $s =
s(z)$. Two other applications are considered as well: the first concerns the
Hannay-Ozorio de Almeida sum formula, while the second deals with the
asymptotic of the counting function $\pi_F(T)$ for weighted primitive periods
of the flow $\phi_t.$
