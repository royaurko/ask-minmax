The Naming Games (NG) are agent-based models for agreement dynamics, peer
pressure and herding in social networks, and protocol selection in autonomous
ad-hoc sensor networks. By introducing a small noise term to the NG, the
resulting Markov Chain model called Noisy Naming Games (NNG) are ergodic, in
which all partial consensus states are recurrent. By using Gibbs-Markov
equivalence we show how to get the NNG's stationary distribution in terms of
the local specification of a related Markov Random Field (MRF). By ordering the
partially-synchronized states according to their Gibbs energy, taken here to be
a good measure of social tension, this method offers an enhanced method for
community-detection in social interaction data. We show how the lowest Gibbs
energy multi-name states separate and display the hidden community structures
within a social network.
