The formation of current sheets in ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamic
flows in two dimensions is studied numerically using the technique of adaptive
mesh refinement. The growth of current density is in agreement with simple
scaling assumptions. As expected, adaptive mesh refinement shows to be very
efficient for studying singular structures compared to non-adaptive treatments.
