We developed a method for simulating pedestrian dynamics in a large, dense
crowd. Our numerical model calculates pedestrian motion from Newton second
laws, taking into account visco-elastic contact forces, contact friction, and
ground reaction forces. In our computer simulation, non-spherical shapes
(spheropolygons) modelled the positions of the chest and arms in the packing
arrangement of pedestrian bodies, based on a cross-sectional profile using data
from the US National Library of Medicine. Motive torque was taken to arise
solely from the pedestrians orientation toward their preferred destination. The
objective was to gain insight into a tragic incident at the Madrid Arena
Pavilion in Spain, where five girls were crushed to death. The incident took
place at a Halloween Celebration in 2012, in a long, densely crowded hallway
used as entrance and exit at the same time. Our simulations reconstruct the
mechanics of clogging in the hallway. The hypothetical case of a total
evacuation order was also investigated. The result highlights the importance of
the pedestrians density and the effect of counter flow in the onset of
avalanches and clogging, and provides qualitative measures of the number of
injuries based on a calculation of the contact force network between the
pedestrians.
