The identification of the limiting factors in the dynamical behavior of
complex systems is an important interdisciplinary problem which often can be
traced to the spectral properties of an underlying network. By deriving a
general relation between the eigenvalues of weighted and unweighted networks,
here I show that for a wide class of networks the dynamical behavior is tightly
bounded by few network parameters. This result provides rigorous conditions for
the design of networks with predefined dynamical properties and for the
structural control of physical processes in complex systems. The results are
illustrated using synchronization phenomena as a model process.
