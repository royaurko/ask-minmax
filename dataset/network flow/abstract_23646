We provide a general overview of the velocity-dependent one-scale model for
cosmic string evolution and discuss two further extensions to it. We introduce
and justify a new ansatz for the momentum parameter $k$, and also incorporate
the effect of radiation backreaction. We thus discuss the evolution of the
basic large-scale features of cosmic string networks in all relevant
cosmological scenarios, concentrating in particular on the `scaling' solutions
relevant for each case. In a companion paper, we show, by comparing with
numerical simulations, that this model provides an accurate description of the
large-scale features of cosmic string networks.
