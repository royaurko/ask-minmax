Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is the collection of many small size low cost,
battery operated sensor nodes distributed over the targeted region to collect
the information of interest. We can say these networks can be a fruitful
solution for many applications such as target tracking, intrusion detection
etc. Whenever we are talking about MAC layer protocols we need to give stress
on energy efficiency factor.
