We investigate the flux flow state in a two-gap superconductor in which two
s-wave gaps with different amplitudes exist on two separate Fermi surfaces. The
flux flow resistivity is obtained on the basis of the Bardeen-Stephen relation
and the result agrees well with the anomalous field dependence of the flow
resistivity recently observed in the two-gap superconductor MgB2. Some typical
properties of the vortex in this system are also discussed.
