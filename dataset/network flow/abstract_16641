Starting from a microscopic model of randomly cross-linked particles with
quenched disorder, we calculate the Laudau-Wilson free energy S for arbitrary
cross-link densities. Considering pure shear deformations, S takes the form of
the elastic energy of an isotropic amorphous solid state, from which the shear
modulus can be identified. It is found to be an universal quantity, not
depending on any microscopic length-scales of the model.
