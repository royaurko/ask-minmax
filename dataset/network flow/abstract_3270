We introduce a global quantity $\delta$ that characterizes turbulent
fluctuations in inhomogeneous anisotropic flows. This time-dependent quantity
is based on spatial averages of global velocity fields rather than classical
temporal averages of local velocities. $\delta(t)$ provides a useful
quantitative characterization of any turbulent flow through generally only two
parameters, its time average $\bar \delta$ and its variance $\delta_2$.
Properties of $\bar \delta$ and $\delta_2$ are experimentally studied in the
typical case of the von K\'arm\'an flow and used to characterize the scale by
scale energy budget as a function of the forcing mode as well as the transition
between two flow topologies.
