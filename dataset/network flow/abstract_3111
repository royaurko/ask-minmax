The controllability of a network is a theoretical problem of relevance in a
variety of contexts ranging from financial markets to the brain. Until now,
network controllability has been characterized only on isolated networks, while
the vast majority of complex systems are formed by multilayer networks. Here we
build a theoretical framework for the linear controllability of multilayer
networks by mapping the problem into a combinatorial matching problem. We found
that correlating the external signals in the different layers can significantly
reduce the multiplex network robustness to node removal, as it can be seen in
conjunction with a hybrid phase transition occurring in interacting Poisson
networks. Moreover we observe that multilayer networks can stabilize the fully
controllable multiplex network configuration that can be stable also when the
full controllability of the single network is not stable.
