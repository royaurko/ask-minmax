We present a new, deadlock-free, routing scheme for toroidal interconnection
networks, called OutFlank Routing (OFR). OFR is an adaptive strategy which
exploits non-minimal links, both in the source and in the destination nodes.
When minimal links are congested, OFR deroutes packets to carefully chosen
intermediate destinations, in order to obtain travel paths which are only an
additive constant longer than the shortest ones. Since routing performance is
very sensitive to changes in the traffic model or in the router parameters, an
accurate discrete-event simulator of the toroidal network has been developed to
empirically validate OFR, by comparing it against other relevant routing
strategies, over a range of typical real-world traffic patterns. On the
16x16x16 (4096 nodes) simulated network OFR exhibits improvements of the
maximum sustained throughput between 14% and 114%, with respect to Adaptive
Bubble Routing.
