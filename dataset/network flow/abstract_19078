We take an analytical approach to study the Quality of user Experience (QoE)
for video streaming applications. Our propose is to characterize buffer
starvations for streaming video with Long-Range-Dependent (LRD) input traffic.
Specifically we develop a new analytical framework to investigate Quality of
user Experience (QoE) for streaming by considering a Markov Modulated Fluid
Model (MMFM) that accurately approximates the Long Range Dependence (LRD)
nature of network traffic. We drive the close-form expressions for calculating
the distribution of starvation as well as start-up delay using partial
differential equations (PDEs) and solve them using the Laplace Transform. We
illustrate the results with the cases of the two-state Markov Modulated Fluid
Model that is commonly used in multimedia applications. We compare our
analytical model with simulation results using ns-3 under various operating
parameters. We further adopt the model to analyze the effect of bitrate
switching on the starvation probability and start-up delay. Finally, we apply
our analysis results to optimize the objective quality of experience (QoE) of
media streaming realizing the tradeoff among different metrics incorporating
user preferences on buffering ratio, startup delay and perceived quality.
