Minimum cuts have been closely related to shortest paths in planar graphs via
planar duality - so long as the graphs are undirected. Even maximum flows are
closely related to shortest paths for the same reason - so long as the source
and the sink are on a common face. In this paper, we give a correspondence
between maximum flows and shortest paths via duality in directed planar graphs
with no constraints on the source and sink. We believe this a promising avenue
for developing algorithms that are more practical than the current
asymptotically best algorithms for maximum st-flow.
