In a recent paper, Jaggi et al. (INFOCOM 2007), presented a distributed
polynomial-time rate-optimal network-coding scheme that works in the presence
of Byzantine faults. We revisit their adversarial models and augment them with
three, arguably realistic, models. In each of the models, we present a
distributed scheme that demonstrates the usefulness of the model. In
particular, all of the schemes obtain optimal rate $C-z$, where $C$ is the
network capacity and $z$ is a bound on the number of links controlled by the
adversary.
