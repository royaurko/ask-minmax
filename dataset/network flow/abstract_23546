The spreading of an epidemic is determined by the connectiviy patterns which
underlie the population. While it has been noted that a virus spreads more
easily on a network in which global distances are small, it remains a great
challenge to find approaches that unravel the precise role of local
interconnectedness. Such topological properties enter very naturally in the
framework of our two-timestep description, also providing a novel approach to
tract a probabilistic system. The method is elaborated for SIS-type epidemic
processes, leading to a quantitative interpretation of the role of loops up to
length 4 in the onset of an epidemic.
