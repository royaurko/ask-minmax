The network, the nodes of which are concepts (people's names, companies'
names, etc.), extracted from web-publications, is considered. A working
algorithm of extracting such concepts is presented. Edges of the network under
consideration refer to the reference frequency which depends on the fact how
many times the concepts, which correspond to the nodes, are mentioned in the
same documents. Web-documents being published within a period of time together
form an information flow, which defines the dynamics of the network studied.
The phenomenon of its structure stability, when the number of web-publications,
constituting its formation bases, increases, is discussed
