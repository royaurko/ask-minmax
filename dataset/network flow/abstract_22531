We present the results from our earlier paper (arXiv:math/0602484) on the
affine normal flow on noncompact convex hypersurfaces in affine space from a
more PDE point of view, emphasizing the estimates involved. Our results concern
the limits of solutions to a parabolic Monge-Ampere equation on $S^n$, where a
sequence of smooth strictly convex initial value functions increase
monotonically to a limiting initial value function which is infinite on at
least a hemisphere of $S^n$. We prove long-time existence and instantaneous
smoothing for quite general initial data, and we characterize ancient solutions
as ellipsoids or paraboloids. We make essential use of estimates of Andrews and
Gutierrez-Huang, and barriers due to Calabi.
