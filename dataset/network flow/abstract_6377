Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks provide a significant solution for file sharing
among peers connected to Internet. It is fast and completely decentralised
system with robustness. But due to absence of a server documents on a P2P
network are not rated which makes it difficult for a peer to obtain precise
information in result of a query. In past, some researchers tried to attach
ratings to the peers itself but it was complex and less effective. In this
paper, a novel P2P architecture is proposed which attaches ratings to the
uploaded document directly. These ratings then become as <Rating> element in
its XML advertisement which has several child elements for information
classification. The attached <Rating> element is extracted from the
advertisement in real time and the document is then sorted accordingly.
Therefore, the information can be easily sorted based on a request by a peer
according to the relevance of matter. The information regarding relevance is
obtained by the peer issuing the query. This research leads to a smart P2P
model, the Rated-Resource P2P network (R2P2P).
