Denial of Service (DoS) is a security threat which compromises the
confidentiality of information stored in Local Area Networks (LANs) due to
uncontributorized access by spoofed IP addresses. SYN Flooding is a type of DoS
which is harmful to network as the flooding of packets may delay other users
from accessing the server and in severe cases, the server may need to be shut
down, wasting valuable resources, especially in critical real-time services
such as in e-commerce and the medical field. The objective of this paper is to
review the state-of-the art of detection mechanisms for SYN flooding. The
detection schemes for SYN Flooding attacks have been classified broadly into
three categories - detection schemes based on the router data structure,
detection schemes based on statistical analysis of the packet flow and
detection schemes based on artificial intelligence. The advantages and
disadvantages for various detection schemes under each category have been
critically examined. The performance measures of the categories have also been
compared.
