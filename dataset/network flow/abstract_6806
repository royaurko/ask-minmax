Proper motions in a sunspot group with a delta-configuration and close to the
solar disc center have been studied by employing local correlation tracking
techniques. The analysis is based on more than one hour time series of G-band
images. Radial outflows with a mean speed of 0.67 km s^{-1} have been detected
around the spots, the well-known sunspots moats. However, these outflows are
not found in those umbral core sides without penumbra. Moreover, moat flows are
only found in those sides of penumbrae located in the direction marked by the
penumbral filaments. Penumbral sides perpendicular to them show no moat flow.
These results strongly suggest a relation between the moat flow and the
well-known, filament aligned, Evershed flow. The standard picture of a moat
flow originated from a blocking of the upward propagation of heat is commented
in some detail.
