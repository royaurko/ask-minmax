Single particle spectra as well as elliptic flow in Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV are investigated within a hadronic cascade model and an
ideal hydrodynamic model. Pseudorapidity distribution and transverse momentum
spectra for charged hadrons are surprisingly comparable between these two
models. However, a large deviation is predicted for the elliptic flow. The
forthcoming experimental data will clarify the transport and thermalization
aspects of matter produced in Cu+Cu collisions.
