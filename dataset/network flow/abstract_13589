We revisit a phenomenological description of turbulent thermal convection
along the lines proposed by Gough (1977) in which eddies grow solely by
extracting energy from the unstably stratified mean state and are subsequently
destroyed by internal shear instability. This work is part of an ongoing
investigation for finding a procedure to calculate the turbulent fluxes of heat
and momentum in the presence of a shearing background flow in stars.
