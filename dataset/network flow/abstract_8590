Compressive sensing (CS) has been widely used for the data gathering in
wireless sensor networks for the purpose of reducing the communication overhead
recent years. In this paper, we first show that with simple modification, 1-bit
compressive sensing can also been used for the data gathering in wireless
sensor networks to further reduce the communication overhead. We also propose a
novel blind 1-bit CS reconstruction algorithm which outperforms other state of
the art blind 1-bit CS reconstruction algorithms. Experimental results on real
sensor datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our method.
