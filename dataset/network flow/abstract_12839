It is suggested that a Poynting flux-dominated outflow with a sufficiently
strong magnetic field can pick up hard X-ray photons when the magnetic field is
of sufficient strength. The zeroth generation X-rays pair produce, and the
pairs radiate extremely energetic first generation photons that could be
detected by extensive air shower arrays and/or MILAGRO if they escape the
production site intact. Giant flares from magnetars may thus yield bursts of
UHE photons. GRB-associated Poynting flows may be unstable to pair production
near their source, and their energy rapidly converted to pairs.
