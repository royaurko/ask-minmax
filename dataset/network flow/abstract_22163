Axisymmetric relaxed states of a cylindrical plasma column are found
analytically in both standard and Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by complete
minimization of energy with constraints imposed by invariants inherent in
corresponding models. It is shown that the relaxed state in Hall MHD is the
force-free magnetic field with uniform axial flow and/or rigid azimuthal
rotation. The relaxed states in standard MHD are more complex due to the
coupling between velocity and magnetic field. Application of these states for
reversed-field pinches (RFP) is discussed.
