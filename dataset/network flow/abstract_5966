We contribute to the understanding of how systemic risk arises in a network
of credit-interlinked agents. Motivated by empirical studies we formulate a
network model which, despite its simplicity, depicts the nature of interbank
markets better than a homogeneous model. The components of a vector
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process living on the vertices of the network describe the
financial robustnesses of the agents. For this system, we prove a LLN for
growing network size leading to a propagation of chaos result. We state
properties, which arise from such a structure, and examine the effect of
inhomogeneity on several risk management issues and the possibility of
contagion.
