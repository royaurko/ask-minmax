We use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to study
the non-linear thin shell instability (NTSI) in supersonic colliding flows. We
show that for flows with monochromatic perturbations and for flows with
white-noise perturbations, growth speeds approximate quite well to the analytic
predictions of Vishniac (1994).
  For flows with subsonic turbulence, growth speeds match Vishniac's
predictions only at short wavelengths where the turbulence is weaker. We find
that supersonic turbulence, of a lower Mach number than the colliding flows,
completely suppresses the NTSI. Our results provide a diagnostic for
identifying the presence of the NTSI in colliding flows with turbulence.
