We model the evolution of the accretion disk of WZ Sagittae during the long
quiescence. We find that the large amount of mass in the disk derived from the
outburst luminosity is a severe constraint and demands values of $\alpha_c$
$\approx$ 0.001 in contradiction to some recent suggestions. We include in our
computations the formation of an inner disk hole and the growth of the disk due
to redistribution of angular momentum. We find a new mode of disk evolution.
The disk is quasi-stationary. Only about half of the mass transfered from the
companion star flows through the disk, the other half is needed to build up the
steadily growing outer disk. When the 3:1 resonance radius is reached the disk
growth ends. From then on all transferred matter flows inward, the surface
density increases, leading to an outburst within a few years. We predict
superhumps at low luminosity during this last phase. We discuss X-rays
expected, the white dwarf mass and distance to WZ Sagittae.
