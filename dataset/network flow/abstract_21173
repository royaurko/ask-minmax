The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation with fractional integrals is derived. An
integral of fractional order is considered as an approximation of the integral
on fractal. Fractional integrals can be used to describe the fractal media.
Using fractional integrals, the fractional generalization of the
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is obtained. From the fractional Chapman-Kolmogorov
equation, the Fokker-Planck equation is derived.
