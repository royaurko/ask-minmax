\D0 has used W --> e nu events associated with a high pT jet to probe for the
effects of extended source color dipole radiation in W-jet rapidity
correlations. We have also studied the low energy flow in these events and
shown an enhancement between the jet and the beam directions, indicating the
effects of color coherency.
