In this paper we proceed with investigation of connections between Fokker -
Planck equation and continuum mechanics. In spectral decomposition of Fokker -
Planck equation solution we preserve only terms with the smallest degree of
damping. We find, that macroscopic parameters of Fokker-Planck flows, obtained
in this way, have following properties: velocities field possess potential, its
potential is proportional to density logarithm and satisfy diffusion equation.
We proved, that such a pair of density and velocities field satisfy the set of
classic hydrodynamics equations for isothermal compressible fluid with friction
mass force, proportional to velocity. We proved also, that the potential
velocities field alone, with potential, which satisfy diffusion equation,
satisfy Burgers equation without mass forces.
