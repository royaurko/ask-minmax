We investigate the effect of quenched disorder in the Nagel-Schreckenberg
model of traffic flow. Spatial inhomogenities, i.e. lattice sites where the
braking probability is enlarged, are considered as well as particle disorder,
i.e. cars of a different maximum velocity. Both types of disorder lead to
segregated states.
