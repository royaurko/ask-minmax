This paper is about the wireless sensor network in environmental monitoring
applications. A Wireless Sensor Network consists of many sensor nodes and a
base station. The number and type of sensor nodes and the design protocols for
any wireless sensor network is application specific. The sensor data in this
application may be light intensity, temperature, pressure, humidity and their
variations .Clustering and routing are the two areas which are given more
attention in this paper.
