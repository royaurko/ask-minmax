Recently Shukurov, Stepanov and Sokoloff [\textbf{Phys. Rev. E 69 (2008)}]
have suggested that Moebius flows can support dynamo action. In this report, it
is shown that a steady perturbation of a magnetic field in a general twisted
Riemannian flux tube may support dynamo action. Instead of the twist number
used in the above reference, the focus here is on the Frenet torsion of the
magnetic flux tube. A relation between the constant torsion of the screw dynamo
torus, its internal radius, and the ratio between toroidal and poloidal flow.
Solution of self-induction equation for the screw dynamo torsioned flow, can be
solved to yield a Frenet torsion as high as
${\tau}_{0}\approx{7.5{\times}{\Omega}^{\theta}Hz^{-1}m^{-1}}$, for an applied
random magnetic field of $<B^{0}>\approx{45 G}$ for an induced steady
perturbation of $B_{1}\approx{0.03G}$, as in the Perm Riemannian torus
experiment. The Moebius strip plays the role of the propeller divertor which
imprints the angular velocity ${\Omega}^{\theta}$, around the torus axis, to
the dynamo flow, here this role is played by torsion. Actually this situation
is already familiar to plasma physicists, where in stellarators torsion
substitutes very well the role played by external magnetic fields in tokamaks
making magnetic fields twist along plasma toroidal devices. Weak torsion of the
torus channel is assumed.
