The finite temperature dynamical phases of vortices in films driven by a
uniform force and interacting with the periodic pinning potential of a square
lattice of columnar defects are investigated by Langevin dynamics simulations
of a London model. Vortices driven along the [0,1] direction and at densities
for which there are more vortices than columnar defects ($B>B_{\phi}$) are
considered. At low temperatures, two new dynamical phases, elastic flow and
plastic flow, and a sharp transition between them are identified and
characterized according to the behavior of the vortex spatial order, velocity
distribution and frequency-dependent velocity correlation
