We explore packet traffic dynamics in a data network model near phase
transition point from free flow to congestion. The model of data network is an
abstraction of the Network Layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)
Reference Model of packet switching networks. The Network Layer is responsible
for routing packets across the network from their sources to their destinations
and for control of congestion in data networks. Using the model we investigate
spatio-temporal packets traffic dynamics near the phase transition point for
various network connection topologies, and static and adaptive routing
algorithms. We present selected simulation results and analyze them.
