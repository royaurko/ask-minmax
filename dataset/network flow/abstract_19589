We present a simple description on the electrophoretic dynamics of
polyelectrolytes going through designed channels with narrow constrictions of
slit geometry. By analyzing rheological behaviours of the stuck chain, which is
coupled to the effect of solvent flow, three critical electric fields
(permeation field $E^{(per)} \sim N^{-1}$, deformation field $E^{(def)} \sim
N^{-3/5}$ and injection field $E^{(inj)} \simeq N^0$, with $N$ polymerization
index) are clarified. Between $E^{(per)}$ and $E^{(inj)}$, the chain migration
is dictated by the driven activation process. In particular, at $E>E^{(def)}$,
the stuck chain at the slit entrance is strongly deformed, which enhances the
rate of the permeation. From these observations, electrophoretic mobility at a
given electric field is deduced, which shows non-monotonic dependence on $N$.
For long enough chains, mobility increases with $N$, in good agreement with
experiments. An abrupt change in the electrophoretic flow at a threshold
electric field is formally regarded as a nonequilibrium phase transition.
