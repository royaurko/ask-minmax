Wireless Networks are most appealing in terms of deployment over a wide range
of applications. The key areas are disaster management, industrial unit
automation and battlefield surveillance. The paper presents a study over
inter-operability of MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network) protocols i.e DSDV, OLSR,
ZRP, AODV over WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) [10]. The review here covers all
the prevailing protocol solutions for WSN and deployment of MANET protocols
over them. The need of moving to MANET protocols lie in situation when we talk
about mobile sensory nodes which are a compulsion when we talk about the above
mentioned three areas. However, the deployment may not be limited to these
only.
