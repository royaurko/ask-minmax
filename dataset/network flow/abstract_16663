We consider the problem of maximizing the revenue raised from tolls set on
the arcs of a transportation network, under the constraint that users are
assigned to toll-compatible shortest paths. We first prove that this problem is
strongly NP-hard. We then provide a polynomial time algorithm with a worst-case
precision guarantee of ${1/2}\log_2 m_T+1$, where $m_T$ denotes the number of
toll arcs. Finally we show that the approximation is tight with respect to a
natural relaxation by constructing a family of instances for which the
relaxation gap is reached.
