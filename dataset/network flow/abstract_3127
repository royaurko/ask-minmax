We investigate analytically the behavior of Ising model on two connected
Barabasi-Albert networks. Depending on relative ordering of both networks there
are two possible phases corresponding to parallel or antiparallel alingment of
spins in both networks. A difference between critical temperatures of both
phases disappears in the limit of vanishing inter-network coupling for
identical networks. The analytic predictions are confirmed by numerical
simulations.
