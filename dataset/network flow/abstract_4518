A network is called localizable if the positions of all the nodes of the
network can be computed uniquely. If a network is localizable and embedded in
plane with generic configuration, the positions of the nodes may be computed
uniquely in finite time. Therefore, identifying localizable networks is an
important function. If the complete information about the network is available
at a single place, localizability can be tested in polynomial time. In a
distributed environment, networks with trilateration orderings (popular in real
applications) and wheel extensions (a specific class of localizable networks)
embedded in plane can be identified by existing techniques. We propose a
distributed technique which efficiently identifies a larger class of
localizable networks. This class covers both trilateration and wheel
extensions. In reality, exact distance is almost impossible or costly. The
proposed algorithm based only on connectivity information. It requires no
distance information.
