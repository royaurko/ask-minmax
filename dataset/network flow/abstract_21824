We show that certain right-invariant metrics endow the infinite-dimensional
Lie group of all smooth orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle
with a Riemannian structure. The study of the Riemannian exponential map allows
us to prove infinite-dimensional counterparts of results from classical
Riemannian geometry: the Riemannian exponential map is a smooth local
diffeomorphism and the length-minimizing property of the geodesics holds.
