We used various analytical and numerical techniques to elucidate signal
propagation in a small enzymatic cascade which is subjected to external and
internal noise. The nonlinear character of catalytic reactions, which underlie
protein signal transduction cascades, renders stochastic signaling dynamics in
cytosol biochemical networks distinct from the usual description of stochastic
dynamics in gene regulatory networks. For a simple 2-step enzymatic cascade
which underlies many important protein signaling pathways, we demonstrated that
the commonly used techniques such as the linear noise approximation and the
Langevin equation become inadequate when the number of proteins becomes too
low. Consequently, we developed a new analytical approximation, based on mixing
the generating function and distribution function approaches, to the solution
of the master equation that describes nonlinear chemical signaling kinetics for
this important class of biochemical reactions. Our techniques work in a much
wider range of protein number fluctuations than the methods used previously. We
found that under certain conditions the burst-phase noise may be injected into
the downstream signaling network dynamics, resulting possibly in unusually
large macroscopic fluctuations. In addition to computing first and second
moments, which is the goal of commonly used analytical techniques, our new
approach provides the full time-dependent probability distributions of the
colored non-Gaussian processes in a nonlinear signal transduction cascade.
