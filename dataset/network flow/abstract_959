We consider particles suspended in a randomly stirred or turbulent fluid.
When effects of the inertia of the particles are significant, an initially
uniform scatter of particles can cluster together. We analyse this 'unmixing'
effect by calculating the Lyapunov exponents for dense particles suspended in
such a random three-dimensional flow, concentrating on the limit where the
viscous damping rate is small compared to the inverse correlation time of the
random flow (that is, the regime of large Stokes number). In this limit
Lyapunov exponents are obtained as a power series in a parameter which is a
dimensionless measure of the inertia. We report results for the first seven
orders. The perturbation series is divergent, but we obtain accurate results
from a Pade-Borel summation. We deduce that particles can cluster onto a
fractal set and show that its dimension is in satisfactory agreement with
previously reported in simulations of turbulent Navier-Stokes flows. We also
investigate the rate of formation of caustics in the particle flow.
