Big data analysis has become much popular in the present day scenario and the
manipulation of big data has gained the keen attention of researchers in the
field of data analytics. Analysis of big data is currently considered as an
integral part of many computational and statistical departments. As a result,
novel approaches in data analysis are evolving on a daily basis. Thousands of
transaction requests are handled and processed everyday by different websites
associated with e-commerce, e-banking, e-shopping carts etc. The network
traffic and weblog analysis comes to play a crucial role in such situations
where Hadoop can be suggested as an efficient solution for processing the
Netflow data collected from switches as well as website access-logs during
fixed intervals.
