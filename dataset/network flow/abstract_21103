Similar evolutionary variational inequalities appear as convenient
formulations for continuous quasistationary models for sandpile growth,
formation of a network of lakes and rivers, magnetization of type-II
superconductors, and elastoplastic deformations. We outline the main steps of
such models derivation and try to clarify the origin of this similarity. New
dual variational formulations, analogous to mixed variational inequalities in
plasticity, are derived for sandpiles and superconductors.
