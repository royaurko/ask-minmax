We investigate formation of economic and social networks where agents may
form or cut ties. The novelty is combining a setup where agents are
heterogeneous in their talent for generating value in the links they form and
value may also accrue from indirect ties. We provide sufficient conditions for
assortative matching: agents of greater talent have partners of greater talent.
A novel feature is that agents with higher talent are more central in networks.
Another novel feature is degree assortativity: partnered agents have a similar
number of partners. Two suboptimal network structures are noteworthy. One
network displays excess assortativity as high and low talented types fail to
connect, and thus inefficient due to payoff externalities despite otherwise
obeying the conditions of Becker (1973). In another suboptimal network an agent
of low talent becomes excessively central.
