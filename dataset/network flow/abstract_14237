We use large-scale parallel simulations to compute the motion of
superconducting magnetic vortices during avalanches triggered by small field
increases. We find that experimentally observable voltage bursts correspond to
pulsing vortex movement along branched channels or winding chains, and relate
vortex flow images to features of statistical distributions. As pin density is
increased, a crossover occurs from interstitial motion in narrow easy-flow
winding channels with typical avalanche sizes, to pin-to-pin motion in broad
channels, characterized by a very broad distribution of sizes. Our results are
consistent with recent experiments.
