The Web has been chosen as a basic infrastructure to gain the social
structure information, through the social network extraction, from all over the
world. However, most of the web documents are unstructured and lack of
semantics. Moreover, that network is subject to all kinds of changes and
dynamics, and a network can be very complex due to the large number of nodes
and links Web contains. In this paper, we discuss a methodology that meant to
assists in extracting and modeling the social network from Web snippet. As the
manual social network extraction of web documents is impractical and
unscalable, and fully automated extraction are still at the very early stage to
be implemented, we proposed a (semi)-automatic extraction based on the
superficial methods.
