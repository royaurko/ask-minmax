One of the first theorems in perturbation theory claims that for an arbitrary
self-adjoint operator A there exists a perturbation B of Hilbert-Schmidt class,
which destroys completely the absolutely continuous spectrum of A (von
Neumann). However, if A is the discrete free 1-D Schr\"odinger operator and B
is a Jacobi matrix the a.c. spectrum remains perfectly the same. Moreover,
Killip and Simon described explicitly the spectral properties for such A+B.
Jointly with Damanik they generalized this result to the case of perturbations
of periodic Jacobi matrices. Recall that the spectrum of a periodic Jacobi
matrix is a system of intervals of a very specific nature. Christiansen, Simon
and Zinchenko posed the following question: "is there an extension of the
Damanik-Killip-Simon theorem to the general finite system of intervals case?"
Here we solve this problem completely. Our method deals with the Jacobi flow on
GMP matrices. GMP (an abbreviation for Generalized Moment Problem) matrices are
probably a new object in the spectral theory (a very close relative of Jacobi
and CMV matrices). The Jacobi flow on them is also a probably new member of the
rich family of integrable systems. An ideology of analytic vector bundles plays
an essential role in our construction.
