Binary constrained flows of soliton equations admitting $2\times 2$ Lax
matrices have 2N degrees of freedom, which is twice as many as degrees of
freedom in the case of mono-constrained flows. For their separation of
variables only N pairs of canonical separated variables can be introduced via
their Lax matrices by using the normal method. A new method to introduce the
other N pairs of canonical separated variables and additional separated
equations is proposed. The Jacobi inversion problems for binary constrained
flows are established. Finally, the factorization of soliton equations by two
commuting binary constrained flows and the separability of binary constrained
flows enable us to construct the Jacobi inversion problems for some soliton
hierarchies.
