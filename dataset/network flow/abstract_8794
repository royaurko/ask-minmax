The equations for the three-dimensional incompressible flow of liquid
crystals are considered in a smooth bounded domain. The existence and
uniqueness of the global strong solution with small initial data are
established. It is also proved that when the strong solution exists, all the
global weak solutions constructed in [16] must be equal to the unique strong
solution.
