Networked control systems (NCS) are spatially distributed systems where
communication among plants, sensors, actuators and controllers occurs in a
shared communication network. NCS have been studied for the last ten years and
important research results have been obtained. These results are in the area of
stability and stabilizability. However, while important, these results must be
complemented in different areas to be able to design effective NCS. In this
paper we approach the control design of NCS using symbolic (finite) models.
Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems where one
symbol corresponds to an "aggregate" of continuous states. We consider a fairly
general multiple-loop network architecture where plants communicate with
digital controllers through a shared, non-ideal, communication network
characterized by variable sampling and transmission intervals, variable
communication delays, quantization errors, packet losses and limited bandwidth.
We first derive a procedure to obtain symbolic models that are proven to
approximate NCS in the sense of alternating approximate bisimulation. We then
use these symbolic models to design symbolic controllers that realize
specifications expressed in terms of automata on infinite strings. An example
is provided where we address the control design of a pair of nonlinear control
systems sharing a common communication network. The closed-loop NCS obtained is
validated through the OMNeT++ network simulation framework.
