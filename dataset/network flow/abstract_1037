We have measured the nonlinear rheological response of a model transient
network over a large range of steady shear rates. The system is built up from
an oil in water droplet microemulsion into which a telechelic polymer is
incorporated. The phase behaviour is characterized which comprises a liquid-gas
phase separation and a percolation threshold. The rheological measurements are
performed in the one phase region above the percolation line. Shear thinning is
observed for all samples, leading in most cases to an unstable stress response
at intermediate shear rates. We built up a very simple mean field model which
involves the reduction of the residence time of the stickers in the droplets
due to the chain tensions at high shear. The computed constitutive equation is
non-monotonic with a range where the stress is a decreasing function of the
rate, a feature that indeed makes homogeneous flows unstable. The computed the
flow curves compare well to the experiments.
