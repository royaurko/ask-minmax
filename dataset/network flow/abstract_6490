A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a self-configuring infrastructure less
network of mobile devices connected by wireless links. In this network
technology, simulative analysis is a significant method to understand the
performance of routing protocols. In this paper three protocols AODV, DSDV and
DSR were simulated using Manhattan Grid Mobility Model. The reactive (AODV,
DSR) and proactive (DSDV) protocols internal mechanism leads to considerable
performance difference. The performance differentials are analyzed using NS-2
which is the main network simulator, NAM (Network Animator), AWK (post
processing script) and were compared in terms of Packet Delivery Fraction
(PDF), Average end-to-end Delay and Throughput, in different environments
specified by varying network load, mobility rate and number of nodes. Our
results presented in this research work demonstrate the performance analysis of
AODV, DSDV and DSR routing protocols. It has been observed that, under
Manhattan Grid mobility model, AODV and DSR performs better than DSDV in terms
of PDF and Throughput. However in term of Average end-to-end Delay, DSDV
appears to be the best one.
