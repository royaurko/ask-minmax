The effects of initial state fluctuations on elliptic flow are investigated
within a (3+1)d Boltzmann + hydrodynamics transport approach. The spatial
eccentricity ($\epsilon_{\rm RP}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm part}$) is calculated for
initial conditions generated by a hadronic transport approach (UrQMD). Elliptic
flow results as a function of impact parameter, beam energy and transverse
momentum for two different equations of state and for averaged initial
conditions or a full event-by-event setup are presented. These investigations
allow the conclusion that in mid-central ($b=5-9$ fm) heavy ion collisions the
final elliptic flow is independent of the initial state fluctuations and the
equation of state. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that most of the $v_2$ is
build up during the hydrodynamic stage of the evolution. Therefore, the use of
averaged initial profiles does not contribute to the uncertainties of the
extraction of transport properties of hot and dense QCD matter based on viscous
hydrodynamic calculations.
