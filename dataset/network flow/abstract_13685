We review the signatures for the soft collective dynamics in
highest-multiplicity ultrarelativistic p-Pb collisions and show that the
effects are well described in a three-stage model, consisting of the
event-by-event Glauber initial conditions, viscous 3+1D hydrodynamics, and
statistical hadronization. In particular, we discuss the ridges in two-particle
correlations in the relative azimuth and pseudorapidity, the elliptic and
triangular flow coefficients, and the mass hierarchy of observables sensitive
to flow.
