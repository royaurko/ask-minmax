Network jammers can uncover the reliability of the wireless networks, where
the position of the jammer node permit the network to cope with jamming
leveraging varieties of defence strategies. Wireless Bluetooth network is a
short range network, where the Bluetooth transceiver is operating in the 2.4
GHz ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) radio band, and a special type of
frequency hopping pattern was included with the specification of the Bluetooth
technology to offer the necessity requirement for the matching Radio Frequency
RF channels. This paper calculates and evaluates the effect of noise power
jammer and follower jammer on the Personal Area Network (PAN) Bluetooth
network. The results prove that the effect on the Bluetooth network depends on
many factors such as power density, distance and immunity technique, which is
used in many Bluetooth networks.
