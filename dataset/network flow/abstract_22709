Dependency analysis is a program analysis that determines potential data flow
between program points. While it is not a security analysis per se, it is a
viable basis for investigating data integrity, for ensuring confidentiality,
and for guaranteeing sanitization. A noninterference property can be stated and
proved for the dependency analysis. We have designed and implemented a
dependency analysis for JavaScript. We formalize this analysis as an
abstraction of a tainting semantics. We prove the correctness of the tainting
semantics, the soundness of the abstraction, a noninterference property, and
the termination of the analysis.
