Elliptic flow signals the presence of multiple interactions between the
constituents of the created matter in heavy-ion collisions. This includes
possible contributions from the different phases, including the hadronic phase.
In these proceedings I will first show that the energy dependence of elliptic
flow, based on recent ALICE and STAR beam energy scan measurements, can largely
be understood in terms of a boosted thermal system. In addition, a detailed
comparison between the identified particle elliptic flow measured by the ALICE
collaboration and viscous hydrodynamical model calculations with and without a
hadronic afterburner is performed to constrain the possible effects of
individual hadron-hadron re-interaction cross-sections.
