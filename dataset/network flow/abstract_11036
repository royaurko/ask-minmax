The goal of this work is to model the peering arrangements between Autonomous
Systems (ASes). Most existing models of the AS-graph assume an undirected
graph. However, peering arrangements are mostly asymmetric Customer-Provider
arrangements, which are better modeled as directed edges. Furthermore, it is
well known that the AS-graph, and in particular its clustering structure, is
influenced by geography.
  We introduce a new model that describes the AS-graph as a directed graph,
with an edge going from the customer to the provider, but also models symmetric
peer-to-peer arrangements, and takes geography into account. We are able to
mathematically analyze its power-law exponent and number of leaves. Beyond the
analysis we have implemented our model as a synthetic network generator we call
GdTang. Experimentation with GdTang shows that the networks it produces are
more realistic than those generated by other network generators, in terms of
its power-law exponent, fractions of customer-provider and symmetric peering
arrangements, and the size of its dense core. We believe that our model is the
first to manifest realistic regional dense cores that have a clear geographic
flavor. Our synthetic networks also exhibit path inflation effects that are
similar to those observed in the real AS graph.
