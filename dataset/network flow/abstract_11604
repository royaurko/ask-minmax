Mobile malware and mobile network attacks are becoming a significant threat
that accompanies the increasing popularity of smart phones and tablets. Thus in
this paper we present our research vision that aims to develop a network-based
security solution combining analytical modelling, simulation and learning,
together with billing and control-plane data, to detect anomalies and attacks,
and eliminate or mitigate their effects, as part of the EU FP7 NEMESYS project.
These ideas are supplemented with a careful review of the state-of-the-art
regarding anomaly detection techniques that mobile network operators may use to
protect their infrastructure and secure users against malware.
