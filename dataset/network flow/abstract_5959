The user equilibrium in traffic assignment problem is based on the fact that
travelers choose the minimum-cost path between every origin-destination pair
and on the assumption that such a behavior will lead to an equilibrium of the
traffic network. In this paper, we consider this problem when the traffic
network links are fuzzy cost. Therefore, a Physarum-type algorithm is developed
to unify the Physarum network and the traffic network for taking full of
advantage of Physarum Polycephalum's adaptivity in network design to solve the
user equilibrium problem. Eventually, some experiments are used to test the
performance of this method. The results demonstrate that our approach is
competitive when compared with other existing algorithms.
