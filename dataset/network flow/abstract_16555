We study the dynamics of a finite chain of diffusively coupled Lorenz
oscillators with periodic boundary conditions. Such rings possess infinitely
many fixed states, some of which are observed to be stable. It is shown that
there exists a stable fixed state in arbitrarily large rings for a fixed
coupling strength. This suggests that coherent behavior in networks of
diffusively coupled systems may appear at a coupling strength that is
independent of the size of the network.
