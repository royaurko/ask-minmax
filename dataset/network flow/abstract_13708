An explicit determination of all local conservation laws of kinematic type on
moving domains and moving surfaces is presented for the Euler equations of
inviscid compressible fluid flow on curved Riemannian manifolds in n>1
dimensions. All corresponding kinematic constants of motion are also
determined, along with all Hamiltonian kinematic symmetries and kinematic
Casimirs which arise from the Hamiltonian structure of the inviscid
compressible fluid equations.
