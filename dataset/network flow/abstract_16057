From network topologies to online social networks, many of today's most
sensitive datasets are captured in large graphs. A significant challenge facing
owners of these datasets is how to share sensitive graphs with collaborators
and contributorized users, e.g. network topologies with network equipment vendors or
Facebook's social graphs with academic collaborators. Current tools can provide
limited node or edge privacy, but require modifications to the graph that
significantly reduce its utility.
  In this work, we propose a new alternative in the form of graph watermarks.
Graph watermarks are small graphs tailor-made for a given graph dataset, a
secure graph key, and a secure user key. To share a sensitive graph G with a
collaborator C, the owner generates a watermark graph W using G, the graph key,
and C's key as input, and embeds W into G to form G'. If G' is leaked by C,its
owner can reliably determine if the watermark W generated for C does in fact
reside inside G', thereby proving C is responsible for the leak. Graph
watermarks serve both as a deterrent against data leakage and a method of
recourse after a leak. We provide robust schemes for creating, embedding and
extracting watermarks, and use analysis and experiments on large, real graphs
to show that they are unique and difficult to forge. We study the robustness of
graph watermarks against both single and powerful colluding attacker models,
then propose and empirically evaluate mechanisms to dramatically improve
resilience.
