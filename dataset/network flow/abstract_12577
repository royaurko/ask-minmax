The sum rate performance of random-access networks crucially depends on the
access protocol and receiver structure. Despite extensive studies, how to
characterize the maximum sum rate of the simplest version of random access,
Aloha, remains an open question. In this paper, a comprehensive study of the
sum rate performance of Aloha networks is presented. By extending the unified
analytical framework proposed in [20], [21] from the classical collision model
to the capture model, the network steady-state point in saturated conditions is
derived as a function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
threshold which determines a fundamental tradeoff between the information
encoding rate and the network throughput. To maximize the sum rate, both the
SINR threshold and backoff parameters of nodes should be properly selected.
Explicit expressions of the maximum sum rate and the optimal setting are
obtained under various assumptions on the receiver model and channel
conditions. The analysis reveals that similar to the sum capacity of the
multiple access channel, the maximum sum rate of Aloha also logarithmically
increases with the mean received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but the high-SNR
slope is only $e^{-1}$. Effects of backoff, multipacket reception, channel
fading and power control on the sum rate performance of Aloha networks are
further discussed, which shed important light on the practical network design.
