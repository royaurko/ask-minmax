Nanostructured metamaterials, especially arrays of metallic nanoparticles
which sustain the excitation of localized plasmon polaritons, provide excellent
opportunities to mold the flow of light in the linear regime. We suggest a
metamaterial structure whose properties are determined not only by its inner
geometry but also by its entire shape. We call this structure a
\emph{metamaterial nanotip}. We evaluate the potential of this nanotip to
control the size and the location of the field enhancement. Two-dimensional
implementations of this metamaterial nanotip were comprehensively numerically
simulated and confirm the expected, physically distinct regimes of operation.
