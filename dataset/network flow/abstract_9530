Recent years have seen increased interest in the online presence of extreme
right groups. Although originally composed of dedicated websites, the online
extreme right milieu now spans multiple networks, including popular social
media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Ideally therefore, any
contemporary analysis of online extreme right activity requires the
consideration of multiple data sources, rather than being restricted to a
single platform. We investigate the potential for Twitter to act as a gateway
to communities within the wider online network of the extreme right, given its
facility for the dissemination of content. A strategy for representing
heterogeneous network data with a single homogeneous network for the purpose of
community detection is presented, where these inherently dynamic communities
are tracked over time. We use this strategy to discover and analyze persistent
English and German language extreme right communities.
