A hidden generalized gauge symmetry of a cutoff QED is used to show the
renormalizability of QED. In particular, it is shown that corresponding Ward
identities are valid all along the renormalization group flow. The exact
Renormalization Group flow equation corresponding to the effective action of a
cutoff lambda phi^4 theory is also derived. Generalization to any gauge group
is indicated.
