Both analytical and numerical works show that magnetic reconnection must
occur in hot accretion flows. This process will effectively heat and accelerate
electrons. In this paper we use the numerical hybrid simulation of magnetic
reconnection plus test-electron method to investigate the electron acceleration
and heating due to magnetic reconnection in hot accretion flows. We consider
fiducial values of density, temperature, and magnetic parameter $\beta_e$
(defined as the ratio of the electron pressure to the magnetic pressure) of the
accretion flow as $n_{0} \sim 10^{6} {\rm cm^{-3}}$, $T_{e}^0\sim 2\times 10^9
{\rm K}$, and $\beta_e=1$. We find that electrons are heated to a higher
temperature $T_{e}=5\times 10^9$K, and a fraction $\eta\sim 8%$ of electrons
are accelerated into a broken power-law distribution, $dN(\gamma)\propto
\gamma^{-p}$, with $p\approx 1.5$ and 4 below and above $\sim 1$ MeV,
respectively. We also investigate the effect of varying $\beta$ and $n_0$. We
find that when $\beta_e$ is smaller or $n_0$ is larger, i.e, the magnetic field
is stronger, $T_e$, $\eta$, and $p$ all become larger.
