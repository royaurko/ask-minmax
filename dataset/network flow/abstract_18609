Recently, the prospects for amorphous phases of graphene (a-G) have been
explored computationally. Initial models were flat, and contained odd-member
rings, while maintaining three-fold coordination and sp2 bonding. Upon
relaxation, puckering occurs, and may be traced to the existence of pentagons,
in analogy with the situation for fullerenes. In this work, we systematically
explore the inherent structures with energy close to the flat starting
structure. As expected, the planar symmetry can be broken in various ways,
which we characterize for 800-atom model of a-G, always using local basis
density functional techniques. The classical normal modes of various structural
models are discussed, with an emphasis on imaginary modes indicating the
evolution from flat to puckered. We also discuss very low energy conformational
fluctuations akin to those seen previously in amorphous silicon, and reflect on
the nature of the amorphous "ground state" within a network of fixed topology.
For completeness, high energy modes were also computed, and are found to be
associated with strained parts of the network.
