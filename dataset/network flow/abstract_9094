In this paper we propose wireless sensor network architecture with layered
protocols, targeting different aspects of the awareness requirements in
wireless sensor networks. Under such a unified framework, we pay special
attention to the most important awareness issues in wireless sensor networks:
namely dynamic awareness, energy awareness and spatiotemporal awareness. First,
we propose the spatiotemporal aware routing protocol for wireless sensor
networks, which maintains a constant delivery speed for soft real-time
communication. Second, we introduce the time-energy aware aggregation scheme,
which increases the degree of aggregation and reduces energy consumption
without jeopardizing the end-to-end delay. It is the data aggregation scheme to
take the timely delivery of messages as well as protocol overhead into account
to adjust aggregation strategies adaptively in accordance with assessed traffic
conditions and expected wireless sensor network requirements. Third, we also
deal with dynamic awareness by proposing a new communication category based on
a lazy-binding concept. The evaluation of this integrated architecture
demonstrates its performance composability and its capability to be tailored
for applications with different awareness requirements. We believe that the
integrated architecture, supporting various kinds of awareness requirements,
lays a foundation for overall wireless sensor network.
