Elliptic flow results are presented for Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}
= 130$
 GeV in RHIC. This signal is investigated as a function of transverse momentum,
rapidity and centrality. Results from four-particle correlation analysis, which
can filter out contributions to the flow signal from correlations unrelated to
the event reaction plane (``non-flow''), are presented and compared to the
conventional method, in which non-flow effects are treated as part of the
systematic uncertainty.
