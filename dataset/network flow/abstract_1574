We introduce a simple lattice model of traffic flow in a city where drivers
optimize their route-selection in time in order to avoid traffic jams, and
study its phase structure as a function of the density of vehicles and of the
drivers' behavioral parameters via numerical simulations and mean-field
analytical arguments. We identify a phase transition between a low- and a
high-density regime. In the latter, inductive drivers may surprisingly behave
worse than randomly selecting drivers.
