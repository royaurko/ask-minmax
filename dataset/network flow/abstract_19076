We present a novel efficient adaptive sensing and monitoring solution for a
system of mobile sensing devices that support traffic monitoring applications.
We make a key observation that much of the variance in commute times arises at
a few congestion hotspots, and a reliable estimate of congestion can be
obtained by selectively monitoring congestion just at these hotspots. We design
a smartphone application and a backend system that automatically identifies and
monitors congestion hotspots. The solution has low resource footprint in terms
of both battery usage on the sensing devices and the network bytes used for
uploading data. When a user is not inside any hotspot zone, adaptive sampling
conserves battery power and reduces network usage, while ensuring that any new
hotspots can be effectively identified. Our results show that our application
consumes 40- 80% less energy than a periodic sampling system for different
routes in our experiments, with similar accuracy of congestion information. The
system can be used for a variety of applications such as automatic congestion
alerts to users approaching hotspots, reliable end-to-end commute time
estimates and effective alternate route suggestions.
