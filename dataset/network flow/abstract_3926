In this paper we study the controllability of networked systems with static
network topologies using tools from algebraic graph theory. Each agent in the
network acts in a decentralized fashion by updating its state in accordance
with a nearest-neighbor averaging rule, known as the consensus dynamics. In
order to control the system, external control inputs are injected into the so
called leader nodes, and the influence is propagated throughout the network.
Our main result is a tight topological lower bound on the rank of the
controllability matrix for such systems with arbitrary network topologies and
possibly multiple leaders.
