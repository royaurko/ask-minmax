A celebrated universal aspect of wall-bounded turbulent flows is the von
Karman log-law-of-the-wall, describing how the mean velocity in the streamwise
direction depends on the distance from the wall. Although the log-law is known
for more than 75 years, the von Karman constant governing the slope of the
log-law was not determined theoretically. In this Letter we show that the
von-Karman constant can be estimated from homogeneous turbulent data, i.e.
without information from wall-bounded flows.
