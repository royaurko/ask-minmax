We consider a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which is applicable to lattice
theories defined on Lefschetz thimbles. In the algorithm, any point (field
configuration) on a thimble is parametrized uniquely by the flow-direction and
the flow-time defined at a certain asymptotic region close to the critical
point, and it is generated by solving the gradient flow equation downward. The
associated complete set of tangent vectors is also generated in the same
manner. Molecular dynamics is then formulated as a constrained dynamical
system, where the equations of motion with Lagrange multipliers are solved by
the second-order constraint-preserving symmetric integrator. The algorithm is
tested in the lambda phi^4 model at finite density, by choosing the thimbles
associated with the classical vacua for subcritical and supercritical values of
chemical potential. For the lattice size L=4, we find that the residual sign
factors average to not less than 0.99 and are safely included by reweighting
and that the results of the number density are consistent with those obtained
by the complex Langevin simulations.
