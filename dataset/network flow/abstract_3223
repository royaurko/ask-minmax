A review of earlier fluid dynamical calculations with QGP show a softening of
the directed flow while with hadronic matter this effect is absent. The effect
shows up in the reaction plane as enhanced emission which is orthogonal to the
directed flow. Thus, it is not shadowed by the deflected projectile and target.
As both of these flow components are in the reaction plane these form an
enhanced 'elliptic flow' pattern. Recent experimental data at 11 AGeV and above
show the same softening, hinting at QGP formation.
