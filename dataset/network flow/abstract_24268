Chaos and its applications in the field of secure communications have
attracted a lot of attention. Chaos-based pseudo-random number generators are
critical to guarantee security over open networks as the Internet. We have
previously demonstrated that it is possible to define such generators with good
statistical properties by using a tool called "chaotic iterations", which
depends on an iteration function. An approach to find update functions such
that the associated generator presents a random-like and chaotic behavior is
proposed in this research work. To do so, we use the vectorial Boolean negation
as a prototype and explain how to modify this iteration function without
deflating the good properties of the associated generator. Simulation results
and basic security analysis are then presented to evaluate the randomness of
this new family of generators.
