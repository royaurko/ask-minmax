Growing networks have a causal structure. We show that the causality strongly
influences the scaling and geometrical properties of the network. In particular
the average distance between nodes is smaller for causal networks than for
corresponding homogeneous networks. We explain the origin of this effect and
illustrate it using as an example a solvable model of random trees. We also
discuss the issue of stability of the scale-free node degree distribution. We
show that a surplus of links may lead to the emergence of a singular node with
the degree proportional to the total number of links. This effect is closely
related to the backgammon condensation known from the balls-in-boxes model.
