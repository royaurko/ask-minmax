We study the flow spectrum ${\cal S}(G)$ and the integer flow spectrum
$\overline{{\cal S}}(G)$ of signed $(2t+1)$-regular graphs. We show that if $r
\in {\cal S}(G)$, then $r = 2+\frac{1}{t}$ or $r \geq 2 + \frac{2}{2t-1}$.
Furthermore, $2 + \frac{1}{t} \in {\cal S}(G)$ if and only if $G$ has a
$t$-factor. If $G$ has a 1-factor, then $3 \in \overline{{\cal S}}(G)$, and for
every $t \geq 2$, there is a signed $(2t+1)$-regular graph $(H,\sigma)$ with $
3 \in \overline{{\cal S}}(H)$ and $H$ does not have a 1-factor.
  If $G$ $(\not = K_2^3)$ is a cubic graph which has a 1-factor, then $\{3,4\}
\subseteq {\cal S}(G) \cap \overline{{\cal S}}(G)$. Furthermore, the following
four statements are equivalent: (1) $G$ has a 1-factor. (2) $3 \in {\cal
S}(G)$. (3) $3 \in \overline{{\cal S}}(G)$. (4) $4 \in \overline{{\cal S}}(G)$.
There are cubic graphs whose integer flow spectrum does not contain 5 or 6, and
we construct an infinite family of bridgeless cubic graphs with integer flow
spectrum $\{3,4,6\}$.
  We show that there are signed graphs where the difference between the integer
flow number and the flow number is greater than or equal to 1, disproving a
conjecture of Raspaud and Zhu.
  The paper concludes with a proof of Bouchet's 6-flow conjecture for
Kotzig-graphs.
