We show that any topologically transitive codimension-one Anosov flow on a
closed manifold is topologically equivalent to a smooth Anosov flow that
preserves a smooth volume. By a classical theorem due to Verjovsky, any higher
dimensional codimension-one Anosov flow is topologically transitive. Recently,
Simic showed that any higher dimensional codimension-one Anosov flow that
preserves a smooth volume is topologically equivalent to the suspension of an
Anosov diffeomorphism. Therefore, our result gives a complete classification of
codimension-one Anosov flow up to topological equivalence in higher dimensions.
  In this second version, the order of the presentation of the proof is changed
and some minor errors in the previous version is corrected.
