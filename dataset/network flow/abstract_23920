Reactions to textual content posted in an online social network show
different dynamics depending on the linguistic style and readability of the
submitted content. Do similar dynamics exist for responses to scientific
articles? Our intuition, supported by previous research, suggests that the
success of a scientific article depends on its content, rather than on its
linguistic style. In this article, we examine a corpus of scientific abstracts
and three forms of associated reactions: article downloads, citations, and
bookmarks. Through a class-based psycholinguistic analysis and readability
indices tests, we show that certain stylistic and readability features of
abstracts clearly concur in determining the success and viral capability of a
scientific article.
