We study the uniaxial compressive behavior of disordered colloidal
free-standing micropillars composed of a bidisperse mixture of 3 and 6 um
polystyrene particles. Mechanical annealing of confined pillars enables
variation of the packing fraction across the phase space of colloidal glasses.
The measured normalized strengths and elastic moduli of the annealed
freestanding micropillars span almost three orders-of-magnitude despite similar
plastic morphology governed by shear banding. We measure a robust correlation
between ultimate strengths and elastic constants that is invariant to relative
humidity, implying a critical strain of $\sim$0.01 that is strikingly similar
to that observed in metallic glasses (MGs) [W.L. Johnson, K. Samwer, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 95, 195501, 2005] and suggestive of a universal mode of cooperative
plastic deformation. We estimate the characteristic strain of the underlying
cooperative plastic event by considering the energy necessary to create an
Eshelby-like ellipsoidal inclusion in an elastic matrix. We find that the
characteristic strain is similar to that found in experiments and simulations
of other disordered solids with distinct bonding and particle sizes, suggesting
a universal criterion for the elastic to plastic transition in glassy materials
with the capacity for finite plastic flow.
