The flow rate of grains through large orifices is known to be dependent on
its diameter to a 5/2 power law. This relationship has been checked for big
outlet sizes, whereas an empirical fitting parameter is needed to reproduce the
behavior for small openings.
  In this work, we provide experimental data and numerical simulations covering
a wide span of outlet sizes, both in three and two dimensions. This allows us
to show that the laws that are usually employed are satisfactory only if a
small range of openings is considered. We propose a new law for the mass flow
rate of grains that correctly reproduces the data for all the orifice sizes,
including the behaviors for very large and very small outlet sizes.
