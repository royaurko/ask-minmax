Whether you just want to take a peek of a remote computer status, or you want
to install the latest version of a software on several workstations, you can do
all of this from your computer. The networks are growing, the time spent
administering the workstations increases and the number of repetitive tasks is
going sky high. But here comes MESH to take that load off your shoulders. And
because of SMS commands you can take this "command center" wherever you will
go. Just connect a GSM phone to the computer (using a cable, IrDA or Bluetooth)
and lock/restart/shutdown computers from your LAN with the push of a cell phone
button. You can even create your own SMS commands. This is MESH - the network
administrator's Swiss knife
