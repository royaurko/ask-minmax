An important problem in the theory of compressible gas flows is to understand
the singular behavior of vacuum states. The main difficulty lies in the fact
that the system becomes degenerate at the vacuum boundary, where the
characteristics coincide and have unbounded derivative. In this paper, we
overcome this difficulty by presenting a new formulation and new energy spaces.
We establish the local in time well-posedness of one-dimensional compressible
Euler equations for isentropic flows with the physical vacuum singularity in
some spaces adapted to the singularity.
