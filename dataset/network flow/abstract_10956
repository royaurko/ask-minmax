We investigate course registration data of 18 semesters at a Korean
University to portray the time evolution of students' positions in the network
of fellow students. Apart from being a study of the social positions of
students, the present work is also an example of how large-scale, time
resolved, affiliation networks can be analyzed. For example we discuss the
proper definitions of weights, and propose a redefined weighted clustering
coefficient. Among other things, we find that the students enter the network at
the center and are gradually diffusing towards the periphery. On the other
hand, the ties to the classmates of the first semester (still present at the
university) will, on average, become stronger as time progresses.
