Information about primary transmitter location is crucial in enabling several
key capabilities in cognitive radio networks, including improved
spatio-temporal sensing, intelligent location-aware routing, as well as aiding
spectrum policy enforcement. Compared to other proposed non-interactive
localization algorithms, the weighted centroid localization (WCL) scheme uses
only the received signal strength information, which makes it simple to
implement and robust to variations in the propagation environment. In this
paper we present the first theoretical framework for WCL performance analysis
in terms of its localization error distribution parameterized by node density,
node placement, shadowing variance, correlation distance and inaccuracy of
sensor node positioning. Using this analysis, we quantify the robustness of WCL
to various physical conditions and provide design guidelines, such as node
placement and spacing, for the practical deployment of WCL. We also propose a
power-efficient method for implementing WCL through a distributed cluster-based
algorithm, that achieves comparable accuracy with its centralized counterpart.
