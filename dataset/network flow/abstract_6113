When real networks are considered, coupled networks with connectivity and
feedback-dependency links are not rare but more general. Here we develop a
mathematical framework and study numerically and analytically percolation of
interacting networks with feedback-dependency links. We find that when nodes of
between networks are lowly connected, the system undergoes from second order
transition through hybrid order transition to first order transition as
coupling strength increases. And, as average degree of each inter-network
increases, first order region becomes smaller and second-order region becomes
larger but hybrid order region almost keep constant. Especially, the results
implies that average degree \bar{k} between intra-networks has a little
influence on robustness of system for weak coupling strength, but for strong
coupling strength corresponding to first order transition system become robust
as \bar{k} increases. However, when average degree k of inter-network is
increased, the system become robust for all coupling strength. Additionally,
when nodes of between networks are highly connected, the hybrid order region
disappears and the system first order region becomes larger and secondorder
region becomes smaller. Moreover, we find that the existence of feedback
dependency links between interconnecting networks makes the system extremely
vulnerable by comparing non-feedback condition for the same parameters.
