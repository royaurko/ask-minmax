We present a general review about the N=1 supersymmetric SU(Nc) Yang-Mills on
the lattice focusing our attention on the quenched approximation in
supersymmetry. Finally we analyse and discuss the recent results obtained at
strong coupling and large Nc for the mesonic and fermionic propagators and
spectrum.
