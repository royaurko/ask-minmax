We suggest certain effects, caused by interaction between rotation and
gravitation with turbulence structure, for the cooling/heating of dispersed
phase of non-isothermal particles in rotating turbulent fluid flows. These
effects are obtained through the derivation of kinetic or probability density
function based macroscopic equations for the particles. In doing so, for
one-way temperature coupling, we also show that homogeneous, isotropic
non-isothermal fluid turbulence does not influence the mean temperature (though
it influences mean velocity) of the dispersed phase of particles settling due
to gravitational force in the isotropic turbulence.
