We study an important practical aspect of the route planning problem in
real-world road networks -- maneuvers. Informally, maneuvers represent various
irregularities of the road network graph such as turn-prohibitions, traffic
light delays, round-abouts, forbidden passages and so on. We propose a
generalized model which can handle arbitrarily complex (and even negative)
maneuvers, and outline how to enhance Dijkstra's algorithm in order to solve
route planning queries in this model without prior adjustments of the
underlying road network graph.
