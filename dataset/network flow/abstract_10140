We study the Yang-Mills flow on a holomorphic vector bundle E over a compact
Kahler manifold X. We construct a natural barrier function along the flow, and
introduce some techniques to study the blow-up of the curvature along the flow.
Making some technical assumptions, we show how our techniques can be used to
prove that the curvature of the evolved connection is uniformly bounded away
from an analytic subvariety determined by the Harder-Narasimhan-Seshadri
filtration of E. We also discuss how our assumptions are related to stability
in some simple cases.
