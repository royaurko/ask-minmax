We give a centralized deterministic algorithm for constructing linear network
error-correcting codes that attain the Singleton bound of network
error-correcting codes. The proposed algorithm is based on the algorithm by
Jaggi et al. We give estimates on the time complexity and the required symbol
size of the proposed algorithm. We also estimate the probability of a random
choice of local encoding vectors by all intermediate nodes giving a network
error-correcting codes attaining the Singleton bound. We also clarify the
relationship between the robust network coding and the network error-correcting
codes with known locations of errors.
