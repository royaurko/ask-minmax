We investigate the locality of interactions in hydrodynamic turbulence using
data from a direct numerical simulation on a grid of 1024^3 points; the flow is
forced with the Taylor-Green vortex. An inertial range for the energy is
obtained in which the flux is constant and the spectrum follows an approximate
Kolmogorov law. Nonlinear triadic interactions are dominated by their non-local
components, involving widely separated scales. The resulting nonlinear transfer
itself is local at each scale but the step in the energy cascade is independent
of that scale and directly related to the integral scale of the flow.
Interactions with large scales represent 20% of the total energy flux. Possible
explanations for the deviation from self-similar models, the link between these
findings and intermittency, and their consequences for modeling of turbulent
flows are briefly discussed.
