We study the instantaneous and local energy injection in a turbulent shear
flow driven by volume forces. The energy injection can be both positive and
negative. Extremal events are related to coherent streaks. The probability
distribution is asymmetric, deviates slightly from a Gaussian shape and depends
on the position in shear direction. The probabilities for positive and negative
injection are exponentially related, but the prefactor in the exponent varies
across the shear layer.
