We put forward an idea that the boundary entropy associated with integrable
massless flow of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) is identified with tachyon
action of boundary string field theory. We show that the temperature
parameterizing a massless flow in the TBA formalism can be identified with
tachyon energy for the classical action at least near the ultraviolet fixed
point, i.e. the open string vacuum.
