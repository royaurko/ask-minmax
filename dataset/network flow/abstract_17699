We construct a contact form on R^{2n+1}, n at least 2, equal to the standard
contact form outside a compact set and defining the standard contact structure
on all of R^{2n+1}, which has trapped Reeb orbits, including a torus invariant
under the Reeb flow, but no closed Reeb orbits. This answers a question posed
by Helmut Hofer.
