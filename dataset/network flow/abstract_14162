It is shown that the connection of sufficiently fast flows with dynamical
channels for particle escape in the Solar Corona is rather direct: it depends
on their ability to deform (in specific cases to distort) the ambient magnetic
field lines to temporarily stretch (shrink, destroy) the closed field lines so
that the flow can escape the local region. Using a dissipative two--fluid code
in which the flows are treated at par with the currents, we have demonstrated
channel creation in a variety of closed--field line structures. This
self--induced transparency constitutes the active mode for the formation of the
solar wind.
