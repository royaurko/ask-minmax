Many of the systems that are traditionally analyzed as complex networks have
natural interpretations as multiplex structures. While these formulations
retain more information than standard network models, there is not yet a fully
developed theory for computing network metrics and statistics on these objects.
As many of the structural representations associated to these models can
distort the underlying characteristics of dynamical process, we introduce an
algebraic method for modeling arbitrary dynamics on multiplex networks. Since
several network metrics are based on generalized notions of dynamical transfer,
we can use this framework to extend many of the standard network metrics to
multiplex structures in a consistent fashion.
