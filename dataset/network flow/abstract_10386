The macroscopic control of ubiquitous heat flow remains poorly explored due
to the lack of a fundamental theoretical method. Here, by establishing
nonlinear transformation thermotics for treating materials whose conductivity
depends on temperature, we show analytical and simulation evidence for
switchable thermal cloaking and a macro thermal diode based on the cloaking.
The latter allows heat flow in one direction but prohibits the flow in the
opposite direction. For future experimental demonstration, we also confirm the
cloaking and diode by using parameters of homogeneous isotropic materials
according to the design based on the effective medium theory. Our results
suggest that the nonlinear transformation thermotics could be a fundamental
theoretical method for achieving macro heat rectification, and provide guidance
both for arbitrary macroscopic control of heat flow and for the design of the
counterparts of switchable thermal cloaks and macro thermal diodes in other
fields like seismology, acoustics, electromagnetics, or matter waves.
