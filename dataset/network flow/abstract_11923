Chimera state is a relatively new emerging phenomenon observed in non-locally
coupled identical units. We report emergence of the chimera state in multiplex
network where individual layers are represented by 1-d lattice with non-local
interactions. While, multiplexing does not change the type of the chimera state
and retains the multi-chimera state displayed by the isolated networks, it
changes the regions of the incoherence. Following few earlier works on the
coupled dynamical evolution, we investigate dependence of emergence of the
chimera state on the control parameter of the multiplex system namely the
coupling strength and the initial conditions. We also derive the necessary
condition for the occurrence of chimera states in the multiplex network.
Observing chimera in a multiplexed network with one to one inter layer
connection is important in order to get a better understanding of many real
world systems which inherently posses multilayer framework.
