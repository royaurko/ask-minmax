We introduce a method of characterization of non-Markovianity using coherence
of a system interacting with the environment. We show that under the allowed
incoherent operations, monotonicity of a valid coherence measure is affected
due to non-Markovian features of the system-environment evolution. We also
define a measure to quantify non-Markovianity of the underlying dynamics based
on the non-monotonic behavior of the coherence measure. We investigate our
proposed non-Markovianity marker in the behavior of dephasing and dissipative
dynamics for one and two qubit cases. We also show that our proposed measure
captures the back-flow of information from the environment to the system and
compatible with well known distinguishability criteria of non-Markovianity.
