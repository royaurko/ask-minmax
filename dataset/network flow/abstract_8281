We study the frequency-synchronization of randomly coupled oscillators. By
analyzing the continuum limit, we obtain the sufficient condition for the
mean-field type synchronization. We especially find that the critical coupling
constant $K$ becomes 0 in the random scale free network,
 $P(k)\propto k^{-\gamma}$, if $2 < \gamma \le 3$. Numerical simulations in
finite networks are consistent with these analysis.
