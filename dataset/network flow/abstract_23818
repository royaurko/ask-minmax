This paper proposes a Markovian model of 1-persistent CSMA/CA protocols with
K-Exponential Backoff scheduling algorithms. The input buffer of each access
node is modeled as a Geo/G/1 queue, and the service time distribution of each
individual head-of-line packet is derived from the Markov chain of the
underlying scheduling algorithm. From the queuing model, we derive the
characteristic equation of network throughput and obtain the stable throughput
and bounded delay regions with respect to the retransmission factor. Our
results show that the stable throughput region of the exponential backoff
scheme exists even for an infinite population. Moreover, we find that the
bounded delay region of exponential backoff is only a sub-set of its stable
throughput region due to the large variance of the service time of input
packets caused by the capture effect. All analytical results presented in this
paper are verified by simulations.
