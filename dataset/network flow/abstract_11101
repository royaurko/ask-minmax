We address the problem of efficiently gathering correlated data from a wired
or a wireless sensor network, with the aim of designing algorithms with
provable optimality guarantees, and understanding how close we can get to the
known theoretical lower bounds. Our proposed approach is based on finding an
optimal or a near-optimal {\em compression tree} for a given sensor network: a
compression tree is a directed tree over the sensor network nodes such that the
value of a node is compressed using the value of its parent. We consider this
problem under different communication models, including the {\em broadcast
communication} model that enables many new opportunities for energy-efficient
data collection. We draw connections between the data collection problem and a
previously studied graph concept, called {\em weakly connected dominating
sets}, and we use this to develop novel approximation algorithms for the
problem. We present comparative results on several synthetic and real-world
datasets showing that our algorithms construct near-optimal compression trees
that yield a significant reduction in the data collection cost.
