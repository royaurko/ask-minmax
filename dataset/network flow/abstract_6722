A zero temperature quench of the Ising model is known to lead to a frozen
steady state on random and small world networks. We study such quenches on
random scale free networks (RSF) and compare the scenario with that in the
Barab\'{a}si-Albert network (BA) and the Watts Strogatz (WS) addition type
network. While frozen states are present in all the cases, the RSF shows an
order-disorder phase transition of mean field nature as in the WS model as well
as the existence of two absorbing phases separated by an active phase. The WS
network also shows an active-absorbing (A-A) phase transition occurring at the
known order-disorder transition point. The comparison of the RSF and the BA
network results show interesting difference in finite size dependence.
