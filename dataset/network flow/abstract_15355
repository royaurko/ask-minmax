In this paper, we present a new algorithm for reverse-engineering gene
interaction networks (GINs) from expression data, by viewing the expression
levels of various genes as coupled random variables. The algorithm is based on
using the so-called phi-mixing coefficient between two random variables as a
measure of the dependence between them. Unlike existing methods, the GINs
constructed using the algorithm presented here have edges that are both
directed and weighted. Thus it is possible to infer both the direction as well
as the strength of the interaction between genes. The GIN constructed is
potentially a minimal network that is compatible with the data. Several GINs
have been constructed for various data sets in lung and ovarian cancer. One of
the lung cancer networks is validated by comparing its predictions against the
output of ChIP-seq data. The neighbors of three transcription factors (ASCL1,
PPARG and NKX2-1) are significantly enriched with ChIP-seq genes compared to
pure chance.
