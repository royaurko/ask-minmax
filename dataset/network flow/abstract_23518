A molecular theory of the glass transition of network forming liquids is
developed using a combination of self-consistent phonon and liquid state
approaches. Both the dynamical transition and the entropy crisis characteristic
of random first order transitions are mapped out as a function of the degree of
bonding and the density. Using a scaling relation for a soft-core model to
crudely translate the densities into temperatures, the theory predicts that the
ratio of the dynamical transition temperature to the laboratory transition
temperature rises as the degree of bonding increases, while the Kauzmann
temperature falls relative to the laboratory transition. These results indicate
why highly coordinated liquids should be "strong" while van der Waals liquids
without coordination are "fragile".
