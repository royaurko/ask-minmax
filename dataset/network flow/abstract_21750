Accuracy of a relativistic weak-coupling expansion procedure for solving the
Hamiltonian bound-state eigenvalue problem in theories with asymptotic freedom
is measured using a well-known matrix model. The model is exactly soluble and
simple enough to study the method up to sixth order in the expansion. The
procedure is found in this case to match the precision of the best available
benchmark method of the altered Wegner flow equation, reaching the accuracy of
a few percent.
