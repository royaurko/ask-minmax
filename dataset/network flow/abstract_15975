In this work we present a computational study of the Kinetoplast genome,
modelled as a large number of semiflexible unknotted loops, which are allowed
to link with each other. As the DNA density increases, the systems shows a
percolation transition between a gas of unlinked rings and a network of linked
loops which spans the whole system. Close to the percolation transition, we
find that the mean valency of the network, i.e. the average number of loops
which are linked to any one loop, is around 3 as found experimentally for the
Kinetoplast DNA. Even more importantly, by simulating the digestion of the
network by a restriction enzyme, we show that the distribution of oligomers,
i.e. structures formed by a few loops which remain linked after digestion,
quantitatively matches experimental data obtained from gel electrophoresis,
provided that the density is, once again, close to the percolation transition.
With respect to previous work, our analysis builds on a reduced number of
assumptions, yet can still fully explain the experimental data. Our findings
suggest that the Kinetoplast DNA can be viewed as a network of linked loops
positioned very close to the percolation transition, and we discuss the
possible biological implications of this remarkable fact.
