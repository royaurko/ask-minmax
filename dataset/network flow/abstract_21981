We discuss the Boussinesq system with $t_5$ stationary, within a general
framework for the analysis of stationary flows of n-Gel'fand-Dickey
hierarchies. We show how a careful use of its bihamiltonian structure can be
used to provide a set of separation coordinates for the corresponding
Hamilton--Jacobi equations.
