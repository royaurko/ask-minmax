To analyze the activities in an Online Social network (OSN), we introduce the
concept of "Node of Attraction" (NoA) which represents the most active node in
a network community. This NoA is identified as the origin/initiator of a
post/communication which attracted other nodes and formed a cluster at any
point in time. In this research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a data
mining method where the main objective is to determine clusters of network
communities in a given OSN dataset. This approach is efficient in handling
different type of discussion topics in our studied OSN - comments, emails, chat
expressions, etc. and can form clusters according to one or more topics. We
believe that this work can be useful in finding the source for spread of this
GA-based clustering of online interactions and reports some results of
experiments with real-world data and demonstrates the performance of proposed
approach.
