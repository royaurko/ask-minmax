We perform an extensive numerical study of avalanche behavior in a 2D LJ
glass at T=0, sheared at finite strain rates $\dot\gamma$. From the finite size
analysis of stress fluctuations and of transverse diffusion we show that
flip-flip correlations remain relevant at all realistic strain rates. We
predict that the avalanche size scales as $\dot\gamma^{-1/d}$, with $d$ the
space dimension.
