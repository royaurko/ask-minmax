The classical problem of the fluid mechanics is the problem of a supersonic
motion around a thin body was generalized to the case of non-equilibrium gas.
The drag and lift force coefficients were founded. It is shown that the drag
and lift force coefficients in the acoustically active supersonic flow are both
decreased
