This work builds on and confirms the theoretical findings of Part 1 of this
paper, Moarref & Jovanovi\'c (2010). We use direct numerical simulations of the
Navier-Stokes equations to assess the efficacy of blowing and suction in the
form of streamwise traveling waves for controlling the onset of turbulence in a
channel flow. We highlight the effects of the modified base flow on the
dynamics of velocity fluctuations and net power balance. Our simulations verify
the theoretical predictions of Part 1 that the upstream traveling waves promote
turbulence even when the uncontrolled flow stays laminar. On the other hand,
the downstream traveling waves with parameters selected in Part 1 are capable
of reducing the fluctuations' kinetic energy, thereby maintaining the laminar
flow. In flows driven by a fixed pressure gradient, a positive net efficiency
as large as 25 % relative to the uncontrolled turbulent flow can be achieved
with downstream waves. Furthermore, we show that these waves can also
relaminarize fully developed turbulent flows at low Reynolds numbers. We
conclude that the theory developed in Part 1 for the linearized flow equations
with uncertainty has considerable ability to predict full-scale phenomena.
