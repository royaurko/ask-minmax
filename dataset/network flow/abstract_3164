Wireless multi-hop networks, in various forms and under various names, are
being increasingly used in military and civilian applications. Studying
connectivity and capacity of these networks is an important problem. The
scaling behavior of connectivity and capacity when the network becomes
sufficiently large is of particular interest. In this position paper, we
briefly overview recent development and discuss research challenges and
opportunities in the area, with a focus on the network connectivity.
