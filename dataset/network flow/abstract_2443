Multi-agent systems have been studied in various contexts of both application
and theory. We take Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), one of the formalisms
designed to reason about such systems, as the foundation of the language we
will build.
  BioAmbient calculus is an extension of \pi-calculus, developed largely for
applications to biomolecular systems. It deals with ambients and their ability
to communicate and to execute concurrent processes while moving.
  In this paper we combine the formalism of Dynamic Epistemic Logic together
with the formalism of BioAmbient Calculus in order to reason about knowledge
maintained and gained upon process transitions. The motivation lies in
developing a language that captures locally available information through
assignment of knowledge, with potential application to biological systems as
well as social, virtual, and others.
  We replace the ambients of BioAmbient Calculus with agents, to which we
attribute knowledge, and explore the parallels of this treatment. The resulting
logic describes the information flow governing mobile structured agents,
organized hierarchically, whose architecture (and local information) may change
due to actions such as communication, merging (of two agents), entering (of an
agent into the inner structure of another agent) and exiting (of an agent from
the structure of another). We show how the main axioms of DEL must be altered
to accommodate the informational effects of the agents' dynamic architecture.
