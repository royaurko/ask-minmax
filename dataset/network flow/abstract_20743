Graph analysis is a critical component of applications such as online social
networks, protein interactions in biological networks, and Internet traffic
analysis. The arrival of massive graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes,
e.g. social graphs, presents a unique challenge to graph analysis applications.
Most of these applications rely on computing distances between node pairs,
which for large graphs can take minutes to compute using traditional algorithms
such as breadth-first-search (BFS). In this paper, we study ways to enable
scalable graph processing on today's massive graphs. We explore the design
space of graph coordinate systems, a new approach that accurately approximates
node distances in constant time by embedding graphs into coordinate spaces. We
show that a hyperbolic embedding produces relatively low distortion error, and
propose Rigel, a hyperbolic graph coordinate system that lends itself to
efficient parallelization across a compute cluster. Rigel produces
significantly more accurate results than prior systems, and is naturally
parallelizable across compute clusters, allowing it to provide accurate results
for graphs up to 43 million nodes. Finally, we show that Rigel's functionality
can be easily extended to locate (near-) shortest paths between node pairs.
After a one- time preprocessing cost, Rigel answers node-distance queries in
10's of microseconds, and also produces shortest path results up to 18 times
faster than prior shortest-path systems with similar levels of accuracy.
