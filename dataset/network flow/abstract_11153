It is now feasible to host Web Services on a mobile device due to the
advances in cellular devices and mobile communication technologies. However,
the reliability, usability and responsiveness of the Mobile Hosts depend on
various factors including the characteristics of available network,
computational resources, and better means of searching the services provided by
them. P2P enhances the adoption of Mobile Host in commercial environments.
Mobile Hosts in P2P can collaboratively share the resources of individual
peers. P2P also enhances the service discovery of huge number of Web Services
possible with Mobile Hosts. Advanced features like post filtering with weight
of keywords and context-awareness can also be exploited to select the best
possible mobile Web Service. This paper proposes the concept of Mobile Hosts in
P2P networks and identifies the means of publishing and discovery of Web
Services in mobile P2P networks.
