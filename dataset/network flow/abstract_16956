An integrated software-based solution for a modular and self-independent
networked robot is introduced. The wirelessly operatable robot has been
developed mainly for autonomous monitoring works with full control over web.
The integrated software solution covers three components : a) the digital
signal processing unit for data retrieval and monitoring system; b) the
externally executable codes for control system; and c) the web programming for
interfacing the end-users with the robot. It is argued that this integrated
software-based approach is crucial to realize a flexible, modular and low
development cost mobile monitoring apparatus.
