We present in this note the existence and uniqueness results for the Stokes
and Navier-Stokes equations which model the laminar flow of an incompressible
fluid inside a two-dimensional channel of periodic sections. The data of the
pressure loss coefficient enables us to establish a relation on the pressure
and to thus formulate an equivalent problem.
