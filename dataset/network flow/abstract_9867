The linear stability of pipe flow implies that only perturbations of
sufficient strength will trigger the transition to turbulence. In order to
determine this threshold in perturbation amplitude we study the \emph{edge of
chaos} which separates perturbations that decay towards the laminar profile and
perturbations that trigger turbulence. Using the lifetime as an indicator and
methods developed in (Skufca et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 174101 (2006))
we show that superimposed on an overall $1/\Re$-scaling predicted and studied
previously there are small, non-monotonic variations reflecting folds in the
edge of chaos. By tracing the motion in the edge we find that it is formed by
the stable manifold of a unique flow field that is dominated by a pair of
downstream vortices, asymmetrically placed towards the wall. The flow field
that generates the edge of chaos shows intrinsic chaotic dynamics.
