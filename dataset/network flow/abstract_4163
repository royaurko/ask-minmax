We present a simple, short and elementary proof that if $v$ is a Beltrami
flow with a finite energy in $\mathbb R^3$ then $v=0$. In the case of the
Beltrami flows satisfying $v\in L^\infty _{loc} (\Bbb R^3) \cap L^q(\Bbb R^3)$
with $q\in [2, 3)$, or $|v(x)|=O(1/|x|^{1+\varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon
>0$, we provide a different, simple proof that $v=0$.
