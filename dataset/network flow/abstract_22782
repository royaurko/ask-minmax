Heavy inertial particles transported by a turbulent flow are shown to
concentrate in the regions where an advected passive scalar, such as
temperature, displays very strong front-like discontinuities. This novel effect
is responsible for extremely high levels of fluctuations for the passive field
sampled by the particles that impacts the heat fluxes exchanged between the
particles and the surrounding fluid. Instantaneous and averaged heat fluxes are
shown to follow strongly intermittent statistics and anomalous scaling laws.
