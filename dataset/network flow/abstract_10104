One of the highlight of this note is that the contributor presents the
relativistic gravity field that Einstein was looking for. The field is a
byproduct of the matter in motion. This field can include both the discrete and
continuous components. In free space the waves produced in this field propagate
with velocity of light.
  Another highlight is the proof of amended Feynman's formulas for
electromagnetic potentials. This makes the formulas mathematically complete and
precise.
  The main result can be stated as follows. In a fixed Lorentzian frame given
is a trajectory $r_2(t,r_0)$ of flow of matter. The parameter $r_0$ changes in
a compact set $F$ representing the position of the matter at some initial time
$t_0.$ The flow must satisfy certain conditions of regularity.
  Given any signed measure $q(Q)$ of finite variation defined on Borel subsets
of $F,$ representing total charge contained in the set $Q\subset F,$ such a
flow determines the scalar $\phi$ and the vector $A$ potentials for a pair
$(E,B)$ of fields satisfying Maxwell's equations and as a byproduct the field
$\varrho,$ representing density of charges, and the field $j,$ representing the
density of currents. All these fields are represented in terms of generalized
functions.
