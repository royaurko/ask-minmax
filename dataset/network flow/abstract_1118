A change of solute dispersion regime with the flow velocity has been studied
both at the macroscopic and pore scales in a transparent array of capillary
channels using an optical technique allowing for simultaneous local and global
concentration mappings. Two solutions of different polymer concentrations (500
and 1000 ppm) have been used at different P\'eclet numbers. At the macroscopic
scale, the displacement front displays a diffusive spreading: for $Pe \leq 10$,
the dispersivity $l\_d$ is constant with $Pe$ and increases with the polymer
concentration; for $Pe > 10$, $l\_d$ increases as $Pe^{1.35}$ and is similar
for the two concentrations. At the local scale, a time lag between the
saturations of channels parallel and perpendicular to the mean flow has been
observed and studied as a function of the flow rate. These local measurements
suggest that the change of dispersion regime is related to variations of the
degree of mixing at the junctions. For $Pe \leq 10$, complete mixing leads to
pure geometrical dispersion enhanced for shear thinning fluids; for $Pe >10$
weaker mixing results in higher correlation lengths along flow paths parallel
to the mean flow and in a combination of geometrical and Taylor dispersion.
