We report a new kind of particle clustering caused purely by gravity,
discovered in our simulation of particle-laden turbulence. Clustering in a
vertical strip pattern forms when strong gravity acts on heavy particles. This
phenomenon is explained by the skewness of the flow velocity gradient in the
gravitational direction experienced by particles, which causes horizontal
convergence of particles.
