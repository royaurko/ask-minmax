Robust diffusion algorithms based on the maximum correntropy criterion(MCC)
are developed to address the distributed networks estimation issue in
impulsive(long-tailed) noise environments. The cost functions used in
distributed network estimation are in general based on the mean square error
(MSE) criterion, which is optimal only when the measurement noise is Gaussian.
In non-Gaussian situations, such as the impulsive-noise case, MCC based method
may achieve a much better performance than the MSE methods since it takes into
account higher order statistics of error distribution. The proposed methods can
also outperform the robust diffusion least mean p-power(DLMP) and diffusion
minimum error entropy (DMEE) algorithms.
