Randomized network coding (RNC) greatly reduces the complexity of
implementing network coding in large-scale, heterogeneous networks. This paper
examines two tradeoffs in applying RNC: The first studies how the performance
of RNC varies with a node's randomizing capabilities. Specifically, a limited
randomized network coding (L-RNC) scheme - in which intermediate nodes perform
randomized encoding based on only a limited number of random coefficients - is
proposed and its performance bounds are analyzed. Such a L-RNC approach is
applicable to networks in which nodes have either limited computation/storage
capacity or have ambiguity about downstream edge connectivity (e.g., as in ad
hoc sensor networks). A second tradeoff studied here examines the relationship
between the reliability and the capacity gains of generalized RNC, i.e., how
the outage probability of RNC relates to the transmission rate at the source
node. This tradeoff reveals that significant reductions in outage probability
are possible when the source transmits deliberately and only slightly below
network capacity. This approach provides an effective means to improve the
feasibility probability of RNC when the size of the finite field is fixed.
