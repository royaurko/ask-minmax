Using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in a new experimental plane Couette
flow, we investigate the dynamics of turbulent patches invading formerly
laminar flows. We evidence experimentally for the first time in this geometry
the existence of large scale flows. These flows appear as soon as laminar and
turbulent domains coexist. Spectral analysis is used to study the dynamical
evolution of these large scales as well as that of the small scales associated
with turbulence. We show that large-scale flows grow before turbulent spots
develop and we point out the crucial role they play in the growth mechanism and
possibly also in the emergence of organised patterns.
