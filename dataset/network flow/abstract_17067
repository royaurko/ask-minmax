Urban environments are brimming with information sources, yet these are
typically disconnected from related information on the Web. Addressing this
disconnect requires an infrastructure able to disseminate information to a
specific micro-location, to be consumed by interested parties. This paper
proposes Aladdin, an infrastructure for highly localised broadcast of Linked
Data via radio waves. When combined with data retrieved from the Web, Aladdin
can enable a new generation of micro-location-aware mobile applications and
services.
