We study the kinematics of timelike geodesic congruences in two and four
dimensions in spacetime geometries representing stringy black holes. The
Raychaudhuri equations for the kinematical quantities (namely, expansion, shear
and rotation) characterising such geodesic flows are written down and
subsequently solved analytically (in two dimensions) and numerically (in four
dimensions) for specific geodesics flows. We compare between geodesic flows in
dual (electric and magnetic) stringy black hole backgrounds in four dimensions,
by showing the differences that arise in the corresponding evolutions of the
kinematic variables. The crucial role of initial conditions and the spacetime
curvature on the evolution of the kinematical variables is illustrated. Some
novel general conclusions on geodesic focusing are obtained from the analytical
and numerical findings. We also propose new quantifiers in terms of (a) the
time (affine parameter) of approach to a singularity and (b) the location of
extrema in the functional evolution of the kinematic variables, which may be
used to distinguish between flows in different geometries. In summary, our
quantitative findings bring out hitherto unknown features of the kinematics of
geodesic flows, which, otherwise, would have remained overlooked, if we
confined ourselves to only a qualitative analysis.
