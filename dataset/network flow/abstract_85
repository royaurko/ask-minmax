In this paper, we investigate the non-signalized intersection issue
considering traffic flow and energy dissipation in terms of game theory based
on the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model. There are two types of driver agents
at the intersection when vehicles on the two streets are approaching to it
simultaneously: C agents (cooperative strategy) pulling up to avoid collision
and D agents (defective strategy) crossing the intersection audaciously. Phase
diagram of the system, which describes free-flow phase, segregation phase,
jammed phase and maximum current curve representing the social maximum payoff,
is presented. Dilemma game is observed at the phase-segregated state except for
the case of $v_{\max }=1.$
