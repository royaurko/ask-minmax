Within a case study on the protein-protein interaction network (PIN) of
Drosophila melanogaster we investigate the relation between the network's
spectral properties and its structural features such as the prevalence of
specific subgraphs or duplicate nodes as a result of its evolutionary history.
The discrete part of the spectral density shows fingerprints of the PIN's
topological features including a preference for loop structures. Duplicate
nodes are another prominent feature of PINs and we discuss their representation
in the PIN's spectrum as well as their biological implications.
