This paper describes a work in progress implementing a solution for
harvesting and transporting information logs from network devices in a
e-science environment. The system is composed for servers, agents, active
devices and a transporting protocol. This document describes the state of
development of agents. Agents capture logs from devices, normalize, reduce and
cataloged them by using metadata. Once all these processes are done, they
transmit the cataloged data by using Transportation Protocol to a warehouse
server. Also an agent use orchestration parameters to transmit modified logs to
a data warehouse server. These parameters can be received from orchestration
applications such as Taverna. The operation of the agents and the communication
protocol solve some of the deficiencies of traditional logs management
protocols. Finally, we show some test realized over the new prototype.
