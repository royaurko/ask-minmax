By exploiting the mathematical analogy between the propagation of sound in a
non-homogeneous potential flow and the propagation of a scalar field in a
background gravitational field, various wave ``energy'' and wave ``momentum''
conservation laws are established in a systematic manner. In particular the
acoustic energy conservation law due to Blokhintsev appears as the result of
the conservation of a mixed co- and contravariant energy-momentum tensor, while
the exchange of relative energy between the wave and the mean flow mediated by
the radiation stress tensor, first noted by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart in the
context of ocean waves, appears as the covariant conservation of the doubly
contravariant form of the same energy-momentum tensor.
