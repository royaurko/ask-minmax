This paper shows determining the secrecy capacity of a unicast network with
uniform wiretap sets is at least as difficult as the k-unicast problem. In
particular, we show that a general k-unicast problem can be reduced to the
problem of finding the secrecy capacity of a corresponding single unicast
network with uniform link capacities and one arbitrary wiretap link.
