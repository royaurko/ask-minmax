In this paper, we show how Web technologies can be used effectively to (i)
address some of the deficiencies of traditional IP network management
platforms, and (ii) render these expensive platforms redundant. We build on the
concept of embedded management application, proposed by Wellens and Auerbach,
and present two models of network management application designs that rely on
Web technologies. First, the pull model is based on the request/response
paradigm. It is typically used to perform data polling. Several commercial
management platforms already use Web technologies that rely on this model to
provide for ad hoc management; we demonstrate how to extend this to regular
management. Second, the push model is a novel approach which relies on the
publish/subscribe/distribute paradigm. It is better suited to regular
management than the pull model, and allows administrators to conserve network
bandwidth as well as CPU time on the management station. It can be seen as a
generalization of the paradigm commonly used for notification delivery.
Finally, we introduce the concept of the collapsed network management platform,
where these two models coexist.
