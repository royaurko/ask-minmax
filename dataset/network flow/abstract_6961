Shear banding is an important feature of flow in complex fluids. Essentially,
shear bands refer to the coexistence of flowing and non-flowing regions in
driven material. Understanding the possible sources of shear banding has
important implications for a wide range of flow applications. In this regard,
quasi-two dimensional flow offers a unique opportunity to study competing
factors that result in shear bands. One proposal is the competition between
intrinsic dissipation and an external source of dissipation. In this paper, we
report on the experimental observation of the transition between different
classes of shear-bands that have been predicted to exist in cylindrical
geometry as the result of this competition [R. J. Clancy, E. Janiaud, D.
Weaire, and S. Hutzlet, Eur. J. Phys. E, {\bf 21}, 123 (2006)].
