The DEPAS (Decentralized Probabilistic Auto-Scaling) algorithm assumes an
overlay network of computing nodes where each node probabilistically decides to
shut down, allocate one or more other nodes or do nothing. DEPAS was
formulated, tested, and theoretically analyzed for the simplified case of
homogenous systems. In this paper, we extend DEPAS to heterogeneous systems.
