We study boundary induced phase transitions in a driven lattice gas
exhibiting metastability. The phase diagram for open systems, parameterized by
the input and output rates, consists of two regions corresponding to the free
flow and jammed phase. Both have been entirely characterized. The microscopic
states in the high density phase are shown to have an interesting striped
structure, which survives in the thermodynamic limit.
