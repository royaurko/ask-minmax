Characterization of pluripotent states, in which cells can both self-renew
and differentiate, and the irreversible loss of pluripotency are important
research areas in developmental biology. In particular, an understanding of
these processes is essential to the reprogramming of cells for biomedical
applications, i.e., the experimental recovery of pluripotency in differentiated
cells. Based on recent advances in dynamical-systems theory for gene
expression, we propose a gene-regulatory-network model consisting of several
pluripotent and differentiation genes. Our results show that cellular-state
transition to differentiated cell types occurs as the number of cells
increases, beginning with the pluripotent state and oscillatory expression of
pluripotent genes. Cell-cell signaling mediates the differentiation process
with robustness to noise, while epigenetic modifications affecting gene
expression dynamics fix the cellular state. These modifications ensure the
cellular state to be protected against external perturbation, but they also
work as an epigenetic barrier to recovery of pluripotency. We show that
overexpression of several genes leads to the reprogramming of cells, consistent
with the methods for establishing induced pluripotent stem cells. Our model,
which involves the inter-relationship between gene expression dynamics and
epigenetic modifications, improves our basic understanding of cell
differentiation and reprogramming.
