The one-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are used to derive analytical
expressions for the relation between pressure and volumetric flow rate in
capillaries of five different converging-diverging axisymmetric geometries for
Newtonian fluids. The results are compared to previously-derived expressions
for the same geometries using the lubrication approximation. The results of the
one-dimensional Navier-Stokes are identical to those obtained from the
lubrication approximation within a non-dimensional numerical factor. The
derived flow expressions have also been validated by comparison to numerical
solutions obtained from discretization with numerical integration. Moreover,
they have been certified by testing the convergence of solutions as the
converging-diverging geometries approach the limiting straight geometry.
