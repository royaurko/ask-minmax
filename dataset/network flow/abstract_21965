We develop a formalism for the calculation of the flow of angular momentum
carried by the fluctuating electromagnetic field within a cavity bounded by two
flat anisotropic materials. By generalizing a procedure employed recently for
the calculation of the Casimir force between arbitrary materials, we obtain an
expression for the torque between anisotropic plates in terms of their
reflection amplitude matrices. We evaluate the torque in 1D for ideal and
realistic model materials.
