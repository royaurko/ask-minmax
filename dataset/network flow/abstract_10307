In this work we investigate, by means of direct numerical simulations, how
rotation affects the bi-dimensionalization of a turbulent flow. We study a thin
layer of fluid, forced by a two-dimensional forcing, within the framework of
the "split cascade" in which the injected energy flows both to small scales
(generating the direct cascade) and to large scale (to form the inverse
cascade). It is shown that rotation reinforces the inverse cascade at the
expense of the direct one, thus promoting bi-dimensionalization of the flow.
This is achieved by a suppression of the enstrophy production at large scales.
Nonetheless, we find that, in the range of rotation rates investigated,
increasing the the vertical scale causes a reduction of the flux of the inverse
cascade. Our results suggest that, even in rotating flows, the inverse cascade
may eventually disappear when the vertical scale is sufficiently large with
respect to the forcing scale.
