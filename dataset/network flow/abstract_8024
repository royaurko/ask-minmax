We consider the evolution by mean curvature flow of a closed submanifold of
the complex projective space. We show that, if the submanifold has small
codimension and it satisfies a suitable pinching condition on the second
fundamental form, then the evolution has two possible behaviours: either the
submanifold shrinks to a round point in finite time, or it converges smoothly
to a totally geodesic limit in infinite time. The latter behaviour is only
possible if the dimension is even. These results generalize previous works by
Huisken and Baker on the mean curvature flow of submanifolds of the sphere.
