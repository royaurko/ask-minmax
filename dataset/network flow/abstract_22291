Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) devices separate micrometer-scale
particles in solution based on their size using a laminar microfluidic flow in
an array of obstacles. We investigate array geometries with rational row-shift
fractions in DLD devices by use of a simple model including both advection and
diffusion. Our model predicts novel multi-directional sorting modes that could
be experimentally tested in high-throughput DLD devices containing obstacles
that are much smaller than the separation between obstacles.
