A peer-to-peer network, enabling different parties to jointly store and run
computations on data while keeping the data completely private. Enigma's
computational model is based on a highly optimized version of secure
multi-party computation, guaranteed by a verifiable secret-sharing scheme. For
storage, we use a modified distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared
data. An external blockchain is utilized as the controller of the network,
manages access control, identities and serves as a tamper-proof log of events.
Security deposits and fees incentivize operation, correctness and fairness of
the system. Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma removes the need for a trusted third
party, enabling autonomous control of personal data. For the first time, users
are able to share their data with cryptographic guarantees regarding their
privacy.
