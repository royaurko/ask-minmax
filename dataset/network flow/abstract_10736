Recently Shukurov et al [Phys Rev \textbf{E} (2008)] presented a numerical
solution of a Moebius strip dynamo flow, to investigate its use in modelling
dynamo flows in Perm torus of liquid sodium dynamo experiments. Here, by
analogy one presents an electric dynamo on a twisted torus or Klein bottle
topology. An exact solution in the form of flat Klein bottle dynamo flow is
obtained. It is shown that even in the absence of magnetic dynamos initial
electric fields can be amplified in distinct points of the Klein bottle. In
this case diffusion is taken as ${\eta}\approx{5.0{\times}10^{-3}{\Omega}-m}$
the electric potential is obtained. The difference of electric fields at the
beginning of plasma flow profile is ${\Delta}E_{Dyn}\approx{468\frac{V}{m}}$,
which is stronger than the electric dynamo field obtained in the magnetic axis
of spheromaks, which is of the order of $E_{Dyn}\approx{200\frac{V}{m}}$. The
potential of the dynamo at the surface of the Earth computed by Boozer [Phys
Fluids \textbf{B} (1993)] of ${\Phi}\approx{160V}$, is used to obtain the
magnetic vector constant $A_{0}\approx{10^{6}V}$. In general the associated
magnetic dynamo is shown to be a fast dynamo in force-free plasmas in Klein
bottle. Of course if the magnetic dynamo growth is turned on the electric
dynamo shall be able to sustain itself along the Klein bottle.
