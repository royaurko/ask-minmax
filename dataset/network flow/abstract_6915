We confront a recent visco-plastic description of dense granular flows [P.
Jop et al, Nature, {\bf 441} (2006) 727] with multi-directional inhomogeneous
steady flows observed in non-smooth contact dynamics simulations of 2D
half-filled rotating drums. Special attention is paid to check separately the
two underlying fundamental statements into which the considered theory can be
recast, namely (i) a single relation between the invariants of stress and
strain rate tensors and (ii) the alignment between these tensors.
Interestingly, the first prediction is fairly well verified over more than four
decades of small strain rate, from the surface rapid flow to the quasi-static
creep phase, where it is usually believed to fail because of jamming. On the
other hand, the alignment between stress and strain rate tensors is shown to
fail over the whole flow, what yields an apparent violation of the
visco-plastic rheology when applied without care. In the quasi-static phase,
the particularly large misalignment is conjectured to be related to transient
dilatancy effects.
