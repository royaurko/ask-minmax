This paper deals with the problem of stabilizing an unstable system through
networked control over the wireless medium. In such a situation a remote sensor
communicates the measurements to the system controller through a noisy channel.
In particular, in the AWGN scenario, we show that protograph-based LDPC
convolutional codes achieve anytime reliability and we also derive a lower
bound to the signal-to-noise ratio required to stabilize the system. Moreover,
on the Rayleigh-fading channel, we show by simulations that resorting to
multiple sensors allows to achieve a diversity gain.
