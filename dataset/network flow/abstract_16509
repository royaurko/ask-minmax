We show that it is possible to evolve a network of global strings numerically
including the effects of radiative backreaction, using the renormalised
equations for the Kalb-Ramond action. We calculate radiative corrections to the
equations of motion and deduce the effect on a network of global strings. We
also discuss the implications of this work for the cosmological axion density.
