Many complicated network problems can be easily understood on small networks.
Difficulties arise when small networks are combined into larger ones.
Fortunately, the mathematical theory of sheaves was constructed to address just
this kind of situation; it extends locally-defined structures to globally valid
inferences by way of consistency relations. This paper exhibits examples in
network monitoring and filter hardware where sheaves have useful descriptive
power.
