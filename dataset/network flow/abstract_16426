The origin of earthquake has long been recognized as resulting from
strike-slip instability of plate tectonics along the fault lines. Several
events of earthquake around the globe have happened which cannot be explained
by this theory. In this work we investigated the earthquake data along with
other observed facts like heat flow profiles etc... of the Indian subcontinent.
In our studies we found a high-quality correlation between the earthquake
events, seismic prone zones, heat flow regions and the geothermal hot springs.
As a consequence, we proposed a hypothesis which can adequately explain all the
earthquake events around the globe as well as the overall geo-dynamics. It is
basically the geothermal power, which makes the plates to stand still, strike
and slip over. The plates are merely a working solid while the driving force is
the geothermal energy. The violent flow and enormous pressure of this power
shake the earth along the plate boundaries and also triggers the intra-plate
seismicity. In the light of the results reported by the California Energy
Commission from the ongoing geothermal power project at the Big Geysers in
California, we further propounded that by harnessing the surplus geothermal
energy the intensity and risk of the impending earthquakes can be substantially
reduced.
