The Heidelberg-Moscow Experiment is presently the most sensitive experiment
looking for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Recently the already very low
background has been lowered by means of a Digital Pulseshape Analysis using a
one parameter cut to distinguish between pointlike events and multiple
scattered events. To use all the information contained in a recorded digital
pulse, we developed a new technique for event recognition based on neural
networks.
