An thorough introduction is given at an introductory level to the field of
quantitative complex system science, with special emphasis on emergence in
dynamical systems based on network topologies. Subjects treated include graph
theory and small-world networks, a generic introduction to the concepts of
dynamical system theory, random Boolean networks, cellular automata and
self-organized criticality, the statistical modeling of Darwinian evolution,
synchronization phenomena and an introduction to the theory of cognitive
systems.
  It inludes chapter on Graph Theory and Small-World Networks, Chaos,
Bifurcations and Diffusion, Complexity and Information Theory, Random Boolean
Networks, Cellular Automata and Self-Organized Criticality, Darwinian
evolution, Hypercycles and Game Theory, Synchronization Phenomena and Elements
of Cognitive System Theory.
