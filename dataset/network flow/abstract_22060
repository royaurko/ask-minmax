The nonaxisymmetric Ekman flow excited inside a neutron star following a
rotational glitch is calculated analytically including stratification and
compressibility. For the largest glitches, the gravitational wave strain
produced by the hydrodynamic mass quadrupole moment approaches the sensitivity
range of advanced long-baseline interferometers. It is shown that the
viscosity, compressibility, and orientation of the star can be inferred in
principle from the width and amplitude ratios of the Fourier peaks (at the spin
frequency and its first harmonic) observed in the gravitational wave spectrum
in the plus and cross polarizations. These transport coefficients constrain the
equation of state of bulk nuclear matter, because they depend sensitively on
the degree of superfluidity.
