We study the deterministic dynamics of networks N composed by m non
identical, mutually pulse-coupled cells. We assume weighted, asymmetric and
positive (cooperative) interactions among the cells, and arbitrarily large
values of m. We consider two cases of the network's graph: the complete graph,
and the existence of a large core (i.e. a large complete subgraph). First, we
prove that the system periodically eventually synchronizes with a natural
"spiking period" \ p >=1, and that if the cells are mutually structurally
identical or similar, then the synchronization is complete (p= 1) . Second, we
prove that the amount of information H that N generates or processes equals log
p. Therefore, if N completely synchronizes, the information is null. Finally,
we prove that N protects the cells from their risk of death.
