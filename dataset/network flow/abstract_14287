We extend our earlier shear-transformation-zone (STZ) theory of amorphous
plasticity to include the effects of thermally assisted molecular
rearrangements. This version of our theory is a substantial revision and
generalization of conventional theories of flow in noncrystalline solids. As in
our earlier work, it predicts a dynamic transition between jammed and flowing
states at a yield stress. Below that yield stress, it now describes thermally
assisted creep. We show that this theory accounts for the experimentally
observed strain-rate dependence of the viscosity of metallic glasses, and that
it also captures many of the details of the transient stress-strain behavior of
those materials during loading. In particular, it explains the apparent onset
of superplasticity at sufficiently high stress as a transition between creep at
low stresses and plastic flow near the yield stress. We also argue that there
are internal inconsistencies in the conventional theories of these deformation
processes, and suggest ways in which further experimentation as well as
theoretical analysis may lead to better understanding of a broad range of
nonequilibrium phenomena.
