This volume contains the proceedings of the (first) Graphs as Models (GaM)
2015 workshop, held on 10-11 April 2015 in London, U.K., as a satellite
workshop of ETAPS 2015, the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice
of Software. This new workshop combines the strengths of two pre-existing
workshop series: GT-VMT (Graph Transformation and Visual Modelling Techniques)
and GRAPHITE (Graph Inspection and Traversal Engineering).
  Graphs are used as models in all areas of computer science: examples are
state space graphs, control flow graphs, syntax graphs, UML-type models of all
kinds, network layouts, social networks, dependency graphs, and so forth. Used
to model a particular phenomenon or process, graphs are then typically analysed
to find out properties of the modelled subject, or transformed to construct
other types of models.
  The workshop aimed at attracting and stimulating research on the techniques
for graph analysis, inspection and transformation, on a general level rather
than in any specific domain. In total, we received 15 submissions covering
several different areas. Of these 15 submissions, nine were eventually accepted
and appear in this volume.
