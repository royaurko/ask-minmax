One of the main issues in modern network science is the phenomenon of
cascading failures of a small number of attacks. Here we define the dimension
of a network to be the maximal number of functions or features of nodes of the
network. It was shown that there exist linear networks which are provably
secure, where a network is linear, if it has dimension one, that the high
dimensions of networks are the mechanisms of overlapping communities, that
overlapping communities are obstacles for network security, and that there
exists an algorithm to reduce high dimensional networks to low dimensional ones
which simultaneously preserves all the network properties and significantly
amplifies security of networks. Our results explore that dimension is a
fundamental measure of networks, that there exist linear networks which are
provably secure, that high dimensional networks are insecure, and that security
of networks can be amplified by reducing dimensions.
