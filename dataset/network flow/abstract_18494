The full dynamics of a synchronous recurrent neural network model with Ising
binary units and a Hebbian learning rule with a finite self-interaction is
studied in order to determine the stability to synaptic and stochastic noise of
frozen-in states that appear in the absence of both kinds of noise. Both, the
numerical simulation procedure of Eissfeller and Opper and a new alternative
procedure that allows to follow the dynamics over larger time scales have been
used in this work. It is shown that synaptic noise destabilizes the frozen-in
states and yields either retrieval or paramagnetic states for not too large
stochastic noise. The indications are that the same results may follow in the
absence of synaptic noise, for low stochastic noise.
