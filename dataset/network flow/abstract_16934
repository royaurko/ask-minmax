In this paper we deal with a semilinear hyperbolic chemotaxis model in one
space dimension evolving on a network, with suitable transmission conditions at
nodes. This framework is motivated by tissue-engineering scaffolds used for
improving wound healing. We introduce a numerical scheme, which guarantees
global mass densities conservation. Moreover our scheme is able to yield a
correct approximation of the effects of the source term at equilibrium. Several
numerical tests are presented to show the behavior of solutions and to discuss
the stability and the accuracy of our approximation.
