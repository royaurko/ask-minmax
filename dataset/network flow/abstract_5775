We propose a protocol that, given a communication network, computes a
subnetwork such that, for every pair $(u,v)$ of nodes connected in the original
network, there is a minimum-energy path between $u$ and $v$ in the subnetwork
(where a minimum-energy path is one that allows messages to be transmitted with
a minimum use of energy). The network computed by our protocol is in general a
subnetwork of the one computed by the protocol given in [13]. Moreover, our
protocol is computationally simpler. We demonstrate the performance
improvements obtained by using the subnetwork computed by our protocol through
simulation.
