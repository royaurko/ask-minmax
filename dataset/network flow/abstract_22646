We develop differential calculus of $C^{r,s}$-mappings on products of locally
convex spaces and prove exponential laws for such mappings. As an application,
we consider differential equations in Banach spaces depending on a parameter in
a locally convex space. Under suitable assumptions, the associated flows are
mappings of class $C^{r,s}$.
