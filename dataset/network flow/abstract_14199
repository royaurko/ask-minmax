Cold molecular gas has recently been found is several cooling flow clusters
cores with single dish telescopes. High spatial resolution imaging of some of
these clusters then revealed the peculiar morphology and dynamics of the CO
emission lines, pointing out a perturbed very cold component in the cluster
centers. We report here the observations of NGC 1275, in the Perseus cluster of
galaxies. This object is the strongest cooling flow emitter in the millimeter.
The 9 dual polarization pixels of the HERA focal plane array, installed on the
30m telescope, enabled to image the large scale emission of the cold molecular
gas which is found to follow the very peculiar Halpha filamentary structure
around the central galaxy. We discuss here this association and the
non-rotating dynamics of the cold gas that argue for a cooling flow origin of
the molecular component.
