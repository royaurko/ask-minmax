In this paper, a framework for the analysis of the
transmission-computation-energy tradeoff in wireless and fixed networks is
introduced. The analysis of this tradeoff considers both the transmission
energy as well as the energy consumed at the receiver to process the received
signal. While previous work considers linear decoder complexity, which is only
achieved by uncoded transmission, this paper claims that the average processing
(or computation) energy per symbol depends exponentially on the information
rate of the source message. The introduced framework is parametrized in a way
that it reflects properties of fixed and wireless networks alike.
  The analysis of this paper shows that exponential complexity and therefore
stronger codes are preferable at low data rates while linear complexity and
therefore uncoded transmission becomes preferable at high data rates. The more
the computation energy is emphasized (such as in fixed networks), the less hops
are optimal and the lower is the benefit of multi-hopping. On the other hand,
the higher the information rate of the single-hop network, the higher the
benefits of multi-hopping. Both conclusions are underlined by analytical
results.
