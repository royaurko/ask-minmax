We analyse the exponential stability properties of a class of measure-valued
equations arising in nonlinear multi-target filtering problems. We also prove
the uniform convergence properties w.r.t. the time parameter of a rather
general class of stochastic filtering algorithms, including sequential Monte
Carlo type models and mean eld particle interpretation models. We illustrate
these results in the context of the Bernoulli and the Probability Hypothesis
Density filter, yielding what seems to be the first results of this kind in
this subject.
