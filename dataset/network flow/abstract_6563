Distributed adaptive filtering has been considered as an effective approach
for data processing and estimation over distributed networks. Most existing
distributed adaptive filtering algorithms focus on designing different
information diffusion rules, regardless of the nature evolutionary
characteristic of a distributed network. In this paper, we study the adaptive
network from the game theoretic perspective and formulate the distributed
adaptive filtering problem as a graphical evolutionary game. With the proposed
formulation, the nodes in the network are regarded as players and the local
combiner of estimation information from different neighbors is regarded as
different strategies selection. We show that this graphical evolutionary game
framework is very general and can unify the existing adaptive network
algorithms. Based on this framework, as examples, we further propose two
error-aware adaptive filtering algorithms. Moreover, we use graphical
evolutionary game theory to analyze the information diffusion process over the
adaptive networks and evolutionarily stable strategy of the system. Finally,
simulation results are shown to verify the effectiveness of our analysis and
proposed methods.
