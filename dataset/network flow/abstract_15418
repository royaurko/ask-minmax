We consider the dynamics of a smart grid system characterized by widespread
distributed generation and storage devices. We assume that agents are free to
trade electric energy over the network and we focus on the emerging market
dynamics. We consider three different models for the market dynamics for which
we present a stability analysis. We see that stability depends on the specific
form of the market dynamics and it may depend on the structure of the
underlying network topology. We run numerical simulations that confirm our
theoretical predictions. As an example, we test our model for the market
dynamics over a real network topology, namely, the Tramway 11 Feeder from New
Mexico's power network.
