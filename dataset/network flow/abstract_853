The behavior of a Josephson flux-flow oscillator in the presence of both bias
current and magnetic field fluctuations has been studied. To derive the
equation for slow phase dynamics in the limit of small noise intensity the
Poincare method has been used. Both the form of spectral line and the linewidth
of the flux-flow oscillator have been derived exactly on the basis of technique
presented in the book of Malakhov, known limiting cases are considered, limits
of their applicability are discussed and appearance of excess noise is
explained. Good coincidence of theoretical description with experimental
results has been demonstrated.
