The parton recombination model has turned out to be a valuable tool to
describe hadronization in high energy heavy ion collisions. I review the model
and revisit recent progress in our understanding of hadron correlations. I also
discuss higher Fock states in the hadrons, possible violations of the elliptic
flow scaling and recombination effects in more dilute systems.
