We reveal that Hopf solitons can be stabilized in rotating atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate. The Hopfion is a matter-wave vortex complex which
carries two independent winding numbers. Such a topological solitonic structure
results from a superfluid flow of atoms simultaneously quantized in poloidal
and toroidal directions. In the framework of a dissipative mean-field model we
observe different unstable evolution scenarios of the Hopfions. We demonstrate
energetic and dynamical stability of the Hopf solitons under experimentally
feasible conditions.
