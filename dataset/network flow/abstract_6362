A spin network is a cubic ribbon graph labeled by representations of
$\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Spin networks are important in various areas of Mathematics
(3-dimensional Quantum Topology), Physics (Angular Momentum, Classical and
Quantum Gravity) and Chemistry (Atomic Spectroscopy). The evaluation of a spin
network is an integer number. The main results of our paper are: (a) an
existence theorem for the asymptotics of evaluations of arbitrary spin networks
(using the theory of $G$-functions), (b) a rationality property of the
generating series of all evaluations with a fixed underlying graph (using the
combinatorics of the chromatic evaluation of a spin network), (c) rigorous
effective computations of our results for some $6j$-symbols using the
Wilf-Zeilberger theory, and (d) a complete analysis of the regular Cube $12j$
spin network (including a non-rigorous guess of its Stokes constants), in the
appendix.
