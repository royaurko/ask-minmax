In the following we study the qualitative properties of solutions to the
geodesic flow induced by a higher order two-component Camassa-Holm system. In
particular, criteria to ensure the existence of temporally global solutions are
presented. Moreover in the metric case, and for inertia operators of order
higher than three, the flow is shown to be geodesically complete.
