The nonlinear flow behaviour of a viscoelastic gel formed due to entangled,
cylindrical micelles in aqueous solutions of the surfactant CTAT has been
studied. On subjecting the system to a step shear rate lying above a certain
value, the shear and normal stresses show interesting time dependent behaviour.
The analysis of the measured time series shows the existence of a finite
correlation dimension and a positive Lyapunov exponent, unambiguously implying
that the dynamics can be described by that of a dynamical system with a strange
attractor whose dimension increases with the increase in shear rate.
