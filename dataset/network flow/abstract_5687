Heterogeneous small cell networks with overlay femtocells and macrocell is a
promising solution for future heterogeneous wireless cellular communications.
However, great resilience is needed in heterogeneous small cells in case of
accidents, attacks and natural disasters. In this article, we first describe
the network architecture of disaster resilient heterogeneous small cell
networks (DRHSCNs), where several self-organization inspired approaches are
applied. Based on the proposed resilient heterogeneous small cell network
architecture, self-configuring (power, physical cell ID and neighbor cell list
self-configuration) and self-optimizing (coverage and capacity optimization and
mobility robustness optimization) techniques are investigated in the DRHSCN.
Simulation results show that self-configuration and self-optimization can
effectively improve the performance of the deployment and operation of the
small cell networks in disaster scenarios.
