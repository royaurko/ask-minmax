In the present study, we use a fifth-order ordinary differential equation, a
generalization of the Blasius equation derived from the Leray-alpha model, to
examine the transition to turbulence in rough-wall boundary-layer flows. This
equation, combined with a weaker formulation of the von Karman log law modified
to include the effects of surface roughness, provides a family of turbulent
velocity profiles with two free parameters: the momentum thickness based
Reynolds number and the roughness function. As a result, a skin-friction
correlation is obtained and predictions of the transitional Reynolds numbers
and maximal skin-friction values are made based on the roughness function.
