In this letter, we propose the interference cancellation through interference
alignment at the downlink of cognitive cellular networks. Interference
alignment helps the spatial resources to be shared among primary and secondary
cells and thus, it can provide higher degrees of freedom through interference
cancellation. We derive and depict the achievable degrees of freedom. We also
analyse and calculate the achievable sum rates applying water-filling optimal
power allocation.
