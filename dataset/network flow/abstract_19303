The most plausible mechanism for triggering the outburst of black hole
candidate X-ray transients is the ionization thermal instability. The disk
instability models can give the observed mass flow in quiescence, but not the
X-ray spectrum. Self-irradiation of the disk in outburst may not lead to X-ray
reprocessing as the dominant source of optical light, but may play a role in
the "reflare." The hard power-law spectrum and radio bursts may be non-thermal
processes driven by the flow of pair-rich plasma from the disk at early times
and due to the formation of a pair-rich plasma corona at late times. The
repeated outbursts suggest some sort of clock, but it is unlikely that it has
anything to do with a simple X-ray heating of the companion star.
