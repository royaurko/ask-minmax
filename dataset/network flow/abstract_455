The optimal power flow (OPF) problem determines power generation/demand that
minimize a certain objective such as generation cost or power loss. It is
nonconvex. We prove that, for radial networks, after shrinking its feasible set
slightly, the global optimum of OPF can be recovered via a second-order cone
programming (SOCP) relaxation under a condition that can be checked a priori.
The condition holds for the IEEE 13-, 34-, 37-, 123-bus networks and two
real-world networks, and has a physical interpretation.
