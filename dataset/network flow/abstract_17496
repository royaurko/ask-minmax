Flows around a wedge-shaped bow are simulated with the aim of investigating
the wave breaking mechanism and small scale features of ship bow waves. This
fluid dynamics video shows the plunging wave breaking process around the wedge
including the thin water sheet formation, overturning sheet with surface
disturbance, fingering and breaking up into spray, plunging and splashing, and
air entrainment.
