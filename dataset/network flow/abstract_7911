A necessary and sufficient condition for linear stability of inviscid
parallel shear flow is formulated by a novel variational method, where the
velocity profile is assumed to be monotonic and analytic. Unstable eigenvalues
of the Rayleigh equation are shown to be associated with positive eigenvalues
of a certain selfadjoint operator. The stability is therefore simply determined
by maximizing a quadratic form, which is theoretically and numerically more
tractable than directly solving the Rayleigh equation. This variational
approach is based on the Hamiltonian nature of the inviscid fluid and will be
applicable to other hydrodynamic stability problems.
