In the optimal velocity model with a time lag, we show that there appear
multiple exact solutions in some ranges of car density, describing a uniform
flow, a stable and an unstable congested flows. This establishes the presence
of subcritical Hopf bifurcations. Our analytic results have far-reaching
implications for traffic flows such as hysteresis phenomena associated with
discontinuous transitions between uniform and congested flows.
