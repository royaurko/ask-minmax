We show how energy flow lines answer the question about diffraction phenomena
presented in 1818 by the French Academy: "deduce by mathematical induction, the
movements of the rays during their crossing near the bodies". This provides a
complementary answer to Fresnel's wave theory of light. A numerical simulation
of these energy flow lines proves that they can reach the bright spot of
Poisson-Arago in the shadow center of a circular opaque disc. For a
monochromatic wave in vacuum, these energy flow lines correspond to the
diffracted rays of Newton's Opticks.
