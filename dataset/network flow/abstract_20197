In this paper, we study the Lie point symmetry group of a system describing
an ideal plastic plane flow in two dimensions in order to find analytical
solutions. The infinitesimal generators that span the Lie algebra for this
system are obtained. We completely classify the subalgebras of up to
codimension two in conjugacy classes under the action of the symmetry group.
Based on invariant forms, we use Ansatzes to compute symmetry reductions in
such a way that the obtained solutions cover simultaneously many invariant and
partially invariant solutions. We calculate solutions of the algebraic,
trigonometric, inverse trigonometric and elliptic type. Some solutions
depending on one or two arbitrary functions of one variable have also been
found. In some cases, the shape of a potentially feasible extrusion die
corresponding to the solution is deduced. These tools could be used to thin,
curve, undulate or shape a ring in an ideal plastic material.
