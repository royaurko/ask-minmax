Cooperative behavior is common in nature even if selfishness is sometimes
better for an individual. Empirical and theoretical studies have shown that the
invasion and expansion of cooperators are related to an inhomogeneous
connectivity distribution. Here we study the evolution of cooperation on an
adaptive network, in which an individual is able to avoid being exploited by
rewiring its link(s). Our results indicate that the broadening of connectivity
distribution is not always beneficial for cooperation. Compared with the
Poisson-like degree distribution, the exponential-like degree distribution is
detrimental to the occurrence of a higher level of cooperation in the
continuous snowdrift game (CSG).
