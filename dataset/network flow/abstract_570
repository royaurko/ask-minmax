The time evolution of the extremely diluted Blume-Emery-Griffiths neural
network model is studied, and a detailed equilibrium phase diagram is obtained
exhibiting pattern retrieval, fluctuation retrieval and self-sustained activity
phases. It is shown that saddle-point solutions associated with fluctuation
overlaps slow down considerably the flow of the network states towards the
retrieval fixed points. A comparison of the performance with other three-state
networks is also presented.
