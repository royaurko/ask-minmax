We have studied the superconducting behavior of 100 nm Titanium Nitride (TiN)
thin film in a perpendicular magnetic field. We found a zero field transition
temperature of 4.6 K and a slope in the H-T plane of -0.745 T/K. At 4.2 K, we
have performed careful transport measurements by measuring both the
differential resistivity and voltage as a function of a DC current. Our results
are analyzed in the framework of linear and non linear flux flow behavior. In
particular, we have observed an electronic instability at high vortex
velocities and from its dependence with respect to the applied magnetic field,
we can exctract the inelastic scattering time and diffusion length of the
quasiparticles.
