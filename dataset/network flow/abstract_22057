In the above paper the contributor treats the boundary layer flow of an
electrically conducting, non-Newtonian fluid along a vertical plate embedded in
a Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer porous medium. The fluid is under the action of a
constant transverse magnetic field and the radiation is taken into account in
the energy equation. The boundary layer equations are transformed into ordinary
ones and subsequently are solved numerically. However, there is a fundamental
error in this paper which is presented below:
