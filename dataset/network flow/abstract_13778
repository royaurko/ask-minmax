We report on the first phase of our study of slightly rotating accretion
flows onto black holes. We consider inviscid accretion flows with a spherically
symmetric density distribution at the outer boundary, but with spherical
symmetry broken by the introduction of a small, latitude-dependent angular
momentum. We study accretion flows by means of numerical 2D, axisymmetric,
hydrodynamical simulations. Our main result is that the properties of the
accretion flow do not depend as much on the outer boundary conditions (i.e.,
the amount as well as distribution of the angular momentum) as on the geometry
of the non-accreting matter. The material that has too much angular momentum to
be accreted forms a thick torus near the equator. Consequently, the geometry of
the polar region, where material is accreted (the funnel), and the mass
accretion rate through it are constrained by the size and shape of the torus.
Our results show one way in which the mass accretion rate of slightly rotating
gas can be significantly reduced compared to the accretion of non-rotating gas
(i.e., the Bondi rate), and set the stage for calculations that will take into
account the transport of angular momentum and energy.
