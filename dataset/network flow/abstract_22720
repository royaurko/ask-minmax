We have examined the cyclotron resonance instability developing in the
relativistic out-flowing plasma in the pulsar magnetosphere. The instability
condition leads to radio emission in the sub-GHz frequency regime which is
likely to be seen as off-pulse emission. Recent studies have shown the presence
of off-pulse emission in long period pulsars, and we demonstrate this plasma
process to be an energetically viable mechanism.
