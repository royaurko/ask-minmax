We prove existence in the Minkowski space of entire spacelike hypersurfaces
with constant negative scalar curvature and given set of lightlike directions
at infinity; we also construct the entire scalar curvature flow with prescribed
set of lightlike directions at infinity, and prove that the flow converges to a
spacelike hypersurface with constant scalar curvature. The proofs rely on
barriers construction and a priori estimates.
