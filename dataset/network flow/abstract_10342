A direct numerical simulation of incompressible channel flow at $Re_\tau$ =
5186 has been performed, and the flow exhibits a number of the characteristics
of high Reynolds number wall-bounded turbulent flows. For example, a region
where the mean velocity has a logarithmic variation is observed, with von
Karman constant $\kappa = 0.384 \pm 0.004$. There is also a logarithmic
dependence of the variance of the spanwise velocity component, though not the
streamwise component. A distinct separation of scales exists between the large
outer-layer structures and small inner-layer structures. At intermediate
distances from the wall, the one-dimensional spectrum of the streamwise
velocity fluctuation in both the streamwise and spanwise directions exhibits
$k^{-1}$ dependence over a short range in $k$. Further, consistent with
previous experimental observations, when these spectra are multiplied by $k$
(premultiplied spectra), they have a bi-modal structure with local peaks
located at wavenumbers on either side of the $k^{-1}$ range.
