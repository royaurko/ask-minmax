Photoexcitation and ionization of partially ionized heavy atoms in highly
relativistic flows by interstellar photons, followed by their reemission in
radiative recombination and decay, boost star-light into beamed $\gamma$ rays
along the flow direction. Repeated excitation/decay of highly relativistic
baryonic ejecta from merger or accretion induced collapse of neutron stars in
dense stellar regions (DSRs), like galactic cores, globular clusters and super
star-clusters, can convert enough kinetic energy in such events in distant
galaxies into cosmological gamma ray bursts (GRBs). The model predicts
remarkably well all the main observed temporal and spectral properties of GRBs.
Its success strongly suggests that GRBs are $\gamma$ ray tomography pictures of
DSRs in galaxies at cosmological distances with unprecedented resolution: A
time resolution of $dt\sim 1~ms$ in a GRB can resolve stars at a Hubble
distance which are separated by only $D\sim 10^{10}cm$. This is equivalent to
the resolving power of an optical telescope with a diameter larger than one
Astronomical Unit!
