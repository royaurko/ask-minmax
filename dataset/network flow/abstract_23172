We develop a new model of the fluctuation dynamo in which the magnetic field
is confined to thin flux ropes advected by a multi-scale flow which models
turbulence. Magnetic dissipation occurs only via reconnections of flux ropes.
The model is particularly suitable for rarefied plasma, such as the Solar
corona or galactic halos. We investigate the kinetic energy release into heat,
mediated by dynamo action, both in our model and by solving the induction
equation with the same flow. We find that the flux rope dynamo is more than an
order of magnitude more efficient at converting mechanical energy into heat.
The probability density of the magnetic energy released during reconnections
has a power-law form with the slope -3, consistent with the Solar corona
heating by nanoflares. We also present a nonlinear extension of the model. This
shows that a plausible saturation mechanism of the fluctuation dynamo is the
suppression of turbulent magnetic diffusivity, due to suppression of random
stretching at the location of the flux ropes. We confirm that the probability
distribution function of the magnetic line curvature has a power-law form
suggested by (Schekochihin et al., 2002). We argue, however, using our results
that this does not imply a persistent folded structure of magnetic field, at
least in the nonlinear stage.
