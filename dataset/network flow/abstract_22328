We study the behaviour of a Hilbert geometry when going to infinity along a
geodesic line. We prove that all the information is contained in the shape of
the boundary at the endpoint of this geodesic line and have to introduce a
regularity property of convex functions to make this link precise. The point of
view is a dynamical one and the main interest of this article is in Lyapunov
exponents of the geodesic flow.
