The drainage of particulate foams is studied under conditions where the
particles are not trapped individually by constrictions of the interstitial
pore space. The drainage velocity decreases continuously as the particle volume
fraction $\phi_{p}$ increases. The suspensions jam - and therefore drainage
stops - for values $\phi_{p}^{*}$ which reveal a strong effect of the particle
size. In accounting for the particular geometry of the foam, we show that
$\phi_{p}^{*}$ accounts for unusual confinement effects when the particles pack
into the foam network. We model quantitatively the overall behavior of the
suspension - from flow to jamming - by taking into account explicitly the
divergence of its effective viscosity at $\phi_{p}^{*}$. Beyond the scope of
drainage, the reported jamming transition is expected to have a deep
significance for all aspects related to particulate foams, from aging to
mechanical properties.
