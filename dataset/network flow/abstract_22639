We introduce an arithmetic version of the multivariate Tutte polynomial, and
(for representable arithmetic matroids) a quasi-polynomial that interpolates
between the two. A generalized Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation with
applications to arithmetic colorings and flows is obtained. We give a new and
more general proof of the positivity of the coefficients of the arithmetic
Tutte polynomial, and (in the representable case) a geometrical interpretation
of them.
