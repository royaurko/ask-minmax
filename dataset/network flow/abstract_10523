In this paper, critical global connectivity of mobile ad hoc communication
networks (MAHCN) is investigated. We model the two-dimensional plane on which
nodes move randomly with a triangular lattice. Demanding the best communication
of the network, we account the global connectivity $\eta$ as a function of
occupancy $\sigma$ of sites in the lattice by mobile nodes. Critical phenomena
of the connectivity for different transmission ranges $r$ are revealed by
numerical simulations, and these results fit well to the analysis based on the
assumption of homogeneous mixing . Scaling behavior of the connectivity is
found as $\eta \sim f(R^{\beta}\sigma)$, where $R=(r-r_{0})/r_{0}$, $r_{0}$ is
the length unit of the triangular lattice and $\beta$ is the scaling index in
the universal function $f(x)$. The model serves as a sort of site percolation
on dynamic complex networks relative to geometric distance. Moreover, near each
critical $\sigma_c(r)$ corresponding to certain transmission range $r$, there
exists a cut-off degree $k_c$ below which the clustering coefficient of such
self-organized networks keeps a constant while the averaged nearest neighbor
degree exhibits a unique linear variation with the degree k, which may be
useful to the designation of real MAHCN.
