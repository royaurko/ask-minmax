The relativistic extension of non-relativistic hydrodynamics suffers from
notorious difficulties. In non-relativistic hydrodynamics where difficulties
also abound, it has proved a useful supplement to study lattice models which
can imitate viscous fluid flow. In this paper we construct a relativistic
spacetime lattice and construct a dynamics of points, thus a relativistic
cellular automaton over it, to model relativistic fluid flow. A simple example
is also explicitly studied, and some numerical results with figures are shown
in the last section.
