We study surfaces evolving by mean curvature flow (MCF). For an open set of
initial data that are $C^3$-close to round, but without assuming rotational
symmetry or positive mean curvature, we show that MCF solutions become singular
in finite time by forming neckpinches, and we obtain detailed asymptotics of
that singularity formation. Our results show in a precise way that MCF
solutions become asymptotically rotationally symmetric near a neckpinch
singularity.
