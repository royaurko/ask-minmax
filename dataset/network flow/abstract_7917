We study photospheric and sub-photospheric properties of active and quiet
regions observed during 11-17 February 2011 including the first X-class flare
X2.2 of the solar cycle 24 which occurred in the active region NOAA 11158 on 15
February 2011. The p-mode parameters and sub-photospheric flows are computed
from the ring-diagrams and inversions. We found larger frequency shifts in
active regions than quiet regions. The active region NOAA 11158 shows stronger
twisted sub-photospheric flows than dormant active regions. The kinetic
helicity density of sub-photospheric flows of the active region NOAA 11158
shows different structure on the flare day than the pre- and post flare days.
