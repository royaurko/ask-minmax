We measure the rotational statistics of neutrally buoyant rods with lengths
$2.8 < l/\eta <72.9 $ in turbulence. For particles with length in the inertial
range, we derive a scaling relationship for the mean square rotation rate, $<
\dot{p}_i \dot{p}_i > \propto l^{-4/3}$ and show that measurements approach
this scaling. Deviations from the proposed scaling are explained as the effect
of dissipation range scales. The correlation time of the Lagrangian
autocorrelation of rod rotation rate scales as the turn over time of eddies of
the size of the rod. Measuring rotational dynamics of single long rods provides
a new way to access the spatial structure of the flow at different length
scales.
