We investigate a class of random graph ensembles based on the Feynman graphs
of multidimensional integrals, representing statistical-mechanical partition
functions. We show that the resulting ensembles of random graphs strongly
resemble those defined in random graphs with hidden color (CDRG), generalizing
the known relation of the Feynman graphs of simple one-dimensional integrals to
random graphs with a given degree distribution.
