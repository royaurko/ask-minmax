Network steganography is the art of hiding secret information within innocent
network transmissions. Recent findings indicate that novel malware is
increasingly using network steganography. Similarly, other malicious activities
can profit from network steganography, such as data leakage or the exchange of
pedophile data. This paper provides an introduction to network steganography
and highlights its potential application for harmful purposes. We discuss the
issues related to countering network steganography in practice and provide an
outlook on further research directions and problems.
