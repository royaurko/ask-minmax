The wireless sensor network has become a hot research area due its wide range
of application in military and civilian domain, but as it uses wireless media
for communication these are easily prone to security attacks. There are number
of attacks on wireless sensor networks like black hole attack, sink hole
attack, Sybil attack, selective forwarding attacks etc. in this paper we will
concentrate on selective forwarding attacks In selective forwarding attacks,
malicious nodes behave like normal nodes and selectively drop packets. The
selection of dropping nodes may be random. Identifying such attacks is very
difficult and sometimes impossible. In this paper we have listed up some
detection techniques, which have been proposed by different researcher in
recent years, there we also have tabular representation of qualitative analysis
of detection techniques
