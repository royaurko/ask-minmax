The paper presents initial step toward new network anomaly detection method
that is based on traffic visualisation. The key design principle of the
proposed approach is the lack of direct, linear time dependencies for the
created network traffic visualisations. The method's feasibility is
demonstrated in network steganography environment by presenting steg-tomography
methodology and developing the dedicated visualisation tool. To contributors' best
knowledge this is the first utilization of network traffic visualisations for
steganalysis purposes.
