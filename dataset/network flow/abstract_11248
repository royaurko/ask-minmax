Energy consumption is the most challenging issue in routing protocol design
for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), since mobile nodes are battery powered.
Furthermore, replacing or recharging batteries is often impossible in critical
environments such as in military or rescue missions. In a MANET, the energy
depletion of a node does not affect the node itself only, but the overall
network lifetime. In this paper, we present multipath and energy-aware on
demand source routing (MEA-DSR) protocol, which exploits route diversity and
information about batteries-energy levels for balancing energy consumption
between mobile nodes. Simulation results, have shown that MEA-DSR protocol is
more energy efficient than DSR in almost mobility scenarios.
