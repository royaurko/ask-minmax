In this paper, we will establish a regularity theory for the K\"ahler-Ricci
flow on Fano $n$-manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded in $L^p$-norm for some
$p > n$. Using this regularity theory, we will also solve a long-standing
conjecture for dimension 3. As an application, we give a new proof of the
Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for Fano 3-manifolds. The results have been
announced in \cite{TiZh12b}.
