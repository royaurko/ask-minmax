We present a short overview on the strongest variational formulation for
gradient flows of geodesically $\lambda$-convex functionals in metric spaces,
with applications to diffusion equations in Wasserstein spaces of probability
measures. These notes are based on a series of lectures given by the second
contributor for the Summer School "Optimal transportation: Theory and applications"
in Grenoble during the week of June 22-26, 2009.
