Stationary, axisymmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes of dust of which
trajectories are integral curves of the time translation Killing vector are
investigated. The flow has no Newtonian limit. Asymptotic flatness implies the
existence of singularities of the curvature scalar that are distributions and
that are not isolated from regularity regions of the flow. The singularities
are closely related to the presence of additional stresses that contribute
negative active mass to the total (Komar) mass, which is zero for
asymptotically flat spacetimes. Several families of solutions are constructed
and a multipole expansion is presented.
