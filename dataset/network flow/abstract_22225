We employ the UrQMD transport + hydrodynamics hybrid model to estimate the
effects of a separation of the hot equilibrated core and the dilute corona
created in high energy heavy ion collisions. It is shown that the fraction of
the system which can be regarded as an equilibrated fireball changes over a
wide range of energies. This has an impact especially on strange particle
abundancies. We show that such a core corona separation allows to improve the
description of strange particle ratios and flow as a function of beam energy as
well as strange particle yields as a function of centrality.
