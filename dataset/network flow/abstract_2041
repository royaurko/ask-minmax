We investigate the capacity of opportunistic communication in the presence of
dynamic and distributed spectral activity, i.e. when the time varying spectral
holes sensed by the cognitive transmitter are correlated but not identical to
those sensed by the cognitive receiver. Using the information theoretic
framework of communication with causal and non-causal side information at the
transmitter and/or the receiver, we obtain analytical capacity expressions and
the corresponding numerical results. We find that cognitive radio communication
is robust to dynamic spectral environments even when the communication occurs
in bursts of only 3-5 symbols. The value of handshake overhead is investigated
for both lightly loaded and heavily loaded systems. We find that the capacity
benefits of overhead information flow from the transmitter to the receiver is
negligible while feedback information overhead in the opposite direction
significantly improves capacity.
