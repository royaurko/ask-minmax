In Ad Hoc networks, route failure may occur due to less received power,
mobility, congestion and node failures. Many approaches have been proposed in
literature to solve this problem, where a node predicts pre-emptively the route
failure that occurs with the less received power. However, this approach
encounters some difficulties, especially in scenario without mobility where
route failures may arise. In this paper, we propose an improvement of AODV
protocol called LO-PPAODV (Link Quality and MAC-Overhead aware Predictive
Preemptive AODV). This protocol is based on new metric combine more routing
metrics (Link Quality, MAC Overhead) between each node and one hop neighbor.
Also we propose a cross-layer networking mechanism to distinguish between both
situations, failures due to congestion or mobility, and consequently avoiding
unnecessary route repair process. The LO-PPAODV was implemented using NS-2. The
simulation results show that our approach improves the overall performance of
the network. It reduces the average end to end delay, the routing overhead, MAC
errors and route errors, and increases the packet delivery fraction of the
network.
