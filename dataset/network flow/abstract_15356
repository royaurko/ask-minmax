This paper proposes a dynamic congestion pricing model that takes into
account mobile source emissions. We consider a tollable vehicular network where
the users selfishly minimize their own travel costs, including travel time,
early/late arrival penalties and tolls. On top of that, we assume that part of
the network can be tolled by a central contributority, whose objective is to
minimize both total travel costs of road users and total emission on a
network-wide level. The model is formulated as a mathematical program with
equilibrium constraints (MPEC) problem and then reformulated as a mathematical
program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). The MPCC is solved using a
quadratic penalty-based gradient projection algorithm. A numerical study on a
toy network illustrates the effectiveness of the tolling strategy and reveals a
Braess-type paradox in the context of traffic-derived emission.
