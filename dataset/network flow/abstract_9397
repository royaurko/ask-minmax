We study synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators in strongly modular networks
in which the structure of the network inside each community is averaged. We
find that the dynamics of the interacting communities can be described as an
ensemble of coupled planar oscillators. In the limit of a large number of
communities, we find a low dimensional description of the level of
synchronization between the communities. In this limit, we describe
bifurcations between incoherence, local synchrony, and global synchrony. We
compare the predictions of this simplified model with simulations of
heterogeneous networks in which the internal structure of each community is
preserved and find excellent agreement. Finally, we investigate synchronization
in networks where several layers of communities within communities may be
present.
