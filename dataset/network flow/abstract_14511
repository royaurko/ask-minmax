We revisit the problem of the hidden sector Landau pole in the Pyramid
Scheme. There is a fixed line in the plane of hidden sector gauge coupling and
a Yukawa coupling between the trianon fields. We postulate that the couplings
flow to this line, at a point where the hidden sector gauge coupling is close
to the strong coupling edge of its perturbative regime. Below the masses of the
heavier trianons, the model quickly flows to a confining N_F=N_C=3
supersymmetric gauge theory, as required by phenomenological considerations. We
study possible discrete R-symmetries, which guarantee, among other things, that
the basin of attraction of the fixed line has full co-dimension in the space of
R-allowed couplings. The Yukawa couplings required to get the fixed line
violate the pyrma-baryon symmetries we invoked in previous work to find a dark
matter candidate. Omitting one of them, we have a dark matter candidate, and an
acceptable RG flow down from the unification scale, if the confinement scale of
the hidden sector group is lowered from 5 to 2 TeV.
