Belief propagation and its variants are popular methods for approximate
inference, but their running time and even their convergence depend greatly on
the schedule used to send the messages. Recently, dynamic update schedules have
been shown to converge much faster on hard networks than static schedules,
namely the residual BP schedule of Elidan et al. [2006]. But that RBP algorithm
wastes message updates: many messages are computed solely to determine their
priority, and are never actually performed. In this paper, we show that
estimating the residual, rather than calculating it directly, leads to
significant decreases in the number of messages required for convergence, and
in the total running time. The residual is estimated using an upper bound based
on recent work on message errors in BP. On both synthetic and real-world
networks, this dramatically decreases the running time of BP, in some cases by
a factor of five, without affecting the quality of the solution.
