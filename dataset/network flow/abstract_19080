An advanced system of sensors/actuators should allow the direct feedback of a
sensed signal into an actuation, e.g., an action potential propagation through
an axon or a special cell activity might be sensed and suppressed by an
actuator through voltage stimulation or chemical delivery. Such a complex
procedure of sensing and stimulation calls for direct communication among these
sensors and actuators. In addition, minimizing the sensor/actuator to the size
of a biological cell can enable the cell-level automatic therapy. For this
objective, we propose such an approach to form a peer-to-peer network of
\emph{in vivo} sensors/actuators (S/As) that can be deployed with or even
inside biological cells. The S/As can communicate with each other via
electromagnetic waves of optical frequencies. In comparison with the comparable
techniques including the radio-frequency identification (RFID) and the wireless
sensor network (WSN), this technique is well adapted for the cell-level
sensing-actuating tasks considering the requirements on size, actuation speed,
signal-collision avoidance, etc.
