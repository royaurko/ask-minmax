A rotationally-symmetrical ellipsoidal flow model is proposed for the
relativistic heavy-ion collisions and compared with the 14.6 A GeV/c Si-Al and
10.8 A GeV/c Au-Au collision data. The large stopping in the heavier collision
system and heavier produced particles is accounted for by using the ellipsoidal
flow picture. The central dip in the proton and deuteron rapidity distributions
for Si-Al collision are reproduced.
