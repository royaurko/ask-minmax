In evolutionary biology, biologists often face the problem of constructing a
phylogenetic tree on a set $X$ of species from a multiset $\Pi$ of partitions
corresponding to various attributes of these species. One approach that is used
to solve this problem is to try instead to associate a tree (or even a network)
to the multiset $\Sigma_{\Pi}$ consisting of all those bipartitions $\{A,X-A\}$
with $A$ a part of some partition in $\Pi$. The rational behind this approach
is that a phylogenetic tree with leaf set $X$ can be uniquely represented by
the set of bipartitions of $X$ induced by its edges. Motivated by these
considerations, given a multiset $\Sigma$ of bipartitions corresponding to a
phylogenetic tree on $X$, in this paper we introduce and study the set
$P(\Sigma)$ consisting of those multisets of partitions $\Pi$ of $X$ with
$\Sigma_{\Pi}=\Sigma$. More specifically, we characterize when $P(\Sigma)$ is
non-empty, and also identify some partitions in $P(\Sigma)$ that are of maximum
and minimum size. We also show that it is NP-complete to decide when
$P(\Sigma)$ is non-empty in case $\Sigma$ is an arbitrary multiset of
bipartitions of $X$. Ultimately, we hope that by gaining a better understanding
of the mapping that takes an arbitrary partition system $\Pi$ to the multiset
$\Sigma_{\Pi}$, we will obtain new insights into the use of median networks
and, more generally, split-networks to visualize sets of partitions.
