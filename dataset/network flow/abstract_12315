We present a mechanism to improve the conductivity of carbon nanotube (CNT)
networks by improving the conductance between CNTs of different chirality. We
argue generally that a weak perturbation can greatly improve the inter-tube
conductance by allowing momentum-conserving tunnelling. The mechanism is
verified with a tight-binding model, allowing an investigation of its impact
for a network containing a range of chiralities. We discuss practical
implementations, and conclude that it may be effected by weak physical
interactions, and therefore does not require chemical bonding to the CNTs.
