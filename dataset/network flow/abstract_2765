We study the properties of the distance between attractors in Random Boolean
Networks, a prominent model of genetic regulatory networks. We define three
distance measures, upon which attractor distance matrices are constructed and
their main statistic parameters are computed. The experimental analysis shows
that ordered networks have a very clustered set of attractors, while chaotic
networks' attractors are scattered; critical networks show, instead, a pattern
with characteristics of both ordered and chaotic networks.
