We report results of a search for optical emission line gas in the Hickson
compact group 62. From narrow band (H-alpha) imaging observations we estimate
10^4 Msun of ionized hydrogen gas within the central regions of three of the
galaxies in the group. There has been considerable interest in this group since
ROSAT detected an extended halo of diffuse X-ray emission, possibly with a
cooling flow at the center. The optical emission line luminosities from the
three galaxies are comparable to each other (~10^{39} ergs/s) and resemble
those seen in normal X-ray luminous early type galaxies. There is no evidence
for any excess emission in the galaxy which lies at the center of the X-ray
cooling flow. We find that the most likely source of excitation for the
emission line nebulosities is photoionization by young stars.
