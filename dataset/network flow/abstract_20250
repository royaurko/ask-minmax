Using relativistic conformal hydrodynamics coupled to the linear $\sigma$
model we study the evolution of matter created in heavy--ion collisions. We
focus the study on the influence of the dynamics of the chiral fields on the
charged-hadron elliptic flow $v_2$ for a temperature--independent as well as
for a temperature--dependent $\eta/s$ that is calculated from kinetic theory.
We find that $v_2$ is not very sensitive to the coupling of chiral fields to
the hydrodynamic evolution, but the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ plays a
much bigger role on this observable.
