We examine here the inner region accretion flows onto black holes. A variety
of models are presented. We also discuss viscosity mechanisms under a variety
of circumstances, for standard accretion disks onto galactic black holes and
supermassive black holes and hot accretion disks. Relevant work is presented
here on unified aspects of disk accretion onto supermassive black holes and the
possible coupling of thick disks to beams in the inner regions. We also explore
other accretion flow scenarios. We conclude that a variety of scenarios yield
high temperatures in the inner flows and that viscosity is likely not higher
than alpha $\sim$ 0.01.
