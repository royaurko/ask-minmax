In this talk, we elaborate on the operation of graph contraction introduced
by Gurau in his study of the Schwinger-Dyson equations. After a brief review of
colored tensor models, we identify the Lie algebra appearing in the
Schwinger-Dyson equations as a Lie algebra associated to a Hopf algebra of the
Connes-Kreimer type. Then, we show how this operation also leads to an analogue
of the Wilsonian flow for the effective action. Finally, we sketch how this
formalism may be adapted to group field theories.
