IRAS 16547-4247 is the most luminous (6.2 x 10^4 Lsun) embedded young stellar
object known to harbor a thermal radio jet. We report the discovery using
VLT-ISAAC of a chain of H_2 2.12 um emission knots that trace a collimated flow
extending over 1.5 pc. The alignment of the H_2 flow and the central location
of the radio jet implies that these phenomena are intimately linked. We have
also detected using TIMMI2 an isolated, unresolved 12 um infrared source
towards the radio jet . Our findings affirm that IRAS 16547-4247 is excited by
a single O-type star that is driving a collimated jet. We argue that the
accretion mechanism which produces jets in low-mass star formation also
operates in the higher mass regime.
