Accelerating imaging speed in optical microscopy is often realized at the
expense of image contrast, image resolution, and detection sensitivity- a
common predicament for advancing high-speed and high-throughput cellular
imaging. We here demonstrate a new imaging approach, called
asymmetric-detection time-stretch optical microscopy (ATOM), which can deliver
ultrafast label-free high-contrast flow imaging with well delineated cellular
morphological resolution and in-line optical image amplification to overcome
the compromised imaging sensitivity at high speed. We show that ATOM can
separately reveal the enhanced phase-gradient and absorption contrast in
microfluidic live-cell imaging at a flow speed as high as ~10 m/s,
corresponding to an imaging throughput of ~100,000 cells/sec. ATOM could thus
be the enabling platform to meet the pressing need for intercalating optical
microscopy in cellular assay, e.g. imaging flow cytometry- permitting
high-throughput access to the morphological information of the individual cells
simultaneously with a multitude of parameters obtained in the standard assay.
