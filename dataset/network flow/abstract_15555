We study a queueing network with a single shared server, that serves the
queues in a cyclic order according to the gated service discipline. External
customers arrive at the queues according to independent Poisson processes.
After completing service, a customer either leaves the system or is routed to
another queue. This model is very generic and finds many applications in
computer systems, communication networks, manufacturing systems and robotics.
Special cases of the introduced network include well-known polling models and
tandem queues. We derive exact limits of the mean delays under both
heavy-traffic and light-traffic conditions. By interpolating between these
asymptotic regimes, we develop simple closed-form approximations for the mean
delays for arbitrary loads.
