We apply Kauffman's automata on small-world networks to study the crossover
between the short-range and the infinite-range case. We perform accurate
calculations on square lattices to obtain both critical exponents and fractal
dimensions. Particularly, we find an increase of the damage propagation and a
decrease in the fractal dimensions when adding long-range connections.
