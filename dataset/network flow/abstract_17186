To perform a reliable on-line assessment of fuel consumption in vehicles, we
introduce "cumulated vehicle acceleration" as an attribute of GPS probe vehicle
traces. The objective of the calculation of the attribute "cumulated vehicle
acceleration" in the GPS probe vehicle data is to perform a reliable on-line
dynamic traffic assignment for the reduction of vehicle consumption in traffic
and transportation networks.
