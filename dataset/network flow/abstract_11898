Biological information processing networks consist of many components, which
are coupled by an even larger number of complex multivariate interactions.
However, analyses of data sets from fields as diverse as neuroscience,
molecular biology, and behavior have reported that observed statistics of
states of some biological networks can be approximated well by maximum entropy
models with only pairwise interactions among the components. Based on
simulations of random Ising spin networks with $p$-spin ($p>2$) interactions,
here we argue that this reduction in complexity can be thought of as a natural
property of densely interacting networks in certain regimes, and not
necessarily as a special property of living systems. By connecting our analysis
to the theory of random constraint satisfaction problems, we suggest a reason
for why some biological systems may operate in this regime.
