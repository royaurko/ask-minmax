P2P networking has become a promising technology and has achieved popularity
as a mechanism for users to share files without the need for centralized
servers. The rapid growth of P2P networks beginning with Kaza, Lime wire,
Napsters, E-donkey, Gnutella etc makes them an attractive target to the
creators of viruses and other security threats. This paper describes the major
security issues on P2P networks (Viruses and worms) and presents the study of
propagation mechanisms. In particular, the paper explores different P2P viruses
and worms, their propagation methodology, outlines the challenges, and
evaluates how P2P worms affect the network. The experimental results obtained
will provide new direction in surmounting the security concerns in P2P Networks
