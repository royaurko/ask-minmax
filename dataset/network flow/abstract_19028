Being able to design genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) to achieve a desired
cellular function is one of the main goals of synthetic biology. However,
determining minimal GRNs that produce desired time-series behaviors is
non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a 'top-down' approach to evolving small
GRNs and then use these to recursively boot-strap the identification of larger,
more complex, modular GRNs. We start with relatively dense GRNs and then use
differential evolution (DE) to evolve interaction coefficients. When the target
dynamical behavior is found embedded in a dense GRN, we narrow the focus of the
search and begin aggressively pruning out excess interactions at the end of
each generation. We first show that the method can quickly rediscover known
small GRNs for a toggle switch and an oscillatory circuit. Next we include
these GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more
complex, modular GRNs. Successful solutions found in canonical DE where we
truncated small interactions to zero, with or without an interaction penalty
term, invariably contained many excess interactions. In contrast, by
incorporating aggressive pruning and the penalty term, the DE was able to find
minimal or nearly minimal GRNs in all test problems.
