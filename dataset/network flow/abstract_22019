We present a model including diffusion and particle-size dispersion for
separation of particles in deterministic lateral displacement devices also
known as bumper arrays. We determine the upper critical diameter for
diffusion-dominated motion and the lower critical diameter for pure
convection-induced displacement. Our model explains the systematic deviation,
observed for small particles in several experiments, from the critical diameter
for separation given by simple laminar flow considerations.
