We extend the study of a model of competitive cluster growth in an active
medium to a basis of networks; this is done by adding nonlocal connections with
probability $p$ to sites on a regular lattice, thus enabling one to interpolate
between regularity and full randomness. The model on networks demonstrates high
sensitivity to small changes in initial configurations, which we characterize
using damage spreading. The main focus of this paper is, however, the devising
of survival strategies through selective networking, to alter the the fate of
an arbitrarily chosen cluster: whether this be to revive a dying cluster to
life, or to make a weak survivor into a stronger one. Although such goals are
typically achieved by networking with relatively small clusters, our results
suggest that it ought to be possible also to network with peers and larger
clusters. The main indication of this comes from the probability distributions
of mass differences between survivors and their immediate neighbours, which
show an astonishing universality; they suggest strategies for winning against
the odds.
