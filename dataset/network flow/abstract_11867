When a piece of malicious information becomes rampant in an information
diffusion network, can we identify the source node that originally introduced
the piece into the network and infer the time when it initiated this? Being
able to do so is critical for curtailing the spread of malicious information,
and reducing the potential losses incurred. This is a very challenging problem
since typically only incomplete traces are observed and we need to unroll the
incomplete traces into the past in order to pinpoint the source. In this paper,
we tackle this problem by developing a two-stage framework, which first learns
a continuous-time diffusion network model based on historical diffusion traces
and then identifies the source of an incomplete diffusion trace by maximizing
the likelihood of the trace under the learned model. Experiments on both large
synthetic and real-world data show that our framework can effectively go back
to the past, and pinpoint the source node and its initiation time significantly
more accurately than previous state-of-the-arts.
