In continuation with our studies of Lifshitz like D$p$-brane solutions, we
propose a class of 1/4 BPS supersymmetric interpolating solutions which
interpolate between IR Lifshitz solutions and UV AdS solutions smoothly. We
demonstrate properties of these classical solutions near the two fixed points.
These interpolating solutions are then used to calculate the entanglement
entropies of strip-like subsystems. With these bulk solutions the entropy
functional also gets modified. We also make a curious observation about the
electric-magnetic duality and the thermal entropy of the Hodge-dual Lifshitz
D$p$ brane systems.
