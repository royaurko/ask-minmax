We present a new layout algorithm for complex networks that combines a
multi-scale approach for community detection with a standard force-directed
design. Since community detection is computationally cheap, we can exploit the
multi-scale approach to generate network configurations with close-to-minimal
energy very fast. As a further asset, we can use the knowledge of the community
structure to facilitate the interpretation of large networks, for example the
network defined by protein-protein interactions.
