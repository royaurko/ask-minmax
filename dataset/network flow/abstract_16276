We study experimentally and theoretically transition phenomena caused by the
external forcing from Rayleigh-Benard convection with the large-scale
circulation (LSC) to the limiting regime of unstably stratified turbulent flow
without LSC whereby the temperature field behaves like a passive scalar. In the
experiments we use the Rayleigh-B\'enard apparatus with an additional source of
turbulence produced by two oscillating grids located nearby the side walls of
the chamber. When the frequency of the grid oscillations is larger than 2 Hz,
the large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent convection is destroyed, and the
destruction of the LSC is accompanied by a strong change of the mean
temperature distribution. However, in all regimes of the unstably stratified
turbulent flow the ratio $\big[(\ell_x \nabla_x T)^2 + (\ell_y \nabla_y T)^2 +
(\ell_z \nabla_z T)^2\big] / < \theta^2 >$ varies slightly (even in the range
of parameters whereby the behaviour of the temperature field is different from
that of the passive scalar). Here $\ell_i$ are the integral scales of
turbulence along x, y, z directions, T and \theta are the mean and fluctuating
parts of the fluid temperature. At all frequencies of the grid oscillations we
have detected the long-term nonlinear oscillations of the mean temperature. The
theoretical predictions based on the budget equations for turbulent kinetic
energy, turbulent temperature fluctuations and turbulent heat flux, are in
agreement with the experimental results.
