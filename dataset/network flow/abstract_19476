We suggest a new, renormalization group (RG) based, nonperturbative method
for treating the intermittency problem of fully developed turbulence which also
includes the effects of a finite boundary of the turbulent flow. The key idea
is not to try to construct an elimination procedure based on some assumed
statistical distribution, but to make an ansatz for possible RG transformations
and to pose constraints upon those, which guarantee the invariance of the
nonlinear term in the Navier-Stokes equation, the invariance of the energy
dissipation, and other basic properties of the velocity field. The role of
length scales is taken to be inverse to that in the theory of critical
phenomena; thus possible intermittency corrections are connected with the outer
length scale. Depending on the specific type of flow, we find different sets of
admissible transformations with distinct scaling behavior: for the often
considered infinite, isotropic, and homogeneous system K41 scaling is enforced,
but for the more realistic plane Couette geometry no restrictions on
intermittency exponents were obtained so far.
