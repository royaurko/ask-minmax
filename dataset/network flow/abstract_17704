Analytic gravitational collapse and expansion solutions with anisotropic
pressure are generated. Metric functions are found by requiring zero heat flow
scalar. It emerges that a single function generates the anisotropic solutions.
Each generating function contains an arbitrary function of time which can be
chosen to fit various astrophysical time profiles. Two examples are provided: a
bounded collapse metric and an expanding cosmological solution
