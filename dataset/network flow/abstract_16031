We propose a nonlinear filtering framework for approaching the problems of
channel state tracking and spatiotemporal channel gain prediction in mobile
wireless sensor networks, in a Bayesian setting. We assume that the wireless
channel constitutes an observable (by the sensors/network nodes),
spatiotemporal, conditionally Gaussian stochastic process, which is
statistically dependent on a set of hidden channel parameters, called the
channel state. The channel state evolves in time according to a known, non
stationary, nonlinear and/or non Gaussian Markov stochastic kernel. This
formulation results in a partially observable system, with a temporally varying
global state and spatiotemporally varying observations. Recognizing the
intractability of general nonlinear state estimation, we advocate the use of
grid based approximate filters as an effective and robust means for recursive
tracking of the channel state. We also propose a sequential spatiotemporal
predictor for tracking the channel gains at any point in time and space,
providing real time sequential estimates for the respective channel gain map,
for each sensor in the network. Additionally, we show that both estimators
converge towards the true respective MMSE optimal estimators, in a common,
relatively strong sense. Numerical simulations corroborate the practical
effectiveness of the proposed approach.
