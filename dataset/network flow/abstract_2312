We investigate steady granular surface flows in a rotating drum and
demonstrate the existence of rigid clusters of grains embedded in the flowing
layer. These clusters are fractal and their size is power-law distributed from
the grain size scale up to the thickness of the flowing layer. The implications
of the absence of a characteristic length scale on available theoretical models
of dense granular flows are discussed. Finally, we suggest a possible
explanation of the difference between velocity profiles observed in surface
flows and in flows down a rough inclined plane.
