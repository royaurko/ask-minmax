By using Hsu's multiplicative functional for the Neumann heat equation, a
natural damped gradient operator is defined for the reflecting Brownian motion
on compact manifolds with boundary. This operator is linked to quasi-invariant
flows in terms of a integration by parts formula, which leads to the standard
log-Sobolev inequality for the associated Dirichlet form on the path space.
