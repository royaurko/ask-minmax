The Dulac series are the asymptotic expansions of first return maps in a
neighborhood of a hyperbolic polycycle. In this article, we consider two
algebras and of power-log transseries (generalized series) which extend the
algebra of Dulac series. We give a formal normal form and prove a formal
embedding theorem for transseries in these algebras.
