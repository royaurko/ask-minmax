Although much political capital has been made regarding the war on terrorism,
and while appropriations have gotten underway, there has been a dearth of deep
work on counter-terrorism, and despite massive efforts by the federal
government, most cities and states do not have a robust response system. In
fact, most do not yet have a robust audit system with which to evaluate their
vulnerabilities or their responses. At the federal level there remain many
unresolved problems of coordination. One reason for this is the shift of much
of federal spending on war-fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. While this
approach has drawn deep and lasting criticism, it is, in fact, in accord with
many principles of both military and corporate strategy. In the following paper
we explore several models of terrorist networks and the implications of both
the models and their substantive conclusions for combating terrorism.
