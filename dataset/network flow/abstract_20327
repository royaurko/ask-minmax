A phenomenological theory is proposed to analyze the asymptotic dynamics of
perturbed inviscid Kolmogorov shear flows in two dimensions. The phase diagram
provided by the theory is in qualitative agreement with numerical observations,
which include three phases depending on the aspect ratio of the domain and the
size of the perturbation: a steady shear flow, a stationary dipole, and four
traveling vortices. The theory is based on a precise study of the inviscid
damping of the linearized equation and on an analysis of nonlinear effects. In
particular, we show that the dominant Landau pole controlling the inviscid
damping undergoes a bifurcation, which has important consequences on the
asymptotic fate of the perturbation.
