In this article we study the tangent cones at first time singularity of a
Lagrangian mean curvature flow. If the initial compact submanifold is
Lagrangian and almost calibrated by Re\Omega in a Calabi-Yau n-fold (M,\Omega),
and T>0 is the first blow-up time of the mean curvature flow, then the tangent
cone of the mean curvature flow at a singular point (X,T) is a stationary
Lagrangian integer multiplicity current in R\sup 2n with volume density greater
than one at X. When n=2, the tangent cone consists of a finite union of more
than one 2-planes in R\sup 4 which are complex in a complex structure on R\sup
4.
