Non-normal transient growth of disturbances is considered as an essential
prerequisite for subcritical transition in shear flows, i.e. transition to
turbulence despite linear stability of the laminar flow. In this work we
present numerical and analytical computations of linear transient growth
covering all linearly stable regimes of Taylor--Couette flow. Our numerical
experiments reveal comparable energy amplifications in the different regimes.
For high shear Reynolds numbers Re the optimal transient energy growth always
follows a 2/3-scaling with Re, which allows for large amplifications even in
regimes where the presence of turbulence remains debated. In co-rotating
Rayleigh-stable flows the optimal perturbations become increasingly columnar in
their structure, as the optimal axial wavenumber goes to zero. In this limit of
axially invariant perturbations we show that linear stability and transient
growth are independent of the cylinders' rotation-ratio and we derive a
universal 2/3-scaling of optimal energy growth with Re using WKB-theory. Based
on this, a semi-empirical formula for the estimation of linear transient growth
valid in all regimes is obtained.
