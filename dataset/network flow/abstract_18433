Internet faces the problem of congestion due to its increased use. AQM
algorithm is a solution to the problem of congestion control in the Internet.
There are various existing algorithms that have evolved over the past few years
to solve the problem of congestion in IP networks. Congested link causes many
problems such as large delay, underutilization of the link and packet drops in
burst. There are various existing algorithms that have evolved over the past
few years to solve the problem of congestion in IP networks. In this paper,
study of these existing algorithms is done. This paper discusses algorithms
based on various congestion-metrics and classifies them based on certain
factors. This helps in identifying the algorithms that regulate the congestion
more effectively.
