We report the mechanical response of a model nanocomposite system of
poly(styrene) (PS)-silica to large-amplitude oscillatory shear deformations.
Nonlinear behavior of PS nanocomposites is discussed with the changes in
particle dispersion upon deformation to provide a complete physical picture of
their mechanical properties. The elastic stresses for the particle and polymer
are resolved by decomposing the total stress into its purely elastic and
viscous components for composites at different strain levels within a cycle of
deformation. We propose a mechanistic model which captures the deformation of
particles and polymer networks at small and large strains, respectively. We
show, for the first time, that chain stretching in a polymer nanocomposite
obtained in large amplitude oscillatory deformation is in good agreement with
the nonlinear chain deformation theory of polymeric networks.
