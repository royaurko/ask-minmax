We present the elliptic flow of inclusive J/$\psi$ measured in the
$\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ channel at forward rapidity ($2.5<y<4.0$), down to zero
transverse momentum, in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}=2.76$
TeV with the ALICE muon spectrometer. The $p_{\mathrm T}$ dependence of
J/$\psi$ $v_2$ in non-central (20%-60%) Pb-Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}=2.76$ TeV is compared with existing measurements at
RHIC and theoretical calculations. The centrality dependence of the
$p_{\mathrm{T}}$-integrated elliptic flow, as well as the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$
dependence in several finer centrality classes is presented.
