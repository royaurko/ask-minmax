The equation of a motion of curves in the projective plane is deduced. Local
flows are defined in terms of polynomial differential functions. A family of
local flows inducing the Kaup-Kupershmidt hierarchy is constructed. The
integration of the congruence curves is discussed. Local motions defined by the
traveling wave cnoidal solutions of the fifth-order Kaup-Kupershmidt equation
are described.
