In this paper we derive a convergence result for the non-homogeneous Markov
chain that arises in the study of networks employing the additive-increase
multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm. We then use this result to solve the
network utility maximization (NUM) problem. Using AIMD, we show that the NUM
problem is solvable in a very simple manner using only intermittent feedback,
no inter-agent communication, and no common clock.
