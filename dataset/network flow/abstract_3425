In light of the rise of malicious attacks on the Internet, and the various
networks and applications attached to it, new approaches towards modeling
predatory activity in networks could be useful. Past research has simulated
networks assuming that all vertices are homogenously susceptible to attack or
infection. Often times in real world networks only subsets of vertices are
susceptible to attack or infection in a heterogeneous population of vertices.
One approach to examining a heterogeneous network susceptible to attack is
modeling a network as a predator prey landscape. If each type of vulnerable
device is considered a heterogeneous species what level of species
diversification is needed to keep a malicious attack from a causing a
catastrophic failure to the entire network. This paper explores the predator
prey analogy for the Internet and presents findings on how different levels of
species diversification effects network resilience. The paper will also discuss
the connection between diversification, competition, anti-trust, and national
security.
