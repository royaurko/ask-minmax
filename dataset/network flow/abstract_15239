Node misbehavior due to selfish or malicious behavior could significantly
degrade the performance of MANET because most existing routing protocols in
MANET aim to find the most efficient path. Overhearing and reputation based
cooperation schemes have been used to detect and isolate the misbehaving nodes
as well as to force them to cooperate. Performance analysis has been done for
the network traffic using OCEAN over DSR on ns2 while considering the low
energy levels for mobile nodes. Throughput, energy level, routing packets and
normalized routing overhead are analyzed for OCEAN and normal DSR to show the
impact of OCEAN on the overall network performance.
