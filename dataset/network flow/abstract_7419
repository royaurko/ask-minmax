We develop a theory to describe the reorientation phenomena in the lamellar
phase of block copolymer melt under reciprocating shear flow. We show that
similar to the steady-shear, the oscillating flow anisotropically suppresses
fluctuations and gives rise to the parallel-perpendicular orientation
transition. The experimentally observed high-frequency reverse transition is
explained in terms of interaction between the melt and the shear-cell walls.
