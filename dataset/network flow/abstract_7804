We derive one unified formula for Ricci curvature tensor on arbitrary warped
product manifold by introducing a new notation for the lift vector and the
Levi-Civita connection.This formula is helpful to further consider Ricci flow
(RF) and hyperbolic geometric flow (HGF) and evolution equations on warped
product manifold. We characterize the behavior of warping function under RF and
under HGF. Simultaneously, we give some simple examples to illustrate the
existence of such warping function solution. In addition, we also gain the
evolution equations for metrics and Ricci curvature on a general warped product
manifold and specific warped product manifold whose second factor manifold is
of Einstein metric.
