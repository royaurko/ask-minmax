We consider a simple multiple access network in which a destination node
receives information from multiple sources via a set of relay nodes. Each relay
node has access to a subset of the sources, and is connected to the destination
by a unit capacity link. We also assume that $z$ of the relay nodes are
adversarial. We propose a computationally efficient distributed coding scheme
and show that it achieves the full capacity region for up to three sources.
Specifically, the relay nodes encode in a distributed fashion such that the
overall codewords received at the destination are codewords from a single
Reed-Solomon code.
