Three-dimensional Doppler tomography has been used to study the H$\alpha$
emission sources in the RS Vulpeculae interacting binary. The 2D tomogram of
this binary suggested that most of the emission arose from the cool mass losing
star with additional evidence of gas flowing close to the predicted trajectory.
However, the 3D tomogram revealed surprising evidence of a more pronounced gas
stream flow at high $V_z$ velocities from -240 to -360 km s{$^{-1}$}. This
behavior is most likely caused by magnetic activity on the cool star since the
central velocity plane, defined by $V_z$ = 0 km s{$^{-1}$}, should be
coincident with the orbital plane of the binary if the flow is dominated by
gravitational forces only. RS Vul has been detected as both an X-ray and a
radio source, and it is possible that the RS Vul gas stream may have been
deflected by magnetic field lines. This flow is distinctly different from that
found in the streamlike state of U CrB, in which the gas flow was confined
mostly to the central velocity plane.
