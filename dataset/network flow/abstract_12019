We give exact relations which are valid for small-world networks (SWN's) with
a general `degree distribution', i.e the distribution of nearest-neighbor
connections. For the original SWN model, we illustrate how these exact
relations can be used to obtain approximations for the corresponding basic
probability distribution. In the limit of large system sizes and small
disorder, we use numerical studies to obtain a functional fit for this
distribution. Finally, we obtain the scaling properties for the mean-square
displacement of a random walker, which are determined by the scaling behavior
of the underlying SWN.
