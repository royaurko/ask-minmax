Social and biological contagions are influenced by the spatial embeddedness
of networks. Historically, many epidemics spread as a wave across part of the
Earth's surface; however, in modern contagions long-range edges -- for example,
due to airline transportation or communication media -- allow clusters of a
contagion to appear in distant locations. Here we study the spread of
contagions on networks through a methodology grounded in topological data
analysis and nonlinear dimension reduction. We construct "contagion maps" that
use multiple contagions on a network to map the nodes as a point cloud. By
analyzing the topology, geometry, and dimensionality of manifold structure in
such point clouds, we reveal insights to aid in the modeling, forecast, and
control of spreading processes. Our approach highlights contagion maps also as
a viable tool for inferring low-dimensional structure in networks.
