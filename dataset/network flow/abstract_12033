The work investigates the influence of leader's strategy on opinion formation
in artificial networked societies. The strength of the social influence is
assumed to be dictated by distance from one agent to another, as well as
individual strengths of the agents. The leader is assumed to have much greater
resources, which allows him to tune the way he influences the other agents. We
study various strategies of using these resources to optimize the conditions
needed to `convince' the whole society to leader's opinion. The flexibility of
the model allows it to be used in studies of political, social and marketing
influence and opinion formation.
