Creativity is individual, and it is social. The social aspects of creativity
have become of increasing interest as systems have emerged that mobilize large
numbers of people to engage in creative tasks. We examine research related to
collective intelligence and differentiate work on collective creativity from
other collective activities by analyzing systems with respect to the tasks that
are performed and the outputs that result. Three types of systems are
discussed: games, contests and networks. We conclude by suggesting how systems
that generate collective creativity can be improved and how new systems might
be constructed.
