In this paper, we study the structurally nonlinear stability of supersonic
contact discontinuities in three-dimensional compressible isentropic steady
flows. Based on the weakly linear stability result and the $L^2$-estimates
obtained by the contributors in J. Diff. Equ. 255(2013), for the linearized problems
of three-dimensional compressible isentropic steady equations at a supersonic
contact discontinuity satisfying certain stability conditions, we first derive
tame estimates of solutions to the linearized problem in higher order norms by
exploring the behavior of vorticities. Since the supersonic contact
discontinuities are only weakly linearly stable, so the tame estimates of
solutions to the linearized problems have loss of regularity with respect to
both of background states and initial data, so to use the tame estimates to
study the nonlinear problem we adapt the Nash-Moser-H\"ormander iteration
scheme to conclude that weakly linearly stable supersonic contact
discontinuities in three-dimensional compressible steady flows are also
structurally nonlinearly stable.
