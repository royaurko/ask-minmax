We present a characterization of short-term stability of random Boolean
networks under \emph{arbitrary} distributions of transfer functions. Given any
distribution of transfer functions for a random Boolean network, we present a
formula that decides whether short-term chaos (damage spreading) will happen.
We provide a formal proof for this formula, and empirically show that its
predictions are accurate. Previous work only works for special cases of
balanced families. It has been observed that these characterizations fail for
unbalanced families, yet such families are widespread in real biological
networks.
