A hydrodynamic model for steady state, spherically-symmetric winds driven by
young stellar clusters with an exponential stellar density distribution is
presented. Unlike in most previous calculations, the position of the singular
point R_sp, which separates the inner subsonic zone from the outer supersonic
flow, is not associated with the star cluster edge, but calculated
self-consistently. When the radiative losses of energy are negligible, the
transition from the subsonic to the supersonic flow occurs always at R_sp ~ 4
R_c, where R_c is the characteristic scale for the stellar density
distribution, irrespective of other star cluster parameters. This is not the
case in the catastrophic cooling regime, when the temperature drops abruptly at
a short distance from the star cluster center and the transition from the
subsonic to the supersonic regime occurs at a much smaller distance from the
star cluster center. The impact from the major star cluster parameters to the
wind inner structure is thoroughly discussed. Particular attention is paid to
the effects which radiative cooling provides to the flow. The results of the
calculations for a set of input parameters, which lead to different
hydrodynamic regimes, are presented and compared to the results from
non-radiative 1D numerical simulations and to those from calculations with a
homogeneous stellar mass distribution.
