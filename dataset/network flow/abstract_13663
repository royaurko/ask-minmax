I classify spacelike self-similar shrinking solutions of the mean curvature
flow in pseudo-euclidean space in arbitrary codimension, if the mean curvature
vector is not a null vector and the principal normal vector is parallel in the
normal bundle. Moreover, I exclude the existence of such self-shrinkers in
several cases. The classification is analogous to the existing classifications
in the euclidean case of Huisken and Smoczyk.
