In this fluid dynamics video, we compare the deformation of two flexible
particles as they propagate through a sudden constriction of a liquid filled
channel under constant-flux flow: a gas bubble, and a capsule formed by
encapsulating a liquid droplet in a cross-linked polymeric membrane. Both
bubble and capsule adopt highly contorted configurations as they squeeze
through the constriction, exhibit broadly similar features over a wide range of
flow rates, and rupture for sufficiently high flow rates. However, at flow
rates prior to rupture, certain features of the deformation allow bubble and
capsule to be distinguished: bubbles exhibit a tip-streaming singularity
associated with critical thinning of the rear of the bubble, while the capsule
membrane wrinkles under large compressive stresses induced by the constriction.
