We present a fundamental solution to an initial value problem for the
KdV-Whitham system in an explicit integral form. Monotonically decreasing
initial data with finite number of breaking points are considered. Generating
function for the commuting flows of the averaged KdV hieararchy producing the
analytical solutions to the KdV-Whitham system is constructed.
