We investigate dynamo action in three-dimensional numerical simulations of
turbulent spherical Couette flows. Close to the onset of dynamo action, the
magnetic field exhibits an intermittent behavior, characterized by a series of
short bursts of the magnetic energy separated by low-energy phases. We show
that this behavior corresponds to the so-called on-off intermittency. This
behavior is here reported for dynamo action with realistic boundary conditions.
We investigate the role of magnetic boundary conditions in this phenomenon.
