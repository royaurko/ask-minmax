The popular conception is that data traffic nearly, if not already, exceeds
voice traffic on backbone networks. However, the results of research reported
in this paper imply that voice traffic greatly exceeds data traffic when real
users are asked to estimate their usage of a wide variety of media. Media usage
was surveyed for students in New York City and in Los Angeles. Other than
significant differences in radio listening, e-mails, and downloads, the usage
was quite similar. Telephone usage (wired and wireless) was nearly an hour per
day. When converted to bits, the telephone traffic was much greater than the
data traffic over the Internet. This paper reports on the details of the two
user studies. The traffic implications of the results are estimated. The
finding that voice exceeds data will then be reconciled with the popular
opposite conception.
