A model is presented that explains the `torsional oscillation' pattern of
deviations in the solar rotation rate as a geostrophic flow. The flow is driven
by temperature variations near the surface due to the enhanced emission of
radiation by the small scale magnetic field. The model explains the sign of the
flow, its amplitude and the fact that the maxima occur near the boundaries of
the main activity belts. The amplitude of the flow decreases with depth from
its maximum at the surface but penetrates over much of the depth of the
convection zone, in agreement with the data from helioseismology. It predicts
that the flow is axisymmetric only on average, and in reality consists of a
superposition of circulations around areas of enhanced magnetic activity. It
must be accompanied by a meridional flow component, which declines more rapidly
with depth.
