The optimal power flow (OPF) problem minimizes power system operating cost
subject to both engineering and network constraints. With the potential to find
global solutions, significant research interest has focused on convex
relaxations of the non-convex AC OPF problem. This paper investigates
``moment-based'' relaxations of the OPF problem developed from the theory of
polynomial optimization problems. At the cost of increased computational
requirements, moment-based relaxations are generally tighter than the
semidefinite relaxation employed in previous research, thus resulting in global
solutions for a broader class of OPF problems. Exploration of the feasible
space for test systems illustrates the effectiveness of the moment-based
relaxation.
