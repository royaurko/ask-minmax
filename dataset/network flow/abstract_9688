Consider the continuum of points along the edges of a network, i.e., a
connected, undirected graph with positive edge weights. We measure the distance
between these points in terms of the weighted shortest path distance, called
the network distance. Within this metric space, we study farthest points and
farthest distances. We introduce a data structure supporting queries for the
farthest distance and the farthest points on two-terminal series-parallel
networks. This data structure supports farthest-point queries in $O(k + \log
n)$ time after $O(n \log p)$ construction time, where $k$ is the number of
farthest points, $n$ is the size of the network, and $p$ parallel operations
are required to generate the network.
