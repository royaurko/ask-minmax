It is known that a unitary matrix can be decomposed into a product of
reflections, one for each dimension, and the Haar measure on the unitary group
pushes forward to independent uniform measures on the reflections. We consider
the sequence of unitary matrices given by successive products of random
reflections.
  In this coupling, we show that powers of the sequence of matrices converge in
a suitable sense to a flow of operators which acts on a random vector space.
The vector space has an explicit description as a subspace of the space of
sequences of complex numbers. The eigenvalues of the matrices converge almost
surely to the eigenvalues of the flow, which are distributed in law according
to a sine-kernel point process. The eigenvectors of the matrices converge
almost surely to vectors which are distributed in law as Gaussian random fields
on a countable set.
  This flow gives the first example of a random operator with a spectrum
distributed according to a sine-kernel point process which is naturally
constructed from finite dimensional random matrix theory.
