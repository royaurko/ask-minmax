Voice over IP (VOIP) has strict Quality of Service (QoS) constraints and
requires real-time packet delivery, which poses a major challenge to IP
networks. The Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) has been designed as a QoS-driven
protocol that addresses user-oriented QoS demands by adaptively routing packets
based on online sensing and measurement. This paper presents our design,
implementation and evaluation of a "Voice over CPN" system where an extension
of the CPN routing algorithm has been developed to support the needs of voice
packet delivery in the presence of other background traffic flows with the same
or different QoS requirements.
