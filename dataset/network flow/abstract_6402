In this paper we present a synthesis of the work performed on two inference
algorithms: the Pearl's belief propagation (BP) algorithm applied to Bayesian
networks without loops (i.e. polytree) and the Loopy belief propagation (LBP)
algorithm (inspired from the BP) which is applied to networks containing
undirected cycles. It is known that the BP algorithm, applied to Bayesian
networks with loops, gives incorrect numerical results i.e. incorrect posterior
probabilities. Murphy and al. [7] find that the LBP algorithm converges on
several networks and when this occurs, LBP gives a good approximation of the
exact posterior probabilities. However this algorithm presents an oscillatory
behaviour when it is applied to QMR (Quick Medical Reference) network [15].
This phenomenon prevents the LBP algorithm from converging towards a good
approximation of posterior probabilities. We believe that the translation of
the inference computation problem from the probabilistic framework to the
possibilistic framework will allow performance improvement of LBP algorithm. We
hope that an adaptation of this algorithm to a possibilistic causal network
will show an improvement of the convergence of LBP.
