We consider the problem of describing the possible spectra of an acoustic
operator with a periodic finite-gap density. We construct flows on the moduli
space of algebraic Riemann surfaces that preserve the periods of the
corresponding operator. By a suitable extension of the phase space, these
equations can be written with quadratic irrationalities.
