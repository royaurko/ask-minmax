The paper considers a class of multi-agent Markov decision processes (MDPs),
in which the network agents respond differently (as manifested by the
instantaneous one-stage random costs) to a global controlled state and the
control actions of a remote controller. The paper investigates a distributed
reinforcement learning setup with no prior information on the global state
transition and local agent cost statistics. Specifically, with the agents'
objective consisting of minimizing a network-averaged infinite horizon
discounted cost, the paper proposes a distributed version of $Q$-learning,
$\mathcal{QD}$-learning, in which the network agents collaborate by means of
local processing and mutual information exchange over a sparse (possibly
stochastic) communication network to achieve the network goal. Under the
assumption that each agent is only aware of its local online cost data and the
inter-agent communication network is \emph{weakly} connected, the proposed
distributed scheme is almost surely (a.s.) shown to yield asymptotically the
desired value function and the optimal stationary control policy at each
network agent. The analytical techniques developed in the paper to address the
mixed time-scale stochastic dynamics of the \emph{consensus + innovations}
form, which arise as a result of the proposed interactive distributed scheme,
are of independent interest.
