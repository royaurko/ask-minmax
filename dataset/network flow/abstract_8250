Recently it has been shown analytically that electric currents in a random
diode network are distributed in a multifractal manner [O. Stenull and H. K.
Janssen, Europhys. Lett. 55, 691 (2001)]. In the present work we investigate
the multifractal properties of a random diode network at the critical point by
numerical simulations. We analyze the currents running on a directed
percolation cluster and confirm the field-theoretic predictions for the scaling
behavior of moments of the current distribution. It is pointed out that a
random diode network is a particularly good candidate for a possible
experimental realization of directed percolation.
