Based on the modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations a detailed numerical
investigation for the complexity of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass is
worked out. The data suggest a scaling law which leads to a vanishing of the
complexity in the thermodynamic limit as proposed recently. The results for the
total number of stable states agree with existing approaches.
