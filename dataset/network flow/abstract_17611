We study $C^2$ extremal quasiconformal mappings in space and establish
necessary and sufficient conditions for a `localized' form of extremality in
the spirit of the work of G. Aronsson on absolutely minimizing Lipschitz
extensions. We also prove short time existence for smooth solutions of a
gradient flow of QC diffeomorphisms associated to the extremal problem.
