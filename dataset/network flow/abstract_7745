We consider the It\^o SDE with partially Sobolev coefficients. Under some
suitable conditions, we show the existence, uniqueness and stability of
generalized stochastic flows associated to such an equation. As an application,
we prove the weak differentiability of the stochastic flow generated by the
It\^o SDE with Sobolev coefficients.
