We propose and analyze a possible implementation of Maxwell's demon based on
a single-electron pump. We show that measurements of the charge states of the
pump and feedback control of the gate voltages lead to a net flow of electrons
against the bias voltage ideally with no work done on the system by the gate
control. The information obtained in the measurements converts thermal
fluctuations into free energy. We derive the conditions on the detector
back-action and measurement time necessary for implementing this conversion.
