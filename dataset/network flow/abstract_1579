We describe a criterion for particles suspended in a randomly moving fluid to
aggregate. Aggregation occurs when the expectation value of a random variable
is negative. This random variable evolves under a stochastic differential
equation. We analyse this equation in detail in the limit where the correlation
time of the velocity field of the fluid is very short, such that the stochastic
differential equation is a Langevin equation.
