We give a new upper bound for the smallest eigenvalues of the Dirac operator
on a Riemannian flow carrying transversal Killing spinors. We derive an
estimate on Sasakian and on 3-dimensional manifolds and partially classify
those satisfying the limiting case. Finally, we compare our estimate with a
lower bound in terms of a natural tensor depending on the eigenspinor.
