In spite of its tremendous value, metadata is generally sparse and
incomplete, thereby hampering the effectiveness of digital information
services. Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of
metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and
inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article
leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium
for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its
independence from content analysis, it can be applied to a wide variety of
resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The
proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and
co-occurrence algorithms first generate an associative network of repository
resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the
associative network as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich
resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form
spreading activation algorithm. This article discusses the general framework
for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata
through such networks, and the results of an experiment and validation of the
proposed method using a standard bibliographic dataset.
