Cognitive radio is being intensively researched for opportunistic access to
the so-called TV White Spaces (TVWS): large portions of the VHF/UHF TV bands
which become available on a geographical basis after the digital switchover.
Using accurate digital TV (DTV) coverage maps together with a database of DTV
transmitters, we develop a methodology for identifying TVWS frequencies at any
given location in the United Kingdom. We use our methodology to investigate
variations in TVWS as a function of the location and transmit power of
cognitive radios, and examine how constraints on adjacent channel interference
imposed by regulators may affect the results. Our analysis provides a realistic
view on the spectrum opportunity associated with cognitive devices, and
presents the first quantitative study of the availability and frequency
composition of TWVS outside the United States.
