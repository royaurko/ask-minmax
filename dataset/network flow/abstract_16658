This article analyses the properties of the Internal Behaviour network, an
action selection mechanism previously proposed by the contributors, with the aid of
a simulation developed for such ends. A brief review of the Internal Behaviour
network is followed by the explanation of the implementation of the simulation.
Then, experiments are presented and discussed analysing the properties of the
action selection in the proposed model.
