The comprehensive characterization of the structure of complex networks is
essential to understand the dynamical processes which guide their evolution.
The discovery of the scale-free distribution and the small world property of
real networks were fundamental to stimulate more realistic models and to
understand some dynamical processes such as network growth. However, properties
related to the network borders (nodes with degree equal to one), one of its
most fragile parts, remain little investigated and understood. The border nodes
may be involved in the evolution of structures such as geographical networks.
Here we analyze complex networks by looking for border trees, which are defined
as the subgraphs without cycles connected to the remainder of the network
(containing cycles) and terminating into border nodes. In addition to
describing an algorithm for identification of such tree subgraphs, we also
consider a series of their measurements, including their number of vertices,
number of leaves, and depth. We investigate the properties of border trees for
several theoretical models as well as real-world networks.
