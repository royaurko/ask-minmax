In this article the notion of metabolic turnover is revisited in the light of
recent results of out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. By means of Monte Carlo
methods we perform an exact uniform sampling of the steady state fluxes in a
genome scale metabolic network of E Coli from which we infer the metabolites
turnover times. However the latter are inferred from net fluxes, and we argue
that this approximation is not valid for enzymes working nearby thermodynamic
equilibrium. We recalculate turnover times from total fluxes by performing an
energy balance analysis of the network and recurring to the fluctuation
theorem. We find in many cases values one of order of magnitude lower, implying
a faster picture of intermediate metabolism.
