In the context of General Relativity, radiation, either gravitational or
electromagnetic, is closely associated to vorticity of observers world lines.
We stress in this letter that the factor that relates the two phenomena is a
circular flow of energy (electromagnetic) and/or superenergy on the planes
orthogonal to vorticity vector. We also stress the potential relevance of the
abovementioned relationship in experiments to detect gravitational radiation.
