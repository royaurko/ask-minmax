Constrained connection is the phenomenon that a reviewer can only review a
subset of products/services due to narrow range of interests or limited
attention capacity. In this work, we study how constrained connections can
affect estimation performance in online review systems (ORS). We find that
reviewers' constrained connections will cause poor estimation performance, both
from the measurements of estimation accuracy and Bayesian Cramer Rao lower
bound.
