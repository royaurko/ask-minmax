We introduce a geometric method for identifying the coupling direction
between two dynamical systems based on a bivariate extension of recurrence
network analysis. Global characteristics of the resulting inter-system
recurrence networks provide a correct discrimination for weakly coupled
R\"ossler oscillators not yet displaying generalised synchronisation.
Investigating two real-world palaeoclimate time series representing the
variability of the Asian monsoon over the last 10,000 years, we observe
indications for a considerable influence of the Indian summer monsoon on
climate in Eastern China rather than vice versa. The proposed approach can be
directly extended to studying $K>2$ coupled subsystems.
