In this paper, a pore-scale network modeling method, based on the flow
continuity residual in conjunction with a Newton-Raphson non-linear iterative
solving technique, is proposed and used to obtain the pressure and flow fields
in a network of interconnected distensible ducts representing, for instance,
blood vasculature or deformable porous media. A previously derived analytical
expression correlating boundary pressures to volumetric flow rate in compliant
tubes for a pressure-area constitutive elastic relation has been used to
represent the underlying flow model. Comparison to a preceding equivalent
method, the one-dimensional Navier-Stokes finite element, was made and the
results were analyzed. The advantages of the new method have been highlighted
and practical computational issues, related mainly to the rate and speed of
convergence, have been discussed.
