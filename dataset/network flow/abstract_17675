We construct, on continuous $Q_1$ finite elements over Cartesian meshes, an
interpolation operator that does not increase the total variation. The operator
is stable in $L^1$ and exhibits second order approximation properties. With the
help of it we provide improved error estimates for discrete minimizers of the
total variation denoising problem and for total variation flows.
