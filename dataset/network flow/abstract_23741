In this work we present a measurement study of user mobility in Second Life.
We first discuss different techniques to collect user traces and then focus on
results obtained using a crawler that we built. Tempted by the question whether
our methodology could provide similar results to those obtained in real-world
experiments, we study the statistical distribution of user contacts and show
that from a qualitative point of view user mobility in Second Life presents
similar traits to those of real humans. We further push our analysis to line of
sight networks that emerge from user interaction and show that they are highly
clustered. Lastly, we focus on the spatial properties of user movements and
observe that users in Second Life revolve around several point of interests
traveling in general short distances. Besides our findings, the traces
collected in this work can be very useful for trace-driven simulations of
communication schemes in delay tolerant networks and their performance
evaluation.
