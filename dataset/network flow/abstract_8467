The vertical handover decision is considered an NP-Hard problem. For that
reason, a large variety of vertical handoff algorithms (VHA) have been proposed
to help the user to select dynamically the best access network in terms of
quality of service (QoS). The objective of this paper is to provide a new
approach for evaluating of the vertical handoff algorithms in order to choose
the most appropriate algorithm which should be used to select the best access
network. Simulation results are presented to evaluate and to test our new
evaluation model
