We formulate a holographic description of effects of disorder in conformal
field theories based on the replica method and the AdS/CFT correspondence.
Starting with $n$ copies of conformal field theories, randomness with a
gaussian distribution is described by a deformation of double trace operators.
After computing physical quantities, we take the $n \to 0$ limit at the final
step. We compute correlation functions in the disordered systems by using the
holographic replica method as well as the formulation in the conformal field
theory. We find examples where disorder changes drastically the scaling of two
point functions. The renormalization group flow of the effective central charge
in our disordered systems is also discussed.
