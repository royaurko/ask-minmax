We show preliminary results for the performance of Network Coded TCP (CTCP)
over large latency networks. While CTCP performs very well in networks with
relatively short RTT, the slow-start mechanism currently employed does not
adequately fill the available bandwidth when the RTT is large. Regardless, we
show that CTCP still outperforms current TCP variants (i.e., Cubic TCP and
Hybla TCP) for high packet loss rates (e.g., >2.5%). We then explore the
possibility of a modified congestion control mechanism based off of H-TCP that
opens the congestion window quickly to overcome the challenges of large latency
networks. Preliminary results are provided that show the combination of network
coding with an appropriate congestion control algorithm can provide gains on
the order of 20 times that of existing TCP variants. Finally, we provide a
discussion of the future work needed to increase CTCP's performance in these
networks.
