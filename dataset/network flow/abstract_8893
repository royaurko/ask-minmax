The Navier-Stokes equations for compressible barotropic flow in the
stationary three dimensional case are considered. It is assumed that a fluid
occupies a bounded domain and satisfies the no-slip boundary condition. The
existence of a weak solution under the assumption that the adiabatic exponent
satisfies $\gamma>1$ is proved. These results cover the cases of monoatomic,
diatomic, and polyatomic gases.
