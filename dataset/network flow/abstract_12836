With the success of the Chandra and XMM missions and the maturation of
gravitational lensing techniques, powerful constraints on the orbital structure
of cluster dark matter halos are possible. I show that the X-ray emissivity and
mass of a galaxy cluster uniquely specify the anisotropy and velocity
dispersion profiles of its dark matter halo. I consider hydrostatic as well as
cooling flow scenarios, and apply the formalism to the lensing cluster
CL0024+16 and the cooling flow cluster Abell 2199. In both cases, the model
predicts a parameter-free velocity dispersion profile that is consistent with
independent optical redshift surveys of the clusters.
