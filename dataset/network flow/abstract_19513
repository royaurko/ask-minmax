We calculate the electrical currents through a superconductor - insulator -
superconductor junction which is also weakly coupled to a normal metal side
probe. The voltage $V$ applied to the normal metal terminal controls the
occupation of Andreev energy levels $E_n$, and therefore controls the Josephson
current flowing through these levels. Whenever the probe voltage crosses an
Andreev level, the Josephson current changes abruptly by an amount equal to the
current flowing through the Andreev level. The differential conductance along
the normal metal terminal permits spectroscopy of the Andreev levels. In a
short junction $(L \ll \xi_0)$, the critical current switches abruptly from the
Ambegaokar-Baratoff value to zero when the probe voltage is approximately equal
to the superconducting energy gap ($|eV| \simeq \Delta$). The magnitude of the
Josephson current switching in a long junction $(L \gg \xi_0)$, and the range
of probe voltages over which the Josephson current differs from its equilibrium
value, are much smaller than for three-terminal ballistic superconductor -
normal metal - superconductor junctions.
