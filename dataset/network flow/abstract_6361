One important issue implied by the finite nature of real-world networks
regards the identification of their more external (border) and internal nodes.
The present work proposes a formal and objective definition of these
properties, founded on the recently introduced concept of node diversity. It is
shown that this feature does not exhibit any relevant correlation with several
well-established complex networks measurements. A methodology for the
identification of the borders of complex networks is described and illustrated
with respect to theoretical (geographical and knitted networks) as well as
real-world networks (urban and word association networks), yielding interesting
results and insights in both cases.
