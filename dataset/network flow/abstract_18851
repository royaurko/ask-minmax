We consider the model of information diffusion in social networks from
\cite{Hui2010a} which incorporates trust (weighted links) between actors, and
allows actors to actively participate in the spreading process, specifically
through the ability to query friends for additional information. This model
captures how social agents transmit and act upon information more realistically
as compared to the simpler threshold and cascade models. However, it is more
difficult to analyze, in particular with respect to seeding strategies. We
present efficient, scalable algorithms for determining good seed sets --
initial nodes to inject with the information. Our general approach is to reduce
our model to a class of simpler models for which provably good sets can be
constructed. By tuning this class of simpler models, we obtain a good seed set
for the original more complex model. We call this the \emph{projected greedy
approach} because you `project' your model onto a class of simpler models where
a greedy seed set selection is near-optimal. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our seeding strategy on synthetic graphs as well as a realistic San Diego
evacuation network constructed during the 2007 fires.
