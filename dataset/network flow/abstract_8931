The flow of Ree-Eyring and Casson non-Newtonian fluids is investigated using
a variational principle to optimize the total stress. The
variationally-obtained solutions are compared to the analytical solutions
derived from the Weissenberg-Rabinowitsch-Mooney equation and the results are
found to be identical within acceptable numerical errors and modeling
approximations.
