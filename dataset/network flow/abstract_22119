Let $d$ be a positive integer, $\mathbb K$ an algebraically closed field of
characteristic 0 and $ X$ an elliptic curve defined over K. We study the
hyperelliptic curves equipped with a projection over $ X$, such that the
natural image of $ X$ in the Jacobian of the curve osculates to order $d$ to
the embedding of the curve, at a Weierstrass point. We construct
($d-1$)-dimensional families of such curves, of arbitrary big genus $g$,
obtaining, in particular, $(g+d-1)$-dimensional families of solutions of the
$KdV$ hierarchy, doubly periodic with respect to the $d$-th $KdV$ flow.
