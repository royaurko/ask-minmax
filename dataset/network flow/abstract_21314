In this paper, an improved secure address resolution protocol is presented
where ARP spoofing attack is prevented. The proposed methodology is a
centralised methodology for preventing ARP spoofing attack. In the proposed
model there is a central server on a network or subnet which prevents ARP
spoofing attack.
