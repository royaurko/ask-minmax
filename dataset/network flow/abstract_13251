We make an improved analysis on the flow of neutrinos originating from WIMP
annihilations inside the Sun and the Earth. We treat both neutrino interaction
and oscillation effects in a consistent framework. Our numerical simulations
are performed in an event based setting, which is useful for both theoretical
studies and for creating neutrino telescope Monte Carlos. We find that the flow
of muon-type neutrinos is enhanced or suppressed depending on the dominant WIMP
annihilation channel.
