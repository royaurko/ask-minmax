We study curvature pinching estimates of Ricci flow on complete 3-
dimensional manifolds without bounded curvature assumption. We will derive some
general curvature conditions which are preserved on any complete solution of
3-dim Ricci flow, these conditions include nonnegative Ricci curvature and
sectional curvature as special cases. A local version of Hamilton-Ivey
estimates is also obtained.
