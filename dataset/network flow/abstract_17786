We compute the Yamabe invariants for a new infinite class of closed
$4$-dimensional manifolds by using a "twisted" version of the Seiberg-Witten
equations, the $\mathrm{Pin}^-(2)$-monopole equations. The same technique also
provides a new obstruction to the existence of Einstein metrics or long-time
solutions of the normalised Ricci flow with uniformly bounded scalar curvature.
