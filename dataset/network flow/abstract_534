In this paper, we study the wireline two-unicast-Z communication network over
directed acyclic graphs. The two-unicast-Z network is a two-unicast network
where the destination intending to decode the second message has apriori side
information of the first message. We make three contributions in this paper:
  1. We describe a new linear network coding algorithm for two-unicast-Z
networks over directed acyclic graphs. Our approach includes the idea of
interference alignment as one of its key ingredients. For graphs of a bounded
degree, our algorithm has linear complexity in terms of the number of vertices,
and polynomial complexity in terms of the number of edges.
  2. We prove that our algorithm achieves the rate-pair (1, 1) whenever it is
feasible in the network. Our proof serves as an alternative, albeit restricted
to two-unicast-Z networks over directed acyclic graphs, to an earlier result of
Wang et al. which studied necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility
of the rate pair (1, 1) in two-unicast networks.
  3. We provide a new proof of the classical max-flow min-cut theorem for
directed acyclic graphs.
