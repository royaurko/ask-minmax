We present the results of a velocity correlation study of the high latitude
cloud MBM16 using a fully sampled $^{12}$CO map, supplemented by new $^{13}$CO
data. We find a correlation length of 0.4 pc. This is similar in size to the
formaldehyde clumps described in our previous study. We associate this
correlated motion with coherent structures within the turbulent flow. Such
structures are generated by free shear flows. Their presence in this non-star
forming cloud indicates that kinetic energy is being supplied to the internal
turbulence by an external shear flow. Such large scale driving over long times
is a possible solution to the dissipation problem for molecular cloud
turbulence.
