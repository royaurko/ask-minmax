Extreme events taking place on networks are not uncommon. We show that it is
possible to manipulate the extreme events occurrence probabilities and its
distribution over the nodes on scale-free networks by tuning the nodal
capacity. This can be used to reduce the number of extreme events occurrences
on a network. However monotonic nodal capacity enhancements, beyond a point, do
not lead to any substantial reduction in the number of extreme events. We point
out the practical implication of this result for network design in the context
of reducing extreme events occurrences.
