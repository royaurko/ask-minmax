An infinite regular three-dimensional network is composed of identical
resistors each of resistance joining adjacent nodes. What is the equivalent
resistance between the lattice site and the lattice site, when two bonds are
removed from the perfect network? Three cases are considered here, and some
numerical values are calculated. Finally, the asymptotic behavior of the
equivalent resistance is studied for large distances between the two sites.
