Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (HWSNET) are more suitable for real
life applications as compared to the homogeneous counterpart. Security of
HWSNET becomes a very important issue with the rapid development of HWSNET.
Intrusion detection system is one of the major and efficient defensive methods
against attacks in HWSNET. Because of different constraints of sensor networks,
security solutions have to be designed with limited usage of computation and
resources. A particularly devastating attack is the sleep deprivation attack.
Here a malicious node forces legitimate nodes to waste their energy by
resisting the sensor nodes from going into low power sleep mode. The target of
this attack is to maximize the power consumption of the affected node, thereby
decreasing its battery life. Existing works on sleep deprivation attack have
mainly focused on mitigation using MAC based protocols, such as S-MAC (sensor
MAC), T-MAC (timeout MAC), B-MAC (Berkley MAC), G-MAC (gateway MAC). In this
article, a brief review of some of the recent intrusion detection systems in
wireless sensor network environment is presented. Finally, a framework of
cluster based layered countermeasure for Insomnia Detection has been proposed
for heterogeneous wireless sensor network (HWSNET) to efficiently detect sleep
deprivation attack. Simulation results on MATLAB exhibit the effectiveness of
the proposed model.
