We study the topological dynamics of the action of the diagonal subgroup on
quotients Gamma\PSL(2,R)*PSL(2,R), where Gamma is an irreducible lattice.
Closed orbits are described and a set of points of dense orbit is explicitly
given. Such properties are expressed using the Furstenberg boundary of the
symmetric space H*H.
