Ti-O nanoparticles have been synthesized via hollow cathode sputtering in an
Ar-O2 atmosphere using high power pulsing. It is shown that the stoichiometry
and the size of the nanoparticles can be varied independently, the former
through controlling the O2 gas flow and the latter by the independent biasing
of two separate anodes in the growth zone. Nanoparticles with diameters in the
range of 25 to 75 nm, and with different Ti-O compositions and crystalline
phases, have been synthesized.
