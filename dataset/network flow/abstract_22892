We study a class of two-dimensional ${\cal N}=(0, 4)$ quiver gauge theories
that flow to superconformal field theories. We find dualities for the
superconformal field theories similar to the 4d ${\cal N}=2$ theories of class
${\cal S}$, labelled by a Riemann surface ${\cal C}$. The dual descriptions
arise from various pair-of-pants decompositions, that involves an analog of the
$T_N$ theory. Especially, we find the superconformal index of such theories can
be written in terms of a topological field theory on ${\cal C}$. We interpret
this class of SCFTs as the ones coming from compactifying 6d ${\cal N}=(2, 0)$
theory on $\mathbb{CP}^1 \times {\cal C}$
