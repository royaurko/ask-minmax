We study the influence of diffusion on the scaling properties of the first
order structure function, S_1, of a two-dimensional chaotically advected
passive scalar with finite lifetime, i.e., with a decaying term in its
evolution equation. We obtain an analytical expression for S_1 where the
dependence on the diffusivity, the decaying coefficient and the stirring due to
the chaotic flow is explicitly stated.
  We show that the presence of diffusion introduces a crossover length-scale,
the diffusion scale (L_d), such that the scaling behaviour for the structure
function is analytical for length-scales shorter than L_d, and shows a scaling
exponent that depends on the decaying term and the mixing of the flow for
larger scales. Therefore, the scaling exponents for scales larger than L_d are
not modified with respect to those calculated in the zero diffusion limit.
Moreover, L_d turns out to be independent of the decaying coeficient, being its
value the same as for the passive scalar with infinite lifetime.
  Numerical results support our theoretical findings.
