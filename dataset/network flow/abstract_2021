Using molecular dynamics simulation, we calculate the distribution of atomic
jum ps in Cu$_{33}$Zr$_{67}$ in the liquid and glassy states. In both states
the distribution of jump lengths can be described by a temperature independent
exponential of the length and an effective activation energy plus a
contribution of elastic displacements at short distances. Upon cooling the
contribution of shorter jumps dominates. No indication of an enhanced
probability to jump over a nearest neighbor distance was found. We find a
smooth transition from flow in the liquid to jumps in the g lass. The
correlation factor of the diffusion constant decreases with decreasing
temperature, causing a drop of diffusion below the Arrhenius value, despite an
apparent Arrhenius law for the jump probability.
