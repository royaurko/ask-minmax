It is found theoretically based on the Ginzburg-Landau framework that p-wave
superfluids of neutral atom gases in three dimension harmonic traps exhibit
spontaneous mass current at rest, whose direction depends on trap geometry.
Under rotation various types of the order parameter textures are stabilized,
including Mermin-Ho and Anderson-Toulouse-Chechetkin vortices. In a cigar shape
trap spontaneous current flows longitudial to the rotation axis and thus
perpendicular to the ordinary rotational current. These features, spontaneous
mass current at rest and texture formation, can be used as diagnoses for p-wave
superfluidity.
