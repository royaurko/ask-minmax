The Internet Threat Monitoring (ITM),is a globally scoped Internet monitoring
system whose goal is to measure, detect, characterize, and track threats such
as distribute denial of service(DDoS) attacks and worms. To block the
monitoring system in the internet the attackers are targeted the ITM system. In
this paper we address flooding attack against ITM system in which the attacker
attempt to exhaust the network and ITM's resources, such as network bandwidth,
computing power, or operating system data structures by sending the malicious
traffic. We propose an information-theoretic frame work that models the
flooding attacks using Botnet on ITM. Based on this model we generalize the
flooding attacks and propose an effective attack detection using Honeypots.
