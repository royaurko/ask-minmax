This paper aims to identify whether different weighted PageRank algorithms
can be applied to contributor citation networks to measure the popularity and
prestige of a scholar from a citation perspective. Information Retrieval (IR)
was selected as a test field and data from 1956-2008 were collected from Web of
Science (WOS). Weighted PageRank with citation and publication as weighted
vectors were calculated on contributor citation networks. The results indicate that
both popularity rank and prestige rank were highly correlated with the weighted
PageRank. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to detect
relationships among these different measures. For capturing prize winners
within the IR field, prestige rank outperformed all the other measures.
