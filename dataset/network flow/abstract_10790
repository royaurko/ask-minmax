The flow behaviors of polymer melt composed of short chains with ten beads
between parallel plates are simulated by using a hybrid method of molecular
dynamics and computational fluid dynamics. Three problems are solved: creep
motion under a constant shear stress and its recovery motion after removing the
stress, pressure-driven flows, and the flows in rapidly oscillating plates. In
the creep/recovery problem, the delayed elastic deformation in the creep motion
and evident elastic behavior in the recovery motion are demonstrated. The
velocity profiles of the melt in pressure-driven flows are quite different from
those of Newtonian fluid due to shear thinning. Velocity gradients of the melt
become steeper near the plates and flatter at the middle between the plates as
the pressure gradient increases and the temperature decreases. In the rapidly
oscillating plates, the viscous boundary layer of the melt is much thinner than
that of Newtonian fluid due to the shear thinning of the melt. Three different
rheological regimes, i.e., the viscous fluid, visco-elastic liquid, and
visco-elastic solid regimes, form over the oscillating plate according to the
local Deborah numbers. The melt behaves as a viscous fluid in a region for
$\omega\tau^R\lesssim 1$, and the crossover between the liquid-like and
solid-like regime takes place around $\omega\tau^\alpha\simeq 1$ (where
$\omega$ is the angular frequency of the plate and $\tau^R$ and $\tau^\alpha$
are Rouse and $\alpha$ relaxation time, respectively).
