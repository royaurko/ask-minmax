A thermal flow sensor has been realised consisting of freely-suspended
silicon-rich silicon-nitride microchannels with an integrated Al/poly-Si++
thermopile in combination with up- and downstream Al heater resistors. The
inherently zero offset of the thermopile is exploited in a feedback loop
controlling the dissipated power in the heater resistors, eliminating
inevitable influences of resistance drift and mismatch of the thin-film metal
resistors. The control system cancels the flow-induced temperature difference
across the thermopile by controlling a power difference between both heater
resistors, thereby giving a measure for the flow rate. The flow sensor was
characterised for power difference versus water flow rates up to 1.5 ul/min,
being in good agreement with a thermal model of the sensor, and the correct
low-drift operation of the temperature-balancing control system has been
verified.
