Network science have constantly been in the focus of research for the last
decade, with considerable advances in the controllability of their structural.
However, much less effort has been devoted to study that how to improve the
controllability of complex networks. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed
to improve the controllability of complex networks by rewiring links regularly
which transforms the network structure. Then it is demonstrated that our
algorithm is very effective after numerical simulation experiment on typical
network models (Erd\"os-R\'enyi and scale-free network). We find that our
algorithm is mainly determined by the average degree and positive correlation
of in-degree and out-degree of network and it has nothing to do with the
network size. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss the correlation between
controllability of complex networks and degree distribution index: power-law
exponent and heterogeneity
