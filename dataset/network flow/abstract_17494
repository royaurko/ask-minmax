Ultrasound-driven microbubbles rectify oscillatory motion into strong steady
streaming flow [1, 2]. In this fluid dynamics video, we show size-dependent
trapping, focusing and sorting of microparticles, utilizing the interaction
between bubble streaming and the induced streaming around the mobile particles.
This mechanism is purely passive and is selective for sizes and size
differentials far smaller than any scale imposed by the device geometry.
