We consider the linear stability of dissipative MHD Taylor-Couette flow with
imposed toroidal magnetic fields. The inner and outer cylinders can be either
insulating or conducting; the inner one rotates, the outer one is stationary.
The magnetic Prandtl number can be as small as 10-5, approaching realistic
liquid-metal values. The magnetic field destabilizes the flow, except for
radial profiles of B$_\phi$(R) close to the current-free solution. The profile
with B$_{in}$=B$_{out}$ (the most uniform field) is considered in detail. For
weak fields the TC-flow is stabilized, until for moderately strong fields the
m=1 azimuthal mode dramatically destabilizes the flow again. There is thus a
maximum value for the critical Reynolds number. For sufficiently strong fields
(as measured by the Hartmann number) the toroidal field is always unstable,
even for Re=0.
  The electric currents needed to generate the required toroidal fields in
laboratory experiments are a few kA if liquid sodium is used, somewhat more if
gallium is used. Weaker currents are needed for wider gaps, so a wide-gap
apparatus could succeed even with gallium. The critical Reynolds numbers are
only somewhat larger than the nonmagnetic values, so such an experiment would
require only modest rotation rates.
