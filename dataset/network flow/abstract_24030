Understanding the structure and evolution of web-based user-object networks
is a significant task since they play a crucial role in e-commerce nowadays.
This Letter reports the empirical analysis on two large-scale web sites,
audioscrobbler.com and del.icio.us, where users are connected with music groups
and bookmarks, respectively. The degree distributions and degree-degree
correlations for both users and objects are reported. We propose a new index,
named collaborative clustering coefficient, to quantify the clustering behavior
based on the collaborative selection. Accordingly, the clustering properties
and clustering-degree correlations are investigated. We report some novel
phenomena well characterizing the selection mechanism of web users and outline
the relevance of these phenomena to the information recommendation problem.
