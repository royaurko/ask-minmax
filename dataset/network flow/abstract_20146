The two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are rewritten as a system of
coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations. These equations describe the
evolution of the moments of an expansion of the vorticity with respect to
Hermite functions and of the centers of vorticity concentrations. We prove the
convergence of this expansion and show that in the zero viscosity and zero core
size limit we formally recover the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff model for the evolution
of point-vortices. The present expansion systematically incorporates the
effects of both viscosity and finite vortex core size. We also show that a
low-order truncation of our expansion leads to the representation of the flow
as a system of interacting Gaussian (i.e. Oseen) vortices which previous
experimental work has shown to be an accurate approximation to many important
physical flows [9].
