Force-directed algorithms such as the Kamada-Kawai algorithm have shown
promising results for solving the boundary detection problem in a mobile ad hoc
network. However, the classical Kamada-Kawai algorithm does not scale well when
it is used in networks with large numbers of nodes. It also produces poor
results in non-convex networks. To address these problems, this paper proposes
an improved version of the Kamada-Kawai algorithm. The proposed extension
includes novel heuristics and algorithms that achieve a faster energy level
reduction. Our experimental results show that the improved algorithm can
significantly shorten the processing time and detect boundary nodes with an
acceptable level of accuracy.
