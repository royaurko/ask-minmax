The small gain condition is sufficient for input-to-state stability (ISS) of
interconnected systems. However, verification of the small gain condition
requires large amount of computations in the case of a large size of the
system. To facilitate this procedure we aggregate the subsystems and the gains
between the subsystems that belong to certain interconnection patterns (motifs)
using three heuristic rules. These rules are based on three motifs:
sequentially connected nodes, nodes connected in parallel and almost
disconnected subgraphs. Aggregation of these motifs keeps the main structure of
the mutual influences between the subsystems in the network. Furthermore,
fulfillment of the reduced small gain condition implies ISS of the large
network. Thus such reduction allows to decrease the number of computations
needed to verify the small gain condition. Finally, an ISS-Lyapunov function
for the large network can be constructed using the reduced small gain
condition. Applications of these rules is illustrated on an example.
