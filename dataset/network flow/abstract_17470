We revisit the persistent flow of a superfluid in a thin wavy-rough annulus.
The existence of a phase memory around this thin corrugated annulus is shown to
be responsible for the energy minima with a periodic dependence on the total
momentum which is directly related to the quantization of circulation. We also
illustrate the general features using the ideal Bose gas as an example.
