First, we consider galaxy formation from the viewpoint of hierarchical
clustering theory and discuss the possibility that inhomogeneous models with a
local void may be compatible with the observed homogeneity of galactic
distributions found by recent redshift surveys, because their inhomogeneity can
be weakened by the difference in the feedback system of galaxy formation
between the inner and outer regions. Next, it is shown with the results of
numerical simulations that the observed inhomogeneity of two-point correlations
of galaxies can be accounted for by these models. Also, the natural appearance
of bulk flows for an off-central observer is shown. Finally the inhomogeneity
of baryon contents is discussed from the viewpoint of our inhomogeneous models.
