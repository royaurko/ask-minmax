We describe a simple adaptive network of coupled chaotic maps. The network
reaches a stationary state (frozen topology) for all values of the coupling
parameter, although the dynamics of the maps at the nodes of the network can be
non-trivial. The structure of the network shows interesting hierarchical
properties and in certain parameter regions the dynamics is polysynchronous:
nodes can be divided in differently synchronized classes but contrary to
cluster synchronization, nodes in the same class need not be connected to each
other. These complicated synchrony patterns have been conjectured to play roles
in systems biology and circuits. The adaptive system we study describes ways
whereby this behaviour can evolve from undifferentiated nodes.
