The Gauss-Manin connection for nonabelian cohomology spaces is the
isomonodromy flow. We write down explicitly the vector fields of the
isomonodromy flow and calculate its induced vector fields on the associated
graded space of the nonabelian Hogde filtration. The result turns out to be
intimately related to the quadratic part of the Hitchin map.
