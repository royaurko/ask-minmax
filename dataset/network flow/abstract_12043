The existence of spontaneous magnetization of Ising spins on directed
Barabasi-Albert networks is investigated with seven neighbors, by using Monte
Carlo simulations. In large systems we see the magnetization for different
temperatures T to decay after a characteristic time tau, which is extrapolated
to diverge at zero temperature.
