In this paper, we consider three problems related to survival, growth, and
goal reaching maximization of an investment portfolio with proportional net
cash flow. We solve the problems in a market constrained due to borrowing
prohibition. To solve the problems, we first construct an auxiliary market and
then apply the dynamic programming approach. Via our solutions, an alternative
approach is introduced in order to solve the problems defined under an
auxiliary market.
