The set of the fixed points of the Hopfield type network is under
investigation. The connection matrix of the network is constructed according
the Hebb rule from the set of memorized patterns which are treated as distorted
copies of the standard-vector. It is found that the dependence of the set of
the fixed points on the value of the distortion parameter can be described
analytically. The obtained results are interpreted in the terms of neural
networks and the Ising model at T=0.
