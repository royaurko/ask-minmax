The role of polymers additives on the turbulent convective flow of a
Rayleigh--Taylor system is investigated by means of direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of Oldroyd-B viscoelastic model. The dynamics of polymers
elongation follow adiabatically the self-similar evolution of the turbulent
mixing layer, and shows the appearance of a strong feedback on the flow which
originate a cut off for polymer elongations. The viscoelastic effects on the
mixing properties of the flow are twofold. Mixing is appreciably enhanced at
large scales (the mixing layer growth-rate is larger than that of the purely
Newtonian case) and depleted at small scales (thermal plumes are more coherent
with respect to the Newtonian case). The observed speed up of the thermal
plumes, together with an increase of the correlations between temperature field
and vertical velocity, contributes to a significant {\it enhancement of heat
transport}. Our findings are consistent with a scenario of {\it drag reduction}
between falling and rising plumes induced by polymers, and provide further
evidence of the occurrence of drag reduction in absence of boundary layers. A
weakly non-linear model proposed by Fermi for the growth of the mixing layer is
reported in the Appendix.
