Easy access and vast amount of data, especially from long period of time,
allows to divide social network into timeframes and create temporal social
network. Such network enables to analyse its dynamics. One aspect of the
dynamics is analysis of social communities evolution, i.e., how particular
group changes over time. To do so, the complete group evolution history is
needed. That is why in this paper the new method for group evolution extraction
called GED is presented.
