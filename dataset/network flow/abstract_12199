Regenerating codes are a class of codes for distributed storage networks that
provide reliability and availability of data, and also perform efficient node
repair. Another important aspect of a distributed storage network is its
security. In this paper, we consider a threat model where an eavesdropper may
gain access to the data stored in a subset of the storage nodes, and possibly
also, to the data downloaded during repair of some nodes. We provide explicit
constructions of regenerating codes that achieve information-theoretic secrecy
capacity in this setting.
