Most methods proposed to uncover communities in complex networks rely on
their structural properties. Here we introduce the stability of a network
partition, a measure of its quality defined in terms of the statistical
properties of a dynamical process taking place on the graph. The time-scale of
the process acts as an intrinsic parameter that uncovers community structures
at different resolutions. The stability extends and unifies standard notions
for community detection: modularity and spectral partitioning can be seen as
limiting cases of our dynamic measure. Similarly, recently proposed
multi-resolution methods correspond to linearisations of the stability at short
times. The connection between community detection and Laplacian dynamics
enables us to establish dynamically motivated stability measures linked to
distinct null models. We apply our method to find multi-scale partitions for
different networks and show that the stability can be computed efficiently for
large networks with extended versions of current algorithms.
