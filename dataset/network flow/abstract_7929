In this paper, the linear flutter characteristics of laminated composite flat
panels immersed in a supersonic flow is investigated using field consistent
elements within the framework of unified formulation. The influence of the
aerodynamic damping on the supersonic flutter characteristics of flat composite
panels is also investigated. The aerodynamic force is evaluated using
two-dimensional static aerodynamic approximation for high supersonic flow.
Numerical results are presented for laminated composites that bring out the
influence of the flow angle, the boundary conditions, the plate thickness and
the plate aspect ratio on the flutter characteristics.
