Elliptic flow from nuclear collisions is a hadronic observable sensitive to
the early stages of system evolution. We report first results on elliptic flow
of charged particles at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=130 GeV
using the STAR TPC at RHIC. The elliptic flow signal, v_2, averaged over
transverse momentum, reaches values of about 6% for relatively peripheral
collisions and decreases for the more central collisions. This can be
interpreted as the observation of a higher degree of thermalization than at
lower collision energies. Pseudorapidity and transverse momentum dependence of
elliptic flow are also presented.
