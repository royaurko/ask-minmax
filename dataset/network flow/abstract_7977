We present a fundamentally different approach to orthogonal layout of data
flow diagrams with ports. This is based on extending constrained stress
majorization to cater for ports and flow layout. Because we are minimizing
stress we are able to better display global structure, as measured by several
criteria such as stress, edge-length variance, and aspect ratio. Compared to
the layered approach, our layouts tend to exhibit symmetries, and eliminate
inter-layer whitespace, making the diagrams more compact.
