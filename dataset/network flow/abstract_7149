In many networks such as transportation or communication networks, distance
is certainly a relevant parameter. In addition, real-world examples suggest
that when long-range links are existing, they usually connect to hubs-the well
connected nodes. We analyze a simple model which combine both these
ingredients--preferential attachment and distance selection characterized by a
typical finite `interaction range'. We study the crossover from the scale-free
to the `spatial' network as the interaction range decreases and we propose
scaling forms for different quantities describing the network. In particular,
when the distance effect is important (i) the connectivity distribution has a
cut-off depending on the node density, (ii) the clustering coefficient is very
high, and (iii) we observe a positive maximum in the degree correlation
(assortativity) which numerical value is in agreement with empirical
measurements. Finally, we show that if the number of nodes is fixed, the
optimal network which minimizes both the total length and the diameter lies in
between the scale-free and spatial networks. This phenomenon could play an
important role in the formation of networks and could be an explanation for the
high clustering and the positive assortativity which are non trivial features
observed in many real-world examples.
