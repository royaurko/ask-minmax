We study the shape differentiability of a cost function for the flow of an
incompressible viscous fluid of power-law type. The fluid is confined to a
bounded planar domain surrounding an obstacle. For smooth perturbations of the
shape of the obstacle we express the shape gradient of the cost function which
can be subsequently used to improve the initial design.
