We incorporate hydrodynamic interactions in a structure-based model of
ubiquitin and demonstrate that the hydrodynamic coupling may reduce the peak
force when stretching the protein at constant speed, especially at larger
speeds. Hydrodynamic interactions are also shown to facilitate unfolding at
constant force and inhibit stretching by fluid flows.
