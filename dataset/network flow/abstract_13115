A signed measure analysis of two-dimensional intermittent magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence is presented. This kind of analysis is performed to characterize the
scaling behavior of the sign-oscillating flow structures, and their geometrical
properties. In particular, it is observed that cancellations between positive
and negative contributions of the field inside structures, are inhibited for
scales smaller than the Taylor microscale, and stop near the dissipative scale.
Moreover, from a simple geometrical argument, the relationship between the
cancellation exponent and the typical fractal dimension of the structures in
the flow is obtained.
