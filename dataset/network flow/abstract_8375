We analyze gene expression time-series data of yeast S. cerevisiae measured
along two full cell-cycles. We quantify these data by using q-exponentials,
gene expression ranking and a temporal mean-variance analysis. We construct
gene interaction networks based on correlation coefficients and study the
formation of the corresponding giant components and minimum spanning trees. By
coloring genes according to their cell function we find functional clusters in
the correlation networks and functional branches in the associated trees. Our
results suggest that a percolation point of functional clusters can be
identified on these gene expression correlation networks.
