Using a fluid model, the plasma densities, electron temperature and ion Mach
number in front of a powered electrode in different plasma discharges is
computed. The dust charge is computed using OML theory for Maxwellian electrons
and ions distributed according to a shifted-Maxwellian. By assuming force
balance between gravity and the electrostatic force, the dust levitation height
is obtained. The importance of the dust charge variation is investigated.
