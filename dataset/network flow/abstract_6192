Laboratory experiments point out the existence of patterns made of
alternately laminar and turbulent oblique bands in plane Couette flow in its
way to/from turbulence as the Reynolds number R is varied. Many previous
theoretical and numerical works on the problem have considered small
aspect-ratio systems subjected to periodic boundary conditions, while
experiments correspond to the opposite limit of large aspect-ratio. Here, by
means of fully resolved direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes
equations at decreasing R, we scrutinize the transition from temporal to
spatiotemporal behavior in systems of intermediate sizes. We show that there
exists a streamwise crossover size of order L_x~70-80h (where 2h is the gap
between the plates driving the flow) beyond which the transition to/from
turbulence in PCF is undoubtedly a spatiotemporal process, with typical
scenario `[turbulent flow]->[riddled regime]->[oblique pattern]->[laminar
flow]', whereas below that size it is more a temporal process describable in
terms of finite-dimensional dynamical systems with scenario `[chaotic
flow]->[laminar flow]' (via chaotic transients). In the crossover region, the
`[oblique pattern]' stage is skipped, which leads us to suggest that an
appropriate rendering of the patterns observed in experiments needs a faithful
account of streamwise correlations at scales at least of the order of that
crossover size.
