We construct RG flow solutions interpolating AdS and Schrodinger geometries
in Abelian Higgs models obtained from consistent reductions of type IIB
supergravity and M-theory. We find that z=2 Schrodinger geometries can be
realized at the minima of scalar potentials of these models, where a scalar
charged under U(1) gauge symmetry obtains a nonzero vacuum expectation value.
The RG flows are induced by an operator deformation of the dual CFT. The flows
are captured by fake superpotentials of the theories.
