We report on an effort to study the connections between dynamics in simulated
radio galaxy plasma flows and the properties of nonthermal electron populations
carried in those flows. To do this we have introduced a new numerical scheme
for electron transport that allows a much more detailed look at this problem
than has been possible before. Especially when the dynamics is fully three
dimensional the flows are generally chaotic in the cocoon, and the jet itself
can flail about violently. The bending jet can pinch itself off and redirect
itself to enhance its penetration of the ambient medium. These behaviors often
eliminate the presence of a strong jet termination shock, which is assumed
present in all modern cartoon models of the RG phenomenon. Instead a much more
complex ``shock web'' forms near the end of the jet that leads to a far less
predictable pattern of particle acceleration. Similarly, the magnetic fields in
these flows are highly filamented, as well as spatially and temporally
intermittent. This leads to a very localized and complex pattern of synchrotron
aging for relativistic electron populations, which makes it difficult to use
properties of the electron spectrum to infer the local rate of aging.
