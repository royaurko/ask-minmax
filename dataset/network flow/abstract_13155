Azimuthal anisotropy ($v_2$) and two-particle angular correlations of high
$p_T$ charged hadrons have been measured in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=130 GeV for transverse momenta up to 6 GeV/c, where hard
processes are expected to contribute significantly. The two-particle angular
correlations exhibit elliptic flow and a structure suggestive of fragmentation
of high $p_T$ partons. The monotonic rise of $v_2(p_T)$ for $p_T<2$ GeV/c is
consistent with collective hydrodynamical flow calculations. At $\pT>3$ GeV/c a
saturation of $v_2$ is observed which persists up to $p_T=6$ GeV/c.
