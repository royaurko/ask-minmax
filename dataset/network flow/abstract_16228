Motivated by rolling adhesion of white blood cells in the vasculature, we
study how cells move in linear shear flow above a wall to which they can adhere
via specific receptor-ligand bonds. Our computer simulations are based on a
Langevin equation accounting for hydrodynamic interactions, thermal
fluctuations and adhesive interactions. In contrast to earlier approaches, our
model not only includes stochastic rules for the formation and rupture of
bonds, but also fully resolves both receptor and ligand positions. We identify
five different dynamic states of motion in regard to the translational and
angular velocities of the cell. The transitions between the different states
are mapped out in a dynamic state diagram as a function of the rates for bond
formation and rupture. For example, as the cell starts to adhere under the
action of bonds, its translational and angular velocities become synchronized
and the dynamic state changes from slipping to rolling. We also investigate the
effect of non-molecular parameters. In particular, we find that an increase in
viscosity of the medium leads to a characteristic expansion of the region of
stable rolling to the expense of the region of firm adhesion, but not to the
expense of the regions of free or transient motion. Our results can be used in
an inverse approach to determine single bond parameters from flow chamber data
on rolling adhesion.
