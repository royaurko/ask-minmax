In this paper we demonstrate the rate gains achieved by two-tier
heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) with varying degrees of coordination
between macrocell and microcell base stations (BSs). We show that without the
presence of coordination, network densification does not provide any gain in
the sum rate and rapidly decreases the mean per-user
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR). Our results show that
coordination reduces the rate of SINR decay with increasing numbers of
microcell BSs in the system. Validity of the analytically approximated mean
per-user SINR over a wide range of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is demonstrated
via comparison with the simulated results.
