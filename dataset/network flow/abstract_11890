In many real-world complex systems, the time-evolution of the network's
structure and the dynamic state of its nodes are closely entangled. Here, we
study opinion formation and imitation on an adaptive complex network which is
dependent on the individual dynamic state of each node and vice versa to model
the co-evolution of renewable resources with the dynamics of harvesting agents
on a social network. The adaptive voter model is coupled to a set of identical
logistic growth models and we show that in such systems, the rate of
interactions between nodes as well as the adaptive rewiring probability play a
crucial role for the sustainability of the system's equilibrium state. We
derive a macroscopic description of the system which provides a general
framework to model and quantify the influence of single node dynamics on the
macroscopic state of the network and is applicable to many fields of study,
such as epidemic spreading or social modeling.
