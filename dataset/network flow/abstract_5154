Outflows and convective motions in accretion flows have been intensively
discussed recently in the context of advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF)
based on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical
simulations. We, however, point that without proper treatments of the disk
magnetic fields, a major source of viscosity, one can never derive general,
firm conclusions concerning the occurrence of outflows and convection. We
analyzed the 3D MHD numerical simulation data of magnetized accretion flows
initially threaded by weak toroidal magnetic fields, finding large-scale
convective motions dominating near the black hole. In contrast, outflows occur
only temporarily and are not very significant in our simulations. If there grow
strong vertical fields somehow, however, formation of bi-polar jets is
inevitable. It is claimed that radiation could be dominant at the outermost
zones of the convective disks because of outward energy flow by convection,
however, this is no longer the case in convective MHD flows, since accretion
energy can be released via magnetic reconnection in the inner parts. Such
reconnection leads to sporadic flare events, thus producing substantial
variability in out-going radiation.
