We propose a method of generating different scale-free networks, which has
several input parameters in order to adjust the structure, so that they can
serve as a basis for computer simulation of real-world phenomena. The
topological structure of these networks was studied to determine what kind of
networks can be produced and how can we give the appropriate values of
parameters to get a desired structure.
