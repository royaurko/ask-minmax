With exponential increase in the volumes of video traffic in cellular
net-works, there is an increasing need for optimizing the quality of video
delivery. 4G networks (Long Term Evolution Advanced or LTE A) are being
introduced in many countries worldwide, which allow a downlink speed of upto 1
Gbps and uplink of 100 Mbps over a single base station. This makes a strong
push towards video broadcasting over LTE networks, characterizing its
performance and developing metrics which can be deployed to provide user
feedback of video quality and feed-back them to network operators to fine tune
the network. In this paper, we characterize the performance of video
transmission over LTE A physical layer using popular video quality metrics such
as SSIM, Blocking, Blurring, NIQE and BRISQUE. We conduct experiments to find a
suitable no-reference metrics for mobile scenario and find that Blocking
Metrics is most promising in case of channel or modulation variations but it
does not perform well to quantize variations in compression ratios. The metrics
BRISQUE is very efficient in quantizing this distortion and performs well in
case of network variations also.
