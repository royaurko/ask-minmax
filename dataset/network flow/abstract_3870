This paper elaborates about the potential risk of systemic instabilities in
future networks and proposes a methodology to mitigate it. The starting concept
is modeling the network as a complex environment (e.g. ecosystem) of resources
and associated functional controllers in a continuous and dynamic game of
cooperation - competition. Methodology foresees defining and associating
utility functions to these controllers and elaborating a global utility
function (as a function of the controllers' utility functions) for the overall
network. It is conjectured that the optimization of the global utility function
ensures network stability and security evaluations. Paper concludes arguing
that self-governance (with limited human intervention) is possible provided
that proper local, global control rules are coded into these utility functions
optimization processes.
