The phase diagram of non-compact lattice QED in four dimensions with
staggered fermions of charges 1 and $-1/2$ is investigated. The renormalized
charges are determined and found to be in agreement with perturbation theory.
This is an indication that there is no continuum limit with non-vanishing
renormalized gauge coupling, and that the theory has a validity bound for every
finite value of the renormalized coupling. The renormalization group flow of
the charges is investigated and an estimate for the validity bound as a
function of the cut-off is obtained. Generalizing this estimate to all fermions
in the Standard Model,it is found that a cut-off at the Planck scale implies
that $\alpha_R$ has to be less than $1/80$. Due to spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking, strongly bound fermion-antifermion composite states are generated.
Their spectrum is discussed.
