Present study aims to develop a predictive model for the average summer
monsoon rainfall amount over India. The dataset made available by the Indian
Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, has been explored. To develop the
predictive model, Backpropagation method with Conjugate Gradient Descent
algorithm has been implemented. The Neural Net model with the said algorithm
has been learned thrice to reach a good result. After three runs of the model,
it is found that a high prediction yield is available. Ultimately, Artificial
Neural Network with Conjugate Gradient Descent based Backpropagation algorithm
is found to be skillful in predicting average summer monsoon rainfall amount
over India.
