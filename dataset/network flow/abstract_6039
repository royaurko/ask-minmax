Concepts of complex networks have been used to obtain metrics that were
correlated to text quality established by scores assigned by human judges.
Texts produced by high-school students in Portuguese were represented as
scale-free networks (word adjacency model), from which typical network features
such as the in/outdegree, clustering coefficient and shortest path were
obtained. Another metric was derived from the dynamics of the network growth,
based on the variation of the number of connected components. The scores
assigned by the human judges according to three text quality criteria
(coherence and cohesion, adherence to standard writing conventions and theme
adequacy/development) were correlated with the network measurements. Text
quality for all three criteria was found to decrease with increasing average
values of outdegrees, clustering coefficient and deviation from the dynamics of
network growth. Among the criteria employed, cohesion and coherence showed the
strongest correlation, which probably indicates that the network measurements
are able to capture how the text is developed in terms of the concepts
represented by the nodes in the networks. Though based on a particular set of
texts and specific language, the results presented here point to potential
applications in other instances of text analysis.
