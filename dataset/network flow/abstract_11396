We propose a stochastic model for the diffusion of topics entering a social
network modeled by a Watts-Strogatz graph. Our model sets into play an implicit
competition between these topics as they vie for the attention of users in the
network. The dynamics of our model are based on notions taken from real-world
OSNs like Twitter where users either adopt an exogenous topic or copy topics
from their neighbors leading to endogenous propagation. When instantiated
correctly, the model achieves a viral regime where a few topics garner
unusually good response from the network, closely mimicking the behavior of
real-world OSNs. Our main contribution is our description of how clusters of
proximate users that have spoken on the topic merge to form a large giant
component making a topic go viral. This demonstrates that it is not weak ties
but actually strong ties that play a major part in virality. We further
validate our model and our hypotheses about its behavior by comparing our
simulation results with the results of a measurement study conducted on real
data taken from Twitter.
