We analyse the flow of information in multiplex networks by means of the
communicability function. First, we generalize this measure from its definition
from simple graphs to multiplex networks. Then, we study its relevance for the
analysis of real-world systems by studying a social multiplex where information
flows using formal/informal channels and an air transportation system where the
layers represent different air companies. Accordingly, the communicability,
which is essential for the good performance of these complex systems, emerges
at a systemic operation point in the multiplex where the performance of the
layers operates in a coordinated way very differently from the state
represented by a collection of unconnected networks.
