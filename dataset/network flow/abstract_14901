We consider the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with periodic
boundary conditions and time-independent forcing. For this type of flow, we
derive adjoint equations whose trajectories converge asymptotically to the
equilibrium and traveling wave solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations. Using
the adjoint equations, arbitrary initial conditions evolve to the vicinity of a
(relative) equilibrium at which point a few Newton-type iterations yield the
desired (relative) equilibrium solution. We apply this adjoint-based method to
a chaotic two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow. A convergence rate of 100% is
observed, leading to the discovery of 21 new steady state and traveling wave
solutions at Reynolds number Re=40. Some of the new invariant solutions have
spatially localized structures that were previously believed to only exist on
domains with large aspect ratios. We show that one of the newly found steady
state solutions underpins the temporal intermittencies, i.e., high energy
dissipation episodes of the flow. More precisely, it is shown that each
intermittent episode of a generic turbulent trajectory corresponds to its close
passage to this equilibrium solution.
