We develop a full theoretical approach to clustering in complex networks. A
key concept is introduced, the edge multiplicity, that measures the number of
triangles passing through an edge. This quantity extends the clustering
coefficient in that it involves the properties of two --and not just one--
vertices. The formalism is completed with the definition of a three-vertex
correlation function, which is the fundamental quantity describing the
properties of clustered networks. The formalism suggests new metrics that are
able to thoroughly characterize transitive relations. A rigorous analysis of
several real networks, which makes use of the new formalism and the new
metrics, is also provided. It is also found that clustered networks can be
classified into two main groups: the {\it weak} and the {\it strong
transitivity} classes. In the first class, edge multiplicity is small, with
triangles being disjoint. In the second class, edge multiplicity is high and so
triangles share many edges. As we shall see in the following paper, the class a
network belongs to has strong implications in its percolation properties.
