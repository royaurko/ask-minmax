We prove the stability of the torus, and with suitable rescaling, hyperbolic
space under the (two-loop) renormalization group flow for the nonlinear sigma
model. To prove stability we use similar techniques to \cite{GIK02}, where the
stability of the torus under Ricci flow was first established. The main
technical tool is maximal regularity theory.
