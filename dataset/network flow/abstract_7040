The meridional flow in the Sun is an axisymmetric flow that is generally
poleward directed at the surface, and is presumed to be of fundamental
importance in the generation and transport of magnetic fields. Its true shape
and strength, however, is debated. We present a numerical simulation of
helioseismic wave propagation in the whole solar interior in the presence of a
prescribed, stationary, single-cell, deep meridional circulation serving as a
test-bed for helioseismic measurement techniques. A deep-focusing time-distance
helioseismology technique is applied to the artificial data showing that it can
in fact be used to measure the effects of the meridional flow very deep in the
solar convection zone. It is shown that the ray-approximation which is commonly
used for interpretation of helioseismology measurements remains a reasonable
approximation even for the very long distances between 12 and 42 degrees
corresponding to depths between 52 and 195 Mm considered here. From the
measurement noise we extrapolate that on the order of a full solar cycle may be
needed to probe the flow all the way to the base of the convection zone.
