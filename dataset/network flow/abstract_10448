The pervasiveness of wireless communication recently gave mobile ad hoc
networks (MANET) a significant researchers' attention, due to its innate
capabilities of instant communication in many time and mission critical
applications. However, its natural advantages of networking in civilian and
military environments make them vulnerable to security threats. Support for an
anonymity in MANET is an orthogonal to security critical challenge we faced in
this paper. We propose a new anonymous authentication protocol for mobile ad
hoc networks enhanced with a distributed reputation system. The main its
objective is to provide mechanisms concealing a real identity of communicating
nodes with an ability of resist to known attacks. The distributed reputation
system is incorporated for a trust management and malicious behavior detection
in the network. The end-to-end anonymous authentication is conducted in
three-pass handshake based on an asymmetric and symmetric key cryptography.
After successfully finished authentication phase secure and multiple anonymous
data channels are established. The anonymity is guarantied by randomly chosen
pseudonyms owned by a user. Nodes of the network are publicly identified and
are independent of users' pseudonyms. In this paper we presented an example of
the protocol implementation.
