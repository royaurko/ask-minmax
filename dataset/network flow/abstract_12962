We performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the clustering
instability of a freely cooling dilute gas of inelastically colliding disks in
a quasi-one-dimensional setting. We observe that, as the gas cools, the shear
stress becomes negligibly small, and the gas flows by inertia only. Finite-time
singularities, intrinsic in such a flow, are arrested only when close-packed
clusters are formed. We observe that the late-time dynamics of this system are
describable by the Burgers equation with vanishing viscosity, and predict the
long-time coarsening behavior.
