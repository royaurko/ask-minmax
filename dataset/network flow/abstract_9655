This paper investigates the adoption level of a network service where the net
utility perceived by each user incorporates three key features, namely, user
service affinity heterogeneity, a network externality, and a subscription cost.
Services with network externality face a "chicken and egg" adoption problem in
that the service requires customers in order to attract customers. In this
paper we study cost subsidization as a means to "reach the knee" and thereby
change the equilibrium adoption level from zero to one. By focusing on a simple
subsidy structure and a simple model for user heterogeneity, we can derive
explicit expressions for quantities of natural interest, such as the minimum
subsidy required, the minimum subsidy duration, and the aggregate cost of the
subsidy to the service provider. We show that small or large subsidies are
inefficient, but that there is a Pareto efficient frontier for "intermediate"
subsidies wherein subsidy duration and aggregate cost are in tension with one
another.
