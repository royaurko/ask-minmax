Providing functionalities that allow online social network users to manage in
a secure and private way the publication of their information and/or resources
is a relevant and far from trivial topic that has been under scrutiny from
various research communities. In this work, we provide a framework that allows
users to define highly expressive access policies to their resources in a way
that the enforcement does not require the intervention of a (trusted or not)
third party. This is made possible by the deployment of a newly defined
cryptographic primitives that provides - among other things - efficient access
revocation and access policy privacy. Finally, we provide an implementation of
our framework as a Facebook application, proving the feasibility of our
approach.
