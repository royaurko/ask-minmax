We provide an explicit rigorous derivation of a diffusion limit - a
stochastic differential equation with additive noise - from a deterministic
skew-product flow. This flow is assumed to exhibit time-scale separation and
has the form of a slowly evolving system driven by a fast chaotic flow. Under
mild assumptions on the fast flow, we prove convergence to a stochastic
differential equation as the time-scale separation grows. In contrast to
existing work, we do not require the flow to have good mixing properties. As a
consequence, our results incorporate a large class of fast flows, including the
classical Lorenz equations.
