We consider the problem of finding the graph on which an epidemic cascade
spreads, given only the times when each node gets infected. While this is a
problem of importance in several contexts -- offline and online social
networks, e-commerce, epidemiology, vulnerabilities in infrastructure networks
-- there has been very little work, analytical or empirical, on finding the
graph. Clearly, it is impossible to do so from just one cascade; our interest
is in learning the graph from a small number of cascades.
  For the classic and popular "independent cascade" SIR epidemics, we
analytically establish the number of cascades required by both the global
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator, and a natural greedy algorithm. Both results
are based on a key observation: the global graph learning problem decouples
into $n$ local problems -- one for each node. For a node of degree $d$, we show
that its neighborhood can be reliably found once it has been infected $O(d^2
\log n)$ times (for ML on general graphs) or $O(d\log n)$ times (for greedy on
trees). We also provide a corresponding information-theoretic lower bound of
$\Omega(d\log n)$; thus our bounds are essentially tight. Furthermore, if we
are given side-information in the form of a super-graph of the actual graph (as
is often the case), then the number of cascade samples required -- in all cases
-- becomes independent of the network size $n$.
  Finally, we show that for a very general SIR epidemic cascade model, the
Markov graph of infection times is obtained via the moralization of the network
graph.
