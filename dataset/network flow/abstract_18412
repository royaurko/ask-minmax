We study the mathematical aspects of the Bose Einstein Condensation for the
pure hopping model describing arrays of Josephson junctions on non homogeneous
networks. The graphs under investigation are obtained by adding density zero
perturbations to the homogeneous Cayley Trees. The resulting topological model
is described by the (opposite of the) adjacency operator on the graph. In the
present paper we investigate some relevant spectral properties of the adjacency
of the perturbed network, such the appearance of the hidden spectrum below the
norm, the transience character and the Perron Frobenius distribution. All the
mentioned properties have a mathematical interest in itself, and have natural
applications for the investigation of the BEC of Bardeen Cooper Bosons on the
networks under consideration.
