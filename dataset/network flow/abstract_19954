This short article describes flow parameters, numerical method, and
animations of the fluid dynamics video "LES of an Inclined Jet into a
Supersonic Turbulent Crossflow"
(http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/14073/3/GFM-2009.mpg
[high-resolution] and

[low-resolution] video). We performed large-eddy simulation with the sub-grid
scale (LES-SGS) stretched-vortex model of momentum and scalar transport to
study the gas-dynamics interactions of a helium inclined round jet into a
supersonic ($M=3.6$) turbulent (\Reth$ =13\times10^3$) air flow over a flat
surface. The video shows the temporal development of Mach-number and magnitude
of density-gradient in the mid-span plane, and isosurface of helium
mass-fraction and $\lam_2$ (vortical structures). The identified vortical
structures are sheets, tilted tubes, and discontinuous rings. The vortical
structures are shown to be well correlated in space and time with helium
mass-fraction isosurface ($Y_{\rm He}=0.25$).
