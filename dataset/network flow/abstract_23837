We report results of molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water at the
temperature T=277 K for a range of high pressure. One aim of the study was to
test the model Amoeba potential for description of equilibrium structural
properties and dynamical processes in liquid water. The comparison our
numerical results with the Amoeba and TIP5P potentials, our results of \emph{ab
initio} molecular dynamics simulations and the experimental data reveals that
the Amoeba potential reproduces correctly structural properties of the liquid
water. Other aim of our work was related with investigation of the pressure
induced structural transformations and their influence on the microscopic
collective dynamics. We have found that the structural anomaly at the pressure
$p_c\approx 2000$ Atm is related with the changes of the local, short-range
order in liquid water within first two coordination shells. This anomaly
specifies mainly by deformation of the hydrogen-bond network. We also discuss
in detail the anomalous behavior of sound propagation in liquid water at high
pressures and compare numerical results with the experimental data.
