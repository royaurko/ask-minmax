High throughput is a fundamental goal of network design and is of particular
interest in data center and high performance computing networks. Although
myriad network topologies have been recently proposed, a broad head-to-head
comparison of these proposals is absent, and the right way to compare
worst-case throughput performance turns out to be a subtle problem.
  In this paper, we present a framework to benchmark the throughput of network
topologies. First, we show that cut-based metrics such as bisection bandwidth
are the wrong measure: they yield incorrect conclusions about throughput
performance. Next, we show how to generate a near-worst-case traffic matrix for
a given topology, which empirically approaches a theoretical lower bound.
Finally, we employ this metric, along with other traffic matrices, to analyze
the throughput performance of a variety of networks proposed for data centers
and high performance computing. Our evaluation code is freely available to
facilitate future reproducible work on rigorously designing and evaluating
networks.
