I review constraints on the physical properties of AGN jets revealed through
Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) studies of the structure and
time-evolution of parsec-scale jets, including recent results from the MOJAVE
program. In particular I focus on constraints available from very long time
baseline studies which probe a wide range of jet behavior over many outbursts.
Kinematic studies of propagating jet features find an apparent speed
distribution that peaks around 10c for blazars, with speeds up to 50c observed.
These observed speeds require Lorentz factors at least as large, implying that
parsec-scale Lorentz factors up to 10-20 are common for blazars with a tail up
to ~ 50. Jet flows are still becoming organized on these scales as evidenced by
the high incidence of non-radial motions and/or accelerations of jet features
(including increases and decreases in apparent speed and direction). Changes in
Lorentz factors of propagating jet features appear to play a significant role
in the observed accelerations, and while the connection between acceleration of
jet features and the underlying flow is not clear, the pattern of observed
accelerations suggest the flow may increase in speed near the base of the jet
and decrease further out. In some jets, ejections of new features span a range
of ejection angles over many epochs, tracing out wider opening angles on
parsec-scales than are apparent in single epoch observations.
