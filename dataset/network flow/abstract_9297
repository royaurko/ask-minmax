Side channel attacks are a major security concern for smart cards and other
embedded devices. They analyze the variations on the power consumption to find
the secret key of the encryption algorithm implemented within the security IC.
To address this issue, logic gates that have a constant power dissipation
independent of the input signals, are used in security ICs. This paper presents
a design methodology to create fully connected differential pull down networks.
Fully connected differential pull down networks are transistor networks that
for any complementary input combination connect all the internal nodes of the
network to one of the external nodes of the network. They are memoryless and
for that reason have a constant load capacitance and power consumption. This
type of networks is used in specialized logic gates to guarantee a constant
contribution of the internal nodes into the total power consumption of the
logic gate.
