In this paper we propose a classification scheme to isolate truly benign
tumors from those that initially start off as benign but subsequently show
metastases. A non-parametric artificial neural network methodology has been
chosen because of the analytical difficulties associated with extraction of
closed-form stochastic-likelihood parameters given the extremely complicated
and possibly non-linear behavior of the state variables.
