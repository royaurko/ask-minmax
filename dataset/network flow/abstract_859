We study theoretically the effects of confinement on active polar gels such
as the actin network of eukaryotic cells. Using generalized hydrodynamics
equations derived for active gels, we predict, in the case of quasi
one-dimensional geometry, a spontaneous flow transition from a homogeneously
polarized immobile state for small thicknesses, to a perturbed flowing state
for larger thicknesses. The transition is not driven by an external field but
by the activity of the system. We suggest several possible experimental
realizations.
