The distribution of magnetic field in single-phase polycrystalline bulk MgB2
has been measured using a Magneto-Optical (MO) technique for an external
magnetic field applied perpendicular to the sample surface. The MO studies
indicate that an inter-granular current network is readily established in this
material and the current is not limited by weak-linked grain boundaries. The
grain boundaries are observed to resist preferential magnetic field
penetration, with the inter-grain mechanism dominating the current flow in the
sample at temperatures up to 30K. The results provide clear evidence that the
intra-granular current flow is isotropic. A critical current density of ~10^4
Acm-2 was estimated at 30K in a field of 150mT from the MO measurements. These
results provide further evidence of the considerable potential for MgB2 for
engineering applications.
