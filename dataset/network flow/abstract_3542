We present measures, models and link prediction algorithms based on the
structural balance in signed social networks. Certain social networks contain,
in addition to the usual 'friend' links, 'enemy' links. These networks are
called signed social networks. A classical and major concept for signed social
networks is that of structural balance, i.e., the tendency of triangles to be
'balanced' towards including an even number of negative edges, such as
friend-friend-friend and friend-enemy-enemy triangles. In this article, we
introduce several new signed network analysis methods that exploit structural
balance for measuring partial balance, for finding communities of people based
on balance, for drawing signed social networks, and for solving the problem of
link prediction. Notably, the introduced methods are based on the signed graph
Laplacian and on the concept of signed resistance distances. We evaluate our
methods on a collection of four signed social network datasets.
