This paper presents a Bayesian model for unsupervised learning of verb
selectional preferences. For each verb the model creates a Bayesian network
whose architecture is determined by the lexical hierarchy of Wordnet and whose
parameters are estimated from a list of verb-object pairs found from a corpus.
``Explaining away'', a well-known property of Bayesian networks, helps the
model deal in a natural fashion with word sense ambiguity in the training data.
On a word sense disambiguation test our model performed better than other state
of the art systems for unsupervised learning of selectional preferences.
Computational complexity problems, ways of improving this approach and methods
for implementing ``explaining away'' in other graphical frameworks are
discussed.
