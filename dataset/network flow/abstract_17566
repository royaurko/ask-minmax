We present a set of polynomial equations that provides models of the lattice
Boltzmann theory for any required level of accuracy and for any dimensional
space in a general form. We explicitly derive two- and three-dimensional models
applicable to describe thermal compressible flows of the level of the
Navier-Stokes equations.
