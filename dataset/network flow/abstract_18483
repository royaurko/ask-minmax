Considering real physical (MAC/PHY) traces inside network simulations is a
complex task that might lead to complex yet approximated models. However,
realistic cross-layer analysis with the upper layer and in particular the
transport layer cannot be driven without considering the MAC/PHY level. In this
paper, we propose to cope with this problem by introducing a software that
translates real physical events from a given trace in order to be used inside a
network simulator such as $ns$-2. The main objective is to accurately perform
analysis of the impact of link layer reliability schemes (obtained by the use
of real physical traces) on transport layer performance. We detail the internal
mechanisms and the benefits of this software with a focus on 4G satellite
communications scenarios and present the resulting metrics provided by CLIFT to
perform consistent cross-layer analysis.
