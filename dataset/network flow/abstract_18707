We study the condensation phenomenon in a zero range process on weighted
scale-free networks in order to show how the weighted transport influences the
particle condensation. Instead of the approach of grand canonical ensemble
which is generally used in a zero range process, we introduce an alternate
approach of the mean field equations to study the dynamics of particle
transport. We find that the condensation on scale-free network is easier to
occur in the case of weighted transport than in the case of weight-free. In the
weighted transport, especially, a dynamical condensation is even possible for
the case of no interaction among particles, which is impossible in the case of
weight-free.
