I discuss the multiphase nature of the intracluster medium whose neglect can
lead to overestimates of the baryon fraction of clusters by up to a factor of
two. The multiphase form of the cooling flow equations are derived and reduced
to a simple form for a wide class of self-similar density distributions. It is
shown that steady-state cooling flows are \emph{not} consistent with all
possible emissivity profiles which can therefore be used as a test of the
theory. In combination, they provide strong constraints on the mass
distribution within the cooling radius.
