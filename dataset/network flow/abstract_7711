Right-invariant geodesic flows on manifolds of Lie groups associated with
2-cocycles of corresponding Lie algebras are discussed. Algebra of integrals of
motion for magnetic geodesic flows is considered and necessary and sufficient
condition of integrability in quadratures is formulated. Canonic forms for
2-cocycles of all 4-dimensional Lie algebras are given and integrable cases
among them are separated.
