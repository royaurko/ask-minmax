Due to deployment in hostile environment, wireless sensor network is
vulnerable to various attacks. Exhausted sensor nodes in sensor network become
a challenging issue because it disrupts the normal connectivity of the network.
Affected nodes give rise to denial of service that resists to get the objective
of sensor network in real life. A mathematical model based on Absorbing Markov
Chain (AMC)is proposed for Denial of Sleep attack detection in sensor network.
In this mechanism, whether sensor network is affected by denial of sleep attack
or not can be decided by considering expected death time of sensor network
under normal scenario.
