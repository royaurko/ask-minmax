Recent studies on the spin and the chirality orderings of the
three-dimensional Heisenberg spin glass and related systems are reviewed with
particular emphasis on the possible spin-chirality decoupling phenomena.
Chirality scenario of real spin-glass transition and its experimental
consequence on the ordering of Heisenberg-like spin glasses are discussed.
