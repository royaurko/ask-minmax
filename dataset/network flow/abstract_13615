In this paper, we establish the local well-posedness for the Cauchy problem
of the simplified version of hydrodynamic flow of nematic liquid crystals
(\ref{LLF}) in $\mathbb R^3$ for any initial data $(u_0,d_0)$ having small
$L^3_{\hbox{uloc}}$-norm of $(u_0,\nabla d_0)$. Here $L^3_{\hbox{uloc}}(\mathbb
R^3)$ is the space of uniformly locally $L^3$-integrable functions. For any
initial data $(u_0, d_0)$ with small $\displaystyle |(u_0,\nabla
d_0)|_{L^3(\mathbb R^3)}$, we show that there exists a unique, global solution
to (\ref{LLF}) which is smooth for $t>0$ and has monotone deceasing
$L^3$-energy for $t\ge 0$.
