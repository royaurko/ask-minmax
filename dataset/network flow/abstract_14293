Surface flow of granular material is investigated within a continuum approach
in two dimensions. The dynamics is described by a non-linear coupling between
the two `states' of the granular material: a mobile layer and a static bed.
Following previous studies, we use mass and momentum conservation to derive
St-Venant like equations for the evolution of the thickness R of the mobile
layer and the profile Z of the static bed. This approach allows the rheology in
the flowing layer to be specified independently, and we consider in details the
two following models: a constant plug flow and a linear velocity profile. We
study and compare these models for non-stationary avalanches triggered by a
localized amount of mobile grains on a static bed of constant slope. We solve
analytically the non-linear dynamical equations by the method of
characteristics. This enables us to investigate the temporal evolution of the
avalanche size, amplitude and shape as a function of model parameters and
initial conditions. In particular, we can compute their large time behavior as
well as the condition for the formation of shocks.
