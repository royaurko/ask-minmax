Complex socioeconomic networks such as information, finance and even
terrorist networks need resilience to cascades - to prevent the failure of a
single node from causing a far-reaching domino effect. We show that terrorist
and guerrilla networks are uniquely cascade-resilient while maintaining high
efficiency, but they become more vulnerable beyond a certain threshold. We also
introduce an optimization method for constructing networks with high passive
cascade resilience. The optimal networks are found to be based on cells, where
each cell has a star topology. Counterintuitively, we find that there are
conditions where networks should not be modified to stop cascades because doing
so would come at a disproportionate loss of efficiency. Implementation of these
findings can lead to more cascade-resilient networks in many diverse areas.
