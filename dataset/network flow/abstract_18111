The aim of this paper is to introduce the idea of the Semantic Web to the
Complexity community and set a basic ground for a project resulting in creation
of Internet-based semantic network of Complexity-related information providers.
Implementation of the Semantic Web technology would be of mutual benefit to
both the participants and users and will confirm self-referencing power of the
community to apply the products of its own research to itself. We first explain
the logic of the transition and discuss important notions associated with the
Semantic Web technology. We then present a brief outline of the project
milestones.
