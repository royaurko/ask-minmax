Motivated by the structure of networks of cross-linked cytoskeletal
biopolymers, we study the orientationally ordered phases in two-dimensional
networks of randomly cross-linked semiflexible polymers. We consider permanent
cross-links which prescribe a finite angle and treat them as quenched disorder
in a semi-microscopic replica field theory. Starting from a fluid of
un-cross-linked polymers and small polymer clusters (sol) and increasing the
cross-link density, a continuous gelation transition occurs. In the resulting
gel, the semiflexible chains either display long range orientational order or
are frozen in random directions depending on the value of the crossing angle,
the crosslink concentration and the stiffness of the polymers. A crossing angle
$\theta\sim 2\pi/M$ leads to long range $M$-fold orientational order, e.g.,
"hexatic" or "tetratic" for $\theta=60^{\circ}$ or $90^{\circ}$, respectively.
The transition is discontinuous and the critical cross-link density depends on
the bending stiffness of the polymers and the cross-link geometry: the higher
the stiffness and the lower $M$, the lower the critical number of cross-links.
In between the sol and the long range ordered state, we always observe a gel
which is a statistically isotropic amorphous solid (SIAS) with random
positional and random orientational localization of the participating polymers.
