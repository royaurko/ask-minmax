When a posterior distribution has multiple modes, unconditional expectations,
such as the posterior mean, may not offer informative summaries of the
distribution. Motivated by this problem, we propose to decompose the sample
space of a multimodal distribution into domains of attraction of local modes.
Domain-based representations are defined to summarize the probability masses of
and conditional expectations on domains of attraction, which are much more
informative than the mean and other unconditional expectations. A computational
method, the multi-domain sampler, is developed to construct domain-based
representations for an arbitrary multimodal distribution. The multi-domain
sampler is applied to structural learning of protein-signaling networks from
high-throughput single-cell data, where a signaling network is modeled as a
causal Bayesian network. Not only does our method provide a detailed landscape
of the posterior distribution but also improves the accuracy and the predictive
power of estimated networks.
