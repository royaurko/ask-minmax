The paper discusses fundamental detectability properties associated with the
problem of distributed state estimation using networked observers. The main
result of the paper establishes connections between detectability of the plant
through measurements, observability of the node filters through
interconnections, and algebraic properties of the underlying communication
graph, to ensure the interconnected filtering error dynamics are stabilizable
via output injection.
