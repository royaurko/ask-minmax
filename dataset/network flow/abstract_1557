We investigate the role of localization effects in the Kondo disorder
mechanism for non-Fermi liquid behavior in disordered Kondo lattices. We find
that the distribution of Kondo temperatures is strongly affected by
fluctuations of the conduction electron density of states, a feature neglected
in the previous treatment. For moderate disorder, the self-consistent
distribution of Kondo temperatures flows to a universal log-normal form,
irrespective of the form of the bare disorder distribution. For sufficient
disorder, the system enters a Griffiths phase with diverging thermodynamic
responses.
