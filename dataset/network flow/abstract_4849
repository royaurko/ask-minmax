Recent numerical simulations of lid-driven cavity flow of a nematic liquid
crystal have found dynamical behavior where topological defects rotate about
the center of the fluid vortex induced by the lid motion. By considering a
simpler geometry of an infinite system with axisymmetric fluid flow we show
that the Ericksen-Leslie nematodynamic equation for the director can be solved
exactly. The solution demonstrates that any configuration of defects will be
advected by the fluid flow, with the defects rotating about the center of the
fluid vortex with the angular velocity of the fluid.
