We study the nature of quiet-Sun oscillations using multi-wavelength
observations from TRACE, Hinode, and SOHO. The aim is to investigate the
existence of propagating waves in the solar chromosphere and the transition
region via analyzing the statistical distribution of power in different
locations, e.g. in bright magnetic (network), bright non-magnetic and dark
non-magnetic (inter-network) regions, separately. We use Fourier power and
phase-difference techniques combined with a wavelet analysis. Two-dimensional
Fourier power maps were constructed in the period bands 2-4 minutes, 4-6
minutes, 6-15 minutes, and beyond 15 minutes. We detect the presence of
long-period oscillations with periods between 15 and 30 minutes in bright
magnetic regions. These oscillations were detected from the chromosphere to the
transition region. The Fourier power maps show that short-period powers are
mainly concentrated in dark regions whereas long-period powers are concentrated
in bright magnetic regions. This is the first report of long-period waves in
quiet-Sun network regions. We suggest that the observed propagating
oscillations are due to magnetoacoustic waves which can be important for the
heating of the solar atmosphere.
