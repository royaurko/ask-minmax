Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are set of energy-limited sensors, which
recently have been point of interest due to their vast applications. One of the
efficient ways to consume energy in these networks is to utilize optimal
routing protocols. In this approach, we proposed a greedy hierarchical
chain-based routing method, named, PGC (stands for Persian Greedy Chain) which
route the network applying Spread Spectrum codes as a mask given to the grid
cells. Due to similarities between the proposed method in this article and
LEACH protocol, we compare this routing protocol with the proposed model from
diverse aspects in the simulation section such as remaining energy and being
fault tolerant and reliable. The results prove that presented method is more
robust and efficient.
