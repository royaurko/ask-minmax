We prove a log average almost-sure invariance principle (log asip) for
renewal processes with positive i.i.d. gaps in the domain of attraction of an
$\alpha$-stable law with $0<\alpha<1$. Dynamically, this means that renewal and
Mittag-Leffler paths are forward asymptotic in the scaling flow, up to a time
average. This strengthens the almost-sure invariance principle in log density
we proved in {FisherTalet2011}. The scaling flow is a Bernoulli flow on a
probability space. We study a second flow, the increment flow, transverse to
the scaling flow, which preserves an infinite invariant measure constructed
using singular cocycles. A cocycle version of the Hopf Ratio Ergodic Theorem
leads to an order--two ergodic theorem for the Mittag--Leffler increment flow.
Via the log asip, this result then passes to a second increment flow,
associated to the renewal process. As corollaries, we have new proofs of
theorems of {AaronsonDenkerFisher1992} and of {ChungErdos1951}, motivated by
fractal geometry.
