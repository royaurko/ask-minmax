Bearings are mechanical dissipative systems that, when perturbed, relax
toward a synchronized (bearing) state. Here we find that bearings can be
perceived as physical realizations of complex networks of oscillators with
asymmetrically weighted couplings. Accordingly, these networks can exhibit
optimal synchronization properties through fine tuning of the local interaction
strength as a function of node degree [Motter, Zhou, and Kurths, Phys. Rev. E
71, 016116 (2005)]. We show that, in analogy, the synchronizability of bearings
can be maximized by counterbalancing the number of contacts and the inertia of
their constituting rotor disks through the mass-radius relation, $m\sim
r^{\alpha}$, with an optimal exponent $\alpha=\alpha_{\times}$ which converges
to unity for a large number of rotors. Under this condition, and regardless of
the presence of a long-tailed distribution of disk radii composing the
mechanical system, the average participation per disk is maximized and the
energy dissipation rate is homogeneously distributed among elementary rotors.
