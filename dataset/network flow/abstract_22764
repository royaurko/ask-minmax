We investigate the mechanics of an active droplet endowed with internal
nematic order and surrounded by an isotropic Newtonian fluid. Using numerical
simulations we demonstrate that, due to the interplay between the active
stresses and the defective geometry of the nematic director, this system
exhibits two of the fundamental functions of living cells: spontaneous division
and motility, by means of self-generated hydrodynamics flows. These behaviors
can be selectively activated by controlling a single physical parameter,
namely, an active variant of the capillary number.
