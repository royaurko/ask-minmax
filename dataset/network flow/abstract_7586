The measurement of elliptic flow for charged particles in Au-Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 130$ GeV using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is presented. Charge particle distributions over a
wide pseudo-rapidity region ($|\eta|<5.3$) are measured by the PHOBOS silicon
multiplicity detectors. These distributions are used to extract the final-state
azimuthal anisotropy. The centrality and pseudo-rapidity dependences of
elliptic flow, averaged over momenta on an event-by-event basis and particle
species, are discussed.
