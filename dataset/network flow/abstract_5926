We iteratively derive the product-form solutions of stationary distributions
of priority multiclass queueing networks with multi-sever stations. The
networks are Markovian with exponential interarrival and service time
distributions. These solutions can be used to conduct performance analysis or
as comparison criteria for approximation and simulation studies of large scale
networks with multi-processor shared-memory switches and cloud computing
systems with parallel-server stations. Numerical comparisons with existing
Brownian approximating model are provided to indicate the effectiveness of our
algorithm.
