The celebrated Kermack-McKendric model of epidemics studies the transmission
of a disease in a population where each individual is initially susceptible
(S), may become infective (I) and then removed or recovered (R) and plays no
further epidemiological role. This ODE model arises as the limiting case of a
network model where each individual has an equal chance of infecting every
other. More recent work gives explicit consideration to the network of social
interaction and attendant probability of transmission for each interacting
pair. The state of such a network is an assignment of the values {S,I,R} to its
members. Given such a network, an initial state and a particular susceptible
individual, we would like to compute their probability of becoming infected in
the course of an epidemic. It turns out that this problem is NP-hard. In
particular, it belongs in a class of problems all of whose known solutions
require an exponential amount of computation and for which it is unlikely that
there will be more efficient solutions.
