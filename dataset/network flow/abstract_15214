Evolution of belief systems has always been in focus of cognitive research.
In this paper we delineate a new model describing belief systems as a network
of statements considered true. Testing the model a small number of parameters
enabled us to reproduce a variety of well-known mechanisms ranging from opinion
changes to development of psychological problems. The self-organizing opinion
structure showed a scale-free degree distribution. The novelty of our work lies
in applying a convenient set of definitions allowing us to depict opinion
network dynamics in a highly favorable way, which resulted in a scale-free
belief network. As an additional benefit, we listed several conjectural
consequences in a number of areas related to thinking and reasoning.
