Previous work on network coding capacity for random wired and wireless
networks have focused on the case where the capacities of links in the network
are independent. In this paper, we consider a more realistic model, where
wireless networks are modelled by random geometric graphs with interference and
noise. In this model, the capacities of links are not independent. By employing
coupling and martingale methods, we show that, under mild conditions, the
network coding capacity for random wireless networks still exhibits a
concentration behavior around the mean value of the minimum cut.
