This paper computes the sensing capacity of a sensor network, with sensors of
limited range, sensing a two-dimensional Markov random field, by modeling the
sensing operation as an encoder. Sensor observations are dependent across
sensors, and the sensor network output across different states of the
environment is neither identically nor independently distributed. Using a
random coding argument, based on the theory of types, we prove a lower bound on
the sensing capacity of the network, which characterizes the ability of the
sensor network to distinguish among environments with Markov structure, to
within a desired accuracy.
