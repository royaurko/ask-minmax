A general approach for investigating transport phenomena in porous media is
presented. This approach has the capacity to represent various kinds of
irregularity in porous media without the need for excessive detail or
computational effort. The overall method combines a generalized Effective
Medium Approximation (EMA) with a macroscopic continuum model in order to
derive a transport equation with explicit analytical expressions for the
transport coefficients. The proposed form of the EMA is an anisotropic and
heterogeneous extension of Kirkpatrick's EMA [Rev. Mod. Phys. 45, 574 (1973)]
which allows the overall model to account for microscopic alterations in
connectivity (with the locations of the pores and the orientation and length of
the throat) as well as macroscopic variations in transport properties. A
comparison to numerical results for randomly generated networks with different
properties is given, indicating the potential for this methodology to handle
cases that would pose significant difficulties to many other analytical models
