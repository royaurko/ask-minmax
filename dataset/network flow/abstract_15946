Physical contact remains difficult to trace in large metropolitan networks,
though it is a key vehicle for the transmission of contagious outbreaks.
Co-presence encounters during daily transit use provide us with a city-scale
time-resolved physical contact network, consisting of 1 billion contacts among
3 million transit users. Here, we study the advantage that knowledge of such
co-presence structures may provide for early detection of contagious outbreaks.
We first examine the "friend sensor" scheme --- a simple, but universal
strategy requiring only local information --- and demonstrate that it provides
significant early detection of simulated outbreaks. Taking advantage of the
full network structure, we then identify advanced "global sensor sets",
obtaining substantial early warning times savings over the friends sensor
scheme. Individuals with highest number of encounters are the most efficient
sensors, with performance comparable to individuals with the highest travel
frequency, exploratory behavior and structural centrality. An efficiency
balance emerges when testing the dependency on sensor size and evaluating
sensor reliability; we find that substantial and reliable lead-time could be
attained by monitoring only 0.01% of the population with the highest degree.
