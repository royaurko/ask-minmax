Synchronisation between coupled oscillatory systems is a common phenomenon in
many natural as well as technical systems. Varying the strength of coupling
often leads to qualitative changes in the complex dynamics of the mutually
coupled systems including different types of synchronisation such as phase,
lag, generalised, or even complete synchronisation. Here, we study the
geometric signatures of coupling along with the onset of generalised
synchronisation between two coupled chaotic oscillators by mapping the systems'
individual as well as joint recurrences in phase space to a complex network.
For a paradigmatic continuous-time model system, the transitivity properties of
the resulting joint recurrence networks display distinct variations associated
with changes in the structural similarity between different parts of the
considered trajectories. They therefore provide a useful indicator for the
emergence of generalised synchronisation.
  This paper is dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the introduction of
recurrence plots by Eckmann et al. (Europhys. Lett. 4 (1987), 973).
