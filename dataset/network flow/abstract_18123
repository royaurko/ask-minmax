We present an extensive analysis of long-term statistics of the queries to
websites using logs collected on several web caches in Russian academic
networks and on US IRCache caches. We check the sensitivity of the statistics
to several parameters: (1) duration of data collection, (2) geographical
location of the cache server collecting data, and (3) the year of data
collection. We propose a two-parameter modification of the Zipf law and
interpret the parameters. We find that the rank distribution of websites is
stable when approximated by the modified Zipf law. We suggest that website
popularity may be a universal property of Internet.
