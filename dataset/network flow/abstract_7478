Light-front QCD is studied by the method of flow equations. Dynamical gluon
mass is generated, which evolves with the cut-off according to renormalization
group equation. Eliminating by flow equations the quark gluon coupling with the
dynamical gluon mode, one obtains an effective interaction between quark and
antiquark which exibits the Coulomb and confining singularities. The scale,
which regulates the light-front IR singularities in the gluon sector, defines
the string tension of confining interaction. The mechanism of confinement in
the light-front formalism is suggested, based on the singular nature of the
light-front gauge.
