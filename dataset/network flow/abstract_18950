This paper proposes a Traffic-Differentiated Two-Hop Routing protocol for
Quality of Service (QoS) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It targets WSN
applications having different types of data traffic with several priorities.
The protocol achieves to increase Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and reduce
end-to-end delay while considering multi-queue priority policy, two-hop
neighborhood information, link reliability and power efficiency. The protocol
is modular and utilizes effective methods for estimating the link metrics.
Numerical results show that the proposed protocol is a feasible solution to
addresses QoS service differenti- ation for traffic with different priorities.
