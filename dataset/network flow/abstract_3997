Using two-dimensional simulations of non-radiative viscous rotating black
hole accretion flows, we show that the flows with alpha~0.1-0.3 self-organize
to form stationary unipolar or bipolar outflows accompanied by global
meridional circulations. The required energy comes, with efficiency
\~0.001-0.01, from the matter directly accreted onto black hole. Observational
implications are discussed.
