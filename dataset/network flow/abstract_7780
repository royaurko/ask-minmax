Using classical double G of a Lie algebra g equipped with a classical
R-operator we define two sets of mutually commuting functions with respect to
the initial Lie-Poisson bracket on g* and its extensions. We consider in
details examples of the Lie algebras g with the "Adler--Kostant--Symes"
R-operators and the corresponding two sets of mutually commuting functions.
Using the constructed commutative hamiltonian flows on different extensions of
g we obtain zero-curvature equations with g-valued U-V pairs. Among such the
equations are so-called "negative flows" of soliton hierarchies. We illlustrate
our approach by examples of abelian and non-abelian Toda field equations.
