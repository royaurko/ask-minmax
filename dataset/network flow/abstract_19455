If dark energy can be described as a perfect fluid, then, apart from its
equation of state relating energy density and pressure, we should also especify
the corresponding rest frame. Since dark energy is typically decoupled from the
rest of components of the universe, in principle such a frame could be
different from that of matter and radiation. In this work we consider the
potential observable effects of the motion of dark energy and the possibility
to measure the dark energy velocity relative to matter. In particular we
consider the modification of the usual interpretation of the CMB dipole and its
implications for the determination of matter bulk flows on very large scales.
We also comment on the possible origin of a dark energy flow and its evolution
in different models.
