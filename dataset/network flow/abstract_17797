We present a preliminary study of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in CUDA
software running on GPUs. We show how an attacker can overrun a buffer to
corrupt sensitive data or steer the execution flow by overwriting function
pointers, e.g., manipulating the virtual table of a C++ object. In view of a
potential mass market diffusion of GPU accelerated software this may be a major
concern.
