k-connectivity is an important measure of network robustness and resilience
to random faults and disruptions. We undertake both local and global approaches
to k-connectivity and calculate closed form analytic formulas for the
probability that a confined random network remains fully connected after the
removal of k-1 nodes. Our analysis reveals that k-connectivity is governed by
microscopic details of the network domain such as sharp corners rather than the
macroscopic total volume. Hence, our results can aid in the design of reliable
networks, an important problem in e.g. wireless ad hoc and sensor networks.
