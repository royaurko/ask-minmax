We report here results on the study of the totally asymmetric simple
exclusion processes (TASEP), defined on an open network, consisting of head and
tail simple chain segments with a double-chain section inserted in-between.
Results of numerical simulations for relatively short chains reveal an
interesting new feature of the network. When the current through the system
takes its maximum value, a simple translation of the double-chain section
forward or backward along the network, leads to a sharp change in the shape of
the density profiles in the parallel chains, thus affecting the total number of
cars in that part of the network. In the symmetric case of equal injection and
ejection rates (\alpha = \beta >1/2) and equal lengths of the head and tail
sections, the density profiles in the two parallel chains are almost linear,
characteristic for the coexistence line (shock phase). Upon moving the section
forward (backward), their shape changes to the one typical for the high (low)
density phases of a simple chain. The total bulk density of cars in a section
with a large number of parallel chains is evaluated too. The observed effect
might have interesting implications for the traffic flow control as well as for
biological transport processes in living cells. An explanation of this
phenomenon is offered in terms of finite-size dependence of the effective
injection and ejection rates at the ends of the double-chain section.
