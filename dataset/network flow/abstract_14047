We investigate the behaviour of low angular momentum viscous accretion flows
around black holes using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Earlier,
it has been observed that in a significant part of the energy and angular
momentum parameter space, rotating transonic accretion flow undergoes shock
transition before entering in to the black hole and a part of the post-shock
matter is ejected as bipolar outflows, which are supposed to be the precursor
of relativistic jets. In this work, we simulate accretion flows having
injection parameters from the inviscid shock parameter space, and study the
response of viscosity on them. With the increase of viscosity, shock becomes
time dependent and starts to oscillate when the viscosity parameter crosses its
critical value. As a result, the in falling matter inside the post-shock region
exhibits quasi-periodic variations and causes periodic ejection of matter from
the inner disc as outflows. In addition, the same hot and dense post-shock
matter emits high energy radiation and the emanating photon flux also modulates
quasi-periodically. Assuming a ten solar mass black hole, the corresponding
power density spectrum peaks at the fundamental frequency of few Hz followed by
multiple harmonics. This feature is very common in several outbursting black
hole candidates. We discuss the implications of such periodic variations.
