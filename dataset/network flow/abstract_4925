Studies of the physical measures for Cherry flows were initiated by R. Saghin
and E. Vargas in "Invariant measures for Cherry flows". While the non-positive
divergence case was resolved, the positive divergence one still lacked the
complete description. Some conjectures were put forward. In this paper we
contribute in this direction. Namely, under mild technical assumptions we solve
conjectures stated by R. Saghin and E. Vargas by providing a description of the
physical measures for Cherry flows in the positive divergence case.
