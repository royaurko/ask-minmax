We compute the longitudinal hydrodynamic flow in ultrarelativistic heavy ion
collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5500 GeV by using boost non-invariant initial
conditions following from perturbative QCD. The transfer of entropy and energy
from the central region to larger rapidities caused by boost non-invariance is
determined and the associated decrease in the lifetime of the system is
estimated.
