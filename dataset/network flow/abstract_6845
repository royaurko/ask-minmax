We consider a passive scalar that is advected by a prescribed mean zero
divergence-free velocity field, diffuses, and reacts according to a KPP-type
nonlinear reaction. We introduce a quantity, the bulk burning rate, that makes
both mathematical and physical sense in general situations and extends the
often ill-defined notion of front speed. We establish rigorous lower bounds for
the bulk burning rate that are linear in the amplitude of the advecting
velocity for a large class of flows. These "percolating" flows are
characterized by the presence of tubes of streamlines connecting distant
regions of burned and unburned material and generalize shear flows. The bound
contains geometric information on the velocity streamlines and degenerates when
these oscillate on scales that are finer than the width of the laminar burning
region. We give also examples of very different kind of flows, cellular flows
with closed streamlines, and rigorously prove that these can produce only
sub-linear enhancement of the bulk burning rate.
