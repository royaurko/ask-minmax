We establish a relationship between the Small-World behavior found in complex
networks and a family of Random Walks trajectories using, as a linking bridge,
a maze iconography. Simple methods to generate mazes using Random Walks are
discussed along with related issues and it is explained how to interpret mazes
as graphs and loops as shortcuts. Small-World behavior was found to be
non-logarithmic but power-law in this model, we discuss the reason for this
peculiar scaling
