We introduce the group of exponents of a map of the reals into a metric space
and give conditions under which this group embeds in the first Cech cohomology
group of the closure of the image of the map. We show that this group
generalizes the subgroup of the reals generated by the Fourier-Bohr exponents
of an almost periodic orbit and that any minimal almost periodic flow in a
complete metric space is determined up to (topological) equivalence by this
group. We also develop a way of associating groups with any self-homeomorphism
of a metric space that generalizes the rotation number of an
orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the circle with irrational rotation
number.
