We study the energetics of the accretion-induced outflow and then plausible
jet around black holes/compact objects using a newly developed disc-outflow
coupled model. Inter-connecting dynamics of outflow and accretion essentially
upholds the conservation laws. The energetics depend strongly on the viscosity
parameter \alpha and the cooling factor f which exhibit several interesting
features. The bolometric luminosities of ultra-luminous X-ray binaries (e.g.
SS433) and family of highly luminous AGNs and quasars can be reproduced by the
model under the super-Eddington accretion flows. Under appropriate conditions,
low-luminous AGNs (e.g. Sagittarius A^*) also fit reasonably well with the
luminosity corresponding to a sub-Eddington accretion flow with f\to 1.
