Radio-loud AGN typically manifest powerful relativistic jets extending up to
millions of light years and often showing superluminal motions organised in a
complex kinematic pattern. A number of physical models are still competing to
explain the jet structure and kinematics revealed by radio images using the
VLBI technique. Robust measurements of longitudinal and transverse velocity
field in the jets would provide crucial information for these models. This is a
difficult task, particularly for transversely resolved jets in objects like 3C
273 and M87. To address this task, we have developed a new technique for
identifying significant structural patterns (SSP) of smooth, transversely
resolved flows and obtaining a velocity field from cross-correlation of these
regions in multi-epoch observations. Detection of individual SSP is performed
using the wavelet decomposition and multiscale segmentation of the observed
structure. The cross-correlation algorithm combines structural information on
different scales of the wavelet decomposition, providing a robust and reliable
identification of related SSP in multi -epoch images. The algorithm enables
recovering structural evolution on scales down to 0.25 full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the image point spread function (PSF). We present here
examples of applying this algorithm to obtain the first detailed transverse
velocity fields and to study the kinematic evolution in the parsec-scale jets
in 3C 273 and M87.
