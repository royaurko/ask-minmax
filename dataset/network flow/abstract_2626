We present the results of an experimental and numerical investigation of a
turbulent flow over a backward-facing step in a channel. Experimental data are
visualized using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) device. As a mathematical
model we used quasi-hydrodynamic (QHD) equations. We have carried out numerical
modeling of the flow for three configurations that were also studied
experimentally. The computed flow proved to be non-stationary. The averaged
flow in the separation zone is in a good agreement with the experimental data.
