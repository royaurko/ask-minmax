We study the exact renormalisation group flow for ultracold Fermi-gases in
unitary regime. We introduce a pairing field to describe the formation of the
Cooper pairs, and take a simple ansatz for the effective action. Set of
approximate flow equations for the effective couplings including boson and
fermionic fluctuations is derived. At some value of the running scale, the
system undergoes a phase transition to a gapped phase. The values of the energy
density, chemical potential, pairing gap and the corresponding proportionality
constants relating the interacting and non-interacting Fermi gases are
calculated. Standard mean field results are recovered if we omit the boson
loops.
