This paper investigates under which conditions information can be reliably
shared and consensus can be solved in unknown and anonymous message-passing
networks that suffer from crash-failures. We provide algorithms to emulate
registers and solve consensus under different synchrony assumptions. For this,
we introduce a novel pseudo leader-election approach which allows a
leader-based consensus implementation without breaking symmetry.
