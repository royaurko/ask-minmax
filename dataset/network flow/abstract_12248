This paper introduces a general theoretical framework to analyze noise
limited networks. More precisely, we consider two homogenous Poisson point
processes of base stations and users. General model of radio signal propagation
and effect of fading are also considered. The main difference of our model with
respect to other existing models is that a user connects to his best servers
but not necessarily the closest one. We provide general formula for the outage
probability. We study functionals related to the SNR as well as the sum of
these functionals over all users per cell. For the latter, the expectation and
bounds on the variance are obtained.
