With the expansion of computer networks,the mobile terminal with wireless
access capability experience a sharp increase in the number of wireless
routers, especially low cost wireless routers are becoming very important
network equipment. This paper designs a wireless router based on the ARM
platform, the Linux system. First, there is a research and analysis on the
working principle and implementation of Network Address Translation (NAT)
technology. Then I study the IPTABLES components under the Linux system and use
it when processing data packets which go into the chain and the table and
finally using laptop with Ethernet card and the WIFI card to build the Linux
operating system. Related routing forwarding rules are defined between the two
cards and use IPTABLES to achieve a laptop as a wireless WIFI hotspot providing
routing and network connections to other computer services. It proves this
paper's design, and production feasibility. The paper also discusses the design
and production method of the wireless router with ARM board feasibility.
