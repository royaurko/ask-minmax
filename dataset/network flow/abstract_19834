A specific asymptotic expansion at large Reynolds numbers (R)for the long
wavelength perturbation of a non stationary anisotropic helical solution of the
force less Navier-Stokes equations (Trkal solutions) is effectively constructed
of the Beltrami type terms through multi scaling analysis. The asymptotic
procedure is proved to be valid for one specific value of the scaling
parameter,namely for the square root of the Reynolds number (R).As a result
large scale structures arise as gradient lines of the energy determined by the
initial conditions for two anisotropic Beltrami flows of the same helicity.The
same intitial conditions determine the boundaries of the vortex-velocity tubes,
containing both streamlines and vortex lines
