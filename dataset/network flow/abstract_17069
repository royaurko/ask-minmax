We report large scale simulations of the blue phases of cholesteric liquid
crystals. Our results suggest a structure for blue phase III, the blue fog,
which has been the subject of a long debate in liquid crystal physics. We
propose that blue phase III is an amorphous network of disclination lines,
which is thermodynamically and kinetically stabilised over crystalline blue
phases at intermediate chiralities}. This amorphous network becomes ordered
under an applied electric field, as seen in experiments.
