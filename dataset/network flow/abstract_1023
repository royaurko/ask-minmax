The problem of serving multicast flows in a crossbar switch is considered.
Intra-flow linear network coding is shown to achieve a larger rate region than
the case without coding. A traffic pattern is presented which is achievable
with coding but requires a switch speedup when coding is not allowed. The rate
region with coding can be characterized in a simple graph-theoretic manner, in
terms of the stable set polytope of the "enhanced conflict graph". No such
graph-theoretic characterization is known for the case of fanout splitting
without coding.
  The minimum speedup needed to achieve 100% throughput with coding is shown to
be upper bounded by the imperfection ratio of the enhanced conflict graph. When
applied to KxN switches with unicasts and broadcasts only, this gives a bound
of min{(2K-1)/K,2N/(N+1)} on the speedup. This shows that speedup, which is
usually implemented in hardware, can often be substituted by network coding,
which can be done in software.
  Computing an offline schedule (using prior knowledge of the flow rates) is
reduced to fractional weighted graph coloring. A graph-theoretic online
scheduling algorithm (using only queue occupancy information) is also proposed,
that stabilizes the queues for all rates within the rate region.
