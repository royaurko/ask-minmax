The viscosity of lipid bilayer membranes plays an important role in
determining the diffusion constant of embedded proteins and the dynamics of
membrane deformations, yet it has historically proven very difficult to
measure. Here we introduce a new method based on quantification of the
large-scale circulation patterns induced inside vesicles adhered to a solid
surface and subjected to simple shear flow in a microfluidic device. Particle
Image Velocimetry based on spinning disk confocal imaging of tracer particles
inside and outside of the vesicle, and tracking of phase-separated membrane
domains are used to reconstruct the full three-dimensional flow pattern induced
by the shear. These measurements show excellent agreement with the predictions
of a recent theoretical analysis, and allow direct determination of the
membrane viscosity.
