Power law distribution seems to be an important characteristic of web graphs.
Several existing web graph models generate power law graphs by adding new
vertices and non-uniform edge connectivities to existing graphs. Researchers
have conjectured that preferential connectivity and incremental growth are both
required for the power law distribution. In this paper, we propose a different
web graph model with power law distribution that does not require incremental
growth. We also provide a comparison of our model with several others in their
ability to predict web graph clustering behavior.
