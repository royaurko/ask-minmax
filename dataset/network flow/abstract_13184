Identifying jets in heavy ion collisions is of significant interest since the
properties of jets are expected to get modified because of the formation of
quark gluon plasma. The detection of jets is, however, difficult because of
large number of non-jet hadrons produced in the collision process. In this work
we propose a method of identifying a jet and determining its transverse
momentum by means of flow analysis. This has been done an event-by-event basis.
