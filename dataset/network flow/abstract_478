Static analysis (aka offline analysis) of a model of an IP network is useful
for understanding, debugging, and verifying packet flow properties of the
network. There have been static analysis approaches proposed in the literature
for networks based on model checking as well as graph reachability. Abstract
interpretation is a method that has typically been applied to static analysis
of programs. We propose a new, abstract-interpretation based approach for
analysis of networks. We formalize our approach, mention its correctness
guarantee, and demonstrate its flexibility in addressing multiple
network-analysis problems that have been previously solved via tailor-made
approaches. Finally, we investigate an application of our analysis to a novel
problem -- inferring a high-level policy for the network -- which has been
addressed in the past only in the restricted single-router setting.
