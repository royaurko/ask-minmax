We consider the problem of inferring the unknown parameters of a stochastic
biochemical network model from a single measured time-course of the
concentration of some of the involved species. Such measurements are available,
e.g., from live-cell fluorescence microscopy in image-based systems biology. In
addition, fluctuation time-courses from, e.g., fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy provide additional information about the system dynamics that can
be used to more robustly infer parameters than when considering only mean
concentrations. Estimating model parameters from a single experimental
trajectory enables single-cell measurements and quantification of cell--cell
variability. We propose a novel combination of an adaptive Monte Carlo sampler,
called Gaussian Adaptation, and efficient exact stochastic simulation
algorithms that allows parameter identification from single stochastic
trajectories. We benchmark the proposed method on a linear and a non-linear
reaction network at steady state and during transient phases. In addition, we
demonstrate that the present method also provides an ellipsoidal volume
estimate of the viable part of parameter space and is able to estimate the
physical volume of the compartment in which the observed reactions take place.
