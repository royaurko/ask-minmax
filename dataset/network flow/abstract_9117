With the raise in practice of Internet, in social, personal, commercial and
other aspects of life, the cybercrime is as well escalating at an alarming
rate. Such usage of Internet in diversified areas also augmented the illegal
activities, which in turn, bids many network attacks and threats. Network
forensics is used to detect the network attacks. This can be viewed as the
extension of network security. It is the technology, which detects and also
suggests prevention of the various network attacks. Botnet is one of the most
common attacks and is regarded as a network of hacked computers. It captures
the network packet, store it and then analyze and correlate to find the source
of attack. Various methods based on this approach for botnet detection are in
literature, but a generalized method is lacking. So, there is a requirement to
design a generic framework that can be used by any botnet detection. This
framework is of use for researchers, in the development of their own method of
botnet detection, by means of providing methodology and guidelines. In this
paper, various prevalent methods of botnet detection are studied, commonalities
among them are established and then a generalized model for the detection of
botnet is proposed. The proposed framework is described as UML diagrams.
