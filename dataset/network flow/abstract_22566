We discuss how the wettability and roughness of a solid impacts its
hydrodynamic properties. We see in particular that hydrophobic slippage can be
dramatically affected by the presence of roughness. Owing to the development of
refined methods for setting very well-controlled micro- or nanotextures on a
solid, these effects are being exploited to induce novel hydrodynamic
properties, such as giant interfacial slip, superfluidity, mixing, and low
hydrodynamic drag, that could not be achieved without roughness.
