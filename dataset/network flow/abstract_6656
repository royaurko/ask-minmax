Replicated network data are available in many research fields. In connectomic
applications, inter-connections among brain regions are collected from each
patient, with interest focusing on studying common structures and individual
differences in the architecture of interconnections in the brain. Current
methods study shared connectivity patterns or reduce network data to summary
statistics prior to statistical analysis, while we propose a fully generative
Bayesian nonparametric approach for modeling the population distribution of
network-valued data. The joint distribution of the edges follows a multivariate
Bernoulli distribution, with transformed edge probability vectors expressed as
the sum of a shared similarity vector and a class-specific deviation modeled
via flexible mixtures of low-rank factorization exploiting the network
structure. The formulation is provably flexible, leads to a simple Gibbs
sampler, and provides a framework for clustering network-valued data, while
adaptively shrinking towards lower dimensional representations. We discuss
theoretical properties and illustrate the performance in simulations and
application to human brain networks.
