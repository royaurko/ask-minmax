Electrical transport properties of DyAs epitaxial layers grown on GaAs have
been investigated at various temperatures and magnetic fields up to 12T. The
measured longitudinal resistances show two distinct peaks at fields around 0.2
and 2.5T which are believed to be related to the strong spin-disorder
scattering occurring at the phase transition boundaries induced by external
magnetic field. An empirical magnetic phase diagram is deduced from the
temperature dependent experiment, and the anisotropic transport properties are
also presented for various magnetic field directions with respect to the
current flow.
