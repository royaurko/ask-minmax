We have obtained high spatial resolution temperature and abundance profiles
for the galaxy cluster Abell 2029 with the Chandra ACIS-S instrument. Our
observations reveal that the spectra are well-fit by a single-phase gas in each
annulus. While the temperature of the intracluster medium drops from ~9 keV at
3 arcmin (260 kpc) to 3 keV in the central 5 arcsec (5 kpc) of the cluster,
there is no evidence for gas emitting at temperatures below 3 keV. The addition
of a cooling flow component does not improve the fits, despite previous claims
for a massive cooling flow. There is also no evidence for excess absorption
above the Galactic N_H value. We also observe a steep Fe abundance gradient,
such that Z_Fe >= 2 Z_solar (assuming meteoritic solar Fe abundance) in the
core, consistent with significant enrichment from Fe-rich Type Ia supernovae in
the cD galaxy. The Fe abundance drops to ~0.5 Z_solar at 3 arcmin (260 kpc), in
good agreement with previous BeppoSAX measurements. The high resolution image
reveals neither a strong central point source, nor any filamentary structure
related to a cooling flow or a merger. The absence of a strong merger signature
argues against the creation of the wide-angle-tail radio source morphology in a
merger event. (modified for astro-ph).
