Doi proved that the $L^2_t H^{1/2}_x$ local smoothing effect for
Schr\"odinger equation on a Riemannian manifold does not hold if the geodesic
flow has one trapped trajectory. We show in contrast that Strichartz estimates
and $L^1\to L^\infty$ dispersive estimates still hold without loss for
$e^{it\Delta}$ in various situations where the trapped set is hyperbolic and of
sufficiently small fractal dimension.
