Fast thermalization, a subsequent strong buildup of elliptic flow of QCD
matter and jet-quenching as found at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
are understood as the consequence of perturbative QCD (pQCD) interactions
within the 3+1 dimensional parton cascade BAMPS. The main contributions stem
from pQCD inspired bremsstrahlung. Comparisons to Au+Au data of the flow
parameter v_2 as a function of participation number as well as the gluonic
contribution to the nuclear modification factor R_AA for most central
collisions are given. Also the shear viscosity to entropy ratio is dynamically
extracted, which lies in the range of 0.08-0.15, depending on the chosen
coupling constant.
