We introduce a new topological descriptor of a network called the density
decomposition which is a partition of the nodes of a network into regions of
uniform density. The decomposition we define is unique in the sense that a
given network has exactly one density decomposition. The number of nodes in
each partition defines a density distribution which we find is measurably
similar to the degree distribution of given real networks (social, internet,
etc.) and measurably dissimilar in synthetic networks (preferential attachment,
small world, etc.). We also show how to build networks having given density
distributions, which gives us further insight into the structure of real
networks.
