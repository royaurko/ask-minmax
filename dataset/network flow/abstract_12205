Besides the need for a better understanding of networks, there is a need for
prescriptive models and tools to specify requirements concerning networks and
their associated graph representations. We propose class-based graphs as a
means to specify requirements concerning object-based graphs. Various variants
of membership are proposed as special relations between class-based and
object-based graphs at the local level, while various variants of compliance
are proposed at the global level.
