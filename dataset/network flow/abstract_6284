In recent work we presented a new approach to the analysis of weighted
networks, by providing a straightforward generalization of any network measure
defined on unweighted networks. This approach is based on the translation of a
weighted network into an ensemble of edges, and is particularly suited to the
analysis of fully connected weighted networks. Here we apply our method to
several such networks including distance matrices, and show that the clustering
coefficient, constructed by using the ensemble approach, provides meaningful
insights into the systems studied. In the particular case of two data sets from
microarray experiments the clustering coefficient identifies a number of
biologically significant genes, outperforming existing identification
approaches.
