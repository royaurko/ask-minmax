We consider a plane channel flow of an electrically conducting fluid which is
driven by a mean pressure gradient in the presence of an applied magnetic field
that is streamwise periodic with zero mean. Magnetic flux expulsion and the
associated bifurcation in such a configuration is explored using direct
numerical simulations (DNS). The structure of the flow and magnetic fields in
the Hartmann regime (where the dominant balance is through Lorentz forces) and
the Poiseuille regime (where viscous effects play a significant role) are
studied and detailed comparisons to the existing one-dimensional model of
Kamkar and Moffatt (J. Fluid. Mech., Vol.90, pp 107-122, 1982) are drawn to
evaluate the validity of the model. Comparisons show good agreement of the
model with DNS in the Hartmann regime, but significant diferences arising in
the Poiseuille regime when non-linear effects become important. The effects of
various parameters like the magnetic Reynolds number, imposed field wavenumber
etc. on the bifurcation of the flow are studied. Magnetic field line
reconnections occuring during the dynamic runaway reveal a specific two-step
pattern that leads to the gradual expulsion of flux in the core region.
