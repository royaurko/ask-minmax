The goal is the development of a simultaneous, dynamic, technological as well
as logistical real-time planning and an organizational control of the
production by the production units themselves, working in the production
network under the use of Multi-Agent-Technology. The design of the
multi-agent-based manufacturing management system, the models of the single
agents, algorithms for the agent-based, decentralized dispatching of orders,
strategies and data management concepts as well as their integration into the
SCM, basing on the solution described, will be explained in the following.
