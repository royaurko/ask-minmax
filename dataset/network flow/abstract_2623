Recently, B.Chow and R.S.Hamilton introduced the cross curvature flow on
3-manifolds. In this paper, we analyze two interesting examples for this new
flow. One is on a square torus bundle over a circle, and the other is on a
$S^{2}$ bundle over a circle. We show that the global flow exist in both cases.
But on the former the flow diverges at time infinity, and on the latter the
flow converges at time infinity.
