We present a numerical study of the flow of an assembly of frictionless soft
discs at zero temperature, in the vicinity of and slightly above the jamming
density. We find that some of the flow properties, such as the fluctuations in
the number of contacts or the shear modulus, display a critical like behaviour
that is governed by the proximity to the jamming point. Dynamical correlations
during a quasistatic deformation, however, are non critical and dominated by
system size. At finite strain rates, these dynamical correlations acquire a
finite, strain-rate dependent amplitude, that decreases when approaching the
jamming point from above.
