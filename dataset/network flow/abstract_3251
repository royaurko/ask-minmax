Given any $K>0$, we construct two equivalent $C^2$ flows, one of which has
positive topological entropy larger than $K$ and admits zero as the exponential
growth of periodic orbits, in contrast, the other has zero topological entropy
and super-exponential growth of periodic orbits. Moreover we establish a
$C^{\infty}$ flow on $\mathbb{S}^2$ with super-exponential growth of periodic
orbits, which is also equivalent to another flow with zero exponential growth
of periodic orbits. On the other hand, any two dimensional flow has only zero
topological entropy.
