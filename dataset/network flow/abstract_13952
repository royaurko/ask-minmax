Arterial wall shear stress (WSS) parameters are widely used as prediction
criteria for the initiation and development of atherosclerosis and arterial
pathologies. However, clinical measurements of local WSS require complicated
and expensive techniques and therefore traditional clinical evaluation of
arterial condition relay mainly on flowrate and heart rate measurements. In
this manuscript we show that heart rate and flowrate measurements are not
sufficient for prediction of local WSS parameters and we suggest a third
parameter based on the local pulsatility index (PI). The study includes
experimental measurements of the flow profiles and WSS parameters of 16
different physiological flow waveforms in a straight arterial model. For each
case, the phase-averaged velocity profiles were measured using digital particle
image velocimetry techniques and were used to estimate WSS parameters utilizing
the Womersley pulsating flow model. The results show that heart rate and
flowrate parameters were not sufficient for prediction local WSS parameters for
the 16 cases, while PI parameter exhibited well one-to-one correlation with WSS
oscillatory index (OSI) and with the frequency of negative WSS occurrence
(P[%]). In addition it provide a lowest limit for the peak-to-peak WSS ratios
(min/max) for varying conditions. Therefore, PI was found to be an essential
parameter for the complete description of the local WSS quantities for arterial
flow.
