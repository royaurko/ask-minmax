We determined the frequency dependent effective permittivity of a large
ternary network of randomly positioned resistors, capacitors, and diodes. A
linear circuit analysis of such systems is shown to match the experimental
dielectric response of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) filled polymers.
This modeling method is able to reproduce the two most important features of
SWCNT filled composites, i.e. the low frequency dispersion and dipolar
relaxation. As a result of the modeling important physical conclusion proved by
the experimental data was done: the low frequency behavior of SWCNT-filled
polymer composites is mostly caused by the fraction of semiconducting SWCNTs.
