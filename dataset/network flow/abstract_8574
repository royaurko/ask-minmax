We review the properties and evolution of strings networks containing both a
spectrum of string tensions as well as Y-junctions, namely a point at which
three different strings meet. Such a situation is expected in cosmic
superstring networks, where the tension of the different strings is determined
by the fundamental string tension $\mu_F$ as well as the string coupling $g_s$.
We discuss evolution of such a network, and the proliferation of kinks as they
travel through junctions. These effects can leave observational signals on
B-modes and gravitational waves, which can then in turn constrain the
underlying parameters of the theory.
