The transport capacity of a dense ad hoc network with n nodes scales like
\sqrt(n). We show that the transport capacity divided by \sqrt(n) approaches a
non-random limit with probability one when the nodes are i.i.d. distributed on
the unit square. We prove that the transport capacity under the protocol model
is a subadditive Euclidean functional and use the machinery of subadditive
functions in the spirit of Steele to show the existence of the limit.
