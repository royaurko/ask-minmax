When a plate is withdrawn from a liquid bath a coating layer is deposited
whose thickness and homogeneity depend on the velocity and the wetting
properties of the plate. Using a long-wave mesoscopic hydrodynamic description
that incorporates wettability via a Derjaguin (disjoining) pressure we identify
four qualitatively different dynamic transitions between microscopic and
macroscopic coatings that are out-of-equilibrium equivalents of well known
equilibrium unbinding transitions. Namely, these are continuous and
discontinuous dynamic emptying transitions and discontinuous and continuous
dynamic wetting transitions. We uncover several features that have no
equivalent at equilibrium.
