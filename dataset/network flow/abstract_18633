In order to gather information more efficiently, wireless sensor networks
(WSNs) are partitioned into clusters. Most proposed clustering algorithms do
not consider the location of the base station. This situation causes hot spot
problems in multi-hop WSNs. In this paper, we analyze a fuzzy clustering
algorithm (FCA) which aims to prolong the lifetime of WSNs. This algorithm
adjusts the cluster-head radius considering the residual energy and distance to
the base station parameters of the sensor nodes. This helps to decrease the
intra-cluster work of the sensor nodes which are closer to the base station or
have lower battery level. Fuzzy logic is utilized for handling the
uncertainties in cluster-head radius estimation. We compare this algorithm with
the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm according to the
parameters of first node dies half of the nodes alive and energy-efficiency
metrics. Our simulation results show that the fuzzy clustering approach
performs better than LEACH. Therefore, the FCA is a stable and energy-efficient
clustering algorithm.
