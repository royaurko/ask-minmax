The angular correlations measured in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV are
decomposed into contributions from back to back emission and elliptic flow.
Modeling the dominant term in the correlation functions as a momentum
conservation effect or as an effect of the initial transverse velocity of the
source, the remaining elliptic flow component can be estimated. The elliptic
flow coefficient extracted from the CMS Collaboration data is 0.04-0.08. No
additional small-angle, ridge-like correlations are needed to explain the
experimental data.
