We study the stability of wireless networks under stochastic arrival
processes of packets, and design efficient, distributed algorithms that achieve
stability in the SINR (Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio) interference
model.
  Specifically, we make the following contributions. We give a distributed
algorithm that achieves $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log^2 n})$-efficiency on all networks
(where $n$ is the number of links in the network), for all length monotone,
sub-linear power assignments. For the power control version of the problem, we
give a distributed algorithm with $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n(\log n + \log \log
\Delta)})$-efficiency (where $\Delta$ is the length diversity of the link set).
