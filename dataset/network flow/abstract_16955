Cloaking using a volumetric structure composed of stacked two-dimensional
transmission-line networks is verified with measurements. The measurements are
done in a waveguide, in which an array of metallic cylinders is inserted
causing a short-circuit in the waveguide. The metal cylinders are cloaked using
a previously designed and simulated cloak that hides the cylinders and thus
enables wave propagation inside the waveguide.
