We explore both analytically and numerically an ensemble of coupled
phase-oscillators governed by a Kuramoto-type system of differential equations.
However, we have included the effects of time-delay (due to finite
signal-propagation speeds) and network plasticity (via dynamic coupling
constants) inspired by the Hebbian learning rule in neuroscience. When
time-delay and learning effects combine, novel synchronization phenomena are
observed. We investigate the formation of spatio-temporal patterns in both one-
and two-dimensional oscillator lattices with periodic boundary conditions and
comment on the role of dimensionality.
