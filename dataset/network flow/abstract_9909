Nontrivial steady flows have recently been found that capture the main
structures of the turbulent buffer layer. We study the effects of polymer
addition on these "exact coherent states" (ECS) in plane Couette flow. Despite
the simplicity of the ECS flows, these effects closely mirror those observed
experimentally: Structures shift to larger length scales, wall-normal
fluctuations are suppressed while streamwise ones are enhanced, and drag is
reduced. The mechanism underlying these effects is elucidated. These results
suggest that the ECS are closely related to buffer layer turbulence.
