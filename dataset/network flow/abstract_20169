We present recent results on the production, spectra and elliptic flow of
strange particles in dynamic simulations employing hadronic degrees of freedom
and from recombination models. The main focus will be on the Ultra-relativistic
Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) Boltzmann approach to relativistic heavy ion
collisions and a hybrid approach with intermediate hydrodynamic evolution based
on UrQMD (available for download as UrQMD v3.3). Compared to the standard
binary collision approach, an enhancement of the strange particle particle
yields is found in the hybrid approach due to the assumption of local
equilibration. The production origins of the Phi-meson in the hybrid approach
are studied in further detail. We also present results on the transverse
momentum spectra of baryon to meson ratios of strange particles. Due to the
approximate energy independent scaling of this ratio as a function of p_T we
argue, that a maximum in these spectra may not be a unique sign for quark
coalescence but can be understood in terms of flow and fragmentation.
