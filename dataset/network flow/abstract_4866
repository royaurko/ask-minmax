Speculative optimisation relies on the estimation of the probabilities that
certain properties of the control flow are fulfilled. Concrete or estimated
branch probabilities can be used for searching and constructing advantageous
speculative and bookkeeping transformations.
  We present a probabilistic extension of the classical equational approach to
data-flow analysis that can be used to this purpose. More precisely, we show
how the probabilistic information introduced in a control flow graph by branch
prediction can be used to extract a system of linear equations from a program
and present a method for calculating correct (numerical) solutions.
