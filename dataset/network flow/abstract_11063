In this paper, we introduce a modified epidemic model on regular and
scale-free networks respectively. We consider the birth rate $\delta$, cure
rate $\gamma$, infection rate $\lambda$, $\alpha$ from the infectious disease,
and death rate $\beta$ from other factors. Through mean-field analysis, we find
that on regular network there is an epidemic threshold $\lambda_{c}$ dependent
on the parameters $\delta$, $\gamma$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$; while for power
law degree distribution network epidemic threshold is absent in the
thermodynamic limit. The result is the same as that of the standard SIS model.
This reminds us the structure of the networks plays a very important role in
the spreading property of the infectious disease.
