It is shown that most, but not all, of the four dimensional metrics in the
Multi-Centre family with integrable geodesic flow may be recognized as
belonging to spatially homogeneous Bianchi type A metrics. We show that any
diagonal bi-axial Bianchi II metric has an integrable geodesic flow, and that
the simplest hyperk\"ahler metric in this family displays a finite dimensional
W-algebra for its observables. Our analysis puts also to light non-diagonal
Bianchi VI$_0$ and VII$_0$ metrics which seem to be new. We conclude by showing
that the elliptic coordinates advocated in the literature do not separate the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the tri-axial Bianchi IX metric.
