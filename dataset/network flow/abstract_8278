This article presents a hub-based approach to community finding in complex
networks. After identifying the network nodes with highest degree (the
so-called hubs), the network is flooded with wavefronts of labels emanating
from the hubs, accounting for the identification of the involved communities.
The simplicity and potential of this method, which is presented for
direct/undirected and weighted/unweighted networks, is illustrated with respect
to the Zachary karate club data, image segmentation, and concept association.
Attention is also given to the identification of the boundaries between
communities.
