The thin-liquid film drainage between two curved surfaces is a fundamental
process for many hydrodynamic measurements, for which Vinogradova's formula has
played a central role when flow slip occurs at fluid-solid interfaces. By
performing a rigorous order-of-magnitude analysis, we reveal the importance of
the curvature contribution to boundary flow, neglected sofar. Vinogradova's
result is found to considerably underestimate the slip-induced reduction of the
hydrodynamic drainage force. Our theory can play a crucial role in
distinguishing finite-slip from no-slip and quantifying the degree of flow slip
at fluid-solid surfaces, which is a fundamental but controversial issue in
fluid dynamics. Moreover, qualitatively different from previous theories, our
theory predicts a finite hydrodynamic repulsive force for two hydrophobic
particles in touch, thus allowing particle collision to occur in a finite time
without any additional attractive surface forces. This finding has deep and
immediate implications on particle coagulation, adsorption and sedimentation
processes relevant for numerous industrial technologies as well as natural
phenomena on the earth.
