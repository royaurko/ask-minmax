Robustness and sensitivity of responses generated by cell signaling networks
has been associated with survival and evolvability of organisms. However,
existing methods analyzing robustness and sensitivity of signaling networks
ignore the experimentally observed cell-to-cell variations of protein
abundances and cell functions or contain ad hoc assumptions. We propose and
apply a data driven Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based method to quantify
robustness and sensitivity of Escherichia coli (E. coli) chemotaxis signaling
network. Our analysis correctly rank orders different models of E. coli
chemotaxis based on their robustness and suggests that parameters regulating
cell signaling are evolutionary selected to vary in individual cells according
to their abilities to perturb cell functions. Furthermore, predictions from our
approach regarding distribution of protein abundances and properties of
chemotactic responses in individual cells based on cell population averaged
data are in excellent agreement with their experimental counterparts. Our
approach is general and can be used to evaluate robustness as well as generate
predictions of single cell properties based on population averaged experimental
data in a wide range of cell signaling systems.
