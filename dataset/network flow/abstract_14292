We introduce a class of simple models for shear thickening and/ or `jamming'
in colloidal suspensions. These are based on schematic mode coupling theory
(MCT) of the glass transition, having a memory term that depends on a density
variable, and on both the shear stress and the shear rate. (Tensorial aspects
of the rheology, such as normal stresses, are ignored for simplicity.) We
calculate steady-state flow curves and correlation functions. Depending on
model parameters, we find a range of rheological behaviours, including
`S-shaped' flow curves, indicating discontinuous shear thickening, and
stress-induced transitions from a fluid to a nonergodic (jammed) state, showing
zero flow rate in an interval of applied stress. The shear thickening and
jamming scenarios that we explore appear broadly consistent with experiments on
dense colloids close to the glass transition, despite the fact that we ignore
hydrodynamic interactions. In particular, the jamming transition we propose is
conceptually quite different from various hydrodynamic mechanisms of shear
thickening in the literature, although the latter might remain pertinent at
lower colloid densities. Our jammed state is a stress-induced glass, but its
nonergodicity transitions have an analytical structure distinct from that of
the conventional MCT glass transition.
