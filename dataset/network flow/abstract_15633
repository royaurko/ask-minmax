This paper presents the first network-coded multiple access (NCMA) system
operated on higher-order modulations beyond BPSK. NCMA allows multiple nodes to
transmit simultaneously to an access point (AP) to boost throughput of wireless
local area networks (WLAN): the key idea is to jointly exploit multiuser
decoding (MUD) and physical-layer network coding (PNC). High-order modulations
are commonly adopted in WLAN systems when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
medium or high. However, direct generalization of the existing NCMA decoding
algorithm, originally designed for BPSK, to higher-order modulations will lead
to huge performance degradation. We find that the throughput degradation is
caused by the relative phase offset between received signals from different
nodes. To circumvent the throughput degradation, this paper investigates an
NCMA system with multiple receive antennas at the AP, referred to as MIMO-NCMA.
We have implemented MIMO-NCMA on software-defined radios. Our experimental
results show that, at SNR of 10dB, the throughput of MIMO-NCMA outperforms
single-antenna NCMA and conventional distributed MIMO-MUD, respectively. We
believe that MIMO-NCMA throughput can be further improved with modulations
beyond QPSK (e.g., 64-QAM).
