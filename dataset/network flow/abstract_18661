Due to mobility of nodes in ad hoc networks, the most challenging issue is to
design and to make sound analysis of a routing protocol that determines its
robustness to deliver packets in low routing packet overhead. In this paper, we
thoroughly analyzed the Adaptive Monitor Based Routing (AMBR) protocol by
varying different parameters that affect a routing protocol to measure its
performance. Analysis shows that it requires less routing control overhead
comparing with other prevalent routing protocols. An improved analytical model
is also presented in this paper. All these analyses firmly prove that AMBR is a
sound and robust protocol in terms of flooding, routing overhead and hence,
enhances reliability.
