We report on some recent developments in the search for optimal network
topologies. First we review some basic concepts on spectral graph theory,
including adjacency and Laplacian matrices, and paying special attention to the
topological implications of having large spectral gaps. We also introduce
related concepts as ``expanders'', Ramanujan, and Cage graphs. Afterwards, we
discuss two different dynamical feautures of networks: synchronizability and
flow of random walkers and so that they are optimized if the corresponding
Laplacian matrix have a large spectral gap. From this, we show, by developing a
numerical optimization algorithm that maximum synchronizability and fast random
walk spreading are obtained for a particular type of extremely homogeneous
regular networks, with long loops and poor modular structure, that we call
entangled networks. These turn out to be related to Ramanujan and Cage graphs.
We argue also that these graphs are very good finite-size approximations to
Bethe lattices, and provide almost or almost optimal solutions to many other
problems as, for instance, searchability in the presence of congestion or
performance of neural networks. Finally, we study how these results are
modified when studying dynamical processes controlled by a normalized (weighted
and directed) dynamics; much more heterogeneous graphs are optimal in this
case. Finally, a critical discussion of the limitations and possible extensions
of this work is presented.
