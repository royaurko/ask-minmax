We show how the bosonic spectral action emerges from the fermionic action by
the renormalization group flow in the presence of a dilaton and the Weyl
anomaly. The induced action comes out to be basically the Chamseddine-Connes
spectral action introduced in the context of noncommutative geometry. The
entire spectral action describes gauge and Higgs fields coupled with gravity.
We then consider the effective potential and show, that it has the desired
features of a broken and an unbroken phase, with the roll down.
