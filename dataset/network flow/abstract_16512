Star clusters with a high central density contain an ecological network of
evolving binaries, affected by interactions with passing stars, while in turn
affecting the energy budget of the cluster as a whole by giving off binding
energy. This is the first paper in a series aimed at providing the tools for
increasingly realistic simulations of these ecological networks.
