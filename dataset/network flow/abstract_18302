This paper discusses the advent of new technologies which have emerged under
the area of Location Based Services (LBS). An innovative implementation and
approach has been presented for design of applications which are inventive and
attractive towards the user. Spatial Trigger is one of the most promising
additions to the LBS technologies. This paper describes ways in which mobile
advertisement services can be introduced effectively in the cellular market by
bringing innovation in them through effective usage of Spatial Triggers. Hence,
opening new horizons to make the consumer cellular networks, commercially, more
effective and informative.
