This paper is concerned with a conservation law model of traffic flow on a
network of roads, where each driver chooses his own departure time in order to
minimize the sum of a departure cost and an arrival cost. The model includes
various groups of drivers, with different origins and destinations and having
different cost functions. Under a natural set of assumptions, two main results
are proved: (i) the existence of a globally optimal solution, minimizing the
sum of the costs to all drivers, and (ii) the existence of a Nash equilibrium
solution, where no driver can lower his own cost by changing his departure time
or the route taken to reach destination. In the case of Nash solutions, all
departure rates are uniformly bounded and have compact support.
