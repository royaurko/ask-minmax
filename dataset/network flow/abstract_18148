We present different classes of solutions to the Firing Squad Synchronization
Problem on networks of different shapes. The nodes are finite state processors
that work at unison discrete steps. The networks considered are the line, the
ring and the square. For all of these models we have considered one and two-way
communication modes and also constrained the quantity of information that
adjacent processors can exchange each step. We are given a particular time
expressed as a function of the number of nodes of the network, $f(n)$ and
present synchronization algorithms in time $n^2$, $n \log n$, $n\sqrt n$,
$2^n$. The solutions are presented as {\em signals} that are used as building
blocks to compose new solutions for all times expressed by polynomials with
nonnegative coefficients.
