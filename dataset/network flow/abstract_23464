Stress paths in granular matter often suffer sudden large-scale
rearrangements when the system is slightly perturbed, i.e. granular systems are
unstable. We show in this paper that the observed instability is due to the
minimally rigid, or isostatic, character of the system's contact network. It is
first demonstrated that the contact network of a granular packing becomes
isostatic (minimally rigid) in any dimension in the limit of large
stiffness-to-load ratio. We next show that, in this isostatic limit, the
load-stress response function becomes power-law distributed and takes
exponentially large (growing as exp(H) where H is the system's height) positive
and negative values. Large negative values of the load-stress response function
imply instability, since only positive (compressive) stresses are allowed in
non-cohesive granular packings. Thus there is an isostatic phase transition in
the limit of large stiffness (or small load), and the resulting isostatic phase
has an anomalously large susceptibility to perturbation.
