Many biochemical processes can successfully be described by dynamical systems
allowing some form of switching when, depending on their initial conditions,
solutions of the dynamical system end up in different regions of state space
(associated with different biochemical functions). Switching is often realized
by a bistable system (i.e. a dynamical system allowing two stable steady state
solutions) and, in the majority of cases, bistability is established
numerically. In our point of view this approach is too restrictive, as, one the
one hand, due to predominant parameter uncertainty numerical methods are
generally difficult to apply to realistic models originating in Systems
Biology. And on the other hand switching already arises with the occurrence of
a saddle type steady state (characterized by a Jacobian where exactly one
Eigenvalue is positive and the remaining eigenvalues have negative real part).
Consequently we derive conditions based on linear inequalities that allow the
analytic computation of states and parameters where the Jacobian derived from a
mass action network has a defective zero eigenvalue so that -- under certain
genericity conditions -- a saddle-node bifurcation occurs. Our conditions are
applicable to general mass action networks involving at least one conservation
relation, however, they are only sufficient (as infeasibility of linear
inequalities does not exclude defective zero eigenvalues).
