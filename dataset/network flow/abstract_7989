Stationary, inviscid, axi-symmetric, rotating, transonic accretion flow has
been studied in a general relativistic framework, in the Schwarzschild metric;
for three different flow geometries - under both polytropic and isothermal
conditions. The equilibrium points of the underlying fluid system have been
located and an eigenvalue based linear dynamical systems analysis of these
critical points has been carried out, to obtain a taxonomic scheme of the
critical points. It has hence been shown that only saddle and centre type
points can arise for real, physical transonic flow.
