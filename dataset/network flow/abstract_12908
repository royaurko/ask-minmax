The response of a field-stabilized two-dimensional smectic to shear stress is
discussed. Below a critical temperature the smectic film exhibits elastic
response to an infinitesimal shear stress normal to the layering. At finite
stresses free dislocations nucleate and relax the applied stress. The coupling
of the dislocation current to the stress results in non-newtonian viscous flow.
The flow profile in a channel geometry is shown to change qualitatively from a
power-law dependence to a Poiseuille-like profile opon increasing the pressure
head.
