Performance of cooperative diversity schemes at Low Signal to Noise Ratios
(LSNR) was recently studied by Avestimehr et. al. [1] who emphasized the
importance of diversity gain over multiplexing gain at low SNRs. It has also
been pointed out that continuous energy transfer to the channel is necessary
for achieving the max-flow min-cut bound at LSNR. Motivated by this we propose
the use of Selection Decode and Forward (SDF) at LSNR and analyze its
performance in terms of the outage probability. We also propose an energy
optimization scheme which further brings down the outage probability.
