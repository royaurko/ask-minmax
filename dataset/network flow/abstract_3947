It is shown that a greedy orthogonal access scheme achieves the sum degrees
of freedom of all one-dimensional (all nodes placed along a straight line)
convex cellular networks (where cells are convex regions) when no channel
knowledge is available at the transmitters except the knowledge of the network
topology. In general, optimality of orthogonal access holds neither for
two-dimensional convex cellular networks nor for one-dimensional non-convex
cellular networks, thus revealing a fundamental limitation that exists only
when both one-dimensional and convex properties are simultaneously enforced, as
is common in canonical information theoretic models for studying cellular
networks. The result also establishes the capacity of the corresponding class
of index coding problems.
