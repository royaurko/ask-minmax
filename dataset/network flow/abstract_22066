We construct an auto-validated algorithm that calculates a close to identity
change of variables which brings a general saddle point into a normal form. The
transformation is robust in the underlying vector field, and is analytic on a
computable neighborhood of the saddle point. The normal form is suitable for
computations aimed at enclosing the flow close to the saddle, and the time it
takes a trajectory to pass it. Several examples illustrate the usefulness of
this method.
