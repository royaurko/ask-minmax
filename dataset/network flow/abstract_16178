We present local velocity measurements in emulsions under shear using
heterodyne Dynamic Light Scattering. Two emulsions are studied: a dilute system
of volume fraction $\phi=20$ % and a concentrated system with $\phi=75$ %.
Velocity profiles in both systems clearly show the presence of wall slip. We
investigate the evolution of slip velocities as a function of shear stress and
discuss the validity of the corrections for wall slip classically used in
rheology. Focussing on the bulk flow, we show that the dilute system is
Newtonian and that the concentrated emulsion is shear-thinning. In the latter
case, the curvature of the velocity profiles is compatible with a
shear-thinning exponent of 0.4 consistent with global rheological data.
However, even if individual profiles can be accounted for by a power-law fluid
(with or without a yield stress), we could not find a fixed set of parameters
that would fit the whole range of applied shear rates. Our data thus raise the
question of the definition of a global flow curve for such a concentrated
system. These results show that local measurements are a crucial complement to
standard rheological tools. They are discussed in light of recent works on soft
glassy materials.
