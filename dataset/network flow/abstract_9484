We propose a joint source-channel-network coding scheme, based on compressive
sensing principles, for wireless networks with AWGN channels (that may include
multiple access and broadcast), with sources exhibiting temporal and spatial
dependencies. Our goal is to provide a reconstruction of sources within an
allowed distortion level at each receiver. We perform joint source-channel
coding at each source by randomly projecting source values to a lower
dimensional space. We consider sources that satisfy the restricted eigenvalue
(RE) condition as well as more general sources for which the randomness of the
network allows a mapping to lower dimensional spaces. Our approach relies on
using analog random linear network coding. The receiver uses compressive
sensing decoders to reconstruct sources. Our key insight is the fact that,
compressive sensing and analog network coding both preserve the source
characteristics required for compressive sensing decoding.
