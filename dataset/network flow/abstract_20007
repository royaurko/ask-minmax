We consider a coupled system of Navier-Stokes and Nernst-Planck equations,
describing the evolution of the velocity and the concentration fields of
dissolved constituents in an electrolyte solution. Motivated by recent
applications in the field of micro- and nanofluidics, we consider the model in
such generality that electrokinetic flows are included. This prohibits
employing the assumption of electroneutrality of the total solution, which is a
common approach in the mathematical literature in order to determine the
electrical potential. Therefore we complement the system of mass and momentum
balances with a Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential, with the
charge density stemming from the concentrations of the ionic species. For the
resulting Navier-Stokes-Nernst-Planck-Poisson system we prove the existence of
unique local strong solutions in bounded domains in $\R^n$ for any $n\geq2$ as
well as the existence of unique global strong solutions and exponential
convergence to uniquely determined steady states in two dimensions.
