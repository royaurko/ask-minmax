This sequence of fluid dynamics videos illustrates the behavior of a
suspension of noncolloidal particles flowing past various bluff body obstacles
within a microfluidic device. The polystyrene particles, of 7 {\mu}m diameter
and volume fraction of 8.4%, are carefully made neutrally buoyant with the
suspending liquid composed of a mixture of water and a small fraction of
glycerol. The channel depth is 60 {\mu}m and the typical length of the
obstacles normal to the flow direction is 200 {\mu}m. The flow rate is varied
to generate Reynolds numbers based on the scale of the obstacle in the
approximate range 60 < Re < 500; the narrow dimension in the depth direction
suppresses onset of unsteadiness and vortex shedding, so that the flows studied
are found to be steady (aside from particle-scale fluctuations). Particles are
observed to be depleted in the wake region of the obstacle. In certain cases,
the entire wake is clear of particles; in other cases there is a portion of the
wake in which particles recirculate while a portion of the wake is completely
devoid of particles. Experimental observations reveal that if particles are
forced into an initially particle-depleted region, they will eventually leave
and will bring the wake to its original state, implying these are steady-state
distributions.
