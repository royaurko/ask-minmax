We describe the complex poles of the power spectrum of correlations for the
geodesic flow on compact hyperbolic manifolds in terms of eigenvalues of the
Laplacian acting on certain natural tensor bundles. These poles are a special
case of Pollicott-Ruelle resonances, which can be defined for general Anosov
flows. In our case, resonances are stratified into bands by decay rates. The
proof also gives an explicit relation between resonant states and eigenstates
of the Laplacian.
