We present a new scheme for solving Navier-Stokes systems. This is inspired
by material differentiation and combined with discrete Morse semi-flow.
  The solution has the first energy inequality, we set some assumption though.
  This result crucially does not provide any new result, but I believe that by
making my scheme is more sophisticated, we can develop the study of
Navier-Stokes systems.
