A one-dimensional model of inertial pumping is introduced and solved. The
pump is driven by a high-pressure vapor bubble generated by a microheater
positioned asymmetrically in a microchannel. The bubble is approximated as a
short-term impulse delivered to the two fluidic columns inside the channel.
Fluid dynamics is described by a Newton-like equation with a variable mass, but
without the mass derivative term. Because of smaller inertia, the short column
refills the channel faster and accumulates a larger mechanical momentum. After
bubble collapse the total fluid momentum is nonzero, resulting in a net flow.
Two different versions of the model are analyzed in detail, analytically and
numerically. In the symmetrical model, the pressure at the channel-reservoir
connection plane is assumed constant, whereas in the asymmetrical model it is
reduced by a Bernoulli term. For low and intermediate vapor bubble pressures,
both models predict the existence of an optimal microheater location. The
predicted net flow in the asymmetrical model is smaller by a factor of about 2.
For unphysically large vapor pressures, the asymmetrical model predicts
saturation of the effect, while in the symmetrical model net flow increases
indefinitely. Pumping is reduced by nonzero viscosity, but to a different
degree depending on the microheater location.
