Persistence and permanence are properties of dynamical systems that describe
the long-term behavior of the solutions, and in particular specify whether
positive solutions approach the boundary of the positive orthant. Mass-action
systems (or more generally power-law systems) are very common in chemistry,
biology, and engineering, and are often used to describe the dynamics in
interaction networks. We prove that two-species mass-action systems derived
from weakly reversible networks are both persistent and permanent, for any
values of the reaction rate parameters. Moreover, we prove that a larger class
of networks, called endotactic networks, also give rise to permanent systems,
even if we allow the reaction rate parameters to vary in time. These results
also apply to power-law systems and other nonlinear dynamical systems. In
addition, ideas behind these results allow us to prove the Global Attractor
Conjecture for three-species systems.
