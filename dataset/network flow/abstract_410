Complex, dynamic networks underlie many systems, and understanding these
networks is the concern of a great span of important scientific and engineering
problems. Quantitative description is crucial for this understanding yet, due
to a range of measurement problems, many real network datasets are incomplete.
Here we explore how accidentally missing or deliberately hidden nodes may be
detected in networks by the effect of their absence on predictions of the speed
with which information flows through the network. We use Symbolic Regression
(SR) to learn models relating information flow to network topology. These
models show localized, systematic, and non-random discrepancies when applied to
test networks with intentionally masked nodes, demonstrating the ability to
detect the presence of missing nodes and where in the network those nodes are
likely to reside.
