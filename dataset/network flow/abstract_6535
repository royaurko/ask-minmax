In recent years the concept of the effective capacity that relates the
physical layer characteristics of a wireless channel to the data link layer has
gained a lot of attraction in wireless networking research community. The
effective capacity is based on G\"artner-Ellis' large deviation theorem and it
is used to provide the statistical QoS provisioning in the wireless networks.
Effective capacity also helps in the analysis of the resource allocation or
scheduling policies in various wireless systems such as Relay networks,
multi-user systems and multi-carrier systems subject to statistical QoS
requirements. The effective capacity in noise limited wireless network has
already been investigated in the recent works. Considering the interference
limited wireless channels, in this paper we propose an analytical approach
based on Laplace's method for the effective capacity of uncorrelated Rayleigh
fading channel in the presence of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading interference.
The accuracy of the analytical model for the effective capacity is validated by
numerical simulations. We also provide the evaluation of tail probability of
the delay and maximum sustainable rate. The validation results reveal that the
proposed mathematical approach to the effective capacity can open the path for
further researches in statistical QoS provisioning in interference limited
wireless networks.
