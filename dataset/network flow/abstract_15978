Network covert channels are used to hide communication inside network
protocols. Within the last decades, various techniques for covert channels
arose. We surveyed and analyzed 109 techniques developed between 1987 and 2013
and show that these techniques can be reduced to only 11 different patterns.
Moreover, the majority (69.7%) of techniques can be categorized in only four
different patterns, i.e. most of the techniques we surveyed are very similar.
We represent the patterns in a hierarchical catalog using a pattern language.
Our pattern catalog will serve as a base for future covert channel novelty
evaluation. Furthermore, we apply the concept of pattern variations to network
covert channels. With pattern variations, the context of a pattern can change.
For example, a channel developed for IPv4 can automatically be adapted to other
network protocols. We also propose the pattern-based covert channel
optimizations pattern hopping and pattern combination. Finally, we lay the
foundation for pattern-based countermeasures: While many current
countermeasures were developed for specific channels, a pattern-oriented
approach allows to apply one countermeasure to multiple channels. Hence, future
countermeasure development can focus on patterns, and the development of
real-world protection against covert channels is greatly simplified.
