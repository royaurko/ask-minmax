Benes networks are constructed with simple switch modules and have many
advantages, including small latency and requiring only an almost linear number
of switch modules. As circuit-switches, Benes networks are rearrangeably
non-blocking, which implies that they are full-throughput as packet switches,
with suitable routing.
  Routing in Benes networks can be done by time-sharing permutations. However,
this approach requires centralized control of the switch modules and
statistical knowledge of the traffic arrivals. We propose a backpressure-based
routing scheme for Benes networks, combined with end-to-end congestion control.
This approach achieves the maximal utility of the network and requires only
four queues per module, independently of the size of the network.
