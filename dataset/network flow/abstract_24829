One of the main challenges facing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the
limited power resources available at small sensor nodes. It is therefore
desired to reduce the power consumption of sensors while keeping the distortion
between the source information and its estimate at the fusion centre (FC) below
a specific threshold. In this paper, given the channel state information at the
FC, we propose a subset selection algorithm of sensor nodes to reduce the
average transmission power of the WSN. We assume the channels between the
source and the sensors to be correlated fading channels, modeled by the
Gilbert-Elliott model. We show that when these channels are known at the FC, a
subset of sensors can be selected by the FC such that the received observations
from this subset is sufficient to estimate the source information at the FC
while maintaining the distortion between source information and its estimate
below a specific threshold. Through analyses, we find the probability
distribution of the size of this subset and provide results to evaluate the
power efficiency of our proposed algorithm.
