The paper is devoted to studying the stochastic nonlinear wave (NLW) equation
in a bounded domain D $\subset$ R3. We show that the Markov process associated
with the flow of solution has a unique stationary measure $\mu$, and the law of
any solution converges to $\mu$ with exponential rate in the dual-Lipschitz
norm
