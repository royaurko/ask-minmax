The dimensionality of turbulence in fluid layers determines their properties.
We study electromagnetically driven flows in finite depth fluid layers and show
that eddy viscosity, which appears as a result of three-dimensional motions,
leads to increased bottom damping. The anomaly coefficient, which characterizes
the deviation of damping from the one derived using a quasi-two-dimensional
model, can be used as a measure of the flow dimensionality. Experiments in
turbulent layers show that when the anomaly coefficient becomes high, the
turbulent inverse energy cascade is suppressed. In the opposite limit
turbulence can self-organize into a coherent flow.
