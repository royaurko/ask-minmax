We report measurements of conditional Eulerian and Lagrangian structure
functions in order to assess the effects of non-universal properties of the
large scales on the small scales in turbulence. We study a 1m $\times$ 1m
$\times$ 1.5m flow between oscillating grids which produces $R_\lambda=285$
while containing regions of nearly homogeneous and highly inhomogeneous
turbulence. Large data sets of three-dimensional tracer particle velocities
have been collected using stereoscopic high speed cameras with real-time image
compression technology. Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions are
measured in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous regions of the flow. We
condition the structure functions on the instantaneous large scale velocity or
on the grid phase. At all scales, the structure functions depend strongly on
the large scale velocity, but are independent of the grid phase. We see clear
signatures of inhomogeneity near the oscillating grids, but even in the
homogeneous region in the center we see a surprisingly strong dependence on the
large scale velocity that remains at all scales. Previous work has shown that
similar correlations extend to very high Reynolds numbers. Comprehensive
measurements of these effects in a laboratory flow provide a powerful tool for
assessing the effects of shear, inhomogeneity and intermittency of the large
scales on the small scales in turbulence.
