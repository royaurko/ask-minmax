The transient behavior of an ecosystem with N random interacting species in
the presence of a multiplicative noise is analyzed. The multiplicative noise
mimics the interaction with the environment. We investigate different
asymptotic dynamical regimes and the role of the external noise on the
probability distribution of the local field.
