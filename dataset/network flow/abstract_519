We introduce a general method to infer the directional information flow
between populations whose elements are described by n-dimensional vectors of
symbolic attributes. The method is based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence and
on the Shannon entropy and has a wide range of application. We show here the
results of two applications: first extracting the network of genetic flow
between the meadows of the seagrass Poseidonia Oceanica, where the meadow
elements are specified by sets of microsatellite markers, then we extract the
semantic flow network from a set of Wikipedia pages, showing the semantic
channels between different areas of knowledge.
