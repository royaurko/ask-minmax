Sunspots, which harbor both magnetic polarities within one penumbra, are
called delta-spots. They are often associated with flares. Nevertheless, there
are only very few detailed observations of the spatially resolved magnetic
field configuration. We present an investigation performed with the Tenerife
Infrared Polarimeter at the Vacuum Tower Telescope in Tenerife. We observed a
sunspot with a main umbra and several additional umbral cores, one of them with
opposite magnetic polarity (the delta-umbra). The delta-spot is divided into
two parts by a line along which central emissions of the spectral line Ca II
854.2 nm appear. The Evershed flow comming from the main umbra ends at this
line. In deep photospheric layers, we find an almost vertical magnetic field
for the delta-umbra, and the magnetic field decreases rapidly with height,
faster than in the main umbra. The horizontal magnetic field in the direction
connecting main and delta-umbra is rather smooth, but in one location next to a
bright penumbral feature at some distance to the delta-umbra, we encounter a
change of the magnetic azimuth by 90 degrees from one pixel to the next. Near
the delta-umbra, but just outside, we encounter a blue-shift of the spectral
line profiles which we interpret as Evershed flow away from the delta-umbra.
Significant electric current densities are observed at the dividing line of the
spot and inside the delta-umbra.
