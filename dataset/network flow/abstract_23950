We study the asymptotic scaling properties of standard domain wall networks
in several cosmological epochs. We carry out the largest field theory
simulations achieved to date, with simulation boxes of size 20483, and confirm
that a scale-invariant evolution of the network is indeed the attractor
solution. The simulations are also used to obtain an accurate calibration for
the velocity-dependent one-scale model for domain walls: we numerically
determine the two free model parameters to have the values $c_w = 0.34\pm0.16$
and $k_w = 0.98\pm0.07$, which are higher precision than (but in agreement
with) earlier estimates.
