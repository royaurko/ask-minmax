Understanding key structural properties of large scale networks are crucial
for analyzing and optimizing their performance, and improving their reliability
and security. Here we show that these networks possess a previously unnoticed
feature, global curvature, which we argue has a major impact on core
congestion: the load at the core of a network with N nodes scales as N^2 as
compared to N^1.5 for a flat network. We substantiate this claim through
analysis of a collection of real data networks across the globe as measured and
documented by previous researchers.
