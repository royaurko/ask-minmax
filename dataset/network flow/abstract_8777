In this paper, we compute universal minimal flows of groups of automorphisms
of uncountable $\omega$-homogeneous graphs, $K_n$-free graphs, hypergraphs,
partially ordered sets, and their extensions with an $\omega$-homogeneous
ordering. We present an easy construction of such structures, expanding the
jungle of extremely amenable groups.
