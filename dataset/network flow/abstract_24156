Attacks on information systems followed by intrusions may cause large revenue
losses. The prevention of both is not always possible by just considering
information from isolated sources of the network. A global view of the whole
system is necessary to recognize and react to the different actions of such an
attack. The design and deployment of a decentralized system targeted at
detecting as well as reacting to information system attacks might benefit from
the loose coupling realized by publish/subscribe middleware. In this paper, we
present the advantages and convenience in using this communication paradigm for
a general decentralized attack prevention framework. Furthermore, we present
the design and implementation of our approach based on existing
publish/subscribe middleware and evaluate our approach for GNU/Linux systems.
