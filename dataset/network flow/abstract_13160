We present measurements of net charge and transverse momentum fluctuations in
Au + Au collisions at ?sNN = 20, 130, and 200 GeV reported in our QM 2004
poster using measures ?+-,dyn and <?pt,1 ?pt,2>. We observe the dynamical
fluctuations are finite at all three energies and exhibit a rather modest
dependence on beam energy. We also find both net charge and pt fluctuations
violate the trivial 1/N scaling expected for nuclear collisions consisting of
independent nucleon-nucleon interactions. We speculate the observed centrality
dependence arises due to radial flow and might provide insight on the width and
shape of the radial flow profile.
