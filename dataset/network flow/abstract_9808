A recent exciting experiment by Ghosh et al. reported that the flow of an
ion-containing liquid such as water through bundles of single-walled carbon
nanotubes induces a voltage in the nanotubes that grows logarithmically with
the flow velocity v0. We propose an explanation for this observation. Assuming
that the liquid molecules nearest the nanotube form a 2D solid-like monolayer
pinned through the adsorbed ions to the nanotubes, the monolayer sliding will
occur by elastic loading followed by local yield (stick-slip). The drifting
adsorbed ions produce a voltage in the nanotube through electronic friction
against free electrons inside the nanotube. Thermally excited jumps over
force-biased barriers, well-known in stick-slip, can explain the logarithmic
voltage growth with flow velocity. We estimate the short circuit current and
the internal resistance of the nanotube voltage generator.
