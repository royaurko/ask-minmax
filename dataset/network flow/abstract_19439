A chondrule formation theory is presented where the chondrule formation zone
is located within 0.1 AU of the protosun. This hot, optically thick, inner zone
of the solar accretion disk is coincident with the formation region of the
protosolar jet.
  The model assumes that particles, ranging in diameter from 1 micron to 1 cm,
can be ejected from the inner-accretion disk by the jet flow, and that the
angular momentum of this material is sufficient to eject it from the jet flow.
Given these assumptions, any material so ejected, will fly across the face of
the accretion disk at speeds greater than the escape velocity of the system.
This material can only be recaptured through the action of gas drag. Such a
capture process naturally produces aerodynamic size sorting of chondrules and
chondrule fragments, while the ejection of refractory dust provides a possible
explanation for the observed complementarity between matrix and chondrules.
This transfer of material will result in the loss of angular momentum from the
upper atmosphere of the outer accretion disk and thereby facilitate the
accretion of matter onto the protosun.
