Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that crystallization and
glass-like solidification are useful analogies for understanding cell ordering
in confluent biological tissues. It remains unexplored how cellular ordering
contributes to pattern formation during morphogenesis. With a computational
model we show that a system of elongated, cohering biological cells can get
dynamically arrested in a network pattern. Our model provides a new explanation
for the formation of cellular networks in culture systems that exclude
intercellular interaction via chemotaxis or mechanical traction.
