In this work we investigate the spectra of Laplacian matrices that determine
many dynamic properties of scale-free networks below and at the percolation
threshold. We use a replica formalism to develop analytically, based on an
integral equation, a systematic way to determine the ensemble averaged
eigenvalue spectrum for a general type of tree-like networks. Close to the
percolation threshold we find characteristic scaling functions for the density
of states rho(lambda) of scale-free networks. rho(lambda) shows characteristic
power laws rho(lambda) ~ lambda^alpha_1 or rho(lambda) ~ lambda^alpha_2 for
small lambda, where alpha_1 holds below and alpha_2 at the percolation
threshold. In the range where the spectra are accessible from a numerical
diagonalization procedure the two methods lead to very similar results.
