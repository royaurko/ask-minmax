The high-order statistics of fluctuations in velocity gradients in the
crossover range from the inertial to the Kolmogorov and sub-Kolmogorov scales
are studied by direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence with vastly improved resolution. The derivative moments for orders 0
<= n <= 8 are represented well as powers of the Reynolds number, Re, in the
range 380 <= Re <= 5725, where Re is based on the periodic box length L_x.
These low-Reynolds-number flows give no hint of scaling in the inertial range
even when extended self-similarity is applied. Yet, the DNS scaling exponents
of velocity gradients agree well with those deduced, using a recent theory of
anomalous scaling, from the scaling exponents of the longitudinal structure
functions at infinitely high Reynolds numbers. This suggests that the
asymptotic state of turbulence is attained for the velocity gradients at far
lower Reynolds numbers than those required for the inertial range to appear. We
discuss these findings in the light of multifractal formalism. Our numerical
studies also resolve the crossover of the velocity gradient statistics from the
Gaussian to non-Gaussian behaviour that occurs as the Reynolds number is
increased.
