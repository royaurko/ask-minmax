A distributed algorithm is self-stabilizing if after faults and attacks hit
the system and place it in some arbitrary global state, the system recovers
from this catastrophic situation without external intervention in finite time.
In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing self-stabilizingly a
\emph{maximal independent set} in uniform unidirectional networks of arbitrary
shape. On the negative side, we present evidence that in uniform networks,
\emph{deterministic} self-stabilization of this problem is \emph{impossible}.
Also, the \emph{silence} property (\emph{i.e.} having communication fixed from
some point in every execution) is impossible to guarantee, either for
deterministic or for probabilistic variants of protocols. On the positive side,
we present a deterministic protocol for networks with arbitrary unidirectional
networks with unique identifiers that exhibits polynomial space and time
complexity in asynchronous scheduling. We complement the study with
probabilistic protocols for the uniform case: the first probabilistic protocol
requires infinite memory but copes with asynchronous scheduling, while the
second probabilistic protocol has polynomial space complexity but can only
handle synchronous scheduling. Both probabilistic solutions have expected
polynomial time complexity.
