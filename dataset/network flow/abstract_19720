The pseudo-rapidity dependence of the elliptic flow at various excitation
energies measured by the PHOBOS Collaboration in Au+Au collisions at RHIC is
one of the surprising results that has not been explained before in terms of
hydrodynamical models. Here we show that these data are in agreement with
theoretical predictions and satisfy the universal scaling relation predicted by
the Buda-Lund hydrodynamical model, based on exact solutions of perfect fluid
hydrodynamics. We also show a theoretical prediction on the rapidity and
transverse momentum scaling of the HBT radii measured in heavy ion collisions,
based on the Buda-Lund model.
