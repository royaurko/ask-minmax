Series of lectures on statistical turbulence written for amateurs but not
experts. Elementary aspects and problems of turbulence in two and three
dimensional Navier-Stokes equation are introduced. A few properties of scalar
turbulence and transport phenomena in turbulent flows are described.
Kraichnan's model of passive advection is discussed a bit more precisely.
