In heavy traffic with congested roadway the maximum traffic flow also depends
on length of cars. This is deduced in a simple derivation suited for classroom
demonstration as well as homework. The resulting equation demonstrates a new
relation to an apparently unrelated area of physics, the maximum ship velocity
(hull speed) and explains why traffic is sometimes faster on the slow lane on a
congested multi-lane road.
