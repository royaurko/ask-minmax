The papers describes an easy approach, based on a classical construction by
Dacorogna and Moser, to prove that optimal vector fields in some minimal flow
problem linked to optimal transport models (congested traffic, branched
transport, Beckmann's problem...) are induced by a probability measure on the
space of paths. This gives a new, easier, proof of a classical result by
Smirnov, and allows handling optimal flows without taking care of the presence
of cycles.
