The intention of the ''von Karman sodium'' (VKS) experiment is to study the
hydromagnetic dynamo effect in a highly turbulent and unconstrained flow. Much
effort has been devoted to the optimization of the mean flow and the lateral
boundary conditions in order to minimize the critical magnetic Reynolds number
and hence the necessary motor power. The main focus of this paper lies on the
role of ''lid layers'', i.e. layers of liquid sodium between the impellers and
the end walls of the cylinder. First, we study an analytical test flow to show
that lid layers can have an ambivalent effect on the efficiency of the dynamo.
The critical magnetic Reynolds number shows a flat minimum for a small lid
layer thickness, but increases for thicker layers. For the actual VKS geometry
it is shown that static lid layers yield a moderate increase of the critical
magnetic Reynolds number by approximately 12 per cent. A more dramatic increase
by 100 until 150 per cent can occur when some rotational flow is taken into
account in those layers. Possible solutions of this problem are discussed for
the real dynamo facility.
