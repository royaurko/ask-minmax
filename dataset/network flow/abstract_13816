The analytic approach to spectral flow is about ten years old. In that time
it has evolved to cover an ever wider range of examples. The most critical
extension was to replace Fredholm operators in the classical sense by
Breuer-Fredholm operators in a semifinite von Neumann algebra. The first part
of this paper gives a brief account of this theory extending and refining
earlier results. It is then applied in the latter parts of the paper to a
series of examples. One of the most powerful tools is an integral formula for
spectral flow. This integral formula was known for Dirac operators in a variety
of forms ever since the fundamental papers of Atiyah, Patodi and Singer. One of
the purposes of this exposition is to make contact with this early work so that
one can understand the recent developments in a proper historical context. In
addition we show how to derive these spectral flow formulae in the setting of
Dirac operators on (non-compact) covering spaces of a compact spin manifold
using the adiabatic method.
  Finally we relate our work to that of Coburn, Douglas, Schaeffer and Singer
on Toeplitz operators with almost periodic symbol. We generalise their work to
cover the case of matrix valued almost periodic symbols on \R^N using some
ideas of Shubin.
