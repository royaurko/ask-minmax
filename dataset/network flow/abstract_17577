In this letter, we will consider the use of the variational iteration method
and Pad\'e approximant for finding approximate solutions for a Marangoni
convection induced flow over a free surface due to an imposed temperature
gradient. The solutions are compared with the numerical (fourth-order Runge
Kutta) solutions.
