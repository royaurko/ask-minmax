Recent PHENIX Au+Au -> e- + X data from open charm decay are shown to be
consistent with two extreme opposite dynamical scenarios of ultra-relativistic
nuclear reactions. Perturbative QCD without final state interactions was
previously shown to be consistent with the data. However, we show that the data
are also consistent with zero mean free path hydrodynamics characterized by a
common transverse flow velocity field. The surprising coincidence of both D and
B hydrodynamic flow spectra with pQCD up to p_T ~ 3 and 5 GeV, respectively,
suggests that heavy quarks may be produced essentially at rest in the rapidly
expanding gluon plasma. Possible implications and further tests of collective
heavy quark dynamics are discussed.
