Let $M$ be a closed oriented surface endowed with a Riemannian metric $g$. We
consider the flow $\phi$ determined by the motion of a particle under the
influence of a magnetic field $\Omega$ and a thermostat with external field
${\bf e}$. We show that if $\phi$ is Anosov, then it has weak stable and
unstable foliations of class $C^{1,1}$ if and only if the external field ${\bf
e}$ has a global potential $U$, $g_{1}:=e^{-2U}g$ has constant curvature and
$e^{-U}\Omega$ is a constant multiple of the area form of $g_1$. We also give
necessary and sufficient conditions for just one of the weak foliations to be
of class $C^{1,1}$ and we show that the {\it combined} effect of a thermostat
and a magnetic field can produce an Anosov flow with a weak stable foliation of
class $C^{\infty}$ and a weak unstable foliation which is {\it not} $C^{1,1}$.
Finally we study Anosov thermostats depending quadratically on the velocity and
we characterize those with smooth weak foliations. In particular, we show that
quasi-fuchsian flows as defined by Ghys in \cite{Ghy1} can arise in this
fashion.
