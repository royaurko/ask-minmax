Aggregated data in real world recommender applications often feature
fat-tailed distributions of the number of times individual items have been
rated or favored. We propose a model to simulate such data. The model is mainly
based on social interactions and opinion formation taking place on a complex
network with a given topology. A threshold mechanism is used to govern the
decision making process that determines whether a user is or is not interested
in an item. We demonstrate the validity of the model by fitting attendance
distributions from different real data sets. The model is mathematically
analyzed by investigating its master equation. Our approach provides an attempt
to understand recommender system's data as a social process. The model can
serve as a starting point to generate artificial data sets useful for testing
and evaluating recommender systems.
