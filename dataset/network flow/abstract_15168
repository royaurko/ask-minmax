Video streaming represents a large fraction of Internet traffic.
Surprisingly, little is known about the network characteristics of this
traffic. In this paper, we study the network characteristics of the two most
popular video streaming services, Netflix and YouTube. We show that the
streaming strategies vary with the type of the application (Web browser or
native mobile application), and the type of container (Silverlight, Flash, or
HTML5) used for video streaming. In particular, we identify three different
streaming strategies that produce traffic patterns from non-ack clocked ON-OFF
cycles to bulk TCP transfer. We then present an analytical model to study the
potential impact of these streaming strategies on the aggregate traffic and
make recommendations accordingly.
