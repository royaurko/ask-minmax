Network densification is one of key technologies in future networks to
significantly increase network capacity. The gain obtained by network
densification for fixed terminals have been studied and proved. However for
mobility users, there are a number of issues, such as more frequent handover,
packet loss due to high mobility, interference management and so on. The
conventional solutions are to handover high speed mobiles to macro base
stations or multicast traffic to multiple base stations. These solutions fail
to exploit the capacity of dense networks and overuse the backhaul capacity. In
this paper we propose a set of solutions to systematically solve the technical
challenges of mobile dense networks. We introduce network architecture together
with data transmission protocols to support mobile users. A software-defined
protocol (SDP) concept is presented so that combinations of transport protocols
and physical layer functions can be optimized and triggered on demand. Our
solutions can significantly boost performance of dense networks and simplify
the packet handling process. Importantly, the gain brought by network
densification to fixed users can also be achieved for mobile users.
