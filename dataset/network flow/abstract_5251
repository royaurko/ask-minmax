The entropy production rate of cancer cell is always higher than healthy cell
under the case of no external field applied. Different entropy production
between two kinds of cells determines the direction of entropy flow among
cells. The entropy flow is the carrier of information flow. The entropy flow
from cancer to healthy cell takes along the harmful information of cancerous
cell, propagating its toxic action to healthy tissues. We demonstrate that a
low-frequency and low-intensity electromagnetic field or ultrasound irradiation
may increase the entropy production rate of a cell in normal tissue than that
in cancer, consequently reverse the direction of entropy current between two
kinds of cells. The modification of PH value of cells may also cause the
reversal of the direction of entropy flow between healthy and cancerous cells.
So, the biological tissue under the irradiation of electromagnetic field or
ultrasound or under the appropriate change of cell acidity can avoid the
propagation of harmful information from cancer cells. We suggest that this
entropy mechanism possibly provides a basis for a novel approach to anticancer
therapy.
