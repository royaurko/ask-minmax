Quasi-periodic propagating intensity disturbances (PDs) have been observed in
large coronal loops in EUV images over a decade, and are widely accepted to be
slow magnetosonic waves. However, spectroscopic observations from Hinode/EIS
revealed their association with persistent coronal upflows, making this
interpretation debatable. Motivated by the scenario that the coronal upflows
could be cumulative result of numerous individual flow pulses generated by
sporadic heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, we construct a velocity
driver with repetitive tiny pulses, whose energy frequency distribution follows
the flare power-law scaling. We then perform 3D MHD modeling of an idealized
bipolar active region by applying this broadband velocity driver at the
footpoints of large coronal loops which appear open in the computational
domain. Our model successfully reproduces the PDs with similar features as the
observed, and shows that any upflow pulses inevitably excite slow magnetosonic
wave disturbances propagating along the loop. We find that the generated PDs
are dominated by the wave signature as their propagation speeds are consistent
with the wave speed in the presence of flows, and the injected flows rapidly
decelerate with height. Our simulation results suggest that the observed PDs
and associated persistent upflows may be produced by small-scale impulsive
heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, and that the flows and waves may
both contribute to the PDs at lower heights.
