Photons are a penetrating probe of the hot and dense medium created in
heavy-ion collisions. We present state-of-the-art calculations of viscous
photon emission from nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC. Thermal photons
anisotropic flow coefficients v_n are computed, both with and without
accounting for viscous corrections to the standard thermal emission rates.
These corrections are found to have a larger effect on the v_n coefficients
than the viscous suppression of hydrodynamic flow anisotropies. For thermal
photons, the ratio v_2{SP}/v_3{SP} shows stronger sensitivity to the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) shear viscosity than for hadrons, and it can thus
serve as a sensitive QGP viscometer.
