Relaxation dynamics in reversible catalytic reaction networks is studied,
revealing two salient behaviors that are reminiscent of glassy behavior: slow
relaxation with log(time) dependence of the correlation function, and emergence
of a few plateaus in the relaxation. The former is explained by the eigenvalue
distribution of a Jacobian matrix around the equilibrium state that follows the
distribution of kinetic coefficients of reactions. The latter is associated
with kinetic constraints, rather than metastable states, and is due to the
deficiency of catalysts for chemicals in excess and negative correlation
between the two chemical species. Examples are given, and generality is
discussed.
