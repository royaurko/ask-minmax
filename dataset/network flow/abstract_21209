The possible existence of the Anderson transition in 2D systems without
interaction and spin-orbit effects (such as the usual Anderson model) becomes
recently a subject of controversy in the literature. Comparative analysis of
approaches based on generalized Lyapunov exponents is given, in order to
resolve controversy.
