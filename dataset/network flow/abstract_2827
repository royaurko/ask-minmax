We discuss one of the most prominent features of the very recent preliminary
elliptic flow data of $J/\Psi$ meson from the PHENIX collaboration
\cite{Silvestre:2008tw}. Even within the the rather large error bars of the
measured data a negative elliptic flow parameter ($v_2$) for $J/\Psi$ in the
range of $p_T=0.5-2.5 \GeV/c$ is visible. We argue that this negative elliptic
flow at intermediate $p_T$ is a clear and qualitative signature for the
collectivity of charm quarks produced in nucleus-nucleus reactions at RHIC.
Within a parton recombination approach we show that a negative elliptic flow
puts a lower limit on the collective transverse velocity of heavy quarks. The
numerical value of the transverse flow velocity $\beta_T$ for charm quarks that
is necessary to reproduce the data is $\beta_T(charm)\sim 0.55-0.6c$ and
therefore compatible with the flow of light quarks.
