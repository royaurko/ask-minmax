We introduce a new formalism for dealing with networks of queues. The
formalism is based on the Doi-Peliti second quantization method for reaction
diffusion systems. As a demonstration of the method's utility we compute
perturbatively the different time busy-busy correlations between two servers in
a Jackson network.
