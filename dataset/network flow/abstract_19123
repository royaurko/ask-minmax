We analyze the dynamics of a network of electrically coupled, modified
FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) oscillators. The network building-block architecture is a
bidimensional squared array shaped as a torus, with unidirectional nearest
neighbor coupling in both directions. Linear approximation about the origin of
a single torus, reveals that the array is able to oscillate via a Hopf
bifurcation, controlled by the interneuronal coupling constants. Group
theoretic analysis of the dynamics of one torus leads to discrete rotating
waves moving diagonally in the squared array under the influence of the direct
product group
$\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{S}^1.$ Then, we
studied the existence multifrequency patterns of oscillations, in networks
formed by two coupled tori. We showed that when acting on the traveling waves,
this group leaves them unchanged, while when it acts on the in-phase
oscillations, they are shifted in time by $\phi.$ We therefore proved the
possibility of a pattern of oscillations in which one torus produces traveling
waves of constant phase shift, while the second torus shows synchronous
in-phase oscillations, at $N-$ times the frequency shown by the traveling
waves.
