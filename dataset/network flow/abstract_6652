Information centric networking (ICN) proposes to redesign the Internet by
replacing its host-centric design with information-centric design.
Communication among entities is established at the naming level, with the
receiver side (referred to as the Consumer) acting as the driving force behind
content delivery, by interacting with the network through Interest message
transmissions. One of the proposed advantages for ICN is its support for
mobility, by de-coupling applications from transport semantics. However, so
far, little research has been conducted to understand the interaction between
ICN and mobility of consuming and producing applications, in protocols purely
based on information-centric principles, particularly in the case of NDN. In
this paper, we present our findings on the mobility-based performance of Named
Data Networking (NDN) in wireless access networks. Through simulations, we show
that the current NDN architecture is not efficient in handling mobility and
architectural enhancements needs to be done to fully support mobility of
Consumers and Producers.
