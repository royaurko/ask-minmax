Large graphs are natural mathematical models for describing the structure of
the data in a wide variety of fields, such as web mining, social networks,
information retrieval, biological networks, etc. For all these applications,
automatic tools are required to get a synthetic view of the graph and to reach
a good understanding of the underlying problem. In particular, discovering
groups of tightly connected vertices and understanding the relations between
those groups is very important in practice. This paper shows how a kernel
version of the batch Self Organizing Map can be used to achieve these goals via
kernels derived from the Laplacian matrix of the graph, especially when it is
used in conjunction with more classical methods based on the spectral analysis
of the graph. The proposed method is used to explore the structure of a
medieval social network modeled through a weighted graph that has been directly
built from a large corpus of agrarian contracts.
