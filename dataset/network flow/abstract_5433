The area of networking games has had a growing impact on wireless networks.
This reflects the recognition in the important scaling advantages that the
service providers can benefit from by increasing the autonomy of mobiles in
decision making. This may however result in inefficiencies that are inherent to
equilibria in non-cooperative games. Due to the concern for efficiency,
centralized protocols keep being considered and compared to decentralized ones.
From the point of view of the network architecture, this implies the
co-existence of network-centric and terminal centric radio resource management
schemes. Instead of taking part within the debate among the supporters of each
solution, we propose in this paper hybrid schemes where the wireless users are
assisted in their decisions by the network that broadcasts aggregated load
information. We derive the utilities related to the Quality of Service (QoS)
perceived by the users and develop a Bayesian framework to obtain the
equilibria. Numerical results illustrate the advantages of using our hybrid
game framework in an association problem in a network composed of HSDPA and 3G
LTE systems.
