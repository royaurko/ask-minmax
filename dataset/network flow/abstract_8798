We prove logarithm laws and shrinking target properties for unipotent flows
on the homogenous space $\Gamma\bs G$ with
$G=\SL_2(\bbR)^{r_1}\times\SL_2(\bbC)^{r_2}$ and $\Gamma\subseteq G$ an
irreducible non-uniform lattice. Our method relies on certain estimates for the
norms of (incomplete) theta series in this setting.
