Today, the deployment of Web services in many enterprise applications has
gained much attention. Service network inhibits certain common properties as
they arise spontaneously and are subject to high fluctuation. The objective of
consumer is to compose services for stable business processes in coherence with
their legacy system capabilities and with better quality of services. For this
purpose we have proposed a dynamic decision model that integrates several
performance metrics and attributes to monitor the performance of service
oriented systems in order to ensure their sustainability. Based on the
available metrics, we have identified performance metrics criteria and
classified into categories like time based QoS, size based QoS, combined QoS
and estimated attributes. Then we have designed service network monitoring
ontology (SNM). Our decision model will take user query and SNM as input,
measures the performance capabilities and suggests some new performance
configurations like selected service is not available, physical resource is not
available and no maintenance will be available for the selected service for
composition.
