The closely related issues of (1) reconstructing density and velocity fields
from redshift survey and distance indicator data and (2) determining
cosmological parameters from such data sets are discussed. I focus on possible
explanations for the discrepant values of $\beta\equiv\Omega^{0.6}/b$ resulting
from analyses that employ various reconstruction methods. Although no firm
conclusions are reached, possible routes towards resolution of these
discrepancies are suggested by the discussion.
