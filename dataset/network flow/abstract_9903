The elliptic flows in both Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider are studied in a multi-phase transport model. For both
collisions at same reduced impact parameter and minimum bias collisions, the
elliptic flow of partons in Cu+Cu collisions is about a factor of three smaller
than that in Au+Au collisions at same energy. The reduction factor is similar
to the ratio of the sizes of the two colliding systems and is also related to
the combined effects of initial energy density and spatial elliptic deformation
in the two reactions. A similar system size dependence is also seen in the
elliptic flow of charged hadrons from minimum bias collisions.
