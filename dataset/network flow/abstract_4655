The parameter space of the Feigin-Fuks representations of the N=4 SU(2)$_k$
superconformal algebras is studied from the viewpoint of the specral flow. The
$\eta$ phase of the spectral flow is nicely incorporated through twisted
fermions and the spectral flow resulting from the inner automorphism of the N=4
superconformal algebras is explicitly shown to be operating as identiy
relations among the generators. Conditions for the unitary representations are
also investigated in our Feigin-Fuks parameter space.
