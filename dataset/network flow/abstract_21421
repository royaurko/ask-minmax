Approximations of the Sedov self-similar solution for a strong point
explosion in a medium with the power-law density distribution \rho^o\propto
r^{-m} are reviewed and their accuracy are analyzed. Taylor approximation is
extended to cases m\neq 0. Two approximations of the solution are presented in
the Lagrangian coordinates for spherical, cylindrical and plane geometry. These
approximations may be used for the investigation of the ionization structure of
the adiabatic flow, i.e., inside adiabatic supernova remnants.
