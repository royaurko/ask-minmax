Potential games form a class of non-cooperative games where unilateral
improvement dynamics are guaranteed to converge in many practical cases. The
potential game approach has been applied to a wide range of wireless network
problems, particularly to a variety of channel assignment problems. In this
paper, the properties of potential games are introduced, and games in wireless
networks that have been proven to be potential games are comprehensively
discussed.
