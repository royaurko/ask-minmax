We consider networks with two types of nodes. The v-nodes, called centers,
are hyper- connected and interact one to another via many u-nodes, called
satellites. This central- ized architecture, widespread in gene networks,
possesses two fundamental properties. Namely, this organization creates
feedback loops that are capable to generate practically any prescribed
patterning dynamics, chaotic or periodic, or having a number of equilib- rium
states. Moreover, this organization is robust with respect to random
perturbations of the system.
