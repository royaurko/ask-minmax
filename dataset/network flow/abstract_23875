We consider a resource management problem in a multi-cell downlink OFDMA
network, whereby the goal is to find the optimal per base station resource
allocation and user-base station assignment. The users are assumed to be
strategic/selfish who have private information on downlink channel states and
noise levels. To induce truthfulness among the users as well as to enhance the
spectrum efficiency, the resource management strategy needs to be both
incentive compatible and efficient. However, due to the mixed (discrete and
continuous) nature of resource management in this context, the implementation
of any incentive compatible mechanism that maximizes the system throughput is
NP-hard. We consider the dominant strategy implementation of an approximately
optimal resource management scheme via a computationally tractable mechanism.
The proposed mechanism is decentralized and dynamic. More importantly, it
ensures the truthfulness of the users and it implements a resource allocation
solution that yields at least 1/2 of the optimal throughput. Simulations are
provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the performance of the proposed
mechanism.
