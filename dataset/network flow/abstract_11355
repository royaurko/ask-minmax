In this paper, we propose a new quality link metric, interference and
bandwidth adjusted ETX (IBETX) for wireless multi-hop networks. As MAC layer
affects the link performance and consequently the route quality, the metric
therefore, tackles the issue by achieving twofold MAC-awareness. Firstly,
interference is calculated using cross-layered approach by sending probes to
MAC layer. Secondly, the nominal bit rate information is provided to all nodes
in the same contention domain by considering the bandwidth sharing mechanism of
802.11. Like ETX, our metric also calculates link delivery ratios that directly
affect throughput and selects those routes that bypass dense regions in the
network. Simulation results by NS-2 show that IBETX gives 19% higher throughput
than ETX and 10% higher than Expected Throughput (ETP). Our metric also
succeeds to reduce average end-to-end delay up to 16% less than Expected Link
Performance (ELP) and 24% less than ETX.
