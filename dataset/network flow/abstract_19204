For distributed sensor/relay networks, high reliability and power efficiency
are often required. However, several implementation issues arise in practice.
One such problem is that all the distributed transmitters have limited power
supply since the power source of the transmitters cannot be recharged
continually. To resolve this, distributed beamforming has been proposed as a
viable solution where all distributed transmitters seek to align in phase at
the receiver end. However, it is difficult to implement such transmit
beamforming in a distributed fashion in practice since perfect channel state
information (CSI) need to be made available at all distributed transmitters,
requiring tremendous overhead to feed back CSI from the receiver to all
distributed transmitters.
  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that belongs to the category of
deterministic phase adjustment algorithm: the Deterministic Differential Search
Algorithm (DDSA), where the differences between the measured received signal
strength (RSS) are utilized judiciously to help us predict the deterministic
phase adjustment done at distributed transmitters. Numerical simulations
demonstrate rapid convergence to a pre-determined threshold.
