We consider a problem of optimal control of an infinite horizon system
governed by forward-backward stochastic differential equations with delay.
Sufficient and necessary maximum principles for optimal control under partial
information in infinite horizon are derived. We illustrate our results by an
application to a problem of optimal consumption with respect to recursive
utility from a cash flow with delay.
