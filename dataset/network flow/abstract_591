We give an information flow interpretation for multicasting using network
coding. This generalizes the fluid model used to represent flows to a single
receiver. Using the generalized model, we present a decentralized algorithm to
minimize the number of packets that undergo network coding. We also propose a
decentralized algorithm to construct capacity achieving multicast codes when
the processing at some nodes is restricted to routing. The proposed algorithms
can be coupled with existing decentralized schemes to achieve minimum cost
muticast.
