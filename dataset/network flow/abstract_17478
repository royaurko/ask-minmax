We calculate the running of the three coupling constants in cosmological,
topologically massive 3d gravity. We find that \nu, the dimensionless
coefficient of the Chern-Simons term, has vanishing beta function. The flow of
the cosmological constant and Newton's constant depends on \nu, and for any
positive \nu there exist both a trivial and a nontrivial fixed point.
