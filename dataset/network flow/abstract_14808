Linear time-distance helioseismic inversions are carried out for vector flow
velocities using travel times measured from two $\sim 100^2\,{\rm Mm^2}\times
20\,{\rm Mm}$ realistic magnetohydrodynamic quiet-Sun simulations of about 20
hr. The goal is to test current seismic methods on these state-of-the-art
simulations. Using recent three-dimensional inversion schemes, we find that
inverted horizontal flow maps correlate well with the simulations in the upper
$\sim 3$ Mm of the domains for several filtering schemes, including
phase-speed, ridge, and combined phase-speed and ridge measurements. In several
cases, however, the velocity amplitudes from the inversions severely
underestimate those of the simulations, possibly indicating nonlinearity of the
forward problem. We also find that, while near-surface inversions of the
vertical velocites are best using phase-speed filters, in almost all other
example cases these flows are irretrievable due to noise, suggesting a need for
statistical averaging to obtain better inferences.
