The evolutionary dynamics of the Public Goods game addresses the emergence of
cooperation within groups of individuals. However, the Public Goods game on
large populations of interconnected individuals has been usually modeled
without any knowledge about their group structure. In this paper, by focusing
on collaboration networks, we show that it is possible to include the
mesoscopic information about the structure of the real groups by means of a
bipartite graph. We compare the results with the projected (cocontributor) and the
original bipartite graphs and show that cooperation is enhanced by the
mesoscopic structure contained. We conclude by analyzing the influence of the
size of the groups in the evolutionary success of cooperation.
