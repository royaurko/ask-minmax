This paper proves that it is possible to damp mechanical vibrations of some
beam frames by means of piezoelectric actuators interconnected via passive
networks. We create a kind of electromechanical wave guide where the electrical
velocity group equals the mechanical one thus enabling an electromechanical
energy transfer. Numerical simulations are presented which prove the technical
feasibility of proposed device
