We have investigated how the Andreev-reflection hole current at ballistic
point contacts responds to a large bias voltage. Its strong suppression could
be explained by the drag excerted by the non-equilibrium phonon wind generated
by high-energy electrons flowing through the contact. The hole - phonon
interaction leads to scattering lengths of the low-energetic holes down to
100\,nm, thereby destroying the coherent retracing of the electron path by the
Andreev-reflected holes.
