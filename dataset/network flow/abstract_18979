This paper presents a solution to the problem of monitoring a region of
interest (RoI) using a set of nodes that is not sufficient to achieve the
required degree of monitoring coverage. In particular, sensing coverage of
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a crucial issue in projects due to failure
of sensors. The lack of sensor equipment resources hinders the traditional
method of using mobile robots to move around the RoI to collect readings.
Instead, our solution employs supervised neural networks to produce the values
of the uncovered locations by extracting the non-linear relation among randomly
deployed sensor nodes throughout the area. Moreover, we apply a hybrid
backpropagation method to accelerate the learning convergence speed to a local
minimum solution. We use a real-world data set from meteorological deployment
for experimental validation and analysis.
