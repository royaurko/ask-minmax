Different cross layer design for mobile adhoc network focuses on different
optimization purpose, different Quality of Service (QoS) metric and the
functions like delay, priority handling, security, etc. Existing cross layer
designs provide individual solution for congestion control, fault tolerance,
power conservation, energy minimization and flow control and the major drawback
is of high cost and overhead. In this paper, we propose to design multiple
cross layer design based architecture to provide a combined solution for link
failure management, power conservation, congestion control and admission
control. By simulation results, we show that the average end to end delay,
average energy consumption and the packet loss are considerably reduced with
the increase in high throughput and good delivery ratio.
