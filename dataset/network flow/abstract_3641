In this paper a recent variable anticipation cellular automata model for
single-lane traffic flow is extended to analyze the situation of free and
congested flow in the Highway from Mexico City to Cuernavaca. This highway
presents free flow in standard days; but in the returning day of long weekends
or holidays it exhibits congested flow and in rush hours jamming appears. We
illustrate how our CA model for traffic flow can deal appropriately with
transient situations and can be used to search new alternatives that allow to
improve the traffic flow in Mexican highways.
