Wireless sensor networks consisting of great number of cheap and tiny sensor
nodes which are used for military environment controlling, natural events
recording, traffic monitoring, robot navigation, and etc. Such a networks
encounter with various types of challenges like energy consumption, routing,
coverage, reliability. The most significant types of these problems are
coverage that originated from the nodes energy consumption constrained. In
order to dominate this problem different kinds of methods has been presented
where the majority of them based on theoretical methods and used unbalanced and
calculated distributions. In all of the proposed methods a large numbers of
nodes are used. In this paper our attempt is based on using a few numbers of
sensors in order to cover the vast area of environment. We proposed an
algorithm that divides the desired environment to several areas and in each of
these areas by using the genetic algorithm improve the coverage. The proposed
method is simulated in MATLAB software and the obtained results are compared
with the existing algorithms. Results show that the presented algorithm has a
substantial coverage in compare with its previous counterparts.
