We have investigated the vortex state in a superconducting dice network using
the Bitter decoration technique at several magnetic frustrations f=1/2 and 1/3.
In contrast to other regular network geometries where the existence of a
commensurate state was previouly demonstrated, no ordered state was observed in
the dice network at f=1/2 and the observed vortex-vortex correlation length is
close to one lattice cell.
