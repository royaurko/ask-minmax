We present a simple model of network dynamics that can be solved analytically
for uniform networks. We obtain the dynamics of response of the system to
perturbations. The analytical solution is an excellent approximation for random
networks. A comparison with the scale-free network, though qualitatively
similar, shows the effect of distinct topology.
