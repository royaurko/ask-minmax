We compute the correlation functions of the eigenvalues in the Gaussian
unitary ensemble using the fermionic replica method. We show that non--trivial
saddle points, which break replica symmetry, must be included in the
calculation in order to reproduce correctly the exact results for the
correlation functions at large distance.
