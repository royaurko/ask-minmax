In recent times the cost of mobile communication has dropped significantly
leading to a dramatic increase in mobile phone usage. The widespread usage has
led mobiles to emerge as a strong alternative for other applications one of
which is tracking. This has enabled law-enforcing agencies to detect
overspeeding vehicles and organizations to keep track its employees. The 3
major ways of tracking being employed presently are (a) via GPS [1] (b) signal
attenuation property of a packet [3] and (c) using GSM Network [2]. The initial
cost of GPS is very high resulting in low usage whereas (b) needs a very high
precision measuring device. The paper presents a GSM-based tracking technique
which eliminates the above mentioned overheads, implements it in NS2 and shows
the limitations of the real life simulation. An accuracy of 97% was achieved
during NS2 simulation which is comparable to the above mentioned alternate
methods of tracking.
