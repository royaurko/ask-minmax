Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is now days become very famous due to their
fixed infrastructure-less quality and dynamic nature. They contain a large
number of nodes which are connected and communicated to each other in wireless
nature. Mobile ad hoc network is a wireless technology that contains high
mobility of nodes and does not depend on the background administrator for
central contributority, because they do not contain any infrastructure. Nodes of the
MANET use radio wave for communication and having limited resources and limited
computational power. The Topology of this network is changing very frequently
because they are distributed in nature and self-configurable. Due to its
wireless nature and lack of any central contributority in the background, Mobile ad
hoc networks are always vulnerable to some security issues and performance
issues. The security imposes a huge impact on the performance of any network.
Some of the security issues are black hole attack, flooding, wormhole attack
etc. In this paper, we will discuss issues regarding low performance of
Watchdog protocol used in the MANET and proposed an improved Watchdog
mechanism, which is called by I-Watchdog protocol that overcomes the
limitations of Watchdog protocol and gives high performance in terms of
throughput, delay.
