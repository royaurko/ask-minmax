In this paper, we present optimization approaches for Access Point (AP)
location and frequency assignment, two major planning tasks in deploying Wi-Fi
networks. Since APs are relatively cheap, the major concern is network
performance. We consider a performance metric, referred to as access
efficiency, that captures key aspects of how user devices share access to the
wireless medium. We propose a two-step approach to deal with AP location and
frequency assignment in maximizing access efficiency. A novelty of our modeling
approach is to estimate, in the first step of AP location, the impact of
expected frequency availability on frequency assignment. For each of the two
steps we derive hyperbolic formulations and their linearizations, and we
propose a promising enumerative formulation. Sample results are reported to
show the applicability of the approach.
