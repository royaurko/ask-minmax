We use the recently developed tensor network algorithm based on infinite
projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) to study the phase diagram of
frustrated antiferromagnetic J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a checkerboard lattice.
The simulation indicates a Neel ordered phase when J2 < 0.88J1, a plaquette
valence bond solid state when 0.88 < J2/J1 < 1.11, and a stripe phase when J2 >
1.11J1, with two first-order transitions across the phase boundaries. The
calculation shows the cross-dimer state proposed before is unlikely to be the
ground state of the model, although such a state indeed arises as a metastable
state in some parameter region.
