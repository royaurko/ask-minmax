We consider the problem of securing a multicast network against a wiretapper
that can intercept the packets on a limited number of arbitrary network links
of his choice. We assume that the network implements network coding techniques
to simultaneously deliver all the packets available at the source to all the
destinations. We show how this problem can be looked at as a network
generalization of the Ozarow-Wyner Wiretap Channel of type II. In particular,
we show that network security can be achieved by using the Ozarow-Wyner
approach of coset coding at the source on top of the implemented network code.
This way, we quickly and transparently recover some of the results available in
the literature on secure network coding for wiretapped networks. We also derive
new bounds on the required secure code alphabet size and an algorithm for code
construction.
