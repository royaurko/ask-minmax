The axial magnetic field, which couples to left- and right-handed fermions
with opposite signs, may generate an equilibrium dissipationless energy flow of
fermions in the direction of the field even in the presence of interactions. We
report on numerical observation of this Axial Magnetic Effect in quenched SU(2)
lattice gauge theory. We find that in the deconfinement (plasma) phase the
energy flow grows linearly with the increase of the strength of the axial
magnetic field. In the confinement (hadron) phase the Axial Magnetic Effect is
absent. Our study indirectly confirms the existence of the Chiral Vortical
Effect since both these effects have the same physical origin related to the
presence of the gravitational anomaly.
