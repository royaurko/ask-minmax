We consider a variational method to solve the optical flow problem with
varying illumination. We apply an adaptive control of the regularization
parameter which allows us to preserve the edges and fine features of the
computed flow. To reduce the complexity of the estimation for high resolution
images and the time of computations, we implement a multi-level parallel
approach based on the domain decomposition with the Schwarz overlapping method.
The second level of parallelism uses the massively parallel solver MUMPS. We
perform some numerical simulations to show the efficiency of our approach and
to validate it on classical and real-world image sequences.
