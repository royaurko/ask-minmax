We calculate the statistical properties of the energy landscape of a minimal
model for strong network-forming liquids. Dynamics and thermodynamic properties
of this model can be computed with arbitrary precision even at low
temperatures. A degenerate disordered ground state and logarithmic statistics
for the energy distribution are the landscape signatures of strong liquid
behavior. Differences from fragile liquid properties are attributed to the
presence of a discrete energy scale, provided by the particle bonds, and to the
intrinsic degeneracy of topologically disordered networks.
