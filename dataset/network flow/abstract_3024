The spectral flow is a classical notion of functional analysis and
differential geometry which was given different interpretations as Fredholm
index, Witten index, and Maslov index. The classical theory treats spectral
flow outside the essential spectrum. Inside essential spectrum, the spectral
shift function could be considered as a proper analogue of spectral flow, but
unlike the spectral flow, the spectral shift function is not an integer-valued
function. In this paper it is shown that the notion of spectral flow admits a
natural integer-valued extension for a.e. value of the spectral parameter
inside essential spectrum too and appropriate theory is developed. The
definition of spectral flow inside essential spectrum given in this paper
applies to the classical spectral flow and thus gives one more new alternative
definition of it.
