The flow harmonics $v_{2,3}$ for charged hadrons, are studied for a broad
range of centrality selections and beam collision energies in Au+Au
($\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7 - 200$ GeV) and Pb+Pb ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 2.76$ TeV)
collisions. They validate the characteristic signature expected for the system
size dependence of viscous damping at each collision energy studied. The
extracted viscous coefficients, that encode the magnitude of the ratio of shear
viscosity to entropy density $\eta/s$, are observed to decrease to an apparent
minimum as the collision energy is increased from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7$ to
approximately 62.4 GeV; thereafter, they show a slow increase with
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ up to 2.76 TeV. This pattern of viscous damping provides the
first experimental constraint for $\eta/s$ in the temperature-baryon chemical
potential ($T, \mu_B$) plane, and could be an initial indication for decay
trajectories which lie close to the critical end point in the phase diagram for
nuclear matter.
