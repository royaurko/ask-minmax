We used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to derive the orbital parameters
of spectroscopic binary stars. Using measured radial velocity data of seven
double-lined spectroscopic binary systems V373 Cas, V2388 Oph, V401 Cyg, GM
Dra, V523 Cas, AB And, and HD 141929, we found corresponding orbital and
spectroscopic elements. Our numerical results are in good agreement with those
obtained by others using more traditional methods.
