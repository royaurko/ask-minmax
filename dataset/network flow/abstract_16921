The performance of spatial multiplexing systems with linear
minimum-mean-squared-error receivers is investigated in ad hoc networks. It is
shown that single-stream transmission is preferable over multi-stream
transmission, due to the weaker interference powers from the strongest
interferers remaining after interference-cancelation. This result is obtained
by new exact closed-form expressions we derive for the outage probability and
transmission capacity.
