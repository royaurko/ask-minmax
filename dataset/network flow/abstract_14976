An efficient and relatively fast algorithm for the detection of communities
in complex networks is introduced. The method exploits spectral properties of
the graph Laplacian-matrix combined with hierarchical-clustering techniques,
and includes a procedure to maximize the ``modularity'' of the output. Its
performance is compared with that of other existing methods, as applied to
different well-known instances of complex networks with a community-structure:
both computer-generated and from the real-world. Our results are in all the
tested cases, at least, as good as the best ones obtained with any other
methods, and faster in most of the cases than methods providing similar-quality
results. This converts the algorithm in a valuable computational tool for
detecting and analyzing communities and modular structures in complex networks.
