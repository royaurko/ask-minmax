Finding efficient algorithms to explore large networks with the aim of
recovering information about their structure is an open problem. Here, we
investigate this challenge by proposing a model in which random walkers with
previously assigned home nodes navigate through the network during a fixed
amount of time. We consider that the exploration is successful if the walker
gets the information gathered back home, otherwise, no data is retrieved.
Consequently, at each time step, the walkers, with some probability, have the
choice to either go backward approaching their home or go farther away. We show
that there is an optimal solution to this problem in terms of the average
information retrieved and the degree of the home nodes and design an adaptive
strategy based on the behavior of the random walker. Finally, we compare
different strategies that emerge from the model in the context of network
reconstruction. Our results could be useful for the discovery of unknown
connections in large scale networks.
