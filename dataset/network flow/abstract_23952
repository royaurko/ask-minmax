In this paper, we investigate the impact of cooperation between a secondary
transmitter-receiver pair and a primary transmitter (PT) on the maximum stable
throughput of the primary-secondary network. Each transmitter, primary or
secondary, has a buffer for storing its own traffic. In addition to its own
buffer, the secondary transmitter (ST) has a buffer for storing a fraction of
the undelivered primary packets due to channel impairments. Moreover, the
secondary destination has a relaying queue for storing a fraction of the
undelivered primary packets. In the proposed cooperative system, the ST and the
secondary destination increase the spectrum availability for the secondary
packets by relaying the unsuccessfully transmitted packets of the PT. We
consider two multiple access strategies to be used by the ST and the secondary
destination to utilize the silence sessions of the PT. Numerical results
demonstrate the gains of the proposed cooperative system over the
non-cooperation case.
