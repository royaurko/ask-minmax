Examination of the process of silicon burning, the burning stage that leads
to the production of the iron peak nuclei, reveals that the nuclear evolution
is dominated by large groups of nuclei in mutual equilibrium. These
quasi-equilibrium (QSE) groups form well in advance of the global Nuclear
Statistical Equilibrium (NSE). We present an improved ``minimal'' nuclear
network, which takes advantage of quasi-equilibrium in order to calculate the
nuclear evolution and energy generation while further reducing the
computational cost compared to a conventional \alpha-chain network. During
silicon burning, the resultant \emph{QSE-reduced} \alpha network is twice as
fast as the full \alpha network it replaces and requires the tracking of only
half as many abundance variables, without significant loss of accuracy. When
the QSE-reduced \alpha network is used in combination with a conventional
\alpha network stretching from He to Si, the combined \alpha7 network provides
an accurate approximation for all of the burning stages from He burning to NSE,
while tracking only 7 abundances. These reductions in computational cost and
the number of species evolved make the \alpha7 network well suited for
inclusion within hydrodynamic simulations, particularly those in
multi-dimension.
