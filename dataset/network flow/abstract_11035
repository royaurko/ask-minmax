This paper deals with a path planning and intelligent control of an
autonomous robot which should move safely in partially structured environment.
This environment may involve any number of obstacles of arbitrary shape and
size; some of them are allowed to move. We describe our approach to solving the
motion-planning problem in mobile robot control using neural networks-based
technique. Our method of the construction of a collision-free path for moving
robot among obstacles is based on two neural networks. The first neural network
is used to determine the "free" space using ultrasound range finder data. The
second neural network "finds" a safe direction for the next robot section of
the path in the workspace while avoiding the nearest obstacles. Simulation
examples of generated path with proposed techniques will be presented.
