What is the minimal algebraic structure to reason about information flow? Do
we really need the full power of Boolean algebras with co-closure and de Morgan
dual operators? How much can we weaken and still be able to reason about
multi-agent scenarios in a tidy compositional way? This paper provides some
answers.
