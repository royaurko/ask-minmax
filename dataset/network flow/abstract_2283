The connection between the compressible flow of liquid crystals with low Mach
number and the incompressible flow of liquid crystals is studied in a bounded
domain. In particular, the convergence of weak solutions of the compressible
flow of liquid crystals to the weak solutions of the incompressible flow of
liquid crystals is proved when the Mach number approaches zero; that is, the
incompressible limit is justified for weak solutions in a bounded domain.
