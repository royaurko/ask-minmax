We consider reflection and transmission of interfaces which implement
renormalisation group flows between conformal fixed points in two dimensions.
Such an RG interface is constructed from the identity defect in the ultraviolet
CFT by perturbing the theory on one side of the defect line. We compute
reflection and transmission coefficients in perturbation theory to third order
in the coupling constant and check our calculations against exact constructions
of RG interfaces between coset models.
