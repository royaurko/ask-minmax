Milgram Condition proposed by Aoyama et al. plays an important role on the
analysis of "six degrees of separation". We have shown that the relations
between Milgram condition and the generalized clustering coefficient, which was
introduced as an index for measuring the number of closed paths by us, are
absolutely different in scale free networks (Barabasi and Albert) and small
world networks (Watts and Strogatz, Watts). This fact implies that the effect
of closed paths on information propagation is different in both networks. In
this article, we first investigate the difference and pursuit what is a crucial
mathematical quantity for information propagation. As a result we find that a
sort of "disorder" plays more important role for information propagation than
partially closed paths included in a network. Next we inquired into it in more
detail by introducing two types of intermediate networks. Then we find that the
average of the local clustering coefficient and the generalized clustering
coefficients $C_{(q)}$ have some different functions and important meanings,
respectively. We also find that $C_{(q)}$ is close to the propagation of
information on networks. Lastly, we show that realizability of six degrees of
separation in networks can be understood in a unified way by disorder.
