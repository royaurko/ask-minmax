We study the heat flow in the loop space of a closed Riemannian manifold $M$
as an adiabatic limit of the Floer equations in the cotangent bundle. Our main
application is a proof that the Floer homology of the cotangent bundle, for the
Hamiltonian function kinetic plus potential energy, is naturally isomorphic to
the homology of the loop space.
