The use of elliptic flow and correlation measurements as constraints to
establish the transport properties of hot and dense QCD matter is discussed.
Measured Two- and three-particle correlation functions give initial hints for a
"sonic boom". Elliptic flow measurements give the estimates $c_s \sim 0.35$ and
$\eta/s \sim 0.1$ for the sound speed and viscosity to entropy ratio.
