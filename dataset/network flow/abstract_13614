We propose a model for the propulsion of Leidenfrost solids on ratchets based
on viscous drag due to the flow of evaporating vapor. The model assumes
pressure-driven flow described by the Navier-Stokes equations and is mainly
studied in lubrication approximation. A scaling expression is derived for the
dependence of the propulsive force on geometric parameters of the ratchet
surface and properties of the sublimating solid. We show that the model results
as well as the scaling law compare favorably with experiments and are able to
reproduce the experimentally observed scaling with the size of the solid.
