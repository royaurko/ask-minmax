We study here a model of globally coupled units with adaptive interaction
weights which has a delay in the updating rule. Simulations show that the model
with such delayed synaptic change exhibits dynamical self-organization of
network structure. With suitably chosen parameters, "dominant" unit emerges
spontaneously, in the sense that the connection from such unit to almost all of
the other units are especially strengthened. Such weight structure facilitates
the coherent activity among units.
