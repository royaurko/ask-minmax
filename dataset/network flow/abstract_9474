The growth in the number of users in mobile communications networks and the
rise in the traffic generated by each user, are responsible for the increasing
importance of Mobility Management. Within Mobility Management, the main
objective of Location Management is to enable the roaming of the user in the
coverage area. In this paper, we analyze the savings in Location Management
costs obtained leveraging the users' statistics, in comparison with the
classical strategy. In particular, we introduce two novel algorithms to obtain
the Beta parameters (useful terms in the calculation of location update costs
for different Location Management strategies), utilizing a geographical study
of relative positions of the cells within the location areas. Eventually, we
discuss the influence of the different network parameters on the total Location
Management costs savings for both the radio interface and the fixed network
part, providing useful guidelines for the optimum design of the networks.
