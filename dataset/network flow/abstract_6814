The hydrodynamics of smectic films at an air-water interface is discussed,
with particular focus on the viscous response of the film under flow normal to
the layers. The corrections to the response functions of the smectic phase,
arising from the coupling between the flow and the smectic order parameter, are
calculated. The results for the effective viscosity are illustrated by
analysing smectic film flow in a channel geometry. Two limiting cases of the
flow, namely, motion dominated by dislocation-induced shear-softening and
dislocation-free motion dominated by the permeation mode of mass transfer, are
studied. The effect of drag from a finite depth liquid subphase is considered.
The results are compared to those for hexatic and liquid films.
