We show the results of two-dimensional, azimuthally symmetric simulations of
advection dominated fluid flows around black holes. We use the SPH method, and
the alpha-prescription for the viscosity, including all terms in the stress
tensor. We have performed calculations with 0.001 < alpha < 0.2 and find strong
circulation patterns in the flow, on spatial scales that depend on the
magnitude of the viscosity.
