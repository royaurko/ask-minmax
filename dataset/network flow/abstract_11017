We study the growth of bipartite networks in which the number of nodes in one
of the partitions is kept fixed while the other partition is allowed to grow.
We study random and preferential attachment as well as combination of both. We
derive the exact analytical expression for the degree-distribution of all these
different types of attachments while assuming that edges are incorporated
sequentially, i.e., a single edge is added to the growing network in a time
step. We also provide an approximate expression for the case when more than one
edge are added in a time step. We show that depending on the relative weight
between random and preferential attachment, the degree-distribution of this
type of network falls into one of four possible regimes which range from a
binomial distribution for pure random attachment to an u-shaped distribution
for dominant preferential attachment.
