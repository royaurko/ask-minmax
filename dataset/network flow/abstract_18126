Security of computers and the networks that connect them is increasingly
becoming of great significance. Computer security is defined as the protection
of computing systems against threats to confidentiality, integrity, and
availability. There are two types of intruders: external intruders, who are
uncontributorized users of the machines they attack, and internal intruders, who
have permission to access the system with some restrictions. This chapter
presents a soft computing approach to detect intrusions in a network. Among the
several soft computing paradigms, we investigated fuzzy rule-based classifiers,
decision trees, support vector machines, linear genetic programming and an
ensemble method to model fast and efficient intrusion detection systems.
Empirical results clearly show that soft computing approach could play a major
role for intrusion detection.
