We show how the measurement of appropriately constructed
particle-energy/momentum correlations allows access to the bulk viscosity of
strongly interacting hadron matter in heavy ion collisions. This measurement
can be performed by the LHC and RHIC experiments in events with high-particle
multiplicity, following up on existing estimates of the shear viscosity based
on elliptic flow.
