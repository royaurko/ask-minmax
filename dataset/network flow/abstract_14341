We find a three-parameter family of solutions to IIB supergravity that
corresponds to N=1 supersymmetric holographic RG flows of N=4 supersymmetric
Yang Mills theory. This family of solutions allows one to give a mass to a
single chiral superfield, and to probe a two-dimensional subspace of the
Coulomb branch. In particular, we examine part of the Coulomb branch of the
Leigh-Strassler fixed point. We look at the infra-red asymptotics of these
flows from the ten-dimensional perspective. We also make general conjectures
for the lifting Ansatz of five-dimensional scalar configurations to
ten-dimensional tensor gauge fields. Our solution provides a highly non-trivial
test of these conjectures.
