We study the effect of cooling flows in galaxy clusters on the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) distortion and the possible cosmological implications.
The SZ effect, alongwith X-ray observations of clusters, is used to determine
the Hubble constant, $H_{\circ}$. Blank sky surveys of SZ effect are being
planned to constrain the geometry of the universe through cluster counts. It is
also known that a significant fraction of clusters has cooling flows in them,
which changes the pressure profile of intracluster gas. Since the SZ decrement
depends essentially on the pressure profile, it is important to study possible
changes in the determination of cosmological parameters in the presence of a
cooling flow. We build several representative models of cooling flows and
compare the results with the corresponding case of gas in hydrostatic
equilibrium. We find that cooling flows can lead to an overestimation of the
Hubble constant. Specifically, we find that for realistic models of cooling
flow with mass deposition (varying $\dot m$ with radius), there is of the order
$\sim 10 %$ deviation in the estimated value of the Hubble constant (from that
for gas without a cooling flow) even after excluding $ \sim 80 %$ of the
cooling flow region from the analysis. We also discuss the implications of
using cluster counts from SZ observations to constrain other cosmological
parameters, in the presence of clusters with cooling flows.
