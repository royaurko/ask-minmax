In this paper, we consider a hydrodynamic $Q$-tensor system for nematic
liquid crystal flow, which is derived from Doi-Onsager molecular theory by the
Bingham closure. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of local strong
solution. Furthermore, by taking Deborah number goes to zero and using the
Hilbert expansion method, we present a rigorous derivation from the
molecule-based $Q$-tensor theory to the Ericksen-Leslie theory.
