The independent set problem is NP-hard and particularly difficult to solve in
large sparse graphs. In this work, we develop an advanced evolutionary
algorithm, which incorporates kernelization techniques to compute large
independent sets in huge sparse networks. A recent exact algorithm has shown
that large networks can be solved exactly by employing a branch-and-reduce
technique that recursively kernelizes the graph and performs branching.
However, one major drawback of their algorithm is that, for huge graphs,
branching still can take exponential time. To avoid this problem, we
recursively choose vertices that are likely to be in a large independent set
(using an evolutionary approach), then further kernelize the graph. We show
that identifying and removing vertices likely to be in large independent sets
opens up the reduction space---which not only speeds up the computation of
large independent sets drastically, but also enables us to compute high-quality
independent sets on much larger instances than previously reported in the
literature.
