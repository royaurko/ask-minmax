We present the first measurements of anisotropic statistical fluctuations in
perfectly homogeneous turbulent flows. We address both problems of
intermittency in anisotropic sectors and hierarchical ordering of anisotropies
on a direct numerical simulation of a three dimensional random Kolmogorov flow.
We achieved an homogeneous and anisotropic statistical ensemble by randomly
shifting the forcing phases. We observe high intermittency as a function of the
order of the velocity correlation within each fixed anisotropic sector and a
hierarchical organization of scaling exponents at fixed order of the velocity
correlation at changing the anisotropic sector.
