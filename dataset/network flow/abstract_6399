From the viewpoint of networks, a ranking system for players or teams in
sports is equivalent to a centrality measure for sports networks, whereby a
directed link represents the result of a single game. Previously proposed
network-based ranking systems are derived from static networks, i.e.,
aggregation of the results of games over time. However, the score of a player
(or team) fluctuates over time. Defeating a renowned player in the peak
performance is intuitively more rewarding than defeating the same player in
other periods. To account for this factor, we propose a dynamic variant of such
a network-based ranking system and apply it to professional men's tennis data.
We derive a set of linear online update equations for the score of each player.
The proposed ranking system predicts the outcome of the future games with a
higher accuracy than the static counterparts.
