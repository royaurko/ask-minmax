A finite-size-scaling (FSS) theory is proposed for various models in complex
networks. In particular, we focus on the FSS exponent, which plays a crucial
role in analyzing numerical data for finite-size systems. Based on the
droplet-excitation (hyperscaling) argument, we conjecture the values of the FSS
exponents for the Ising model, the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, and
the contact process, all of which are confirmed reasonably well in numerical
simulations.
