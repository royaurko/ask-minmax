E-mail is probably the most popular application on the Internet, with
everyday business and personal communications dependent on it. Spam or
unsolicited e-mail has been estimated to cost businesses significant amounts of
money. However, our understanding of the network-level behavior of legitimate
e-mail traffic and how it differs from spam traffic is limited. In this study,
we have passively captured SMTP packets from a 10 Gbit/s Internet backbone link
to construct a social network of e-mail users based on their exchanged e-mails.
The focus of this paper is on the graph metrics indicating various structural
properties of e-mail networks and how they evolve over time. This study also
looks into the differences in the structural and temporal characteristics of
spam and non-spam networks. Our analysis on the collected data allows us to
show several differences between the behavior of spam and legitimate e-mail
traffic, which can help us to understand the behavior of spammers and give us
the knowledge to statistically model spam traffic on the network-level in order
to complement current spam detection techniques.
