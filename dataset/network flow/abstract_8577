We study the mutual percolation of a system composed of two interdependent
random regular networks. We introduce a notion of distance to explore the
effects of the proximity of interdependent nodes on the cascade of failures
after an initial attack. We find a non-trivial relation between the nature of
the transition through which the networks disintegrate and the parameters of
the system, which are the degree of the nodes and the maximum distance between
interdependent nodes. We explain this relation by solving the problem
analytically for the relevant set of cases.
