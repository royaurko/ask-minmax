This paper presents results of three-dimensional simulations of global
hydrodynamic instabilities in black hole tori, extending earlier work by Hawley
to Kerr spacetimes. This study probes a three-dimensional parameter space of
torus angular momentum, torus size, and black hole angular momentum. We have
observed the growth of the Papaloizou-Pringle instability for a range of torus
configurations and the resultant formation of m=1 planets. We have also
observed the quenching of this instability in the presence of early accretion
flows; however, in one simulation both early accretion and planet formation
occurred. Though most of the conclusions reached in Hawley's earlier work on
Schwarzschild black holes carry over to Kerr spacetime, the presence of frame
dragging in the Kerr geometry adds an element of complexity to the simulations;
we have seen especially clear examples of this phenomenon in the accretion
flows that arise from retrograde tori.
