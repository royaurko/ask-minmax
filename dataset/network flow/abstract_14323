We elaborate on a previous attempt to prove the irreversibility of the
renormalization group flow above two dimensions. This involves the construction
of a monotonically decreasing $c$-function using a spectral representation. The
missing step of the proof is a good definition of this function at the fixed
points. We argue that for all kinds of perturbative flows the $c$-function is
well-defined and the $c$-theorem holds in any dimension. We provide examples in
multicritical and multicomponent scalar theories for dimension $2<d<4$. We also
discuss the non-perturbative flows in the yet unsettled case of the $O(N)$
sigma-model for $2\leq d\leq 4$ and large $N$.
