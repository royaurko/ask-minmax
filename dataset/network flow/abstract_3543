In many real complex networks, the fractal and self-similarity properties
have been found. The fractal dimension is a useful method to describe fractal
property of complex networks. Fractal analysis is inadequate if only taking one
fractal dimension to study complex networks. In this case, multifractal
analysis of complex networks are concerned. However, multifractal dimension of
weighted networks are less involved. In this paper, multifractal dimension of
weighted networks is proposed based on box-covering algorithm for fractal
dimension of weighted networks (BCANw). The proposed method is applied to
calculate the fractal dimensions of some real networks. Our numerical results
indicate that the proposed method is efficient for analysis fractal property of
weighted networks.
