Lateral flow (LF) immunoassays are one of the most prevalent point-of-care
(POC) diagnostics due to their simplicity, low cost, and robust operation. A
common criticism of LF tests is that they have poor detection limits compared
to analytical techniques, like ELISA, which confines their application as a
diagnostic tool. The low detection limit of LF assays and associated long
equilibration times is due to kinetically limited surface reactions that result
from low target concentrations. Here we use isotachophoresis (ITP), a powerful
electrokinetic preconcentration and separation technique, to focus target
analytes into a thin band and transport them to the LF capture line resulting
is a dramatic increase in the surface reaction rate and equilibrium binding. We
show that ITP is able to improve limit of detection (LOD) of LF assays by
400-fold for 90 second assay time and by 160-fold for a longer 5 minutes time
scale. ITP-enhanced LF (ITP-LF) also shows up to 30% target extraction from 100
uL of the sample, while conventional LF captures less than 1% of the target.
ITP improves LF assay LOD to the level of some lab based immunoassays, such as
ELISA, and may provide sufficient analytical sensitivity for application to a
broader range of analytes and diseases that require higher sensitivity and
lower detection limits.
