In this paper we use several approaches to analyse a scientific journal as a
complex system and to make a possibly more complete description of its current
state and evolution. Methods of complex networks theory, statistics, and
queueing theory are used in this study. As a subject of the analysis we have
chosen the journal ``Condensed Matter Physics''
(http://www.icmp.lviv.ua/journal/). In particular, based on the statistical
data regarding the papers published in this journal since its foundation in
1993 up to now we have composed the co-contributorship network and extracted its
main quantitative characteristics. Further, we analyse the priorities of
scientific trends reflected in the journal and its impact on the publications
in other editions (the citation ratings). Moreover, to characterize an
efficiency of the paper processing, we study the time dynamics of editorial
processing in terms of queueing theory and human activity analysis.
