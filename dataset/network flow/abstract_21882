In this short note I speculate on some consequences of the high energy
collision picture in which the orbital angular momentum of the colliding
hadrons can be converted into secondary particle angular spin momentum via some
spin-orbital interaction. In particular I discuss a possibility to observe a
non-zero polarization of secondary particles (e.g. hyperons) at midrapidity
($x_F=0$) and at low transverse momentum. I also speculate that such effects
could contribute to the produced particle directed and elliptic flow observed
in relativistic nuclear collisions.
