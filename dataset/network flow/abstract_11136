Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are commonly used in various ubiquitous and
pervasive applications. Due to limited power resources, the optimal dynamic
base station (BS) replacement could be Prolong the sensor network lifetime. In
this paper we'll present a dynamic optimum method for base station replacement
so that can save energy in sensors and increases network lifetime. Because
positioning problem is a NPhard problem [1], therefore we'll use genetic
algorithm to solve positioning problem. We've considered energy and distance
parameters for finding BS optimized position. In our represented algorithm base
station position is fixed just during each round and its positioning is done at
the start of next round then it'll be placed in optimized position. Evaluating
our proposed algorithm, we'll execute DBSR algorithm on LEACH & HEED Protocols.
