Public transport routes sharing the same grid of streets and tracks are often
found to proceed in parallel along shorter or longer sequences of stations.
Similar phenomena are observed in other networks built with space consuming
links such as cables, vessels, pipes, neurons, etc. In the case of public
transport networks (PTNs) this behavior may be easily worked out on the basis
of sequences of stations serviced by each route. To quantify this behavior we
use the recently introduced notion of network harness. It is described by the
harness distribution P(r,s): the number of sequences of s consecutive stations
that are serviced by r parallel routes. For certain PTNs that we have analyzed
we observe that the harness distribution may be described by power laws. These
power laws observed indicate a certain level of organization and planning which
may be driven by the need to minimize the costs of infrastructure and secondly
by the fact that points of interest tend to be clustered in certain locations
of a city. This effect may be seen as a result of the strong interdependence of
the evolutions of both the city and its PTN.
  To further investigate the significance of the empirical results we have
studied one- and two-dimensional models of randomly placed routes modeled by
different types of walks. While in one dimension an analytic treatment was
successful, the two dimensional case was studied by simulations showing that
the empirical results for real PTNs deviate significantly from those expected
for randomly placed routes.
