This paper is concerned with a class of partial differential equations, which
are the linear combinations, with constant coefficients, of the classical flows
of the KdV hierarchy. A boundary value problem with inhomogeneous boundary
conditions of a certain special form is studied. We construct some class of
solutions of the problem using the inverse spectral method.
