This paper proposes the use of sets of keys, together with corresponding
identifiers, for use in wireless sensor networks and similar
resource-constrained applications. A specific cryptographic scheme described in
the paper is based on the use of a family of self-inverting matrices derived
from the number theoretic Hilbert transform in conjunction with the Blom's
scheme. In a randomized version of this scheme, the users change their
published IDs at will but the parties can still reach agreement on the key by
using individual scaling factors. The random protocol increases the security of
the system.
