We propose a two dimensional probabilistic cellular automata for the
description of traffic flow in a small city network composed of two
intersections. The traffic in the network is controlled by a set of traffic
lights which can be operated both in fixed-time and a traffic responsive
manner. Vehicular dynamics is simulated and the total delay experienced by the
traffic is evaluated within specified time intervals. We investigate both
decentralized and centralized traffic responsive schemes and in particular
discuss the implementation of the {\it green-wave} strategy. Our investigations
prove that the network delay strongly depends on the signalisation strategy. We
show that in some traffic conditions, the application of the green-wave scheme
may destructively lead to the increment of the global delay.
