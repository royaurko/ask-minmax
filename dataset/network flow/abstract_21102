The 1995 model of Bonabeau et al is generalized by giving each individual a
different ability to win or lose a fight. We also introduce different groups
such that the losers of fights between different groups are eliminated. The
overall phase diagram for the first-order transition between egalitarian and
hierarchical societies does not change much by these generalizations.
