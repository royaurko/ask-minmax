Studies in the forward region of charged particle multiplicity and density,
as well as energy flow, are presented. These measurements are performed using
data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV,
collected with the LHCb detector. The results are compared to predictions from
a variety of Monte Carlo event generators and are used to test underlying event
and hadronization models as well as the performance of event generator tunes in
the forward region.
