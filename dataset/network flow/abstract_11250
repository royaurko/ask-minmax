We find that traditional statistics for measuring degree mixing are strongly
affected by superrich nodes. To counteract and measure the effect of superrich
nodes, we propose a paradigm to quantify the mixing pattern of a real network
in which different mixing patterns may appear among low-degree nodes and among
high-degree nodes. The new paradigm and the simple revised measure uncover the
true complex degree mixing patterns of complex networks with superrich nodes.
The new method indicates that some networks show a false disassortative mixing
induced by superrich nodes, and have no tendency to be genuinely
disassortative. Our results also show that the previously observed fragility of
scale-free networks is actually greatly exacerbated by the presence of even a
very small number of superrich nodes.
