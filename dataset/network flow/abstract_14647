The measurement of the elliptic flow, $v_{2}$, provides a powerful tool for
studying the properties of hot and dense medium created in high-energy nuclear
collisions. We present the measurement of $v_{2}$ of multi-strange hadrons
($\phi$, $\Xi$ and $\Omega$) in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV Au + Au collisions at
STAR. In minimum-bias Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, a
significant amount of elliptic flow, almost identical to other mesons and
baryons, is observed for multi-strange hadrons. Experimental observations of
$p_{T}$ dependence of $v_{2}$ of identified particles at RHIC support partonic
collectivity. We also discuss the possible breaking of mass ordering of the
$\phi$ mesons in the low $p_{T}$ region.
