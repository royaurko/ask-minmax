This paper presents a lattice approach to model the influence of cracking on
inviscid flow in concrete. A mechanical lattice model based on a
damage-plasticity constitutive model was combined with a new dual lattice of
conduit elements for flow analysis. The diffusivity of the conduit elements
depends on the crack-opening obtained from the mechanical lattice. The coupled
lattice model was applied to several benchmark tests for aligned and random
lattices. The results for mechanical loading and flow analysis obtained with
the new approach were shown to be independent of the size of lattice elements
used.
