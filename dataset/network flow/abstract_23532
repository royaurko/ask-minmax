To study the interplay between global market choice and local peer pressure,
we construct a minority-game-like econophysical model. In this so-called
networked minority game model, every selfish player uses both the historical
minority choice of the population and the historical choice of one's neighbors
in an unbiased manner to make decision. Results of numerical simulation show
that the level of cooperation in the networked minority game differs remarkably
from the original minority game as well as the prediction of the
crowd-anticrowd theory. We argue that the deviation from the crowd-anticrowd
theory is due to the negligence of the effect of a four point correlation
function in the effective Hamiltonian of the system.
