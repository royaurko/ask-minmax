We perform a systematic search for static solutions in different sectors of
5d $N=8$ supergravities with compact and non-compact gauged R-symmetry groups,
finding new and listing already known backgrounds. Due to the variety of
possible gauge groups and resulting scalar potentials, the maximally symmetric
vacua we encounter in these theories can be Minkowski, de Sitter, or anti-de
Sitter. There exist BPS and non-BPS near-horizon geometries and full solutions
with all these three types of asymptotics, corresponding to black holes,
branes, strings, rings, and other black objects with more exotic horizon
topologies, supported by $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ charges. The asymptotically AdS$_5$
solutions also have a clear holographic interpretation as RG flows of field
theories on D3 branes, wrapped on compact 2- and 3-manifolds.
