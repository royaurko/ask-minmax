Determination of boiling range of xylene mixed in PX device is currently a
crucial topic in the practical applications because of the recent disputes of
PX project in China. In our study, instead of determining the boiling range of
xylene mixed by traditional approach in laboratory or industry, we successfully
established two Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) models to determine the
initial boiling point and final boiling point respectively. Results show that
the Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks (MLFN) model with 7 nodes (MLFN-7)
is the best model to determine the initial boiling point of xylene mixed, with
the RMS error 0.18; while the MLFN model with 4 nodes (MLFN-4) is the best
model to determine the final boiling point of xylene mixed, with the RMS error
0.75. The training and testing processes both indicate that the models we
developed are robust and precise. Our research can effectively avoid the damage
of the PX device to human body and environment.
