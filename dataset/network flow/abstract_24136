This work tackles the problem of energy-efficient distributed power control
in wireless networks with a large number of transmitters. The problem is
modeled by a dynamic game. Each transmitter-receiver communication is
characterized by a state given by the available energy and/or the individual
channel state and whose evolution is governed by certain dynamics. Since
equilibrium analysis in such a (stochastic) game is generally difficult and
even impossible, the problem is approximated by exploiting the large system
assumption. Under an appropriate exchangeability assumption, the corresponding
mean field game is well defined and studied in detail for special cases. The
main contribution of this work is to show how mean field games can be applied
to the problem under investigation and provide illustrative numerical results.
Our results indicate that this approach can lead to significant gains in terms
of energy-efficiency at the resulting equilibrium.
