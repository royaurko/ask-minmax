We consider a model of heat conduction networks consisting of oscillators in
contact with heat baths at different temperatures. Our aim is to generalize the
results concerning the existence and uniqueness of the stationnary state
already obtained when the network is reduced to a chain of particles. Using
Lasalle's principle, we establish a condition on the disposition of the heat
baths among the network that ensures the uniqueness of the invariant measure.
We will show that this condition is sharp when the oscillators are linear.
Moreover, when the interaction between the particles is stronger than the
pinning, we prove that this condition implies the existence of the invariant
measure.
