We propose an extended local-world evolving network model including a triad
formation step. In the process of network evolution, random fluctuation in the
number of new edges is involved. We derive analytical expressions for degree
distribution, clustering coefficient and average path length. Our model can
unify the generic properties of real-life networks: scale-free degree
distribution, high clustering and small inter-node separation. Moreover, in our
model, the clustering coefficient is tunable simply by changing the expected
number of triad formation steps after a single local preferential attachment
step.
