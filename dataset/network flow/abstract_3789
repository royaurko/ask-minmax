We propose a class of networks which can be regarded as an extension of the
graphitic network. These networks are constructed so that surface states with
non-bonding character (edge states) are formed in a tight-binding model with
one orbital for each atomic site. Besides, for several networks, the
tight-binding electronic structures become a zero-gap semiconductor. These
properties have been found in the $\pi$-electron system of the graphene. Thus,
we call these networks hypergraphite.
