Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of autonomous nodes or
terminals which communicate with each other by forming a multi-hop radio
network and maintaining connectivity in a decentralized manner. The
conventional security solutions to provide key management through accessing
trusted contributorities or centralized servers are infeasible for this new
environment since mobile ad hoc networks are characterized by the absence of
any infrastructure, frequent mobility, and wireless links. We propose a
hierarchical group key management scheme that is hierarchical and fully
distributed with no central contributority and uses a simple rekeying procedure
which is suitable for large and high mobility mobile ad hoc networks. The
rekeying procedure requires only one round in our scheme and Chinese Remainder
Theorem Diffie Hellman Group Diffie Hellmann and Burmester and Desmedt it is a
constant 3 whereas in other schemes such as Distributed Logical Key Hierarchy
and Distributed One Way Function Trees, it depends on the number of members. We
reduce the energy consumption during communication of the keying materials by
reducing the number of bits in the rekeying message. We show through analysis
and simulations that our scheme has less computation, communication and energy
consumption compared to the existing schemes.
