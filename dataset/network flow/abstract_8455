This short paper presents an abstract, tunable model of genomic structural
change within the cell lifecycle and explores its use with simulated evolution.
A well-known Boolean model of genetic regulatory networks is extended to
include changes in node connectivity based upon the current cell state, e.g.,
via transposable elements. The underlying behaviour of the resulting dynamical
networks is investigated before their evolvability is explored using a version
of the NK model of fitness landscapes. Structural dynamism is found to be
selected for in non-stationary environments and subsequently shown capable of
providing a mechanism for evolutionary innovation when such reorganizations are
inherited.
