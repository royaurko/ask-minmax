We study two kinds of economic exchange, additive and multiplicative, in a
system of N agents. The work is divided in two parts, in the first one, the
agents are free to interact with each other. The system evolves to a
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution with additive exchange and condenses with a
multiplicative one. If bankruptcy is introduced, both types of exchange lead to
condensation. Condensation times have been studied. In the second part, the
agents are placed in a social network. We analyze the behavior of wealth
distributions in time, and the formation of economic classes was observed for
certain values of network connectivity.
