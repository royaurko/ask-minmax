We present a simple approach to study the one-dimensional pressureless Euler
system via adhesion dynamics in the Wasserstein space of probability measures
with finite quadratic moments.
  Starting from a discrete system of a finite number of "sticky" particles, we
obtain new explicit estimates of the solution in terms of the initial mass and
momentum and we are able to construct an evolution semigroup in a
measure-theoretic phase space, allowing mass distributions with finite
quadratic moment and corresponding L^2-velocity fields. We investigate various
interesting properties of this semigroup, in particular its link with the
gradient flow of the (opposite) squared Wasserstein distance.
  Our arguments rely on an equivalent formulation of the evolution as a
gradient flow in the convex cone of nondecreasing functions in the Hilbert
space L^2(0,1), which corresponds to the Lagrangian system of coordinates given
by the canonical monotone rearrangement of the measures.
