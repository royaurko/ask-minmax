An analytically tractable model for Gaussian multiuser channels with fading
is studied, and the capacity region of this model is found to be a good
approximation of the capacity region of the original Gaussian network. This
work extends the existing body of work on deterministic models for Gaussian
multiuser channels to include the physical phenomenon of fading. In particular,
it generalizes these results to a unicast, multiple node network setting with
fading.
