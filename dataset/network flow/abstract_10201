Migrations have played an important role in shaping the genetic diversity of
human populations. Understanding genomic data thus requires careful modeling of
historical gene flow. Here we consider the effect of relatively recent
population structure and gene flow, and interpret genomes of individuals that
have ancestry from multiple source populations as mosaics of segments
originating from each population. We propose general and tractable models for
describing the evolution of these patterns of local ancestry and their impact
on genetic diversity. We focus on the length distribution of continuous
ancestry tracts, and the variance in total ancestry proportions among
individuals. The proposed models offer improved agreement with Wright-Fisher
simulation data when compared to state-of-the art models, and can be used to
infer various demographic parameters in gene flow models. Considering HapMap
African-American (ASW) data, we find that a model with two distinct phases of
`European' gene flow significantly improves the modeling of both tract lengths
and ancestry variances.
