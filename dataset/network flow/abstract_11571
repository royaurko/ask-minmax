Cooperative caching is a technique used in mobile ad hoc networks to improve
the efficiency of information access by reducing the access latency and
bandwidth usage. Cache replacement policy plays a significant role in response
time reduction by selecting suitable subset of items for eviction from the
cache. In this paper we have made a review of the existing cache replacement
algorithms proposed for cooperative caching in ad hoc networks. We made an
attempt to classify existing replacement policies for ad hoc networks based on
the replacement decision taken. In addition, this paper suggests some
alternative techniques for cache replacement. Finally, the paper concludes with
a discussion on future research directions.
