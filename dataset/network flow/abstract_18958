Discovering causal genetic variants from large genetic association studies
poses many difficult challenges. Assessing which genetic markers are involved
in determining trait status is a computationally demanding task, especially in
the presence of gene-gene interactions. A non-parametric Bayesian approach in
the form of a Bayesian neural network is proposed for use in analyzing genetic
association studies. Demonstrations on synthetic and real data reveal they are
able to efficiently and accurately determine which variants are involved in
determining case-control status. Using graphics processing units (GPUs) the
time needed to build these models is decreased by several orders of magnitude.
In comparison with commonly used approaches for detecting genetic interactions,
Bayesian neural networks perform very well across a broad spectrum of possible
genetic relationships while having the computational efficiency needed to
handle large datasets.
