The recent torsional oscillator results of Kim and Chan suggest a supersolid
phase transition in solid He-4 confined in Vycor. We have used a capacitive
technique to directly monitor density changes for helium confined in Vycor at
low temperature and have used a piezoelectrically driven diaphragm to study the
pressure-induced flow of solid helium into the Vycor pores. Our measurements
showed no indication of a mass redistribution in the Vycor that could mimic
supersolid decoupling and put an upper limit of about 0.003 um/s on any
pressure-induced supersolid flow in the pores of Vycor.
