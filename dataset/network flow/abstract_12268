Cognitive radio (CR) is found to be an emerging key for efficient spectrum
utilization. In this paper, spectrum sharing among service providers with the
help of cognitive radio has been investigated. The technique of spectrum
sharing among service providers to share the licensed spectrum of licensed
service providers in a dynamic manner is considered. The performance of the
wireless network with opportunistic spectrum sharing techniques is analyzed.
Thus, the spectral utilization and efficiency of sensing is increased, the
interference is minimized, and the call blockage is reduced.
