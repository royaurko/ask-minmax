Unions of graph Fourier multipliers are an important class of linear
operators for processing signals defined on graphs. We present a novel method
to efficiently distribute the application of these operators to the
high-dimensional signals collected by sensor networks. The proposed method
features approximations of the graph Fourier multipliers by shifted Chebyshev
polynomials, whose recurrence relations make them readily amenable to
distributed computation. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used in
a distributed denoising task, and show that the communication requirements of
the method scale gracefully with the size of the network.
