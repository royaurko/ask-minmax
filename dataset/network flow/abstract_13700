We study the compact noncollapsed ancient convex solutions to Mean Curvature
Flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $O(1)\times O(n)$ symmetry. We show they all
have unique asymptotics as $t\to -\infty$ and we give precise asymptotic
description of these solutions. In particular, solutions constructed by White,
and Haslhofer and Hershkovits have those asymptotics (in the case of those
particular solutions the asymptotics was predicted and formally computed by
Angenent).
