Flows on (or variations of) discrete curves in $\R^2$ give rise to flows on a
subalgebra of functions on that curve. For a special choice of flows and a
certain subalgebra this is described by the Toda lattice hierachy. In the paper
it is shown that the canonical symplectic structure on $\R^{2N}$, which can be
interpreted as the phase space of closed discrete curves in $\R^2$ with length
$N,$ induces Poisson commutation relations on the above mentioned subalgebra
which yield the tri-hamiltonian poisson structure of the Toda lattice hierachy.
