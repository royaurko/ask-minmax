Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in computational
neuroscience and machine learning applications. In an RNN, each neuron computes
its output as a nonlinear function of its integrated input. While the
importance of RNNs, especially as models of brain processing, is undisputed, it
is also widely acknowledged that the computations in standard RNN models may be
an over-simplification of what real neuronal networks compute. Here, we suggest
that the RNN approach may be made both neurobiologically more plausible and
computationally more powerful by its fusion with Bayesian inference techniques
for nonlinear dynamical systems. In this scheme, we use an RNN as a generative
model of dynamic input caused by the environment, e.g. of speech or kinematics.
Given this generative RNN model, we derive Bayesian update equations that can
decode its output. Critically, these updates define a 'recognizing RNN' (rRNN),
in which neurons compute and exchange prediction and prediction error messages.
The rRNN has several desirable features that a conventional RNN does not have,
for example, fast decoding of dynamic stimuli and robustness to initial
conditions and noise. Furthermore, it implements a predictive coding scheme for
dynamic inputs. We suggest that the Bayesian inversion of recurrent neural
networks may be useful both as a model of brain function and as a machine
learning tool. We illustrate the use of the rRNN by an application to the
online decoding (i.e. recognition) of human kinematics.
