We develop a physiologically-based lattice model for the transport and
metabolism of drugs in the functional unit of the liver, called the lobule. In
contrast to earlier studies, we have emphasized the dominant role of convection
in well-vascularized tissue with a given structure. Estimates of convective,
diffusive and reaction contributions are given. We have compared drug
concentration levels observed exiting the lobule with their predicted detailed
distribution inside the lobule, assuming that most often the former is
accessible information while the latter is not.
