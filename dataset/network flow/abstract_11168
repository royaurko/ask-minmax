In two different classes of network models, namely, the Watts Strogatz type
and the Euclidean type, subtle changes have been introduced in the randomness.
In the Watts Strogatz type network, rewiring has been done in different ways
and although the qualitative results remain same, finite differences in the
exponents are observed. In the Euclidean type networks, where at least one
finite phase transition occurs, two models differing in a similar way have been
considered. The results show a possible shift in one of the phase transition
points but no change in the values of the exponents. The WS and Euclidean type
models are equivalent for extreme values of the parameters; we compare their
behaviour for intermediate values.
