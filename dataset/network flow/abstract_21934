The Michelson Sivashinsky equation, which models the non linear dynamics of
premixed flames, has been recently extended to describe oblique flames. This
approach was extremely successful to describe the behavior on one side of the
flame, but some qualitative effects involving the interaction of both sides of
the front were left unexplained. We use here a potential flow model, first
introduced by Frankel, to study numerically this configuration. Furthermore,
this approach allows us to provide a physical explanation of the phenomena
occuring in this geometry by means of an electrostatic analogy.
