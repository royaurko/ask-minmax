This paper aims to propose a significant way of remote access and real time
monitoring of a particular geographic area by integrating wireless sensor
clouds with existing Telecom infrastructure and applications built around them
through a gateway. This utility is very potent for environment monitoring in
harsh and inaccessible places like mines, nuclear reactors, etc. We demonstrate
a scaled down version of multi-hop network of wireless sensor nodes and its
integration with existing telecom network infrastructure via a gateway. The
kind of results achieved like temperature monitoring etc. gives a glimpse of an
enormous step ahead in mine safety.
