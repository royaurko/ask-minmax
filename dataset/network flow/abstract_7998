We study the Ricci flow on Riemannian groupoids. We assume that these
groupoids are closed and that the space of orbits is compact and connected. We
prove the short time existence and uniqueness of the Ricci flow on these
groupoids. We also define a F-functional and derive the corresponding results
for steady breathers on these spaces.
