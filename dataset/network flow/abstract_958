Large-scale three dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of hopper flow
are presented. The flow rate of the system is controlled by the width of the
aperture at the bottom. As the steady-state flow rate is reduced, the force
distribution $P(f)$ changes only slightly, while there is a large change in the
impulse distribution $P(i)$. In both cases, the distributions show an increase
in small forces or impulses as the systems approach jamming, the opposite of
that seen in previous Lennard-Jones simulations. This occurs dynamically as
well for a hopper that transitions from a flowing to a jammed state over time.
The final jammed $P(f)$ is quite distinct from a poured packing $P(f)$ in the
same geometry. The change in $P(i)$ is a much stronger indicator of the
approach to jamming. The formation of a peak or plateau in $P(f)$ at the
average force is not a general feature of the approach to jamming.
