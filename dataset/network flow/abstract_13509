We develop connections between Harnack inequalities for the heat flow of
diffusion operators with curvature bounded from below and optimal
transportation. Through heat kernel inequalities, a new isoperimetric-type
Harnack inequality is emphasized. Commutation properties between the heat and
Hopf-Lax semigroups are developed consequently, providing direct access to the
heat flow contraction property along Wasserstein distances.
