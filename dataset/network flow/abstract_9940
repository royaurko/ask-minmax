In the above paper [Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 13 (2002) 1843-1850] the
contributor treats the boundary layer flow along a vertical isothermal plate of an
electrically conducting fluid. The plate lies in a vertical free stream of
constant velocity $u_\infty$, constant temperature $T_\infty$ and constant mass
concentration $C_\infty$. The plate moves vertically with a velocity which is a
linear function of distance $x$ ($u_w=cx$). A transverse magnetic field with
constant strength $B_0$ is imposed on the flow. The boundary layer equations
are integrated numerically. However, there is a fundamental error in this paper
and the presented results do not have any practical value.
