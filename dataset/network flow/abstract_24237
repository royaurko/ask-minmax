We consider a decentralized detection problem in a power-constrained wireless
sensor networks (WSNs), in which a number of sensor nodes collaborate to detect
the presence of a deterministic vector signal. The signal to be detected is
assumed known \emph{a priori}. Given a constraint on the total amount of
transmit power, we investigate the optimal linear precoding design for each
sensor node. More specifically, in order to achieve the best detection
performance, shall sensor nodes transmit their raw data to the fusion center
(FC), or transmit compressed versions of their original data? The optimal power
allocation among sensors is studied as well. Also, assuming a fixed total
transmit power, we examine how the detection performance behaves with the
number of sensors in the network. A new concept "detection outage" is proposed
to quantify the reliability of the overall detection system. Finally,
decentralized detection with unknown signals is studied. Numerical results are
conducted to corroborate our theoretical analysis and to illustrate the
performance of the proposed algorithm.
