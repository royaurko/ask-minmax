We present measurements of the frequency and electric field dependent
conductivity of single walled carbon nanotube(SWCNT) networks of various
densities. The ac conductivity as a function of frequency is consistent with
the extended pair approximation model and increases with frequency above an
onset frequency $\omega_0$ which varies over seven decades with a range of film
thickness from sub-monolayer to 200 nm. The nonlinear electric field-dependent
DC conductivity shows strong dependence on film thickness as well. Measurement
of the electric field dependence of the resistance R(E) allows for the
determination of a length scale $L_{E}$ possibly characterizing the distance
between tube contacts, which is found to systematically decrease with
increasing film thickness. The onset frequency $\omega_0$ of ac conductivity
and the length scale $L_{E}$ of SWCNT networks are found to be correlated, and
a physically reasonable empirical formula relating them has been proposed. Such
studies will help the understanding of transport properties and benefit the
applications of this material system.
