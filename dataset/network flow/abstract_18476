Network motif algorithms have been a topic of research mainly after the
2002-seminal paper from Milo \emph{et al}, that provided motifs as a way to
uncover the basic building blocks of most networks. In Bioinformatics, motifs
have been mainly applied in the field of gene regulation networks. This paper
proposes new algorithms to exactly count isomorphic pattern motifs of sizes 3,
4 and 5 in directed graphs. Let $G(V,E)$ be a directed graph with $m=|E|$. We
describe an $O({m\sqrt{m}})$ time complexity algorithm to count isomorphic
patterns of size 3. In order to count isomorphic patterns of size 4, we propose
an $O(m^2)$ algorithm. To count patterns with 5 vertices, the algorithm is
$O(m^2n)$. The new algorithms were implemented and compared with FANMOD and
Kavosh motif detection tools. The experiments show that our algorithms are
expressively faster than FANMOD and Kavosh's. We also let our motif-detecting
tool available in the Internet.
