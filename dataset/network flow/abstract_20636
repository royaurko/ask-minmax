A gauge model of neural network is introduced, which resembles the Z(2) Higgs
lattice gauge theory of high-energy physics. It contains a neuron variable $S_x
= \pm 1$ on each site $x$ of a 3D lattice and a synaptic-connection variable
$J_{x\mu} = \pm 1$ on each link $(x,x+\hat{\mu}) (\mu=1,2,3)$. The model is
regarded as a generalization of the Hopfield model of associative memory to a
model of learning by converting the synaptic weight between $x$ and
$x+\hat{\mu}$ to a dynamical Z(2) gauge variable $J_{x\mu}$. The local Z(2)
gauge symmetry is inherited from the Hopfield model and assures us the locality
of time evolutions of $S_x$ and $J_{x\mu}$ and a generalized Hebbian learning
rule. At finite "temperatures", numerical simulations show that the model
exhibits the Higgs, confinement, and Coulomb phases. We simulate dynamical
processes of learning a pattern of $S_x$ and recalling it, and classify the
parameter space according to the performance. At some parameter regions, stable
column-layer structures in signal propagations are spontaneously generated.
Mutual interactions between $S_x$ and $J_{x\mu}$ induce partial memory loss as
expected.
