Evolutionary PDEs for geometric order parameters that admit propagating
singular solutions are introduced and discussed. These singular solutions arise
as a result of the competition between nonlinear and nonlocal processes in
various familiar vector spaces. Several examples are given. The motivating
example is the directed self assembly of a large number of particles for
technological purposes such as nano-science processes, in which the particle
interactions are anisotropic. This application leads to the derivation and
analysis of gradient flow equations on Lie algebras. The Riemann structure of
these gradient flow equations is also discussed.
