Magnetic field-driven domain wall motion in an ultrathin Pt/Co(0.45nm)/Pt
ferromagnetic film with perpendicular anisotropy is studied over a wide
temperature range. Three different pinning dependent dynamical regimes are
clearly identified: the creep, the thermally assisted flux flow and the
depinning, as well as their corresponding crossovers. The wall elastic energy
and microscopic parameters characterizing the pinning are determined. Both the
extracted thermal rounding exponent at the depinning transition, $\psi=$0.15,
and the Larkin length crossover exponent, $\phi=$0.24, fit well with the
numerical predictions.
