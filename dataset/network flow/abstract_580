We study the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Google matrix
of the Wikipedia articles hyperlink network and other real networks. With the
help of the Arnoldi method we analyze the distribution of eigenvalues in the
complex plane and show that eigenstates with significant eigenvalue modulus are
located on well defined network communities. We also show that the correlator
between PageRank and CheiRank vectors distinguishes different organizations of
information flow on BBC and Le Monde web sites.
