We introduce a self-organized model of graph evolution associated with
preferential network random walkers. The idea is developed by using two
different types of walkers, the interactions of which lead to a dynamic graph.
The walkers of the first type cause an enhancement in link attachments, while
the second types have a destructive behavior. The statistical properties of the
resulting network, including weight distributions, clustering, spectral
densities and average path length are evaluated. As the ratio of the population
of two types is balanced, the network faces a phase transition. We show that in
the transition point, the graph behaves as a scale-free network, with a scaling
exponent of \sim -1.7.
