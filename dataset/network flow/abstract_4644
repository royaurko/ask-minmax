A model for energy, pressure and flow velocity distributions at the beginning
of relativistic heavy ion collisions has been developed to be used as initial
condition for hydrodynamical calculations. The results show that at the early
stages QGP forms a tilted disk, such that the direction of the largest pressure
gradient stays in the reaction plane, but deviates from both the beam and the
usual transverse flow directions. Such initial conditions may lead to the
creation of the "antiflow" or the "third flow component".
