We consider a body in a parallel flow of non-interacting particles. One can
imagine that the flow is highly rarefied or consists of light rays. The
interaction of particles with the body is perfectly elastic. We introduce the
notions of a body of zero resistance and an invisible body and prove that all
such bodies do exist.
