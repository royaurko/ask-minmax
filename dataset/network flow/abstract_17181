In the last two years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved an
impressive suite of results on standard recognition datasets and tasks.
CNN-based features seem poised to quickly replace engineered representations,
such as SIFT and HOG. However, compared to SIFT and HOG, we understand much
less about the nature of the features learned by large CNNs. In this paper, we
experimentally probe several aspects of CNN feature learning in an attempt to
help practitioners gain useful, evidence-backed intuitions about how to apply
CNNs to computer vision problems.
