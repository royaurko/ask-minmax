Theory is presented for the distributions of local process intensity and
local average pore dimensions in random fibrous materials. For complete
partitioning of the network into contiguous square zones, the variance of local
process intensity is shown to be proportional to the mean process intensity and
inversely proportional to the zone size. The coefficient of variation of local
average pore area is shown to be approximately double that of the local average
pore diameter with both properties being inversely proportional to the square
root of zone size and mean process intensity. The results have relevance to
heterogenous near-planar fibrous materials including paper, nonwoven textiles,
nanofibrous composites and electrospun polymer fibre networks.
