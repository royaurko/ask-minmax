In this paper, we propose a hybrid decision algorithm for the selection of
the access in multi-operator networks environment, where competing operators
share their radio access networks to meet traffic and data rate demands. The
proposed algorithm guarantees the user satisfaction and a global gain for all
cooperating operators. Simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed
scheme and show that the cooperation between operators achieves benefits to
both users and operators; user acceptance as well as the operator resource
utilization and the operator revenue increase.
