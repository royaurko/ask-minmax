Turbulent Taylor-Couette flow between counter-rotating cylinders develops
intermittently fluctuating boundary layers for sufficient counter-rotation. We
demonstrate the phenomenon in direct numerical simulations for radius ratios
\eta=0.5 and 0.71 and propose a theoretical model for the critical value in the
rotation ratio. Numerical results as well as experiments show that the onset of
this intermittency coincides with the maximum in torque. The variations in
torque correlate with the variations in mean Taylor vortex flow which is first
enhanced for weak counter-rotation, and then reduced as intermittency sets in.
To support the model, we compare to numerical results, experiments at higher
Reynolds numbers, and to Wendt's data.
