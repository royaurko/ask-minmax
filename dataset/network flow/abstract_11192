Information and knowledge in exchange in public networks is a crucial
challenge that needs to be overcome in order to consolidate the benefits
associated with such structures. We study the impact of the nature of the
information exchanged over the possibilities of success of this process, basing
ourselves on the analysis of the information produced by the members of the
Network of National Educational Portals. One of the main challenges that the
Network of National Educational Portals faces consists in finding effective
ways of sharing information that can promote knowledge transfer between members
of the network. We argue that a key factor that prevents information sharing is
the use of performance metrics by portal responsibles to evaluate the results
of their decisions. These metrics are highly sensitive, context-dependent, and
produced through non-standardized methods, all of which reduce the willingness
of knowledge sharing. We present a different approach: based on the Network of
National Educational Portals case, we propose creating a comprehensive
information system aimed at providing reliable and timely information in a
systematic fashion. We believe that adopting standardized procedures and
indicators of less sensitive nature, we can produce information for all
partners without the shortcomings of the usual practices.
