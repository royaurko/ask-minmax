We have derived azimuthally-averaged radial iron abundance profiles of the
X-ray gas contained within 12 clusters of galaxies with redshift 0.03 < z < 0.2
observed with BeppoSAX. We find evidence for a negative metal abundance
gradient in most of the clusters, particularly significant in clusters that
possess cooling flows. The composite profile from the 12 clusters resembles
that of cluster simulations of Metzler & Evrard (1997). This abundance gradient
could be the result of the spatial distribution of gas-losing galaxies within
the cluster being more centrally condensed than the primordial hot gas. Both
inside and outside the core region, we find a higher abundance in cooling flow
clusters than in non-cooling flow clusters. Outside of the cooling region this
difference cannot be the result of more efficient sputtering of metals into the
gaseous phase in cooling flow clusters, but might be the result of the mixing
of low metallicity gas from the outer regions of the cluster during a merger.
