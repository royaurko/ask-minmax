Rate, energy and delay are three main parameters of interest in ad-hoc
networks. In this paper, we discuss the problem of maximizing network utility
and minimizing energy consumption while satisfying a given transmission delay
constraint for each packet. We formulate this problem in the standard convex
optimization form and subsequently discuss the tradeoff between utility, energy
and delay in such framework. Also, in order to adapt for the distributed nature
of the network, a distributed algorithm where nodes decide on choosing
transmission rates and probabilities based on their local information is
introduced.
