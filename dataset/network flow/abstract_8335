We consider a class of open stochastic processing networks, with feedback
routing and overlapping server capabilities, in heavy traffic. The networks we
consider satisfy the so-called complete resource pooling condition and
therefore have one-dimensional approximating Brownian control problems.
  We propose a simple discrete review policy for controlling such networks.
  Assuming 2+\epsilon moments on the interarrival times and processing times,
we provide a conceptually simple proof of asymptotic optimality of the proposed
policy.
