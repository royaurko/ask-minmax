In this paper, we address the problem of K-out-of-L exclusion, a
generalization of the mutual exclusion problem, in which there are $\ell$ units
of a shared resource, and any process can request up to $\mathtt k$ units
($1\leq\mathtt k\leq\ell$). We propose the first deterministic self-stabilizing
distributed K-out-of-L exclusion protocol in message-passing systems for
asynchronous oriented tree networks which assumes bounded local memory for each
process.
