The most important standard in wireless local area networks is IEEE 802.11.
This is why much of the research work for the enhancement of wireless network
is usually based on the behavior of IEEE 802.11 protocol. However, some of the
ways in which IEEE 802.11 medium access control layer behaves is still
unreliable to guarantee quality of service. For instance, medium access control
layer packet delay, jitter and packet loss rate still remain a challenge. The
main objective of this research is to propose an accurate estimation of the
medium access control layer packet delay distribution for IEEE 802.11. This
estimation considers the differences between busy probability and collision
probability. These differences are employed to achieve a more accurate
estimation. Finally, the proposed model and simulation are implemented and
validated - using MATLAB program for the purpose of simulation, and Maple
program to undertake the calculation of the equations.
