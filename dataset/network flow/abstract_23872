We present exact analytical results revealing the existence of a countable
infinity of unusual single particle states, which are localized with a
multitude of localization lengths in a Vicsek fractal network with diamond
shaped loops as the 'unit cells'. The family of localized states form clusters
of increasing size, much in the sense of Aharonov-Bohm cages [J. Vidal et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5888 (1998)], but now without a magnetic field. The length
scale at which the localization effect for each of these states sets in can be
uniquely predicted following a well defined prescription developed within the
framework of real space renormalization group. The scheme allows an exact
evaluation of the energy eigenvalue for every such state which is ensured to
remain in the spectrum of the system even in the thermodynamic limit. In
addition, we discuss the existence of a perfectly conducting state at the band
center of this geometry and the influence of a uniform magnetic field threading
each elementary plaquette of the lattice on its spectral properties. Of
particular interest is the case of extreme localization of single particle
states when the magnetic flux equals half the fundamental flux quantum.
