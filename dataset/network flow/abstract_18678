Cluster based routing technique is most popular routing technique in Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSNs). Due to varying need of WSN applications efficient
energy utilization in routing protocols is still a potential area of research.
In this research work we introduced a new energy efficient cluster based
routing technique. In this technique we tried to overcome the problem of
coverage hole and energy hole. In our technique we controlled these problems by
introducing density controlled uniform distribution of nodes and fixing optimum
number of Cluster Heads (CHs) in each round. Finally we verified our technique
by experimental results of MATLAB simulations.
