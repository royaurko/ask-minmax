Networks provide a powerful mathematical framework for analyzing the
structure and dynamics of complex systems (1-3). The study of group behavior
has deep roots in the social science literature (4,5) and community detection
is a central part of modern network science. Network communities have been
found to be highly overlapping and organized in a hierarchical structure (6-9).
Recent technological advances have provided a toolset for measuring the
detailed social dynamics at scale (10,11). In spite of great progress, a
quantitative description of the complex temporal behavior of social groups-with
dynamics spanning from minute-by-minute changes to patterns expressed on the
timescale of years-is still absent. Here we uncover a class of fundamental
structures embedded within highly dynamic social networks. On the shortest
time-scale, we find that social gatherings are fluid, with members coming and
going, but organized via a stable core of individuals. We show that cores
represent social contexts (9), with recurring meetings across weeks and months,
each with varying degrees of regularity. In this sense, cores provide a
vocabulary which quantifies the patterns of social life. The simplification is
so powerful that participation in social contexts is predictable with high
precision. Our results offer new perspectives for modeling and understanding of
processes in social systems, with applications including epidemiology, social
contagion, urban planning, digital economy, and quantitative sociology
