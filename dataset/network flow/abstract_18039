In this paper, we introduce a sophisticated path loss model incorporating
both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions to study
their performance impact in dense small cell networks (SCNs). Analytical
results are obtained for the coverage probability and the area spectral
efficiency (ASE) assuming both a general path loss model and a special case
with a linear LoS probability function. The performance impact of LoS and NLoS
transmissions in dense small cell networks (SCNs) in terms of the ASE is shown
to be significant both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared with previous
work that does not differentiate LoS and NLoS transmissions. Particularly, our
analysis demonstrates when the density of small cells is larger than a
threshold, the network coverage probability will decrease as the SCN becomes
denser, which in turn may make the ASE suffer from a slow growth or even a
decrease. For practical regime of the BS density, the performance results
derived from our analysis are distinctively different from previous results,
and show that the BS density matters. Therefore, our results shed new insights
on the design and deployment of future dense SCNs.
