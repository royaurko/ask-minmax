We demonstrate that both the current (New Dynamics), and next generation
(ENDGame) dynamical cores of the UK Met Office global circulation model, the
UM, reproduce consistently, the long-term, large-scale flows found in several
published idealised tests. The cases presented are the Held-Suarez test, a
simplified model of Earth (including a stratosphere), and a hypothetical
tidally locked Earth. Furthermore, we show that using simplifications to the
dynamical equations, which are expected to be justified for the physical
domains and flow regimes we have studied, and which are supported by the
ENDGame dynamical core, also produces matching long-term, large-scale flows.
Finally, we present evidence for differences in the detail of the planetary
flows and circulations resulting from improvements in the ENDGame formulation
over New Dynamics.
