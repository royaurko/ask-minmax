The stability of shear flows of electrically conducting fluids, with respect
to finite amplitude three-dimensional localized disturbances is considered. The
time evolution of the fluid impulse integral, characterizing such disturbances,
for the case of low magnetic Reynolds number is obtained by integrating
analytically the vorticity equation. Analysis of the resulted equation reveals
a new instability criterion.
