Group extraction and their evolution are among the topics which arouse the
greatest interest in the domain of social network analysis. However, while the
grouping methods in social networks are developed very dynamically, the methods
of group evolution discovery and analysis are still uncharted territory on the
social network analysis map. Therefore the new method for the group evolution
discovery called GED is proposed in this paper. Additionally, the results of
the first experiments on the email based social network together with
comparison with two other methods of group evolution discovery are presented.
