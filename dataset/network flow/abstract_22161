We consider a Frobenius structure associated with the dispersionless
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. This is done, essentially, by applying a
continuous analogue of the finite dimensional theory in the space of Schwartz
functions on the line. The potential of the Frobenius manifold is found to be a
logarithmic potential with quadratic external field. Following the construction
of the principal hierarchy, we construct a set of infinitely many commuting
flows, which extends the classical dKP hierarchy.
