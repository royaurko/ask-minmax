Synfire chains are thought to underlie precisely-timed sequences of spikes
observed in various brain regions and across species. How they are formed is
not understood. Here we analyze self-organization of synfire chains through the
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) of the synapses, axon remodeling, and
potentiation decay of synaptic weights in networks of neurons driven by noisy
external inputs and subject to dominant feedback inhibition. Potentiation decay
is the gradual, activity-independent reduction of synaptic weights over time.
We show that potentiation decay enables a dynamic and statistically stable
network connectivity when neurons spike spontaneously. Periodic stimulation of
a subset of neurons leads to formation of synfire chains through a random
recruitment process, which terminates when the chain connects to itself and
forms a loop. We demonstrate that chain length distributions depend on the
potentiation decay. Fast potentiation decay leads to long chains with wide
distributions, while slow potentiation decay leads to short chains with narrow
distributions. We suggest that the potentiation decay, which corresponds to the
decay of early long-term potentiation of synapses (E-LTP), is an important
synaptic plasticity rule in regulating formation of neural circuity through
STDP.
