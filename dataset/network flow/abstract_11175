Consider the communication of a single-user aided by a nearby relay involved
in a large wireless network where the nodes form an homogeneous Poisson point
process. Since this network is interference-limited the asymptotic error
probability is bounded from above by the outage probability experienced by the
user. We investigate the outage behavior for the well-known cooperative
schemes, namely, decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF). In this
setting, the outage events are induced by both fading and the spatial proximity
of neighbor nodes who generate the strongest interference and hence the worst
communication case. Upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic error probability
which are tight in some cases are derived. It is shown that there exists a
clear trade off between the network density and the benefits of user
cooperation. These results are useful to evaluate performances and to optimize
relaying schemes in the context of large wireless networks.
