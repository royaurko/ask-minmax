We study the network coding problem of sum-networks with 3 sources and n
terminals (3s/nt sum-network), for an arbitrary positive integer n, and derive
a sufficient and necessary condition for the solvability of a family of
so-called terminal-separable sum-network. Both the condition of
terminal-separable and the solvability of a terminal-separable sum-network can
be decided in polynomial time. Consequently, we give another necessary and
sufficient condition, which yields a faster (O(|E|) time) algorithm than that
of Shenvi and Dey ([18], (O(|E|^3) time), to determine the solvability of the
3s/3t sum-network. To obtain the results, we further develop the region
decomposition method in [22], [23] and generalize the decentralized coding
method in [21]. Our methods provide new efficient tools for multiple source
multiple sink network coding problems.
