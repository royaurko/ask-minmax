Binary-state dynamics (such as the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS)
model of disease spread, or Glauber spin dynamics) on random networks are
accurately approximated using master equations. Standard mean-field and
pairwise theories are shown to result from seeking approximate solutions of the
master equations. Applications to the calculation of SIS epidemic thresholds
and critical points of non-equilibrium spin models are also demonstrated.
