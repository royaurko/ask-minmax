The linear and renormalized nonlinear kinetic theory of drift instability of
plasma shear flow across the magnetic field, which has the Kelvin's method of
shearing modes or so-called non-modal approach as its foundation, is developed.
The developed theory proves that the time-dependent effect of the finite ion
Larmor radius is the key effect, which is responsible for the suppression of
drift turbulence in an inhomogeneous electric field. This effect leads to the
non-modal decrease of the frequency and growth rate of the unstable drift
perturbations with time. We find that turbulent scattering of the ion gyrophase
is the dominant effect, which determines extremely rapid suppression of drift
turbulence in shear flow.
