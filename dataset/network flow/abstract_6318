WiFi is widely implemented in campus wide including administrative, teaching
and student's accommodation. Wireless communications are associated with
interconnect devices which includes cellular networks, infrared, bluetooth and
WiFi enabled devices. It involves mobility and freedom of assessing information
anytime and anywhere. A study on WiFi networks in a campus environment is
presented in this paper. The aim of the research was to investigate the
connectivity problems to WiFi networks. The study includes WiFi performance
analysis as well as network auditing. Channel overlapping and saturation
condition were some of the problems encountered. Different types of software
were used for analyzing the results.
