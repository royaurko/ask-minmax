We study J/psi production at RHIC and LHC energies with both initial
production and regeneration. We solve the coupled set of transport equation for
the J/psi distribution in phase space and the hydrodynamic equation for
evolution of quark-gluon plasma. At RHIC, continuous regeneration is crucial
for the J/psi momentum distribution while the elliptic flow is still dominated
by initial production. At LHC energy, almost all the initially created J\psis
are dissociated in the medium and regeneration dominates the J/psi properties.
