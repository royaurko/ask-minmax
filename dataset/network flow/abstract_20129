Measurements of two particle azimuthal correlations in relativistic heavy ion
collisions provide information of the possible interplay between hard-scattered
partons and the hot-dense medium. Toward an understanding of parton-medium
coupling, it is indispensable to obtain correlations where contributions from
higher harmonic flow($v_n$) are rejected. It is also important to produce
correlation measurements where the trigger particle is selected relative to
second and third order event planes. This enables us to explore path-length
dependence of parton energy loss and the influence of the medium on the jets.
We present the latest PHENIX results of correlations in which contributions
from higher harmonic flow have been subtracted, as well as second and third
order event plane-dependent correlations in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV.
