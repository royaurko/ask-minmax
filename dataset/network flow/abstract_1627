We consider the low-energy limit of the two-dimensional theory on multiple
M2-branes suspended between a flat M5-brane and a curved M5-brane. We argue
that it is described by an $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg
model with the superpotential determined by the shape of the curved M5-branes,
which flows in the low-energy limit to a Kazama-Suzuki coset model. We provide
evidence by studying ground states and BPS spectra of the systems.
