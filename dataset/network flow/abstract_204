We do numerical computations on axi-symmetric Navier-Stokes flows with
no-slip flat boundary. We compare a hyperbolic flow with swirl and one without
swirl and observe that the following phenomenons occur only in the swirl case:
The distance between the maximum point of the velocity and the z-axis is
drastically changing around some time (turning point). An "increasing velocity
phenomenon" occurs near the boundary and the maximum value of the velocity is
obtained near the point of symmetry at the boundary when time is close to the
turning point.
