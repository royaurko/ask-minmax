Athermal plastic flows were simulated for the Kob-Andersen binary
Lennard-Jones system and its repulsive version in which the sign of the
attractive terms is changed to a plus. Properties evaluated from simulations at
different densities include the distributions of energy drops, stress drops,
and strain intervals between the flow events. By reference to hidden scale
invariance we show that simulations at a single density in conjunction with an
equilibrium-liquid simulation at the same density allows one to predict the
plastic flow-event properties at other densities. We furthermore demonstrate
quasiuniversality of the flow-event statistics.
