In lattice gauge theories, the gradient flow has been used extensively both,
for scale setting and for defining finite volume renormalization schemes for
the gauge coupling. Unfortunately, rather large cutoff effects have been
observed in some cases. We here investigate these effects to leading order in
perturbation theory, considering various definitions of the lattice observable,
the lattice flow equation and the Yang Mills lattice action. These
considerations suggest an improved set- up for which we perform a scaling test
in the pure SU(3) gauge theory, demonstrating strongly reduced cutoff effects.
We then attempt to obtain a more complete understanding of the structure of
O($a^2$) effects by applying Symanzik's effective theory approach to the 4+1
dimensional local field theory with flow time as the fifth dimension. From
these considerations we are led to a fully O($a^2$) improved set-up the study
of which is left to future work.
