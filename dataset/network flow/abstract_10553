One of the emerging applications that belong to ambient systems is to
transparently and directly interconnect vehicles on roads, making an ad hoc
network that enables a variety of applications through distributed software
without the need of any fixed and dedicated infrastructure. The network as well
as the embedded computers and sensors in the vehicle will be invisible to the
driver, who will get the required services during his journey. New type of ad
hoc network is the Vehicular Ad hoc Network, in which vehicles constitute the
mobile nodes in the network. Due to the prohibitive cost of deploying and
implementing such as system in a real world, most research work in VANET relies
on simulations for evaluation purpose. The key concept for VANET simulations is
a real world vehicular mobility model which will ensures conclusions drawn from
simulation experiments will carry through to real world deployments. In this
paper we present a tool SUMO, MOVE that allows users to easily generate real
world mobility models for VANET simulations. MOVE tool is built on top of SUMO
which is open source micro traffic simulator. Output of MOVE is a real world
mobility model and can used by NS-2 and Qual-net simulator. In this paper we
evaluate and compare ad hoc routing performance for vehicular nodes using MOVE,
which is using random way point model. The simulation results are obtained when
nodes are moving according to a real world mobility model which is
significantly different from that of the generally used random way point model.
