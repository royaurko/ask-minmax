In this paper, we investigate optimal coding strategies for a class of linear
deterministic relay networks. The network under study is a relay network, with
one source, one destination, and two relay nodes. Additionally, there is a
disturbing source of signals that causes interference with the information
signals received by the relay nodes. Our model captures the effect of the
interference of message signals and disturbing signals on a single relay
network, or the interference of signals from multiple relay networks with each
other in the linear deterministic framework. For several ranges of the network
parameters we find upper bounds on the maximum achievable source--destination
rate in the presense of the disturbing node and in each case we find an optimal
coding scheme that achieves the upper bound.
