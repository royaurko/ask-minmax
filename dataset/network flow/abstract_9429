Nowadays, exponential random graphs (ERGs) are among the most widely-studied
network models. Different analytical and numerical techniques for ERG have been
developed that resulted in the well-established theory with true predictive
power. An excellent basic discussion of exponential random graphs addressed to
social science students and researchers is given in [Anderson et al.,
1999][Robins et al., 2007]. This essay is intentionally designed to be more
theoretical in comparison with the well-known primers just mentioned. Given the
interdisciplinary character of the new emerging science of complex networks,
the essay aims to give a contribution upon which network scientists and
practitioners, who represent different research areas, could build a common
area of understanding.
