Analytical expressions correlating the volumetric flow rate to the inlet and
outlet pressures are derived for the time-independent flow of Newtonian fluids
in cylindrically-shaped elastic tubes using a one-dimensional Navier-Stokes
flow model with two pressure-area constitutive relations. These expressions for
elastic tubes are the equivalent of Poiseuille and Poiseuille-type expressions
for rigid tubes which were previously derived for the flow of Newtonian and
non-Newtonian fluids under various flow conditions. Formulae and procedures for
identifying the pressure field and tube geometric profile are also presented.
The results are validated by a finite element method implementation. Sensible
trends in the analytical and numerical results are observed and documented.
