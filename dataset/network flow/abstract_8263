nets. 5. Types of correlations. 6. When pair correlations are important. 7.
When loops are important. 8. Pair degree-degree correlations in growing
networks. 9. How to construct an equilibrium net with given degree-degree
correlations. 10. How to construct a growing scale-free net with a given
clustering (towards a real-space renormalization group for networks).
