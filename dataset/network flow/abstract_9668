According to the exact controllability theory, the controllability is
investigated analytically for two typical types of self-similar bipartite
networks, i.e., the classic deterministic scale-free networks and Cayley trees.
Due to their self-similarity, the analytical results of the exact
controllability are obtained, and the minimum sets of driver nodes (drivers)
are also identified by elementary transformations on adjacency matrices. For
these two types of undirected networks, no matter their links are unweighted or
(nonzero) weighted, the controllability of networks and the configuration of
drivers remain the same, showing a robustness to the link weights. These
results have implications for the control of real networked systems with
self-similarity.
