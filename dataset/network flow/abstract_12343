In this paper, we present the first results of our ongoing early-stage
research on a realtime disaster detection and monitoring tool. Based on
Wikipedia, it is language-agnostic and leverages user-generated multimedia
content shared on online social networking sites to help disaster responders
prioritize their efforts. We make the tool and its source code publicly
available as we make progress on it. Furthermore, we strive to publish detected
disasters and accompanying multimedia content following the Linked Data
principles to facilitate its wide consumption, redistribution, and evaluation
of its usefulness.
