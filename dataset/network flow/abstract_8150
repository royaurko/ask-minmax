We present a series of numerical sunspot models addressing the subsurface
field and flow structure in up to 16 Mm deep domains covering up to 2 days of
temporal evolution. Changes in the photospheric appearance of the sunspots are
driven by subsurface flows in several Mm depth. Most of magnetic field is
pushed into a downflow vertex of the subsurface convection pattern, while some
fraction of the flux separates from the main trunk of the spot. Flux separation
in deeper layers is accompanied in the photosphere with light bridge formation
in the early stages and formation of pores separating from the spot at later
stages. Over a time scale of less than a day we see the development of a large
scale flow pattern surrounding the sunspots, which is dominated by a radial
outflow reaching about 50% of the convective rms velocity in amplitude. Several
components of the large scale flow are found to be independent from the
presence of a penumbra and the associated Evershed flow. While the simulated
sunspots lead to blockage of heat flux in the near surface layers, we do not
see compelling evidence for a brightness enhancement in their periphery. We
further demonstrate that the influence of the bottom boundary condition on the
stability and long-term evolution of the sunspot is significantly reduced in a
16 Mm deep domain compared to the shallower domains considered previously.
