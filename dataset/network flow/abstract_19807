The PHOBOS experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has
collected a large dataset of Au+Au, Cu+Cu, d+Au and p+p collisions in the
center of mass energy range spanning from 19 GeV/nucleon to 200 GeV/nucleon.
The almost full angular coverage of the PHOBOS detector allows the study of
particle production over 10 units pseudorapidity. The unique design of the
spectrometer enables reconstruction and identification of charged particles
down to very low transverse momenta.
  In this paper properties of the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon Plasma
(sQGP) created in the nucleus-nucleus collisions at the highest energy
available in laboratory are discussed. Results from the PHOBOS experiment on
jet suppression, very low pt particles production and elliptic flow are shown.
In more details are presented the most recent studies of the correlations of
charged particles with respect to a high-pt trigger particle, elliptic flow
fluctuations and two particle correlations.
