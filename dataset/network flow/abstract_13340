We discuss the Polyakov effective action for a minimally coupled scalar field
on a two dimensional curved space by considering a non-local covariant
truncation of the effective average action. We derive the flow equation for the
form factor in $\int\sqrt{g}R c_{k}(\Delta)R$, and we show how the standard
result is obtained when we integrate the flow from the ultraviolet to the
infrared.
