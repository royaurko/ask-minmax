We investigate the evolution of infinite strings as a part of a complete
cosmic string network in flat space. We perform a simulation of the network
which uses functional forms for the string position and thus is exact to the
limits of computer arithmetic. Our results confirm that the wiggles on the
strings obey a scaling law described by universal power spectrum. The average
distance between long strings also scales accurately with the time. These
results suggest that small-scale structure will also scale in expanding
universe, even in the absence of gravitational damping.
