Over the period of 6 years and three phases, the SEE-GRID programme has
established a strong regional human network in the area of distributed
scientific computing and has set up a powerful regional Grid infrastructure. It
attracted a number of user communities and applications from diverse fields
from countries throughout the South-Eastern Europe. From the infrastructure
point view, the first project phase has established a pilot Grid infrastructure
with more than 20 resource centers in 11 countries. During the subsequent two
phases of the project, the infrastructure has grown to currently 55 resource
centers with more than 6600 CPUs and 750 TBs of disk storage, distributed in 16
participating countries. Inclusion of new resource centers to the existing
infrastructure, as well as a support to new user communities, has demanded
setup of regionally distributed core services, development of new monitoring
and operational tools, and close collaboration of all partner institution in
managing such a complex infrastructure. In this paper we give an overview of
the development and current status of SEE-GRID regional infrastructure and
describe its transition to the NGI-based Grid model in EGI, with the strong SEE
regional collaboration.
