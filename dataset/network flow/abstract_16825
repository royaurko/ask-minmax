We study the large time fluctuations of entropy production in Markov
processes. In particular, we consider the effect of a coarse-graining procedure
which decimates {\em fast states} with respect to a given time threshold. Our
results provide strong evidence that entropy production is not directly
affected by this decimation, provided that it does not entirely remove loops
carrying a net probability current. After the study of some examples of random
walks on simple graphs, we apply our analysis to a network model for the
kinesin cycle, which is an important biomolecular motor. A tentative general
theory of these facts, based on Schnakenberg's network theory, is proposed.
