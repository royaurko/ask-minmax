We investigate the QCD chiral phase transition at high baryon number density
within the linear quark meson model for two flavors. The method we employ is
based on an exact renormalization group equation for the free energy. Truncated
nonperturbative flow equations are derived at nonzero chemical potential and
temperature. Whereas the renormalization group flow leads to spontaneous chiral
symmetry breaking in vacuum, we find a chiral symmetry restoring first order
transition at high density. Combined with previous investigations at nonzero
temperature, the result implies the presence of a tricritical point with
long--range correlations in the phase diagram.
