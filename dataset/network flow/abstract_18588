In this paper, we evaluate and analyze the impact of different network loads
and varying no. of nodes on distance vector and link state routing algorithms.
We select three well known proactive protocols; Destination Sequenced Distance
Vector (DSDV) operates on distance vector routing, while Fisheye State Routing
(FSR) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocols are based on link state
routing. Further, we evaluate and compare the effects on the performance of
protocols by changing the routing strategies of routing algorithms. We also
enhance selected protocols to achieve high performance. We take throughput,
End-to-End Delay (E2ED) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL) as performance
metrics for evaluation and comparison of chosen protocols both with default and
enhanced versions. Based upon extensive simulations in NS-2, we compare and
discuss performance trade-offs of the protocols, i.e., how a protocol achieves
high packet delivery by paying some cost in the form of increased E2ED and/or
routing overhead. FSR due to scope routing technique performs well in high data
rates, while, OLSR is more scalable in denser networks due to limited
retransmissions through Multi-Point Relays (MPRs).
