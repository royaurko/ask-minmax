Like many big science projects, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)
has multiple geographic locations among which large amounts of data must be
transferred. One particular type of data, crosstalk-corrected images, must be
moved from South America to North America under stringent deadline
requirements. LSST is provisioning an international network with bandwidth
guarantees to handle this traffic. In prior work, we re-examined TCP congestion
control for this use case and found that TCP throughput can approach wire
speeds. This work shows that the Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB) provides an
excellent mechanism by which bandwidth can be managed for a wide range of
traffic types. Using HTB without TCP congestion control over
guaranteed-bandwidth virtual circuits is a compelling solution to the
historical problem of poor TCP performance over long fat networks.
