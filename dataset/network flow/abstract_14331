We present a formulation of non-Abelian gauge theories in general axial
gauges using a Wilsonian (or 'Exact') Renormalisation Group. No 'spurious'
propagator divergencies are encountered in contrast to standard perturbation
theory. Modified Ward identities, compatible with the flow equation, ensure
gauge invariance of physical Green functions. The axial gauge $n A=0$ is shown
to be a fixed point under the flow equation. Possible non-perturbative
approximation schemes and further applications are outlined.
