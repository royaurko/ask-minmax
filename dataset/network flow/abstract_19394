Recent discoveries of the intriguing ``jet-torus'' structure in the Crab
Nebula and other pulsar nebulae prompted calls for re-examining of their
theory. The most radical proposals involve abolishing of the MHD approximation
altogether and developing of purely electromagnetic models. However, the
classical MHD models of the Crab Nebula were hampered by the assumption of
spherical symmetry made in order to render the flow equations easily
integrable. The impressive progress in computational relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics in recent years has made it possible to study the Crab
nebula via numerical simulations without making such a drastic simplification
of the problem. In this letter we present the results of the first study of
such kind. They show that the jet-torus pattern can be explained within MHD
approximation when anisotropy of pulsar winds is taken into account. They also
indicate that the flow in the nebula is likely to be much more intricate than
it has been widely believed.
