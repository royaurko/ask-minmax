We discuss several aspects of three dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge
theories coupled to chiral multiplets. The generation of Chern-Simons couplings
at low-energies results in novel behaviour including compact Coulomb branches,
non-abelian gauge symmetry enhancement and interesting patterns of dynamically
generated potentials. We further show how, given any pair of mirror theories
with N=4 supersymmetry, one may flow to a pair of mirror theories with N=2
supersymmetry by gauging a suitable combination of the R-symmetries. The
resulting theories again have interesting properties due to Chern-Simons
couplings.
