Although recent scientific output focuses on multiple shortest-path problem
definitions for road networks, none of the existing solutions does efficiently
answer all different types of SP queries. This work proposes SALT, a novel
framework that not only efficiently answers SP related queries but also
k-nearest neighbor queries not handled by previous approaches. Our solution
offers all the benefits needed for practical use-cases, including excellent
query performance and very short preprocessing times, thus making it also a
viable option for dynamic road networks, i.e., edge weights changing frequently
due to traffic updates. The proposed SALT framework is a deployable software
solution capturing a range of network-related query problems under one
"algorithmic hood".
