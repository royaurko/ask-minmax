We introduce and study a multivariate function that counts nowhere-zero flows
on a graph G, in which each edge of G has an individual capacity. We prove that
the associated counting function is a piecewise-defined polynomial in these
capacities, which satisfy a combinatorial reciprocity law that incorporates
totally cyclic orientations of G.
