Bright EUV sunspot plumes have been observed in eight out of eleven different
sunspot regions with the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer -- CDS on SOHO. From
wavelength shifts we derive the line-of-sight velocity, relative to the average
velocity in the rastered area, 120 arcsec x 120 arcsec. In sunspot plumes we
find that the motion is directed away from the observer and increases with
increasing line formation temperature, reaches a maximum between 15 and 41
km~s$^{-1}$ close to log T $\approx$ 5.5, then decreases abruptly. The flow
field in the corona is not well correlated with the flow in the transition
region and we discuss briefly the implication of this finding.
