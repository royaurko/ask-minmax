An unobservable false data injection (FDI) attack on AC state estimation (SE)
is introduced and its consequences on the physical system are studied. With a
focus on understanding the physical consequences of FDI attacks, a bi-level
optimization problem is introduced whose objective is to maximize the physical
line flows subsequent to an FDI attack on DC SE. The maximization is subject to
constraints on both attacker resources (size of attack) and attack detection
(limiting load shifts) as well as those required by DC optimal power flow (OPF)
following SE. The resulting attacks are tested on a more realistic non-linear
system model using AC state estimation and ACOPF, and it is shown that, with an
appropriately chosen sub-network, the attacker can overload transmission lines
with moderate shifts of load.
