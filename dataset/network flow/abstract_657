This paper investigates the throughput capacity of a flow crossing a
multi-hop wireless network, whose geometry is characterized by general
randomness laws including Uniform, Poisson, Heavy-Tailed distributions for both
the nodes' densities and the number of hops. The key contribution is to
demonstrate \textit{how} the \textit{per-flow throughput} depends on the
distribution of 1) the number of nodes $N_j$ inside hops' interference sets, 2)
the number of hops $K$, and 3) the degree of spatial correlations. The
randomness in both $N_j$'s and $K$ is advantageous, i.e., it can yield larger
scalings (as large as $\Theta(n)$) than in non-random settings. An interesting
consequence is that the per-flow capacity can exhibit the opposite behavior to
the network capacity, which was shown to suffer from a logarithmic decrease in
the presence of randomness. In turn, spatial correlations along the end-to-end
path are detrimental by a logarithmic term.
