A small-world network (SW) of similar phase oscillators, interacting
according to the Kuramoto model is studied numerically. It is shown that
deterministic Kuramoto dynamics on the SW networks has various stable
stationary states. This can be attributed to the "defect patterns" in a SW
network which is inherited to it from deformation of "helical patterns" in its
parent regular one. Turning on an uncorrelated random force, causes the
vanishing of the defect patterns, hence increasing the synchronization among
oscillators for intermediate noise intensities. This phenomenon which is called
"stochastic synchronization" generally observed in some natural networks like
brain neuronal network.
