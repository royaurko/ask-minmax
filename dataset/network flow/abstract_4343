Nowadays, mobile users can switch between different available networks, for
example, nearby WiFi networks or their standard mobile operator network. Soon
it will be extended to other operators. However, unless telecommunication
operators can directly benefit from allowing a user to switch to another
operator, operators have an incentive to keep their network quality of service
confidential to avoid that their users decide to switch to another network. In
contrast, in a user-centric way, the users should be allowed to share their
observations regarding the networks that they have used. In this paper, we
present our work in progress towards attack-resistant sharing of quality of
service information and network provider reputation among mobile users.
