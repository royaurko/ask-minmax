In this paper, we address the logarithmic corrections to the leading power
laws that govern thermodynamic quantities as a second-order phase transition
point is approached. For phase transitions of spin systems on d-dimensional
lattices, such corrections appear at some marginal values of the order
parameter or space dimension. We present new scaling relations for these
exponents. We also consider a spin system on a scale-free network which
exhibits logarithmic corrections due to the specific network properties. To
this end, we analyze the phase behavior of a model with coupled order
parameters on a scale-free network and extract leading and logarithmic
correction-to-scaling exponents that determine its field- and temperature
behavior. Although both non-trivial sets of exponents emerge from the
correlations in the network structure rather than from the spin fluctuations
they fulfil the respective thermodynamic scaling relations. For the scale-free
networks the logarithmic corrections appear at marginal values of the node
degree distribution exponent. In addition we calculate scaling functions, which
also exhibit nontrivial dependence on intrinsic network properties.
