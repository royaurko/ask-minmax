In this paper, we discuss on the use of self-organizing protocols to improve
the reliability of dynamic Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks. Two similar
approaches are studied, which are based on local knowledge of the nodes' 2nd
neighborhood. The first scheme is a simple protocol requiring interactions
among nodes and their direct neighbors. The second scheme adds a check on the
Edge Clustering Coefficient (ECC), a local measure that allows determining
edges connecting different clusters in the network. The performed simulation
assessment evaluates these protocols over uniform networks, clustered networks
and scale-free networks. Different failure modes are considered. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal.
