This paper extends previous work with network fragments and
situation-specific network construction. We formally define the asymmetry
network, an alternative representation for a conditional probability table. We
also present an object-oriented representation for partially specified
asymmetry networks. We show that the representation is parsimonious. We define
an algebra for the elements of the representation that allows us to 'factor'
any CPT and to soundly combine the partially specified asymmetry networks.
