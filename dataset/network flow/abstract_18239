The success of an infectious disease to invade a population is strongly
controlled by the population's specific connectivity structure. Here a network
model is presented as an aid in understanding the role of social behavior and
heterogeneous connectivity in determining the spatio-temporal patterns of
disease dynamics. We explore the controversial origins of long-term recurrent
oscillations believed to be characteristic to diseases that have a period of
temporary immunity after infection. In particular, we focus on sexually
transmitted diseases such as syphilis, where this controversy is currently
under review. Although temporary immunity plays a key role, it is found that in
realistic small-world networks, the social and sexual behavior of individuals
also has great influence in generating long-term cycles. The model generates
circular waves of infection with unusual spatial dynamics that depend on focal
areas that act as pacemakers in the population. Eradication of the disease can
be efficiently achieved by eliminating the pacemakers with a targeted
vaccination scheme. A simple difference equation model is derived, that
captures the infection dynamics of the network model and gives insights into
their origins and their eradication through vaccination.
