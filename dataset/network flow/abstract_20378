Recently, Duvall and Hanasoge ({\it Solar Phys.} {\bf 287}, 71-83, 2013)
found that large distance $[\Delta]$ separation travel-time differences from a
center to an annulus $[\delta t_{\rm{oi}}]$ implied a model of the average
supergranular cell that has a peak upflow of $240\rm{ms^{-1}}$ at a depth of
$2.3\rm{Mm}$ and a corresponding peak outward horizontal flow of
$700\rm{ms^{-1}}$ at a depth of $1.6\rm{Mm}$. In the present work, this effect
is further studied by measuring and modeling center-to-quadrant travel-time
differences $[\delta t_{\rm{qu}}]$, which roughly agree with this model.
Simulations are analyzed that show that such a model flow would lead to the
expected travel-time differences. As a check for possible systematic errors,
the center-to-annulus travel-time differences $[\delta t_{\rm{oi}}]$ are found
not to vary with heliocentric angle. A consistency check finds an increase of
$\delta t_{\rm{oi}}$ with the temporal frequency $[\nu]$ by a factor of two,
which is not predicted by the ray theory.
