We flow a hypersurface in Euclidean space by mean curvature flow with a
Neumann boundary condition, where the boundary manifold is any torus of
revolution. If we impose the conditions that the initial manifold is compatible
and does not contain the rotational vector field in its tangent space, then
mean curvature flow exists for all time and converges to a flat cross-section
as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
