The server-centric data centre network architecture can accommodate a wide
variety of network topologies. Newly proposed topologies in this arena often
require several rounds of analysis and experimentation in order that they might
achieve their full potential as data centre networks. We propose a family of
novel routing algorithms on two well-known data centre networks of this type,
(Generalized) DCell and FiConn, using techniques that can be applied more
generally to the class of networks we call completely connected
recursively-defined networks. In doing so, we develop a classification of all
possible routes from server-node to server-node on these networks, called
general routes of order $t$, and find that for certain topologies of interest,
our routing algorithms efficiently produce paths that are up to 16% shorter
than the best previously known algorithms, and are comparable to shortest
paths. In addition to finding shorter paths, we show evidence that our
algorithms also have good load-balancing properties.
