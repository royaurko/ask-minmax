Financial markets are complex adaptive systems, and are commonly studied as
complex networks. Most of such studies fall short in two respects: they do not
account for non-linearity of the studied relationships, and they create one
network for the whole studied time series, providing an average picture of a
very long, economically non-homogeneous, period. In this study we look at the
currency markets by creating networks which can account for non-linearity in
the underlying relationships, and are based on short time horizons with the use
of running window approach. Since information--theoretic measures are slow to
converge, we use Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi Maximum Correlation Coefficient as a
measure of the relationships between currencies. We use the Randomized
Dependence Coefficient (RDC) as an estimator of the above. It measures the
dependence between random samples as the largest canonical correlation between
k randomly chosen non-linear projections of their copula transformations. On
this basis we create full graphs, and further filter them into minimally
spanning trees. We create such networks for each window moving along the
studied time series, and analyse the time evolution of various network
characteristics, particularly the degree distributions, and their economic
significance. We apply this procedure to a dataset describing logarithmic
changes in exchange rates in relation to silver for 27 world currencies for the
years between 2002 and 2013.
