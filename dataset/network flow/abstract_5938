We present the N2Sky system, which provides a framework for the exchange of
neural network specific knowledge, as neural network paradigms and objects, by
a virtual organization environment. It follows the sky computing paradigm
delivering ample resources by the usage of federated Clouds. N2Sky is a novel
Cloud-based neural network simulation environment, which follows a pure service
oriented approach. The system implements a transparent environment aiming to
enable both novice and experienced users to do neural network research easily
and comfortably. N2Sky is built using the RAVO reference architecture of
virtual organizations which allows itself naturally integrating into the Cloud
service stack (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) of service oriented architectures.
