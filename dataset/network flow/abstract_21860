A very intuitive description of nucleus-nucleus collision phenomena is
provided by the relativistic fluid dynamics. We consider a 1+1 dimensional
relativistic imperfect fluid flow to approximate the high energy heavy ion
collision. The article investigates the application of the continuous symmetry
group on the relativistic fluid energy-momentum tensor conservation equations
in the ultrarelativistic limit $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$.
