We study computational and sample complexity of parameter and structure
learning in graphical models. Our main result shows that the class of factor
graphs with bounded factor size and bounded connectivity can be learned in
polynomial time and polynomial number of samples, assuming that the data is
generated by a network in this class. This result covers both parameter
estimation for a known network structure and structure learning. It implies as
a corollary that we can learn factor graphs for both Bayesian networks and
Markov networks of bounded degree, in polynomial time and sample complexity.
Unlike maximum likelihood estimation, our method does not require inference in
the underlying network, and so applies to networks where inference is
intractable. We also show that the error of our learned model degrades
gracefully when the generating distribution is not a member of the target class
of networks.
