In this talk I present new STAR results on measurements of integrated
elliptic flow at midrapidity in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 and 62 GeV energies. These results have been obtained from
azimuthal correlations between particles in the main STAR TPC and two forward
TPCs, and are to a large extent free from so-called non-flow correlations.
These results along with the previously reported values of ``participant''
eccentricity taking into account eccentricity fluctuations are used for testing
the $v_2/\eps$ scaling, which is found to hold relatively well.
