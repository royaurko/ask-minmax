Tseytlin has recently proposed that an action functional exists whose
gradient generates to all orders in perturbation theory the Renormalization
Group (RG) flow of the target space metric in the worldsheet sigma model. The
gradient is defined with respect to a metric on the space of coupling constants
which is explicitly known only to leading order in perturbation theory, but at
that order is positive semi-definite, as follows from Perelman's work on the
Ricci flow. This gives rise to a monotonicity formula for the flow which is
expected to fail only if the beta function perturbation series fails to
converge, which can happen if curvatures or their derivatives grow large. We
test the validity of the monotonicity formula at next-to-leading order in
perturbation theory by explicitly computing the second-order terms in the
metric on the space of coupling constants. At this order, this metric is found
not to be positive semi-definite. In situations where this might spoil
monotonicity, derivatives of curvature become large enough for higher order
perturbative corrections to be significant.
