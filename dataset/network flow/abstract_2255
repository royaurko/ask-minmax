We extend the merging model for undirected networks by Kim et al. [Eur. Phys.
J. B 43, 369 (2004)] to directed networks and investigate the emerging
scale-free networks. Two versions of the directed merging model, friendly and
hostile merging, give rise to two distinct network types. We uncover that some
non-trivial features of these two network types resemble two levels of a
certain randomization/non-specificity in the link reshuffling during network
evolution. Furthermore the same features show up, respectively, in metabolic
networks and transcriptional networks. We introduce measures that single out
the distinguishing features between the two prototype networks, as well as
point out features which are beyond the prototypes.
