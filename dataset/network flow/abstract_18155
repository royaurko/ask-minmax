Internet worms, which spread in computer networks without human mediation,
pose a severe threat to computer systems today. The rate of propagation of
worms has been measured to be extremely high and they can infect a large
fraction of their potential hosts in a short time. We study two different
methods of patch dissemination to combat the spread of worms. We first show
that using a fixed number of patch servers performs woefully inadequately
against Internet worms. We then show that by exploiting the exponential data
dissemination capability of P2P systems, the spread of worms can be halted very
effectively. We compare the two methods by using fluid models to compute two
quantities of interest: the time taken to effectively combat the progress of
the worm and the maximum number of infected hosts. We validate our models using
Internet measurements and simulations.
