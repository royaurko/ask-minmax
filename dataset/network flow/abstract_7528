Enstrophy is an averaged measure of fluid vorticity. This quantity is
particularly important in {\em rotating} geophysical flows. We investigate the
dynamical evolution of enstrophy for large-scale quasi-geostrophic flows under
random wind forcing. We obtain upper bounds on the enstrophy, as well as
results establishing its H\"older continuity and describing the small-time
asymptotics.
