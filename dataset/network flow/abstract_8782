We consider the reactive Boussinesq equations in a slanted cylinder, with
zero stress boundary conditions and arbitrary Rayleigh number. We show that the
equations have non-planar traveling front solutions that propagate at a
constant speed. We also establish uniform upper bounds on the burning rate and
the flow velocity for general front-like initial data for the Cauchy problem.
