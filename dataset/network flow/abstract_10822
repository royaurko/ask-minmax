A flow of metrics, $g_t$, on a manifold is a solution of a differential
equation $\dt g = S(g)$, where a geometric functional $S(g)$ is a symmetric
$(0,2)$-tensor usually related to some kind of curvature. The mixed sectional
curvature of a foliated manifold regulates the deviation of leaves along the
leaf geodesics. We introduce and study the flow of metrics on a foliation
(called the 'Partial Ricci Flow'), where $S=-2 r$ and $r$ is the partial Ricci
curvature of the foliation; in other words, the velocity for a unit vector $X$
orthogonal to the leaf, $-2 r(X,X)$, is the mean value of sectional curvatures
over all mixed planes containing $X$.
  The flow preserves totally geodesic foliations and is used to examine the
question: Which foliations admit a metric with a given property of mixed
sectional curvature (e.g., point-wise constant)? This is related to Toponogov
question about dimension of totally geodesic foliations with positive mixed
sectional curvature.
  We first consider a one-dimensional foliation, since this case is easier. We
prove local existence/uniqueness theorem, deduce the government equations for
the curvature and conullity tensors (which are parabolic along the leaves), and
show convergence of solution metrics for some classes of almost-product
structures. For the warped product initial metric the global solution metrics
converge to one with constant mixed sectional curvature.
