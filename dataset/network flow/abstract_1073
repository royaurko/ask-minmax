In this paper, we consider the problem of flow control together with power
allocation to antennas on satellite with arbitrary link states, so as to
maximize the utility function while stabilizing the network. Inspired by
Lyapunov optimization method, a Degree-Limited Scheduling Algorithm (DLSA) is
proposed with a control parameter V, which requires no stochastic knowledge of
link state. Discussion about implementation is carried out about the complexity
of DLSA and several approximation methods to reduce complexity. Analyze shows
DLSA stabilizes the network and the gap between utility function under DLSA and
the optimal value is arbitrarily close to zero on the order of O(1/V).
Simulation results verify DLSA on a simple network.
