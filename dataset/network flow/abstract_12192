Motivated by the hierarchial network model of E. Ravasz, A.-L. Barabasi, and
T. Vicsek, we introduce deterministic scale-free networks derived from a graph
directed self-similar fractal $\Lambda $.
  With rigorous mathematical results we verify that our model captures some of
the most important features of many real networks: the scale free and the high
clustering properties. We also prove that the diameter is the logarithm of the
size of the system. Using our (deterministic) fractal $\Lambda $ we generate
random graph sequence sharing similar properties.
