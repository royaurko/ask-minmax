We present the measurement of centrality dependence of multi-strange hadron
($\Omega$, $\Xi$ and $\phi$) elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) at mid-rapidity in Au+Au
collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We investigate number-of-constituents
quark (NCQ) scaling of identified hadrons $v_{2}$ for different collision
centralities. Maximum deviation from ideal NCQ scaling observed at the level of
10% for centrality 30-80$%$ at $(m_{T} - m_{0})/n_{q}$ $>$ 0.6 GeV/$c^{2}$.
This may indicate smaller contribution to the collectivity from the partonic
phase in the peripheral collisions. We also observe the mass ordering of
$v_{2}$ break down between proton and $\phi$-meson for $p_{T}$ $< $1 GeV/$c$.
This could be due to the effect of later stage hadronic interactions on
$v_{2}$.
