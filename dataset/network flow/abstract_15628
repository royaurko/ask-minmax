In the half-duplex single relay selection network, comprised of a source, $M$
half-duplex relays, and a destination, only one relay is active at any given
time, i.e., only one relay receives or transmits, and the other relays are
inactive, i.e., they do not receive nor transmit. The capacity of this network,
when all links are affected by independent slow time-continuous fading and
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), is still unknown, and only achievable
average rates have been reported in the literature so far. In this paper, we
present new achievable average rates for this network which are larger than the
best known average rates. These new average rates are achieved with a
buffer-aided relaying protocol. Since the developed buffer-aided protocol
introduces unbounded delay, we also devise a buffer-aided protocol which limits
the delay at the expense of a decrease in rate. Moreover, we discuss the
practical implementation of the proposed buffer-aided relaying protocols and
show that they do not require more resources for channel state information
acquisition than the existing relay selection protocols.
