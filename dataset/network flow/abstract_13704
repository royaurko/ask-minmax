The rapidity dependence of elliptic, $v_2$, and triangular, $v_3$, flow
coefficients in proton-nucleus (p+A) collisions is predicted in hydrodynamics
and in a multi-phase transport model (AMPT). We find that $v_n$ ($n=2,3$) on a
nucleus side is significantly larger than on a proton side and the ratio
between the two, $v_n^{\rm Pb}/v_n^{\rm p}$, weekly depends on the transverse
momentum of produced particles.
