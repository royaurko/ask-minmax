We consider convex symmetric lens-shaped networks in R^2 that evolve under
curve shortening flow. We show that the enclosed convex domain shrinks to a
point in finite time. Furthermore, after appropriate rescaling the evolving
networks converge to a self-similarly shrinking network, which we prove to be
unique in an appropriate class. We also include a classification result for
some self-similarly shrinking networks.
