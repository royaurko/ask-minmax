The first direct measurements of effective magnetic diffusivity in turbulent
flow of electro-conductive fluids (the so-called beta-effect) under magnetic
Reynolds number Rm >> 1 are reported. The measurements are performed in a
nonstationary turbulent flow of liquid sodium, generated in a closed toroidal
channel. The peak level of the Reynolds number reached Re \approx 3 10^6, which
corresponds to the magnetic Reynolds number Rm \approx 30. The magnetic
diffusivity of the liquid metal was determined by measuring the phase shift
between the induced and the applied magnetic fields. The maximal deviation of
magnetic diffusivity from its basic (laminar) value reaches about 50% .
