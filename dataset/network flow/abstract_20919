Gene regulatory networks, i.e. DNA segments in a cell which interact with
each other indirectly through their RNA and protein products, lie at the heart
of many important intracellular signal transduction processes. In this paper we
analyse a mathematical model of a canonical gene regulatory network consisting
of a single negative feedback loop between a protein and its mRNA (e.g. the
Hes1 transcription factor system). The model consists of two partial
differential equations describing the spatio-temporal interactions between the
protein and its mRNA in a 1-dimensional domain. Such intracellular negative
feedback systems are known to exhibit oscillatory behaviour and this is the
case for our model, shown initially via computational simulations. In order to
investigate this behaviour more deeply, we next solve our system using Green's
functions and then undertake a linearized stability analysis of the steady
states of the model. Our results show that the diffusion coefficient of the
protein/mRNA acts as a bifurcation parameter and gives rise to a Hopf
bifurcation. This shows that the spatial movement of the mRNA and protein
molecules alone is sufficient to cause the oscillations. This has implications
for transcription factors such as p53, NF-$\kappa$B and heat shock proteins
which are involved in regulating important cellular processes such as
inflammation, meiosis, apoptosis and the heat shock response, and are linked to
diseases such as arthritis and cancer.
