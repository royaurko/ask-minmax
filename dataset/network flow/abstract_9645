We introduce a new statistic, 'spectral goodness of fit' (SGOF) to measure
how well a network model explains the structure of an observed network. SGOF
provides an absolute measure of fit, analogous to the standard R-squared in
linear regression. Additionally, as it takes advantage of the properties of the
spectrum of the graph Laplacian, it is suitable for comparing network models of
diverse functional forms, including both fitted statistical models and
algorithmic generative models of networks. After introducing, defining, and
providing guidance for interpreting SGOF, we illustrate the properties of the
statistic with a number of examples and comparisons to existing techniques. We
show that such a spectral approach to assessing model fit fills gaps left by
earlier methods and can be widely applied.
