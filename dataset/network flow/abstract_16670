In this paper we present a possible model of adaptive grids for numerical
resolution of differential problems, using physical or geometrical properties,
as viscosity or velocity gradient of a moving fluid. The relation between the
values of grid step and these entities is based on the mathematical scheme
offered by the model of scale-free networks, due to Barabasi, so that the step
can be connected to the other variables by a constitutive relation. Some
examples and an application are discussed, showing that this approach can be
further developed for treatment of more complex situations.
