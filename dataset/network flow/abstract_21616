We consider spherically symmetric spacetimes with matter whose timelike flow
is assumed to be shear-free. A number of results on the formation and
visibility of spacetime singularities is proven, with the main one being that
shear-free collapse cannot admit locally naked singularities (which implies
absence of globally naked singularities). We conjecture that shear is a
necessary condition for the occurrence of locally naked singularities in
generic gravitational collapse.
