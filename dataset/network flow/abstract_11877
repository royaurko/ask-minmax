Temporal information can provide useful features for recognizing facial
expressions. However, to manually design useful features requires a lot of
effort. In this paper, to reduce this effort, a deep learning technique which
is regarded as a tool to automatically extract useful features from raw data,
is adopted. Our deep network is based on two different models. The first deep
network extracts temporal geometry features from temporal facial landmark
points, while the other deep network extracts temporal appearance features from
image sequences . These two models are combined in order to boost the
performance of the facial expression recognition. Through several experiments,
we showed that the two models cooperate with each other. As a result, we
achieved superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods in CK+ and
Oulu-CASIA databases. Furthermore, one of the main contributions of this paper
is that our deep network catches the facial action points automatically.
