It turned out that the set of the fixed points is not necessarily the same as
the set of the local minima of the energy functional. It depends on the
diagonal elements of the connection matrix. The simple method which allows to
cut off fictitious fixed points with high energies was found out. Especially
the method is effective if the connection matrix is the projection one.
