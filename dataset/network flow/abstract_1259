We test a recently proposed model of commuting networks on 80 case studies
from different regions of the world (Europe and United-States) and with
geographic units of different sizes (municipality, county, region). The model
takes as input the number of commuters coming in and out of each geographic
unit and generates the matrix of commuting flows betwen the geographic units.
We show that the single parameter of the model, which rules the compromise
between the influence of the distance and job opportunities, follows a
universal law that depends only on the average surface of the geographic units.
We verified that the law derived from a part of the case studies yields
accurate results on other case studies. We also show that our model
significantly outperforms the two other approaches proposing a universal
commuting model (Balcan et al. (2009); Simini et al. (2012)), particularly when
the geographic units are small (e.g. municipalities).
