I use an agent-based simulation to model how individual and societal attitude
change arise from the mutual interactions that occur within political
dialogues. Agents converse with members of their social network, express their
political attitudes, and update their beliefs in a manner that reflects their
personal convictions, their tolerance for dissimilarity, and local social
norms. The model extends previous work by endowing agents with multiple,
theoretically motivated heuristics for reevaluating and expressing their
opinions, including homophily, attitude strength, and conformity. I demonstrate
that novel macroscopic phenomenon emerge from the interactions of these
cognitively and socially refined agents. Specifically, I find that (a)
interactions between persuadable and closed-minded agents drive non-monotonic
changes in the societal distribution of opinions; (b) extremists instigate
neighborhood polarization that propagates outward through undecided agents; (c)
preference falsification produces non-representative public norms that obscure
attitude diversity and consequently alter dynamics of attitude change. I
conclude by discussing the political implications of the results, suggesting an
experiment to validate the model's findings, and proposing extensions for
future work.
