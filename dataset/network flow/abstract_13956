We study the flow of particle-laden turbidity currents down a slope and over
an obstacle. A high-resolution 2D computer simulation model is used, based on
the Navier-Stokes equations. It includes poly-disperse particle grain sizes in
the current and substrate. Particular attention is paid to the erosion and
deposition of the substrate particles, including application of an active layer
model. Multiple flows are modeled from a lock release that can show the
development of sediment waves (SW). These are stream-wise waves that are
triggered by the increasing slope on the downstream side of the obstacle. The
initial obstacle is completely erased by the resuspension after a few flows
leading to self consistent and self generated SW that are weakly dependant on
the initial obstacle. The growth of these waves is directly related to the
turbidity current being self sustaining, that is, the net erosion is more than
the net deposition. Four system parameters are found to influence the SW
growth: (1) slope, (2) current lock height, (3) grain lock concentration, and
(4) particle diameters. Three phases are discovered for the system: (1) "no
SW", (2) "SW buildup", and (3) "SW growth". The second phase consists of a
soliton-like SW structure with a preserved shape. The phase diagram of the
system is defined by isolating regions divided by critical slope angles as
functions of current lock height, grain lock concentration, and particle
diameters.
