Efficient Human Epithelial-2 (HEp-2) cell image classification can facilitate
the diagnosis of many autoimmune diseases. This paper presents an automatic
framework for this classification task, by utilizing the deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) which have recently attracted intensive attention in
visual recognition. This paper elaborates the important components of this
framework, discusses multiple key factors that impact the efficiency of
training a deep CNN, and systematically compares this framework with the
well-established image classification models in the literature. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that i) the proposed framework can effectively
outperform existing models by properly applying data augmentation; ii) our
CNN-based framework demonstrates excellent adaptability across different
datasets, which is highly desirable for classification under varying laboratory
settings. Our system is ranked high in the cell image classification
competition hosted by ICPR 2014.
