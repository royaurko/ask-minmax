The functional diversity in factors identified in association with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) necessitates the utilization of
holistic approaches to investigate the network properties of NAFLD
pathogenesis. We describe the generation of the first mouse-specific
multi-tissue metabolic model, the SteatoNet, to investigate NAFLD-related
steatosis, by utilising an object-oriented modelling approach and incorporating
numerous hepatic metabolic pathways, their interaction with peripheral tissues
and hierarchical feedback regulation at the transcriptional and
post-translational level. The unique validated model is based on steady-state
analysis of ordinary differential equations that allows investigation of
systemic behaviour in the absence of estimated kinetic parameters. Model
analysis indicated the importance of the metabolic flux distribution parameter
in controlling metabolite concentration and identified critical focal points in
the network that may play a pivotal role in initiating NAFLD. Albeit requiring
experimental validation, the candidate triggers identified by SteatoNet provide
insight into the network properties of NAFLD and emphasize the promising scope
and potential of SteatoNet as a primary investigative tool for hypotheses
generation and exploring related metabolic diseases.
