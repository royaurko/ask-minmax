I show that the self-consistent solution of the problem of MHD plasma flow in
magnetosphere of an oblique rotator with an initially split-monopole magnetic
field is reduced to the solution of the similar problem for the axisymmetric
rotator. All properties of the MHD cold plasma flows from the axisymmetric
rotators with the initially split-monopole magnetic field are valid for the
oblique rotators as well. Rotational losses of the oblique rotator do not
depend on the inclination angle and there is no temporal evolution of this
angle. Self-consistent analytical and numerical solutions for the axisymmetric
plasma flows obtained earlier show that the rotators can be divided on fast
rotators ($\sigma_0/U_0^2 > 1$) and slow rotators ($\sigma_0/U_0^2 < 1$), where
$\sigma_0$ is the ratio of the Poynting flux to the matter energy flux in the
flow at the equator on the surface of the star, $U_0 = \gamma_0v_0/c$, $v_0$
and $\gamma_0$ are the initial velocity and Lorentz-factor of the plasma. The
self-consistent approximate analytical solution for the plasma flow from the
oblique rotator is obtained under the condition $\sigma_0/U_0^2 \ll 1$.
Implications of these results for radio pulsars are discussed. In particular, I
argue that all radio pulsars are apparently the slow rotators ejecting the
Poynting dominated relativistic wind.
