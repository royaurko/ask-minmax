In this article, we present a real-time three dimensional (3D) hybrid
beamforming for fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. One of the key
concepts in 5G cellular systems is a small cell network, which settles the high
mobile traffic demand and provides uniform user-experienced data rates. The
overall capacity of the small cell network can be enhanced with the enabling
technology of 3D hybrid beamforming. This study validates the feasibility of
the 3D hybrid beamforming, mostly for link-level performances, through the
implementation of a real-time testbed using a software-defined radio (SDR)
platform and fabricated antenna array. Based on the measured data, we also
investigate system-level performances to verify the gain of the proposed smart
small cell system over long term evolution (LTE) systems by performing
system-level simulations based on a 3D ray-tracing tool.
