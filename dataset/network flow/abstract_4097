This paper contains information about numerical realization of the model of
turbulent flow proposed by Marek Burnat (see ARXIV: M.Burnat "On some
mathematical model of turbulent flow with intensive selfmixing"). As an example
the numerical experiment "Collision" is presented, and several pictures of the
unit vector velocity field at various stages of this experiment are shown.
