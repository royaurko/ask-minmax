Motivated by viral marketing, the problem of influence maximization in social
networks has attracted much attention in recent years and several studies have
been done on that. However, almost all of these studies are focused on the
progressive influence models, such as independent cascade (IC) and Linear
threshold (LT) models, which cannot capture the reversibility in actions. In
this paper, we present the Heat Conduction (HC) model which is a
non-progressive influence model and has favorable real world interpretations.
We also show that HC unifies, generalizes, and extends the existing
nonprogressive models, such as Voter model and non-progressive LT [1]. In
addition, we tackle the influence maximization problem for HC, which is proved
to be NP-hard, with a scalable and provably near-optimal solution; we prove
that the influence spread is submodular under HC and apply the greedy method.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a scalable solution
for influence maximization under non-progressive LT model, as a special case of
HC model. Our fast and efficient algorithm benefits from two key properties of
the proposed HC framework, where we establish closed-form expressions for the
influence function computation and the greedy seed selection. Through extensive
experiments on several real and synthetic networks, we validate the efficacy of
our algorithm and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
in terms of both influence spread and scalability.
