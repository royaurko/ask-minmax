In this work we study the homogenization for infinitesimal dislocation based
gradient viscoplasticity with linear kinematic hardening and general
non-associative monotone plastic flows. The constitutive equations in the
models we study are assumed to be only of monotone type. Based on the
generalized version of Korn's inequality for incompatible tensor fields (the
non-symmetric plastic distortion) due to Neff et al., we derive uniform
estimates for the solutions of quasistatic initial-boundary value problems
under consideration and then using an unfolding operator technique and a
monotone operator method we obtain the homogenized system of equations.
