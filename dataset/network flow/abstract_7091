Direct numerical simulation of a turbulent channel flow with heat transfer
was performed at very low Reynolds numbers. Two different thermal boundary
conditions were studied, and temperature was considered as a passive scalar.
The computations were carried out with huge computational boxes (up to 327.7 x
2 x 128 in the streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise directions, respectively).
The emphases of this paper are to investigate the large-scale structure (puff)
in the intermittent-turbulent flow including the scalar fields and to provide
the values of the transitional and critical Reynolds numbers, below which the
turbulent flow becomes intermittent and laminar, respectively. The statistics,
such as the skin friction and the Stanton number, were also examined: they
suggest that the puff should be effective in sustaining turbulence and in heat
transfer enhancement.
