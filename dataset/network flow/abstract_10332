Active bodies in viscous fluids interact hydrodynamically through
self-generated flows. Here we study spontaneous aggregation induced by
hydrodynamic flow in a suspension of stiff, apolar, active filaments. Lateral
hydrodynamic attractions in extensile filaments lead, independent of volume
fraction, to anisotropic aggregates which translate and rotate ballistically.
Lateral hydrodynamic repulsion in contractile filaments lead, with increasing
volume fractions, to microstructured states of asters, clusters, and incipient
gels where, in each case, filament motion is diffusive. Our results demonstrate
that the interplay of active hydrodynamic flows and anisotropic excluded volume
interactions provides a generic nonequilibrium mechanism for hierarchical
self-assembly of active soft matter.
