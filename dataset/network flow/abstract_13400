In this paper we will make the computation of the Onsager-Machlup functional
of an inhomogeneous uniformly elliptic diffusion process. This functional will
have formally the same picture as in the homogeneous case, the only difference
come from the infinitesimal variation of the volume. For example in the Ricci
flow case, we find some functional which is not so far to the $\mathcal L_{0} $
distance used by Lott to study this flow \cite{Lott:08}. We finish by a
application to small ball probability for weighted sup norm, for inhomogeneous
diffusion.
