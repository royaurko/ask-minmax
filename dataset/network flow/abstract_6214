We study evolving networks where new nodes when attached to the network form
links with other nodes of preferred distances. A particular case is where
always the shortest distances are selected (``make friends with the friends of
your present friends''). We present simulation results for network parameters
like the first eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian (synchronizability),
clustering coefficients, average distances, and degree distributions for
different distance preferences and compare with the parameter values for random
and scale free networks. We find that for the shortest distance rule we obtain
a power law degree distribution as in scale free networks, while the other
parameters are significantly different, especially the clustering coefficient.
