In the present work, we study the periodicities of oscillations in dark fine
structures using observations of a network and a semi-active region close to
the solar disk center. We simultaneously obtained spatially high resolution
time series of white light images and narrow band images in the H$\alpha$ line
using the 2D G\"ottingen spectrometer, which were based on two Fabry-Perot
interferometers and mounted in the VTT/Observatorio del Teide/Tenerife. During
the observations, the H$\alpha$ line was scanned at 18 wavelength positions
with steps of 125 m\AA. We computed series of Doppler and intensity images by
subtraction and addition of the H$\alpha$ $\pm$ 0.3 \AA\ and $\pm$ 0.7 \AA\
pairs, sampling the upper chromosphere and the upper photosphere, respectively.
Then we obtained power, coherence and phase difference spectra by performing a
wavelet analysis to the Doppler fluctuations. Here, we present comparative
results of oscillatory properties of dark fine structures seen in a network and
a semi-active region.
