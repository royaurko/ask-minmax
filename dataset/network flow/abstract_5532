Electronic collaboration among devices in a geographically localized
environment is made possible with the implementation of IEEE 802.11 based
wireless ad hoc networks. Dynamic nature of mobile ad hoc networks(MANETs) may
lead to unpredictable intervention of attacks or fault occurrence, which
consequently may partition the network, degrade its performance, violate the
QoS requirements and most importantly, affect bandwidth allocation to mobile
nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose a new distributed cluster
scheme for MANETs, especially in harsh environments, based on the concept of
survivability to support QoS requirements and to protect bandwidth efficiently.
With the incorporation of clustering algorithms in survivability technology, we
employ a simple network configuration and expect to reduce occurrences of
faults in MANETs. At the same time, we address the scalability problem, which
represents a great challenge to network configuration. We do expect a
simplification of accessing bandwidth allocation with required QoS support for
different applications.
