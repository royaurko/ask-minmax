using standard statistical techniques for analyzing complex networks. In
addition, the community structure of the rap music community is analyzed using
a new method that uses weighted edges to determine which connections are most
important and revealing among all the communities. The results of this method
as well as possible reasons for the structure of the rap music community are
discussed.
