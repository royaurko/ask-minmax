We prove that for a solution $(M^n,g(t))$, $t\in[0,T)$, where $T<\infty$, to
the Ricci flow with bounded curvature on a complete non-compact Riemannian
manifold with the Ricci curvature tensor uniformly bounded by some constant $C$
on $M^n\times [0,T)$, the curvature tensor stays uniformly bounded on
$M^n\times [0,T)$. Some other results are also presented.
