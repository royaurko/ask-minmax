We define and study a new class of 4d N=1 superconformal quiver gauge
theories associated with a planar bipartite network. While UV description is
not unique due to Seiberg duality, we can classify the IR fixed points of the
theory by a permutation, or equivalently a cell of the totally non-negative
Grassmannian. The story is similar to a bipartite network on the torus
classified by a Newton polygon. We then generalize the network to a general
bordered Riemann surface and define IR SCFT from the geometric data of a
Riemann surface. We also comment on IR R-charges and superconformal indices of
our theories.
