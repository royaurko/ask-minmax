We introduce a lattice Boltzmann computational scheme capable of modeling
thermohydrodynamic flows of monatomic gases. The parallel nature of this
approach provides a numerically efficient alternative to traditional methods of
computational fluid dynamics. The scheme uses a small number of discrete
velocity states and a linear, single-time-relaxation collision operator.
Numerical simulations in two dimensions agree well with exact solutions for
adiabatic sound propagation and Couette flow with heat transfer.
