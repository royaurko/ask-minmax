Continuous time Bayesian network classifiers are designed for temporal
classification of multivariate streaming data when time duration of events
matters and the class does not change over time. This paper introduces the
CTBNCToolkit: an open source Java toolkit which provides a stand-alone
application for temporal classification and a library for continuous time
Bayesian network classifiers. CTBNCToolkit implements the inference algorithm,
the parameter learning algorithm, and the structural learning algorithm for
continuous time Bayesian network classifiers. The structural learning algorithm
is based on scoring functions: the marginal log-likelihood score and the
conditional log-likelihood score are provided. CTBNCToolkit provides also an
implementation of the expectation maximization algorithm for clustering
purpose. The paper introduces continuous time Bayesian network classifiers. How
to use the CTBNToolkit from the command line is described in a specific
section. Tutorial examples are included to facilitate users to understand how
the toolkit must be used. A section dedicate to the Java library is proposed to
help further code extensions.
