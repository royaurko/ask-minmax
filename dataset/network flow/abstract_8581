We study the structural properties of the neural network of the C.elegans
(worm) from a directed graph point of view. The Google matrix analysis is used
to characterize the neuron connectivity structure and node classifications are
discussed and compared with physiological properties of the cells. Our results
are obtained by a proper definition of neural directed network and subsequent
eigenvector analysis which recovers some results of previous studies. Our
analysis highlights particular sets of important neurons constituting the core
of the neural system. The applications of PageRank, CheiRank and ImpactRank to
characterization of interdependency of neurons are discussed.
