In this note we study the bilateral merchandise trade flows between 186
countries over the 1948-2005 period using data from the International Monetary
Fund. We use Pajek to identify network structure and behavior across thresholds
and over time. In particular, we focus on the evolution of trade "islands" in
the a world trade network in which countries are linked with directed edges
weighted according to fraction of total dollars sent from one country to
another. We find mixed evidence for globalization.
