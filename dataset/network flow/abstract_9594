Roughly speaking, clustering evolving networks aims at detecting structurally
dense subgroups in networks that evolve over time. This implies that the
subgroups we seek for also evolve, which results in many additional tasks
compared to clustering static networks. We discuss these additional tasks and
difficulties resulting thereof and present an overview on current approaches to
solve these problems. We focus on clustering approaches in online scenarios,
i.e., approaches that incrementally use structural information from previous
time steps in order to incorporate temporal smoothness or to achieve low
running time. Moreover, we describe a collection of real world networks and
generators for synthetic data that are often used for evaluation.
