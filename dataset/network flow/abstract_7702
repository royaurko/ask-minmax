We study the 6-dimensional dynamics -- position and orientation -- of a large
sphere advected by a turbulent flow. The movement of the sphere is recorded
with 2 high-speed cameras. Its orientation is tracked using a novel, efficient
algorithm; it is based on the identification of possible orientation
`candidates' at each time step, with the dynamics later obtained from
maximization of a likelihood function. Analysis of the resulting linear and
angular velocities and accelerations reveal a surprising intermittency for an
object whose size lies in the integral range, close to the integral scale of
the underlying turbulent flow.
