A preceding paper demonstrated that explicit asymptotic methods generally
work much better for extremely stiff reaction networks than has previously been
shown in the literature. There we showed that for systems well removed from
equilibrium explicit asymptotic methods can rival standard implicit codes in
speed and accuracy for solving extremely stiff differential equations. In this
paper we continue the investigation of systems well removed from equilibrium by
examining quasi-steady-state (QSS) methods as an alternative to asymptotic
methods. We show that for systems well removed from equilibrium, QSS methods
also can compete with, or even exceed, standard implicit methods in speed, even
for extremely stiff networks, and in many cases give somewhat better
integration speed than for asymptotic methods. As for asymptotic methods, we
will find that QSS methods give correct results, but with non-competitive
integration speed as equilibrium is approached. Thus, we shall find that both
asymptotic and QSS methods must be supplemented with partial equilibrium
methods as equilibrium is approached to remain competitive with implicit
methods.
