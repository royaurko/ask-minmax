Recent proposals in multicast overlay construction have demonstrated the
importance of exploiting underlying network topology. However, these
topology-aware proposals often rely on incremental and periodic refinements to
improve the system performance. These approaches are therefore neither
scalable, as they induce high communication cost due to refinement overhead,
nor efficient because long convergence time is necessary to obtain a stabilized
structure. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable locating algorithm that
gradually directs newcomers to their a set of their closest nodes without
inducing high overhead. On the basis of this locating process, we build a
robust and scalable topology-aware clustered hierarchical overlay scheme,
called LCC. We conducted both simulations and PlanetLab experiments to evaluate
the performance of LCC. Results show that the locating process entails modest
resources in terms of time and bandwidth. Moreover, LCC demonstrates promising
performance to support large scale multicast applications.
