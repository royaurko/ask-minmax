Networks have become increasingly relevant to everyday life as our society
has become increasingly connected. Attaining a basic understanding of networks
has thus become a necessary form of literacy for all people living in today's
society (and for youths in particular). At the NetSci 2014 conference, we
initiated a year-long process to develop an educational resource that concisely
summarizes essential concepts about networks that can be used by anyone of
school age and older. The process involved several brainstorming sessions on
one key question: "What should every person living in the 21st century know
about networks by the time he/she finishes secondary education?" Different
sessions reached diverse participants, which included professional researchers
in network science, educators, and high-school students. The generated ideas
were connected by the students to construct a concept network. We examined
community structure in the concept network to group ideas into a set of
important concepts, which we refined further through extensive discussion into
seven essential concepts. The students played a major role in this development
process by providing insights and perspectives that were often unrecognized by
researchers and educators. The final result, "Network Literacy: Essential
Concepts and Core Ideas", is now available as a booklet in several different
languages from http://tinyurl.com/networkliteracy .
