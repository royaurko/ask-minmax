Securely sharing and managing personal content is a challenging task in
multi-device environments. In this paper, we design and implement a new
platform called Personal Content Networking (PCN). Our work is inspired by
Content-Centric Networking (CCN) because we aim to enable access to personal
content using its name instead of its location. The unique challenge of PCN is
to support secure file operations such as replication, updates, and access
control over distributed untrusted devices. The primary contribution of this
work is the design and implementation of a secure content management platform
that supports secure updates, replications, and fine-grained content-centric
access control of files. Furthermore, we demonstrate its feasibility through a
prototype implementation on the CCNx skeleton.
