We study nuclear dynamics at the the energy of vanishing flow for
neutron-rich systems. In particular, we shall study the collision rate, density
and temperature reached in a heavy-ion reaction with neutron-rich systems. We
shall also study the mass dependence of these quantities. Our results indicate
nearly mass independent nature for the density reached whereas a significant
mass dependence exists for the temperature of neutron-rich systems.
