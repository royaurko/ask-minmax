We define a notion of mean curvature flow with surgery for two-dimensional
surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with positive mean curvature. Our construction
relies on the earlier work of Huisken and Sinestrari in the higher dimensional
case. One of the main ingredients in the proof is a new estimate for the
inscribed radius established by the first contributor.
