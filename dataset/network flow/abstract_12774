In this paper, a bipartite consensus problem for a multi-agent system is
formulated firstly. Then an event-based interaction rule is proposed for the
multi-agent system with antagonistic interactions. The bipartite consensus
stability is analyzed on the basis of spectral properties of the signed
Laplacian matrix associated with multi-agent networks. Some simulation results
are presented to illustrate the bipartite consensus with the proposed
interaction rule.
