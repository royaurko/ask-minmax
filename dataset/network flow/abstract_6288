An investigation on the properties of electronic states of a tight-binding
Hamiltonian on the Apollonian network is presented. This structure, which is
defined based on the Apollonian packing problem, has been explored both as a
complex network, and as a substrate, on the top of which physical models can
defined. The Schrodinger equation of the model, which includes only nearest
neighbor interactions, is written in a matrix formulation. In the uniform case,
the resulting Hamiltonian is proportional to the adjacency matrix of the
Apollonian network. The characterization of the electronic eigenstates is based
on the properties of the spectrum, which is characterized by a very large
degeneracy. The $2\pi /3$ rotation symmetry of the network and large number of
equivalent sites are reflected in all eigenstates, which are classified
according to their parity. Extended and localized states are identified by
evaluating the participation rate. Results for other two non-uniform models on
the Apollonian network are also presented. In one case, interaction is
considered to be dependent of the node degree, while in the other one, random
on-site energies are considered.
