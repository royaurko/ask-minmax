We consider interval exchange transformations of periodic type and construct
different classes of recurrent ergodic cocycles of dimension $\geq 1$ over this
special class of IETs. Then using Poincar\'e sections we apply this
construction to obtain recurrence and ergodicity for some smooth flows on
non-compact manifolds which are extensions of multivalued Hamiltonian flows on
compact surfaces.
