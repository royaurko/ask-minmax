G-equations are well-known front propagation models in turbulent combustion
and describe the front motion law in the form of local normal velocity equal to
a constant (laminar speed) plus the normal projection of fluid velocity. In
level set formulation, G-equations are Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex
($L^1$ type) but non-coercive Hamiltonians. Viscous G-equations arise from
either numerical approximations or regularizations by small diffusion. The
nonlinear eigenvalue $\bar H$ from the cell problem of the viscous G-equation
can be viewed as an approximation of the inviscid turbulent flame speed $s_T$.
An important problem in turbulent combustion theory is to study properties of
$s_T$, in particular how $s_T$ depends on the flow amplitude $A$. In this
paper, we will study the behavior of $\bar H=\bar H(A,d)$ as $A\to +\infty$ at
any fixed diffusion constant $d > 0$. For the cellular flow, we show that $$
\bar H(A,d)\leq O(\sqrt {\mathrm {log}A}) \quad \text{for all $d>0$}. $$
Compared with the inviscid G-equation ($d=0$), the diffusion dramatically slows
down the front propagation. For the shear flow, the limit
  \nit $\lim_{A\to +\infty}{\bar H(A,d)\over A} = \lambda (d) >0$ where
$\lambda (d)$ is strictly decreasing in $d$, and has zero derivative at $d=0$.
The linear growth law is also valid for $s_T$ of the curvature dependent
G-equation in shear flows.
