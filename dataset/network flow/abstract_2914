This paper studies new properties of the front and back ends of a sorting
network, and illustrates the utility of these in the search for new bounds on
optimal sorting networks. Search focuses first on the "outsides" of the network
and then on the inner part. All previous works focus only on properties of the
front end of networks and on how to apply these to break symmetries in the
search. The new, out-side-in, properties help shed understanding on how sorting
networks sort, and facilitate the computation of new bounds on optimal sorting
networks. We present new parallel sorting networks for 17 to 20 inputs. For 17,
19, and 20 inputs these networks are faster than the previously known best
networks. For 17 inputs, the new sorting network is shown optimal in the sense
that no sorting network using less layers exists.
