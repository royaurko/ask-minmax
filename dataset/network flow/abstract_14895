A controllable synthesis method for SiC-SiO$_{2}$ nanocables has been
proposed. The diameter of SiC core and thickness of SiO$_{2}$ shell were
changed by adjusting the flow ratio between Ar dilution gas and ethanol
precursor. With increasing the flow, the enhancement of 1137cm$^{-1}$ peak was
observed from fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra. This peak
is considered to be originated from a highly disordered surface structure of
SiO$_{2}$ shell which was enhanced with increasing the flow. The FTIR spectra
show the 910cm$^{-1}$ peak which is attributed to surface phonon resonance in
the nanostructure of SiC exited by p-polarized field component.
