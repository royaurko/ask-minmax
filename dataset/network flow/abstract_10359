We construct a nonlinear differential equation of matrix pairs
$(\mathcal{M}(t),\mathcal{L}(t))$ that is invariant (the
\textbf{Structure-Preserving Property}) in the class of symplectic matrix pairs
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{S}_{\mathcal{S}_1,\mathcal{S}_2}=\left\{\left(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{L}\right)|
\ \mathcal{M}=\left[% \begin{array}{cc}
  X_{12} & 0
  X_{22} & I \end{array}% \right]\mathcal{S}_2, \mathcal{L}=\left[%
\begin{array}{cc}
  I & X_{11}
  0 & X_{21} \end{array}% \right]\mathcal{S}_1\right.\nonumber \left. \text{
and }X=\left[% \begin{array}{cc}
  X_{11} & X_{12}
  X_{21} & X_{22} \end{array}% \right]\text{is Hermitian}\right\} \end{align*}
for certain fixed symplectic matrices $\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\mathcal{S}_2$. Its
solution also preserves invariant subspaces on the whole orbit (the
\textbf{Eigenvector-Preserving Property}). Such a flow is called a
\textit{structure-preserving flow} and is governed by a Riccati differential
equation (RDE). In addition, Radon's lemma leads to an explicit form.
Therefore, blow-ups for the structure-preserving flows may happen at a finite
$t$. To continue, we then utilize the Grassmann manifolds to extend the domain
of the structure-preserving flow to the whole $\mathbb{R}$ subtracting some
isolated points.
