With an aim to investigate the effect of externally imposed body acceleration
and magnetic field on pulsatile flow of blood through an arterial segment
having stenosis is under consideration in this paper. The flow of blood is
presented by a unsteady micropolar fluid and the heat transfer characteristics
have been taken into account. The non-linear equations that governing the flow
are solved numerically using finite difference technique by employing a
suitable coordinate transformation. The numerical results have been observed
for axial and microrotation component of velocity, fluid acceleration, wall
shear stress(WSS), flow resistance, temperature and the volumetric flow rate.
It thus turns out that the rate of heat transfer increases with the increase of
Hartmann number $H$, while the wall shear stress has a reducing effect on the
Hartmann number $H$ and an enhancing effect on microrotation parameter $K$ as
well as the constriction height $\delta$.
