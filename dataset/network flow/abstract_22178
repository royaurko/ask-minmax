Motivated by the study of resolvent estimates in the presence of trapping, we
prove a semiclassical propagation theorem in a neighborhood of a compact
invariant subset of the bicharacteristic flow which is isolated in a suitable
sense. Examples include a global trapped set and a single isolated periodic
trajectory. This is applied to obtain microlocal resolvent estimates with no
loss compared to the nontrapping setting.
