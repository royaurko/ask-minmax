A neural network mechanism that can compensate for poor optical quality was
recently discovered in a biological context. We propose that this mechanism can
and should be adopted for astronomical purposes. This would shift emphasis away
from the quality of the optical equipment to information processing, hence
should decrease the cost and make larger instruments feasible.
