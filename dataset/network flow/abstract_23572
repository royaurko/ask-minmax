The self-organized dopant percolative filamentary model, entirely orbital in
character (no fictive spins), predicted the existence and even the ~ 3 nm
diameters of gap nanodomains (discovered by STM) that amazed almost all
theorists in this field. Here it explores the self-consistent and self-limiting
coupling between dopant sites and gap character. It explains precursive
magnetic effects and shows that they are caused by dopant ordering into loops
at an onset temperature of order 2Tc. The ordered coupling of these loops by
filamentary connectors is reflected by Debye-Waller factors, and it apparently
leads to HTSC. The model also resolves the mystery of the vanishing isotope
effect, and it explains the origin of the high-energy "waterfall" recently
discovered by ARPES, as well as some overlooked infrared anomalies.
