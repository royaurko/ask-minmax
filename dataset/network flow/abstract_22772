We derive an efficient and unbiased method for computing order parameters in
correlated electron systems with competing instabilities. Charge, magnetic and
pairing fluctuations above the energy scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking
are taken into account by a functional renormalization group flow, while the
formation of order below that scale is treated in mean-field theory. The method
captures fluctuation driven instabilities such as $d$-wave superconductivity.
As a first application we study the competition between antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity in the ground state of the two-dimensional Hubbard model.
