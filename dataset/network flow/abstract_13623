The motion of a spherical solid particle in plane Couette flow is governed by
a linear problem that has a simple exact solution. As such, there is no need
for an approximate analytical representation of the solution; specially when it
is tedious, complicated, and requires hairy terms to give accurate results only
at small or moderate values of the time.
