One of the main objectives of data mining is to help companies determine to
which potential customers to market and how many resources to allocate to these
potential customers. Most previous works on competitive influence in social
networks focus on the first issue. In this work, our focus is on the second
issue, i.e., we are interested on the competitive influence of marketing
campaigns who need to simultaneously decide how many resources to allocate to
their potential customers to advertise their products. Using results from game
theory, we are able to completely characterize the optimal strategic resource
allocation for the voter model of social networks and prove that the price of
competition of this game is unbounded. This work is a step towards providing a
solid foundation for marketing advertising in more general scenarios.
