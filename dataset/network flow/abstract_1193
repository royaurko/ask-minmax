The flow of power law fluids, which include shear thinning and shear
thickening as well as Newtonian as a special case, in networks of
interconnected elastic tubes is investigated using a residual based pore scale
network modeling method with the employment of newly derived formulae. Two
relations describing the mechanical interaction between the local pressure and
local cross sectional area in distensible tubes of elastic nature are
considered in the derivation of these formulae. The model can be used to
describe shear dependent flows of mainly viscous nature. The behavior of the
proposed model is vindicated by several tests in a number of special and
limiting cases where the results can be verified quantitatively or
qualitatively. The model, which is the first of its kind, incorporates more
than one major non-linearity corresponding to the fluid rheology and conduit
mechanical properties, that is non-Newtonian effects and tube distensibility.
The formulation, implementation and performance indicate that the model enjoys
certain advantages over the existing models such as being exact within the
restricting assumptions on which the model is based, easy implementation, low
computational costs, reliability and smooth convergence. The proposed model can
therefore be used as an alternative to the existing Newtonian distensible
models; moreover it stretches the capabilities of the existing modeling
approaches to reach non-Newtonian rheologies.
