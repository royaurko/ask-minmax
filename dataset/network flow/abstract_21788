We show that a small neighborhood of a closed symplectic submanifold in a
geometrically bounded aspherical symplectic manifold has non-vanishing
symplectic homology. As a consequence, we establish the existence of
contractible closed characteristics on any thickening of the boundary of the
neighborhood. When applied to twisted geodesic flows on compact symplectically
aspherical manifolds, this implies the existence of contractible periodic
orbits for a dense set of low energy values.
