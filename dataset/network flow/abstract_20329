The nonlinear rheology of glass-forming colloidal suspensions with
short-ranged attractions is discussed within the integration-through transients
framework combined with the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition
(ITT-MCT). Calculations are based on the square-well system (SWS), as a model
for colloid-polymer mixtures. The high-density regime featuring reentrant
melting of the glass upon increasing the attraction strength, and the crossover
from repulsive glasses formed at weak attraction to attractive glasses formed
at strong attraction, are discussed. Flow curves are found in qualitative
agreement with experimental data, featuring a strong increase in the yield
stress, and, for suitable interaction parameters, the crossover between two
yield stresses. The yield strain, defined as the position of the stress
overshoot under startup flow, is found to be proportional to the attraction
range for strong attraction. At weak and intermediate attraction strength, the
combined effects of hard-core caging and attraction-driven bonding result in a
richer dependence on the parameters. The first normal-stress difference
exhibits a weaker dependence on short-ranged attractions as the shear stress,
since the latter is more sensitive the short-wavelength features of the static
structure.
