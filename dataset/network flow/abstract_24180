Recently, it has been proposed that the natural connectivity can be used to
efficiently characterise the robustness of complex networks. Natural
connectivity quantifies the redundancy of alternative routes in a network by
evaluating the weighted number of closed walks of all lengths and can be
regarded as the average eigenvalue obtained from the graph spectrum. In this
article, we explore the natural connectivity of random graphs both analytically
and numerically and show that it increases linearly with the average degree. By
comparing with regular ring lattices and random regular graphs, we show that
random graphs are more robust than random regular graphs; however, the
relationship between random graphs and regular ring lattices depends on the
average degree and graph size. We derive the critical graph size as a function
of the average degree, which can be predicted by our analytical results. When
the graph size is less than the critical value, random graphs are more robust
than regular ring lattices, whereas regular ring lattices are more robust than
random graphs when the graph size is greater than the critical value.
