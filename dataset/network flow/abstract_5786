We investigate properties of several string networks in $D < 10$ which carry
electric currents as well as electrostatic charge densities. We show the
electric-current conservations as well as the force-balance condition of the
string tensions on 3-string junctions in these networks. We also show the
consistency of the above string networks from their world-volume point of view
by comparing the world-volume energy-density with the induced worldsheet energy
density of the supergravity solution. Finally, we present new charged
macroscopic string solutions in type II theories in D=8 and discuss certain
issues related to their network construction.
