Network analysis is currently used in a myriad of contexts: from identifying
potential drug targets to predicting the spread of epidemics and designing
vaccination strategies, and from finding friends to uncovering criminal
activity. Despite the promise of the network approach, the reliability of
network data is a source of great concern in all fields where complex networks
are studied. Here, we present a general mathematical and computational
framework to deal with the problem of data reliability in complex networks. In
particular, we are able to reliably identify both missing and spurious
interactions in noisy network observations. Remarkably, our approach also
enables us to obtain, from those noisy observations, network reconstructions
that yield estimates of the true network properties that are more accurate than
those provided by the observations themselves. Our approach has the potential
to guide experiments, to better characterize network data sets, and to drive
new discoveries.
