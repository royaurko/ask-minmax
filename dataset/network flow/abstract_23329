The effect of the nature state on the motion of an inextensible capsule in
simple shear flow has been studied in this paper. Besides the viscosity ratio
of the internal fluid and external fluid of the capsule, the nature state
effect also plays a role for having the transition between two well known
motions, tumbling and tank-treading (TT) with the long axis oscillating about a
fixed inclination angle (a swinging mode), when varying the shear rate. The
intermittent region between tumbling and TT with a swinging mode of the capsule
with a biconcave rest shape has been obtained in a narrow range of the
capillary number. In such region, the dynamics of the capsule is a mixture of
tumbling and TT with a swinging mode; when having the tumbling motion, the
membrane tank-tread backward and forward within a small range. As the capillary
number is very close to and below the threshold for the pure TT with a swinging
mode, the capsule tumbles once after several TT periods in each cycle. The
number of TT periods in one cycle decreases with respect to the decreasing of
the capillary number, until the capsule has one tumble and one TT period
alternatively and such alternating motion exists over a range of the capillary
number; and then the capsule performs more tumbling between two consecutive TT
periods when reducing the capillary number further, and finally shows pure
tumbling. The critical value of the swelling ratio for having the intermittent
region has been estimated.
