A minimal athermal model for the flow of dense disordered materials is
proposed, based on two generic ingredients: local plastic events occuring above
a microscopic yield stress, and the non-local elastic release of the stress
these events induce in the material. A complex spatio-temporal rheological
behaviour results, with features in line with recent experimental observations.
At low shear rates, macroscopic flow actually originates from collective
correlated bursts of plastic events, taking place in dynamically generated
fragile zones. The related correlation length diverges algebraically at small
shear rates. In confined geometries bursts occur preferentially close to the
walls yielding an intermittent form of flow localization.
