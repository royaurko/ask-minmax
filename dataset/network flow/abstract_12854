When an electrically charged system is subjected to the action of an
electromagnetic field, it responds by generating an electrical current. In the
case of a multicomponent plasma other effects, the so called cross effects,
influence the flow of charge as well as the heat flow. In this paper we discuss
these effects and their corresponding transport coefficients in a fully ionized
plasma using Boltzmann's equation. Applications to non-confined plasmas,
specially to those prevailing in astrophysical systems are highlighted. Also, a
detailed comparison is given with other available results.
