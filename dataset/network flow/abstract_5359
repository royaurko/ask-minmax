We introduce a simple one-parameter network growth algorithm which is able to
reproduce a wide variety of realistic network structures but without having to
invoke any global information about node degrees such as
preferential-attachment probabilities. Scale-free networks arise at the
transition point between quasi-random and quasi-ordered networks. We provide a
detailed formalism which accurately describes the entire network range,
including this critical point. Our formalism is built around a statistical
description of the inter-node linkages, as opposed to the single-node degrees,
and can be applied to any real-world network -- in particular, those where
node-node degree correlations might be important.
