To study simultaneously the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic behaviors in
compressible flow systems with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, we present a
theoretical framework for constructing Discrete Boltzmann Model(DBM) with
spherical or cylindrical symmetry in spherical or cylindrical coordinates. To
this aim, a key technique is to use \emph{local} Cartesian coordinates to
describe the particle velocity in the kinetic model. Thus, the geometric
effects, like the divergence and convergence, are described as a
\textquotedblleft force term\textquotedblright . Even though the hydrodynamic
models are one- or two-dimensional, the DBM needs a Discrete Velocity
Model(DVM) with 3 dimensions. We use a DVM with 26 velocities to formulate the
DBM which recovers the Navier-Stokes equations with spherical or cylindrical
symmetry in the hydrodynamic limit. For the system with \emph{global}
cylindrical symmetry, we formulated also a DBM based on a DVM with 2 dimensions
and 16 velocities. In terms of the nonconserved moments, we define two sets of
measures for the deviations of the system from its thermodynamic equilibrium
state. The extension of current model to the multiple-relaxation-time version
is straightforward.
