Ensuring security is something that is not easily done as many of the demands
of network security conflict with the demands of mobile networks, majorly
because of the nature of the mobile devices (e.g. low power consumption, low
processing load). The study of secure distributed key agreement has great
theoretical and practical significance. Securing Mobile Ad-hoc Networks using
Distributed Public-key Cryptography in pairing with Mobile Ad hoc Networks and
various protocols are essential for secure communications in open and
distributed environment.
