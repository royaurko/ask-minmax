We study the temporal percolation properties of temporal networks by taking
as a representative example the recently proposed activity driven network model
[N. Perra et al., Sci. Rep. 2, 469 (2012)]. Building upon an analytical
framework based on a mapping to hidden variables networks, we provide
expressions for the percolation time marking the onset of a giant connected
component in the integrated network. In particular, we consider both the
generating function formalism, valid for degree uncorrelated networks, and the
general case of networks with degree correlations. We discuss the different
limits of the two approach, indicating the parameter regions where the
correlated threshold collapses onto the uncorrelated case. Our analytical
prediction are confirmed by numerical simulations of the model. The temporal
percolation concept can be fruitfully applied to study epidemic spreading on
temporal networks. We show in particular how the susceptible-infected- removed
model on an activity driven network can be mapped to the percolation problem up
to a time given by the spreading rate of the epidemic process. This mapping
allows to obtain addition information on this process, not available for
previous approaches.
