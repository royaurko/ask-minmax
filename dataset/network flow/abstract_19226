Bayesian networks, and especially their structures, are powerful tools for
representing conditional independencies and dependencies between random
variables. In applications where related variables form a priori known groups,
chosen to represent different "views" to or aspects of the same entities, one
may be more interested in modeling dependencies between groups of variables
rather than between individual variables. Motivated by this, we study prospects
of representing relationships between variable groups using Bayesian network
structures. We show that for dependency structures between groups to be
learnable, the data have to satisfy the so-called groupwise faithfulness
assumption. We also show that one cannot learn causal relations between groups
using only groupwise conditional independencies, but also variable-wise
relations are needed. Additionally, we present algorithms for finding the
groupwise dependency structures.
