The Robert-Sommeria-Miller equilibrium statistical mechanics predicts the
final organization of two dimensional flows. This powerful theory is difficult
to handle practically, due to the complexity associated with an infinite number
of constraints. Several alternative simpler variational problems, based on
Casimir's or stream function functionals, have been considered recently. We
establish the relations between all these variational problems, justifying the
use of simpler formulations.
