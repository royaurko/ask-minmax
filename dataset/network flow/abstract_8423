We study the effect of clustering on the organization of cooperation, by
analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma on scale-free
networks with a tunable value of clustering. We find that a high value of the
clustering coefficient produces an overall enhancement of cooperation in the
network, even for a very high temptation to defect. On the other hand, high
clustering homogeneizes the process of invasion of degree classes by defectors,
decreasing the chances of survival of low densities of cooperator strategists
in the network.
