We study the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems for general
network topologies with unidirectional information flow. We propose two
(linear) distributed algorithms, deterministic and gossip, respectively for the
cases where the inter-agent communication is synchronous and asynchronous. Our
contribution is that in both cases, the developed algorithms guarantee state
averaging on arbitrary strongly connected digraphs; in particular, this
graphical condition does not require that the network be balanced or symmetric,
thereby extending many previous results in the literature. The key novelty of
our approach is to augment an additional variable for each agent, called
"surplus", whose function is to locally record individual state updates. For
convergence analysis, we employ graph-theoretic and nonnegative matrix tools,
with the eigenvalue perturbation theory playing a crucial role.
