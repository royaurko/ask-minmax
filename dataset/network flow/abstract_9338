Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks presents one of the big
challenges in systems biology. Gene regulatory networks are usually inferred
from a set of single-gene over-expressions and/or knockout experiments.
Functional relationships between genes are retrieved either from the steady
state gene expressions or from respective time series. We present a novel
algorithm for gene network reconstruction on the basis of steady-state
gene-chip data from over-expression experiments. The algorithm is based on a
straight forward solution of a linear gene-dynamics equation, where
experimental data is fed in as a first predictor for the solution. We compare
the algorithm's performance with the NIR algorithm, both on the well known
E.Coli experimental data and on in-silico experiments. We show superiority of
the proposed algorithm in the number of correctly reconstructed links and
discuss computational time and robustness. The proposed algorithm is not
limited by combinatorial explosion problems and can be used in principle for
large networks of thousands of genes.
