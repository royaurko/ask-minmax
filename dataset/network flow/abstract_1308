When the stations in an IEEE 802.11 infrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS)
employ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the transport layer, this
exacerbates per-flow unfair access which is a direct result of uplink/downlink
bandwidth asymmetry in the BSS. We propose a novel and simple analytical model
to approximately calculate the per-flow TCP congestion window limit that
provides fair and efficient TCP access in a heterogeneous wired-wireless
scenario. The proposed analysis is unique in that it considers the effects of
varying number of uplink and downlink TCP flows, differing Round Trip Times
(RTTs) among TCP connections, and the use of delayed TCP Acknowledgment (ACK)
mechanism. Motivated by the findings of this analysis, we design a link layer
access control block to be employed only at the Access Point (AP) in order to
resolve the unfair access problem. The novel and simple idea of the proposed
link layer access control block is employing a congestion control and filtering
algorithm on TCP ACK packets of uplink flows, thereby prioritizing the access
of TCP data packets of downlink flows at the AP. Via simulations, we show that
short- and long-term fair access can be provisioned with the introduction of
the proposed link layer access control block to the protocol stack of the AP
while improving channel utilization and access delay.
