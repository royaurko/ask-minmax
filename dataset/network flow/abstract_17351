Pure-radiation solutions are found, exploiting the analogy with the Euler-
Darboux equation for aligned colliding plane waves and the Euler-Tricomi
equation in hydrodynamics of two-dimensional flow. They do not depend on one of
the spacelike coordinates and comprise the Hauser solution as a special
subcase.
