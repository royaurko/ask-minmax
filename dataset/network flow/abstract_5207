Of concern in the paper is a study of steady incompressible viscoelastic and
electrically conducting fluid flow and heat transfer in a parallel plate
channel with stretching walls in the presence of a magnetic field applied
externally. The flow is considered to be governed by Walter's liquid B fluid.
The problem is solved by developing a suitable numerical method. The results
are found to be in good agrement with those of earlier investigations reported
in existing scientific literatures. The study reveals that a back flow occurs
near the central line of the channel due to the stretching walls and further
that this flow reversal can be stopped by applying a strong external magnetic
field. The study also shows that with the increase in the strength of the
magnetic field, the fluid velocity decreases but the temperature increases.
Thus the study bears potential applications in the study of the haemodynamic
flow of blood in the cardiovascular system when subjected to an external
magnetic field.
