Presented in this paper is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine for
conducting coherent parameter estimation for interferometric gravitational wave
observations of an inspiral of binary compact objects using data from multiple
detectors. The MCMC technique uses data from several interferometers and infers
all nine of the parameters (ignoring spin) associated with the binary system,
including the distance to the source, the masses, and the location on the sky.
The Metropolis-algorithm utilises advanced MCMC techniques, such as importance
resampling and parallel tempering. The data is compared with time-domain
inspiral templates that are 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) in phase and 2.0 PN in
amplitude. Our routine could be implemented as part of an inspiral detection
pipeline for a world wide network of detectors. Examples are given for
simulated signals and data as seen by the LIGO and Virgo detectors operating at
their design sensitivity.
