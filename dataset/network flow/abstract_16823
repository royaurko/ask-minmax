A 2D, hexagonal in geometry, statistical model of fracture is proposed. The
model is based on the drying fracture process of the bamboo Guadua
angustifolia. A network of flexible cells are joined by brittle junctures of
different Young moduli that break at a fixed threshold in tensile force. The
system is solved by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM). The distribution
of avalanche breakings exhibits a power law with exponent -2.93(9), in
agreement with the random fuse model.
