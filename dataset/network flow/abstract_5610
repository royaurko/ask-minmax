To address growth challenges facing large Data Centers and supercomputing
clusters a new construction is presented for scalable, high throughput, low
latency networks. The resulting networks require 1.5-5 times fewer switches,
2-6 times fewer cables, have 1.2-2 times lower latency and correspondingly
lower congestion and packet losses than the best present or proposed networks
providing the same number of ports at the same total bisection. These advantage
ratios increase with network size. The key new ingredient is the exact
equivalence discovered between the problem of maximizing network bisection for
large classes of practically interesting Cayley graphs and the problem of
maximizing codeword distance for linear error correcting codes. Resulting
translation recipe converts existent optimal error correcting codes into
optimal throughput networks.
