We study the recurrence to mistake dynamical balls, that is, dynamical balls
that admit some errors and whose proportion of errors decrease tends to zero
with the length of the dynamical ball. We prove, under mild assumptions, that
the measure-theoretic entropy coincides with the exponential growth rate of
return times to mistake dynamical balls and that minimal return times to
mistake dynamical balls grow linearly with respect to its length.Moreover we
obtain averaged recurrence formula for subshifts of finite type and suspension
semiflows. Applications include $\beta$-transformations, Axiom A flows and
suspension semiflows of maps with a mild specification property. In particular
we extend some results from [4, 9, 17] for mistake dynamical balls.
