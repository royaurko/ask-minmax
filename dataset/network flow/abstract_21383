Average properties of general inhomogeneous cosmological models are discussed
in the Newtonian framework. It is shown under which circumstances the average
flow reduces to a member of the standard Friedmann--Lema\^\i tre cosmologies.
Possible choices of global boundary conditions of inhomogeneous cosmologies as
well as consequences for the interpretation of cosmological parameters are put
into perspective.
