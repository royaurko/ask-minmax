We report on local superficial blood flow monitoring in biological tissue
from laser Doppler holographic imaging. In time averaging recording conditions,
holography acts as a narrowband bandpass filter, which, combined with a
frequency shifted reference beam, permits frequency selective imaging in the
radiofrequency range. These Doppler images are acquired with an off axis Mach
Zehnder interferometer. Microvascular hemodynamic components mapping is
performed in the cerebral cortex of the mouse and the eye fundus of the rat
with near-infrared laser light without any exogenous marker. These measures are
made from a basic inverse method analysis of local first order optical
fluctuation spectra at low radiofrequencies, from 0 Hz to 100 kHz. Local
quadratic velocity is derived from Doppler broadenings induced by fluid flows,
with elementary diffusing wave spectroscopy formalism in backscattering
configuration. We demonstrate quadratic mean velocity assessment in the 0.1 to
10 millimeters per second range in vitro and imaging of superficial blood
perfusion with a spatial resolution of about 10 micrometers in rodent models of
cortical and retinal blood flow.
