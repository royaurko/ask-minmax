New technique of integration of certain types of partial differential
equations is developed. For this purpose non-commutative integration over
Cayley-Dickson algebras is used. Applications to non-linear vector partial
differential equations of Korteweg-de-Vries and Kadomtzev-Petviashvili types
and describing non-isothermal flows of incompressible Newtonian liquids are
given.
