Yau's uniformization conjecture states: a complete noncompact K\"ahler
manifold with positive holomorphic bisectional curvature is biholomorphic to
$\ce^n$. The K\"ahler-Ricci flow has provided a powerful tool in understanding
the conjecture, and has been used to verify the conjecture in several important
cases. In this article we present a survey of the K\"ahler-Ricci flow with
focus on its application to uniformization. Other interesting methods and
results related to the study of Yau's conjecture are also discussed.
