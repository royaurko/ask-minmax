We investigate a simple stochastic model of social network formation by the
process of reinforcement learning with discounting of the past. In the limit,
for any value of the discounting parameter, small, stable cliques are formed.
However, the time it takes to reach the limiting state in which cliques have
formed is very sensitive to the discounting parameter. Depending on this value,
the limiting result may or may not be a good predictor for realistic
observation times.
