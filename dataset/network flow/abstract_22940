In existing literatures about the top-hat spherical collapse model of galaxy
clusters formation in cosmology containing dark energies, dark energies are
usually assumed not to cluster on this scale. But all these literatures ignored
the current describing the flowing of dark energies outside the clusters which
should exist under this assumption, so the conclusions of these literatures are
worth further explorations. In this paper we study this model in QCDM or
Phantom-CDM cosmologies(flat) by assuming that dark energies will cluster
synchronously with ordinary matters on the scale of galaxy clusters so the dark
energy current flowing outside the clusters does not exist at all and find that
in this case, the key parameters of the model exhibit rather non-trivial and
remarkable dependence on the equation of state coefficients of dark energies.
We then apply the results in
 Press-Scheter theory and calculate the number density of galaxy clusters and
its evolutions. We find that this two quantities are both affected
exponentially by the equation of state coefficients of dark energies. We leave
the study of this model with the assumption that dark energies do not cluster
on the scale of galaxy clusters at all as the topic of another paper where
similar conclusions will be obtained also.
