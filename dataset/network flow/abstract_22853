Hybrid ECAL is a cost-conscious option of electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL)
for particle flow calorimetry to be used in a detector of International Linear
Collider (ILC). It is a combination of silicon-tungsten ECAL, which realizes
high granularity and robust measurement of electromagnetic shower, and
scintillator-tungsten ECAL, which gives affordable cost with similar
performance to silicon. Optimization and a data acquisition trial in a test
bench for the hybrid ECAL are described in this article.
