In this work, we build on the concept of inter-Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs) information exchange. We show the feasibility of an approach that
intelligently utilizes information produced by other WSNs that may or not
belong to the same administrative domain. To illustrate how the behavior of a
WSN can be optimized using data from external WSNs, a specific use-case is
considered, where the operation of a WSN measuring relative humidity is
optimized using the data obtained from a WSN measuring temperature. Evaluated
using a dedicated performance score, the simulation results show that this new
approach can find a trade-off between energy consumption and quality of
measurements. Moreover, we outline the additional challenges that need to be
overcome, and draw conclusions to guide the future work in this field.
