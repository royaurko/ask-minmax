Cellular network resources are essential to be optimized in Femto cells
equipped macro cell networks. This is achieved by increasing the cellular
coverage and channel capacity, and reducing power usage and interference
between femto cells and macro cells. In this paper, the optimization approach
for cellular resources with installed femto cells in macro cell networks has
been addressed by deploying smart antennas applications and effect power
adaptation method which significantly optimize the cellular coverage, channel
capacity, power usage, and intra and inter tier interference. The simulation
results also illustrate the outstanding performance of this optimization
methodology.
