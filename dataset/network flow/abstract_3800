The Ising model shows on growing Barabasi - Albert networks the same
ferromagnetic behavior as on static Barabasi - Albert networks. Sznajd models
on growing Barabasi - Albert networks show an hysteresis like behavior. Nearly
a full consensus builds up and the winning opinion depends on history. On slow
growing Barabasi - Albert networks a full consensus builds up. At five opinions
in the Sznajd model with limited persuasion on growing Barabasi - Albert
networks, all odd opinions win and all even opinions loose supporters.
