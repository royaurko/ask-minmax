Elliptic flow at RHIC is computed event-by-event with NeXSPheRIO. Reasonable
agreement with experimental results on $v_2(\eta)$ is obtained. Various effects
are studied as well: reconstruction of impact parameter direction, freeze out
temperature, equation of state (with or without crossover), emission mecanism.
