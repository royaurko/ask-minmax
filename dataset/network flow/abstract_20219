This article shows how to fit reticulate finite and infinite sites sequence
spectra to aligned data from five modern human genomes (San, Yoruba, French,
Han and Papuan) plus two archaic humans (Denisovan and Neanderthal), to better
infer demographic parameters. These include interbreeding between distinct
lineages. Major improvements in the fit of the sequence spectrum are made with
successively more complicated models. Findings include some evidence of a male
biased gene flow from the Denisova lineage to Papuan ancestors and possibly
even more archaic gene flow. It is unclear if there is evidence for more than
one Neanderthal interbreeding, as the evidence suggesting this largely
disappears when a finite sites model is fitted.
