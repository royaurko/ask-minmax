We propose a simple scheme to establish entanglement among stationary qubits
based on the mechanism of resonance scattering between them and a
single-spin-flip wave packet in designed spin network. It is found that through
the natural dynamical evolution of an incident single-spin-flip wave packet in
a spin network and the subsequent measurement of the output single-spin-flip
wave packet,multipartite entangled states among n stationary qubits,
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states can be generated.
