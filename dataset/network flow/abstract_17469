Recent experimental techniques used to investigate shear banding are
reviewed. After recalling the rheological signature of shear-banded flows, we
summarize the various tools for measuring locally the microstructure and the
velocity field under shear. Local velocity measurements using dynamic light
scattering and ultrasound are emphasized. A few results are extracted from
current works to illustrate open questions and directions for future research.
