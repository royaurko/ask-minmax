Interference networks with no channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) except for the knowledge of the connectivity graph have been recently
studied under the topological interference management (TIM) framework. In this
paper, we consider a similar problem with topological knowledge but in a
distributed broadcast channel setting, i.e. a network where transmitter
cooperation is enabled. We show that the topological information can also be
exploited in this case to strictly improve the degrees of freedom (DoF) as long
as the network is not fully connected, which is a reasonable assumption in
practice. Achievability schemes based on selective graph coloring, interference
alignment, and hypergraph covering, are proposed. Together with outer bounds
built upon generator sequence, the concept of compound channel settings, and
the relation to index coding, we characterize the symmetric DoF for so-called
regular networks with constant number of interfering links, and identify the
sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the arbitrary network topologies to
achieve a certain amount of symmetric DoF.
