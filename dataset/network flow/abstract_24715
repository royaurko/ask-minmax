The present work presents an architecture developed to evaluate the QoS
parameters for the IPTV heterogeneous network. At its very basic level lie two
software technologies: Video LAN and Windows Media Services with two operating
systems: Windows and Linux. Three types of streams are analyzed, which will be
transmitted to a Linux VLC client through means of the aggregation and access
servers. The first stream is generated in real time by a capture camera,
processed by the encapsulated VC-1 encoder and sent to the Media Server, while
the second one is of VoD(Video on Demand) type and the third one will be
handled by DVBViewer through the MPEG TS form. The first stream is transcoded
in H.264-AAC such that the Linux stations will recognize its format. Through
the simultaneous transmission of the three streams, we are analyzing their
performance from a QoS parameters point of view by means of an application
implemented in C programming language. The stream transporting the DVB-S
television content was proven to ensure the best performance regarding loss of
packets, delays and jitter.
