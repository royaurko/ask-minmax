Systems whose organization displays causal asymmetry constraints, from
evolutionary trees to river basins or transport networks, can be often
described in terms of directed paths (causal flows) on a discrete state space.
Such a set of paths defines a feed-forward, acyclic network. A key problem
associated with these systems involves characterizing their intrinsic degree of
path reversibility: given an end node in the graph, what is the uncertainty of
recovering the process backwards until the origin? Here we propose a novel
concept, \textit{topological reversibility}, which rigorously weigths such
uncertainty in path dependency quantified as the minimum amount of information
required to successfully revert a causal path. Within the proposed framework we
also analytically characterize limit cases for both topologically reversible
and maximally entropic structures. The relevance of these measures within the
context of evolutionary dynamics is highlighted.
