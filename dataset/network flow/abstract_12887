We propose very general vortex nucleation mechanisms analogous to a
hydrodynamic instability and calculate associated critical velocity in
agreement with experiments.
  The creation of vortices via extrinsic mechanism is driven by a formation of
the surface vorticity sheet created by the flow, which reaches a critical size.
Such a sheet screens an attraction of a half-vortex ring to the wall, the
barrier for the vortex nucleation disappears and the vortex nucleation is
started. In the intrinsic mechanism the creation of a big vortex ring, which
transforms into the vortex, is driven by a fluctuative generation of small
vortex rings
