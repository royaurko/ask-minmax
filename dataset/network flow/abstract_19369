The origins of recently reported anisotropy of the local velocity field of
nearby galaxies (velocities < 500 km/s corresponding to the distance less than
8 Mpc) are studied. The exact solution of the Newtonian equation for the
expanding Universe is obtained. This solution allows us to separate the
Newtonian motion of nearby galaxies from the Hubble flow by the transition to
the conformal coordinates. The relation between the Hubble flow and the
Newtonian motion is established. We show that the anisotropic local velocity
field of nearby galaxies can be formed by such a Newtonian motion in the
expanding Universe, if at the moment of the capture of galaxies by the central
gravitational field.
