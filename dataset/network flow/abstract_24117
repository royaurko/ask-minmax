In this paper, we address the problem of distributed sparse recovery of
signals acquired via compressed measurements in a sensor network. We propose a
new class of distributed algorithms to solve Lasso regression problems, when
the communication to a fusion center is not possible, e.g., due to
communication cost or privacy reasons. More precisely, we introduce a
distributed iterative soft thresholding algorithm (DISTA) that consists of
three steps: an averaging step, a gradient step, and a soft thresholding
operation. We prove the convergence of DISTA in networks represented by regular
graphs, and we compare it with existing methods in terms of performance,
memory, and complexity.
