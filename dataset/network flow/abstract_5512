A wireless network is realized by mobile devices which communicate over radio
channels. Since, experiments of real life problem with real devices are very
difficult, simulation is used very often. Among many other important properties
that have to be defined for simulative experiments, the mobility model and the
radio propagation model have to be selected carefully. Both have strong impact
on the performance of mobile wireless networks, e.g., the performance of
routing protocols varies with these models. There are many mobility and radio
propagation models proposed in literature. Each of them was developed with
different objectives and is not suited for every physical scenario. The radio
propagation models used in common wireless network simulators, in general
researcher consider simple radio propagation models and neglect obstacles in
the propagation environment. In this paper, we study the performance of
wireless networks simulation by consider different Radio propagation models
with considering obstacles in the propagation environment. In this paper we
analyzed the performance of wireless networks by OPNET Modeler .In this paper
we quantify the parameters such as throughput, packet received attenuation.
