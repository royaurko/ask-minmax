The coherent contribution of all neutrons in neutrino nucleus scattering due
to the neutral current offers a realistic prospect of detecting supernova
neutrinos. As a matter of fact. for a typical supernova at 10 kpc, about 1000
events are expected usinga spherical gaseous detector of radius 4 m
andemploying Xe gas at a pressure of 10 Atm. We propose a world wide network of
several such simple, stable and low cost supernova detectors with a running
time of a few centuries.
