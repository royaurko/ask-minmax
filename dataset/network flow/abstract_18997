Synchronization and localization are critical challenges for the coherent
functioning of a wireless network, which are conventionally solved
independently. Recently, various estimators have been proposed for pairwise
synchronization between immobile nodes, based on time stamp exchanges via
two-way communication. In this paper, we consider a \textit{network of mobile
nodes} for which a novel joint time-range model is presented, treating both
unsynchronized clocks and the pairwise distances as a polynomial function of
\textit{true} time. For a set of nodes, a pairwise least squares solution is
proposed for estimating the pairwise range parameters between the nodes, in
addition to estimating the clock offsets and clock skews. Extending these
pairwise solutions to network-wide ranging and clock synchronization, we
present a central data fusion based global least squares algorithm. A unique
solution is non-existent without a constraint on the cost function (\eg clock
reference node). Ergo, a constrained framework is proposed and a new
Constrained \Cramer\ Rao Bound (CCRB) is derived for the joint time-range
model. In addition, various constraints are proposed and their effects on the
proposed algorithms are studied. Simulations are conducted and the proposed
algorithm is shown to approach the theoretical limits.
