In Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET), various types of Denial of Service Attacks
(DoS) are possible because of the inherent limitations of its routing
protocols. Considering the Ad Hoc On Demand Vector (AODV) routing protocol as
the base protocol it is possible to find a suitable solution to over-come the
attack of initiating / forwarding fake Route Requests (RREQs) that lead to
hogging of network resources and hence denial of service to genuine nodes. In
this paper, a proactive scheme is proposed that could prevent a specific kind
of DoS attack and identify the misbehaving node. Since the proposed scheme is
distributed in nature it has the capability to prevent Distributed DoS (DDoS)
as well. The performance of the proposed algorithm in a series of simulations
reveal that the proposed scheme provides a better solution than existing
approaches with no extra overhead.
