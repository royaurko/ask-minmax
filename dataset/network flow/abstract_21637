We report our results of the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group analysis in
two dimensional coupling space. The qualitative features of the RG flow are
described with a phenomenological RG equation. The dependence on the lattice
spacing for various actions provides the conditions to determine the parameters
entering the RG equation.
