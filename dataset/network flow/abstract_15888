Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have gained a lot of research attention
in recent years since they offer tremendous benefits for remote health
monitoring and continuous, real-time patient care. However, as with any
wireless communication, data security in WBANs is a challenging design issue.
Since such networks consist of small sensors placed on the human body, they
impose resource and computational restrictions, thereby making the use of
sophisticated and advanced encryption algorithms infeasible. This calls for the
design of algorithms with a robust key generation / management scheme, which
are reasonably resource optimal. This paper presents a security suite for
WBANs, comprised of IAMKeys, an independent and adaptive key management scheme
for improving the security of WBANs, and KEMESIS, a key management scheme for
security in inter-sensor communication. The novelty of these schemes lies in
the use of a randomly generated key for encrypting each data frame that is
generated independently at both the sender and the receiver, eliminating the
need for any key exchange. The simplicity of the encryption scheme, combined
with the adaptability in key management makes the schemes simple, yet secure.
The proposed algorithms are validated by performance analysis.
