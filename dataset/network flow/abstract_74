The global entropy generation rate in the zero-mean oscillatory flow of a
Maxwell fluid in a pipe is analyzed with the aim at determining its behavior at
resonant flow conditions. This quantity is calculated explicitly using the
analytic expression for the velocity field and assuming isothermal conditions.
The global entropy generation rate shows well-defined peaks at the resonant
frequencies where the flow displays maximum velocities. It was found that
resonant frequencies can be considered optimal in the sense that they maximize
the power transmitted to the pulsating flow at the expense of maximum
dissipation.
