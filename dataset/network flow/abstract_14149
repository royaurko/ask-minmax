The low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in NGC 3147, NGC 4203, and NGC 4579
have been imaged at four frequencies with the Very Long Baseline Array. The
galaxies are unresolved at all frequencies, with size upper limits of
$10^3-10^4$ times the Schwarzschild radii of their central massive black holes.
The spectral indices between 1.7 and 5.0 GHz range from 0.2 to 0.4; one and
possibly two of the galaxies show spectral turnovers between 5.0 and 8.4 GHz.
The high brightness temperatures ($> 10^9$ K) and relatively straight spectra
imply that free-free emission and/or absorption cannot account for the slightly
inverted spectra. Although the radio properties of the cores superficially
resemble predictions for advection-dominated accretion flows, the radio
luminosities are too high compared to the X-ray luminosities. We suggest that
the bulk of the radio emission is generated by a compact radio jet, which may
coexist with a low radiative efficiency accretion flow.
