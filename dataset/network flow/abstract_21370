The local galaxy distribution offers an interesting constraint to
cosmological models of structure formation. The galaxies are distributed in a
long, filamentary structure, presumably the result of large amplitude
gravitational instability, yet the local velocity field is cold. In particular,
there are no blueshifted galaxies within 5h^-1 Mpc except those within the
Local Group radius of 1h^-1 Mpc. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate
that such a situation is extremely rare for an observer in Omega=1 CDM models,
but is not uncommon in mixed dark matter (MDM) models that include massive
neutrinos.
