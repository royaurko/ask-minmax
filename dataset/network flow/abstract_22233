Red blood cells (RBCs) are an essential component of blood. A method to
include the particulate nature of blood is introduced here with the goal of
studying circulation in large-scale realistic vessels. The method uses a
combination of the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to account for the plasma
motion, and a modified Molecular Dynamics scheme for the cellular motion.
Numerical results illustrate the quality of the model in reproducing known
rheological properties of blood as much as revealing the effect of RBC
structuring on the wall shear stress, with consequences on the development of
cardiovascular diseases.
