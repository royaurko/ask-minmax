The complete knowledge of Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors of complex
networks plays an outstanding role in understanding various dynamical processes
running on them; however, determining analytically Laplacian eigenvalues and
eigenvectors is a theoretical challenge. In this paper, we study the Laplacian
spectra and their corresponding eigenvectors of a class of deterministically
growing treelike networks. The two interesting quantities are determined
through the recurrence relations derived from the structure of the networks.
Beginning from the rigorous relations one can obtain the complete eigenvalues
and eigenvectors for the networks of arbitrary size. The analytical method
opens the way to analytically compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of some
other deterministic networks, making it possible to accurately calculate their
spectral characteristics.
