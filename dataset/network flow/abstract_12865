We propose the viscous Camassa-Holm equations as a closure approximation for
the Reynolds-averaged equations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid. This
approximation is tested on turbulent channel flows with steady mean. Analytical
solutions for the mean velocity and the Reynolds shear stress across the entire
channel are obtained, showing good agreement with experimental measurements and
direct numerical simulations. As Reynolds number varies, these analytical mean
velocity profiles form a family of curves whose envelopes are shown to have
either power law, or logarithmic behavior, depending on the choice of drag law.
