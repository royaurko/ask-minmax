We present methods for detecting phase synchronization of two
unidirectionally coupled, self-sustained noisy oscillators from a signal of the
driven oscillator alone. One method detects soft, another hard phase locking.
Both are applied to the problem of detecting phase synchronization in von
Karman vortex flow meters.
