We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional
exterior domain, with no-slip boundary conditions. We assume that the initial
velocity is a finite-energy and L^q-summable perturbation of the Oseen vortex
with circulation \alpha, where 1 < q < 2. If {\alpha} is sufficiently small, we
show that the solution behaves asymptotically in time like the self-similar
Oseen vortex with circulation \alpha. This is a global stability result, which
holds for arbitrarily large perturbations of the Oseen vortex, and our
smallness assumption on the circulation is independent of the domain under
consideration.
