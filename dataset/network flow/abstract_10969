In most networks, the connection between a pair of nodes is the result of
their mutual affinity and attachment. In this letter, we will propose a Mutual
Attraction Model to characterize weighted evolving networks. By introducing the
initial attractiveness $A$ and the general mechanism of mutual attraction
(controlled by parameter $m$), the model can naturally reproduce scale-free
distributions of degree, weight and strength, as found in many real systems.
Simulation results are in consistent with theoretical predictions.
Interestingly, we also obtain nontrivial clustering coefficient C and tunable
degree assortativity r, depending on $m$ and A. Our weighted model appears as
the first one that unifies the characterization of both assortative and
disassortative weighted networks.
