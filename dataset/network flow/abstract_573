In many applications we are required to increase the deployment of a
distributed monitoring system on an evolving network. In this paper we present
a new method for finding candidate locations for additional deployment in the
network. This method is based on the Group Betweenness Centrality (GBC) measure
that is used to estimate the influence of a group of nodes over the information
flow in the network. The new method assists in finding the location of k
additional monitors in the evolving network, such that the portion of
additional traffic covered is at least (1-1/e) of the optimal.
