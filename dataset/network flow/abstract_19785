We introduce a new scenario for heavy ion collisions that could solve the
lingering problems associated with the so-called HBT puzzle. We postulate that
the system starts expansion as the perfect quark-gluon fluid but close to
freeze-out it splits into clusters, due to a sharp rise of bulk viscosity in
the vicinity of the hadronization transition. We then argue that the
characteristic cluster size is determined by the viscosity coefficient and the
expansion rate. Typically it is much smaller and independent of the total
system volume. These clusters maintain the pre-existing outward-going flow, as
a spray of droplets, but develop no flow of their own, and hadronize by
evaporation. We provide an ansatz for converting the hydrodynamic output into
clusters.
