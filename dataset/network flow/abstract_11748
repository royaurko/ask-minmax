Most cellular network communication strategies are focused on data traffic
scenarios rather than energy balance and efficient utilization. Thus mobile
users in hot cells may suffer from low throughput due to energy loading
imbalance problem. In state of art cellular network technologies, relay
stations extend cell coverage and enhance signal strength for mobile users.
However, busy traffic makes the relay stations in hot area run out of energy
quickly. In this paper, we propose an energy balancing strategy in which the
mobile nodes are able to dynamically select and hand over to the relay station
with the highest potential energy capacity to resume communication. Key to the
strategy is that each relay station merely maintains two parameters that
contains the trend of its previous energy consumption and then predicts its
future quantity of energy, which is defined as the relay station potential
energy capacity. Then each mobile node can select the relay station with the
highest potential energy capacity. Simulations demonstrate that our approach
significantly increase the aggregate throughput and the average life time of
relay stations in cellular network environment.
