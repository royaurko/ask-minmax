In this paper we introduce a new geometric flow with rotational invariance
and prove that, under this kind of flow, an arbitrary smooth closed
contractible hypersurface in the Euclidean space Rn+1 (n, 1) converges to Sn in
the C1-topology as t goes to the infinity. This result covers the well-known
theorem of Gage and Hamilton in [4] for the curvature flow of plane curves and
the famous result of Huisken in [5] on the flow by mean curvature of convex
surfaces, respectively.
