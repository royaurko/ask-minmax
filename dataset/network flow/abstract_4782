The spectrum of two-point functions in a holographic renormalization group
flow from an ultraviolet (UV) to an infrared (IR) conformal fixed point is
necessarily continuous. For a toy model, the spectral function does not only
show the expected UV and IR behaviours, but other interesting features such as
sharp peaks and oscillations in the UV. The spectral functions for the
SU(3)xU(1) flow in AdS_4/CFT_3 and the SU(2)xU(1) flow in AdS_5/CFT_4 are
calculated numerically. They exhibit a simple cross-over behaviour and
reproduce the conformal dimensions of the dual operators in the UV and IR
conformal phases.
