A novel hierarchical model of complex network is proposed, and information
propagation process taking place on top of the network is investigated. Our
model is demonstrated to have small world property. We found that the frequency
distribution of refractory elements number is bimodal and the location of
initially chosen seed infection affects the spreading range of the information.
