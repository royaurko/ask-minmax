Magnetically-driven non-stationary acceleration of jets in AGNs results in
the leading parts of the flow been accelerated to much higher Lorentz factors
than in the case of steady state acceleration with the same parameters. The
higher Doppler-boosted parts of the flow may dominate the high energy emission
of blazar jets. We suggest that highly variable GeV and TeV emission in blazars
is produced by the faster moving leading edges of highly magnetized
non-stationary ejection blobs, while the radio data trace the slower-moving
bulk flow. Model predictions compare favorably with the latest Fermi gamma-ray
and MOJAVE radio VLBI results.
