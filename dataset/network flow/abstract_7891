We prove short-time existence of \phi-regular solutions to the planar
anisotropic curvature flow, including the crystalline case, with an additional
forcing term possibly unbounded and discontinuous in time, such as for instance
a white noise. We also prove uniqueness of such solutions when the anisotropy
is smooth and elliptic. The main tools are the use of an implicit variational
scheme in order to define the evolution, and the approximation with flows
corresponding to regular anisotropies.
