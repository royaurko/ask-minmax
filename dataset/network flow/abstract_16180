As was shown in an earlier paper [1], solids dispersed in a drying drop
migrate to the (pinned) contact line. This migration is caused by outward flows
driven by the loss of the solvent due to evaporation and by geometrical
constraint that the drop maintains an equilibrium surface shape with a fixed
boundary. Here, in continuation of our earlier paper [2], we theoretically
investigate the evaporation rate, the flow field and the rate of growth of the
deposit patterns in a drop over an angular sector on a plane substrate.
Asymptotic power laws near the vertex (as distance to the vertex goes to zero)
are obtained. A hydrodynamic model of fluid flow near the singularity of the
vertex is developed and the velocity field is obtained. The rate of the deposit
growth near the contact line is found in two time regimes. The deposited mass
falls off as a weak power Gamma of distance close to the vertex and as a
stronger power Beta of distance further from the vertex. The power Gamma
depends only slightly on the opening angle Alpha and stays between roughly -1/3
and 0. The power Beta varies from -1 to 0 as the opening angle increases from 0
to 180 degrees. At a given distance from the vertex, the deposited mass grows
faster and faster with time, with the greatest increase in the growth rate
occurring at the early stages of the drying process.
