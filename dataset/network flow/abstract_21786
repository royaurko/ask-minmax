We address the problem of constructing numerical integrators for nonholonomic
Lagrangian systems that enjoy appropriate discrete versions of the geometric
properties of the continuous flow, including the preservation of energy.
Building on previous work on time-dependent discrete mechanics, our approach is
based on a discrete version of the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle for
nonautonomous systems.
