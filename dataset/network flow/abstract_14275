The Boltzmann equation for inelastic Maxwell models is used to analyze
nonlinear transport in a granular binary mixture in the steady simple shear
flow. Two different transport processes are studied. First, the rheological
properties (shear and normal stresses) are obtained by solving exactly the
velocity moment equations. Second, the diffusion tensor of impurities immersed
in a sheared inelastic Maxwell gas is explicitly determined from a perturbation
solution through first order in the concentration gradient. The corresponding
reference state of this expansion corresponds to the solution derived in the
(pure) shear flow problem. All these transport coefficients are given in terms
of the restitution coefficients and the parameters of the mixture (ratios of
masses, concentration, and sizes). The results are compared with those obtained
analytically for inelastic hard spheres in the first Sonine approximation and
by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The comparison between the results
obtained for both interaction models shows a good agreement over a wide range
values of the parameter space.
