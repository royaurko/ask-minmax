A method for computing probabilistic propositions is presented. It assumes
the availability of a single external routine for computing the probability of
one instantiated variable, given a conjunction of other instantiated variables.
In particular, the method allows belief network algorithms to calculate general
probabilistic propositions over nodes in the network. Although in the worst
case the time complexity of the method is exponential in the size of a query,
it is polynomial in the size of a number of common types of queries.
