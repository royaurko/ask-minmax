Context management strategies in wireless technology are dependent upon the
collection of accurate information from the individual nodes. This information
(called context information) can be exploited by administrators or automated
systems in order to decide on specific management concerns. While traditional
approaches for fixed networks are more or less centralized, more complex
management strategies have been proposed for wireless networks, such as
hierarchical, fully distributed and hybrid ones. The reason for the
introduction of new strategies is based on the dynamic and unpredictable nature
of wireless networks and their (usually) limited resources, which do not
support centralized management solutions. In this work, efforts is being made
to uncovered some specific strategies that can be used to managed context
information that reaches the centre of decision making, the work is concluded
with a detail comparison of the strategies to enable context application
developers make right choice of strategy to be employed in a specific
situation.
