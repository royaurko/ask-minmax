An extrinsic representation of a Ricci flow on a differentiable n-manifold M
is a family of submanifolds S(t), each smoothly embedded in R^{n+k}, evolving
as a function of time t such that the metrics induced on the submanifolds S(t)
by the ambient Euclidean metric yield the Ricci flow on M. When does such a
representation exist?
  We formulate this question precisely and describe a new, comprehensive way of
addressing it for surfaces of revolution in R^3. Of special interest is the
Ricci flow on a toroidal surface of revolution, that is, a surface of
revolution whose profile curve is an immersed curve which does not intersect
the axis of revolution. In In this case, the extrinsic representation of the
Ricci flow on a Riemannian cover of S is eternal. This flow can also be
realized as a compact family of non-smooth, but isometric, embeddings of the
torus into R^3.
