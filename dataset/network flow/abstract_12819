A two-dimensional cellular automaton model of traffic flow with open
boundaries are investigated by computer simulations. The outflow of cars from
the system and the average velocity are investigated. The time sequences of the
outflow and average velocity have flicker noises in a jamming phase. The low
density behavior are discussed with simple jam-free approximation.
