Fractal concepts have been introduced in the accretion disc as a new feature.
Due to the fractal nature of the flow, its continuity condition undergoes
modifications. The conserved stationary fractal flow admits only saddle points
and centre-type points in its phase portrait. Completely analytical solutions
of the equilibrium point conditions indicate that the fractal properties enable
the flow to behave like an effective continuum of lesser density, and
facilitates the generation of transonicity. However, strongly fractal flows
inhibit multitransonicity from developing. The mass accretion rate exhibits a
fractal scaling behaviour, and the entire fractal accretion disc is stable
under linearised dynamic perturbations.
