We investigate a relativistic fluid jet driven by radiation from a shocked
accretion disc around a non-rotating black hole approximated by
Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential. The sub-Keplerian and Keplerian accretion rates
control the shock location and therefore, the radiation field around the
accretion disc. We compute the radiative moments with full special relativistic
transformation. The effect of a fraction of radiation absorbed by the black
hole has been approximated, over and above the special relativistic
transformations. We show that the radiative moments around a super massive
black hole are different compared to that around a stellar mass black hole. We
show that the terminal speed of jets increases with the mass accretion
rates,synchrotron emission of the accretion disc and reduction of proton
fraction of the flow composition. To obtain relativistic terminal velocities of
jets, both thermal and radiative driving are important. We show for very high
accretion rates and pair dominated flow, jets around super massive black holes
are truly ultra-relativistic, while for jets around stellar mass black holes,
terminal Lorentz factor of about $10$ is achievable.
