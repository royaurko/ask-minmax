In this paper, a new framework to study weighed networks is introduced. The
idea behind this methodology is to consider that each node of the network is an
agent that desires to satisfy his/her preferences in an economic sense.
Moreover, the formation of a link between two agents depends on the benefits
and costs associated to this link. Therefore, an edge between two given nodes
will only arise if the tradeoff between satisfaction and cost for building it
is jointly positive. Using a computational framework, I intend to show that
depending on the agents combination of benefits and costs, some very well known
networks can naturally arise.
