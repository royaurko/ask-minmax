This invited paper presents some novel ideas on how to enhance the
performance of consensus algorithms in distributed wireless sensor networks,
when communication costs are considered. Of particular interest are consensus
algorithms that exploit the broadcast property of the wireless channel to boost
the performance in terms of convergence speeds. To this end, we propose a novel
clustering based consensus algorithm that exploits interference for
computation, while reducing the energy consumption in the network. The
resulting optimization problem is a semidefinite program, which can be solved
offline prior to system startup.
