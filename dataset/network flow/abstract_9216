We investigate the statistics of the most connected nodes in scale-free
networks. For a scale-free network model with homogeneous nodes, we show by
means of extensive simulations that the exponential truncation--due to the
finite size of the network--of the degree distribution governs the scaling of
the extreme values. We also find that the distribution of maxima obeys scaling
and follows the Gumbel statistics. For a scale-free network model with
heterogeneous nodes, we show that scaling no longer holds and that the
truncation of the degree distribution no longer controls the maximum
distribution. Moreover, we find that neither the Gumbel nor the Frechet
statistics describe the data.
