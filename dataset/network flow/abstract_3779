We investigate aspects of low-magnetic-Reynolds-number flow between two
parallel, perfectly insulating walls, in the presence of an imposed magnetic
field parallel to the bounding walls. We find a functional basis to describe
the flow, well adapted to the problem of finding the attractor dimension, and
which is also used in subsequent direct numerical simulation of these flows.
For given Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, we obtain an upper bound for the
dimension of the attractor by means of known bounds on the nonlinear inertial
term and this functional basis for the flow. Three distinct flow regimes
emerge: a quasi-isotropic 3D flow, a non-isotropic three-dimensional (3D) flow,
and a 2D flow. We find the transition curves between these regimes in the space
parameterized by Hartmann number Ha and attractor dimension $d_\text{att}$. We
find how the attractor dimension scales as a function of Reynolds and Hartmann
numbers (Re and Ha) in each regime. We also investigate the thickness of the
boundary layer along the bounding wall, and find that in all regimes this
scales as 1/Re, independently of the value of Ha, unlike Hartmann boundary
layers found when the field is normal to the channel. The structure of the set
of least dissipative modes is indeed quite different between these two cases
but the properties of turbulence far from the walls (smallest scales and number
of degrees of freedom) are found to be very similar.
