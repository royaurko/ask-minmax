Typical applications of the mobile ad-hoc network, MANET, are in disaster
recovery operations which have to respect time constraint needs. Since MANET is
affected by limited resources such as power constraints, it is a challenge to
respect the deadline of a real-time data. This paper proposes the Energy and
Delay aware based on Dynamic Source Routing protocol, ED-DSR. ED-DSR
efficiently utilizes the network resources such as the intermediate mobile
nodes energy and load. It ensures both timeliness and energy efficiency by
avoiding low-power and overloaded intermediate mobile nodes. Through
simulations, we compare our proposed routing protocol with the basic routing
protocol Dynamic Source Routing, DSR. Weighting factors are introduced to
improve the route selection. Simulation results, using the NS-2 simulator, show
that the proposed protocol prolongs the network lifetime (up to 66%), increases
the volume of packets delivered while meeting the data flows real-time
constraints and shortens the endto- end delay.
