In this paper, we give some convergence results of Lagrangian mean curvature
flow under some stability conditions in a general K\"ahler-Einstein manifold.
In particular, we prove that the flow will converge if the initial data is some
small perturbation of stable minimal Lagrangian submanifold in a
K\"ahler-Einstein manifold.
