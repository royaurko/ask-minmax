Voice over Internet Protocol is a service from the Internet services that
allows users to communicate with each other. Quality of Service is very
sensitive to delay so that Voice over Internet Protocol needs it. The objective
of this research is to study the effect of different queuing algorithms within
the router on Voice over Internet Protocol Quality of Service. In this work,
simulation tool OPNET Modeler is used to implement the proposed network (Voice
over Internet Protocol Network). The proposed network is a private network for
a company that has two locations located at two different countries around the
world in order to simulate the communications within the same location as a
local and the communications between two locations as a long distance and
analyze Voice over Internet Protocol Quality of Service through measuring the
major factors that affect the Quality of Service for Voice over Internet
Protocol according to international telecommunication union standards such as:
delay, jitter and packet loss. In this research, a comparison was carried out
between different queue algorithms like First in First out (FIFO), Priority
queue and Weight Fair Queuing and it was found that Priority queue and Weight
Fair Queuing algorithms are the most appropriate to improve Voice over Internet
Protocol Quality of Service .
