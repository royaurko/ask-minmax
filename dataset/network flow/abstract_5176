We study a reaction-diffusion equation in the cylinder $\Omega =
\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}^m$, with combustion-type reaction term without
ignition temperature cutoff, and in the presence of a periodic flow. We show
that if the reaction function decays as a power of $T$ larger than three as
$T\to 0$ and the initial datum is small, then the flame is extinguished -- the
solution quenches. If, on the other hand, the power of decay is smaller than
three or initial datum is large, then quenching does not happen, and the
burning region spreads linearly in time. This extends results of
Aronson-Weinberger for the no-flow case. We also consider shear flows with
large amplitude and show that if the reaction power-law decay is larger than
three and the flow has only small plateaux (connected domains where it is
constant), then any compactly supported initial datum is quenched when the flow
amplitude is large enough (which is not true if the power is smaller than three
or in the presence of a large plateau). This extends results of
Constantin-Kiselev-Ryzhik for combustion with ignition temperature cutoff. Our
work carries over to the case $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{T}^m$, when
the critical power is $1 + 2/n$, as well as to certain non-periodic flows.
