We present Lagrangian one-particle statistics from the Risoe PTV experiment
of a turbulent flow. We estimate the Lagrangian Kolmogorov constant $C_0$ and
find that it is affected by the large scale inhomogeneities of the flow. The
pdf of temporal velocity increments are highly non-Gaussian for small times
which we interpret as a consequence of intermittency. Using Extended
Self-Similarity we manage to quantify the intermittency and find that the
deviations from Kolmogorov 1941 similarity scaling is larger in the Lagrangian
framework than in the Eulerian. Through the multifractal model we calculate the
multifractal dimension spectrum.
