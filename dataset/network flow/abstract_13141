We formulate and model the dynamics of spatial patterns arising during the
precipitation of calcium carbonate from a supersaturated shallow water flow.
The model describes the formation of travertine deposits at geothermal hot
springs and rimstone dams of calcite in caves. We find explicit solutions for
travertine domes at low flow rates, identify the linear instabilities which
generate dam and pond formation on sloped substrates, and present simulations
of statistical landscape evolution.
