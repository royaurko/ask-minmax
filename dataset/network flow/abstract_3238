The article describes the CFD software tool FlowVision (OOO "Tesis", Moscow).
The model equations used for this research are the set of Reynolds and
continuity equations and equations of the standard k - e turbulence model. The
aim of the paper was testing of FlowVision by comparing the computational
results for a number of simple internal channel fluid flows with known
experimental data. The test cases are non-swirling and swirling flows in pipes
and diffusers, flows in stationary and rotating bends. Satisfactory
correspondence of results was obtained both for flow patterns and respective
quantitative values.
