Topological inhomogeneity gives rise to spectral anomalies that can induce
Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in low dimensional systems. These anomalies
consist in energy regions composed of an infinite number of states with
vanishing weight in the thermodynamic limit (hidden states). Here we present a
rigorous result giving the most general conditions for BEC on complex networks.
We prove that the presence of hidden states in the lowest region of the
spectrum is the necessary and sufficient condition for condensation in low
dimension (spectral dimension $\bar{d}\leq 2$), while it is shown that BEC
always occurs for $\bar{d}>2$.
