In this brief paper, a simple and fast computational method, the Planar
Visibility Graph Networks Algorithm was proposed based on the famous Visibility
Graph Algorithm, which can fulfill converting two dimensional timeseries into a
planar graph. The constructed planar graph inherits several properties of the
series in its structure. Thereby, periodic series, random series, and chaotic
series convert into quite different networks with different average degree,
characteristic path length, diameter, clustering coefficient, different degree
distribution, and modularity, etc. By means of this new approach, with such
different networks measures, one can characterize two dimensional timeseries
from a new viewpoint of complex networks.
