Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are self-organizing, self-healing networks
which provide wireless communication among vehicular and roadside devices.
Applications in such networks can take advantage of the use of simultaneous
connections, thereby maximizing the throughput and lowering latency. In order
to take advantage of all radio interfaces of the vehicle and to provide good
quality of service for vehicular applications, we de- veloped a seamless flow
mobility management architecture based on vehicular network application classes
with network-based mobility management. Our goal is to minimize the time of
flow connection exchange in order to comply with the minimum requirements of
vehicular application classes, as well as to maximize their throughput. NS3
simulations were performed to analyse the behaviour of our architecture by
comparing it with other three scenarios. As a result of this work, we observed
that the proposed architecture presented a low handover time, with lower packet
loss and lower delay.
