Motivated by the fact that transfer functions do not contain structural
information about networks, dynamical structure functions were introduced to
capture causal relationships between measured nodes in networks. From the
dynamical structure functions, a) we show that the actual number of hidden
states can be larger than the number of hidden states estimated from the
corresponding transfer function; b) we can obtain partial information about the
true state-space equation, which cannot in general be obtained from the
transfer function. Based on these properties, this paper proposes algorithms to
find minimal realisations for a given dynamical structure function. This helps
to estimate the minimal number of hidden states, to better understand the
complexity of the network, and to identify potential targets for new
measurements.
