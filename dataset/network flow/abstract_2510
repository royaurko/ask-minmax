We propose a natural model of evolving weighted networks in which new links
are not necessarily connected to new nodes. The model allows a newly added link
to connect directly two nodes already present in the network. This is plausible
in modeling many real-world networks. Such a link is called an inner link,
while a link connected to a new node is called an outer link. In view of
interrelations between inner and outer links, we investigate power-laws for the
strength, degree and weight distributions of weighted complex networks. This
model enables us to predict some features of weighted networks such as the
worldwide airport network and the scientific collaboration network.
