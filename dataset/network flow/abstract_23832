We propose a weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL) formed by the random
sequential partition of a plane into contiguous and non-overlapping blocks and
find that it evolves following several non-trivial conservation laws, namely
$\sum_i^N x_i^{n-1} y_i^{4/n-1}$ is independent of time $\forall \ n$, where
$x_i$ and $y_i$ are the length and width of the $i$th block. Its dual on the
other hand, obtained by replacing each block with a node at its center and
common border between blocks with an edge joining the two vertices, emerges as
a network with a power-law degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$ where
$\gamma=5.66$ revealing scale-free coordination number disorder since $P(k)$
also describes the fraction of blocks having $k$ neighbours. To quantify the
size disorder, we show that if the $i$th block is populated with $p_i\sim
x_i^3$ then its distribution in the WPSL exhibits multifractality.
