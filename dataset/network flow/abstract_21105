The structure of states of the perturbed p-spin spherical spin-glass is
analyzed. At low enough free energy metastable states have a supersymmetric
structure, while at higher free energies the supersymmetry is broken. The
transition between the supersymmetric and the supersymmetry-breaking phase is
triggered by a change in the stability of states.
