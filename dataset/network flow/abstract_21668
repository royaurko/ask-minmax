We consider the renormalization of theories with many scalar fields. We
discuss at the one-loop level some simple, non-gauge models with an arbitrary
number of scalars and fermions both in mass-shell and MS schemes. In MS scheme
we give a detailed qualitative analysis of the RG flow of dimensionless
couplings in flavor space.
