Increasing shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources induce higher and
higher power flow variability at the transmission level. The question arises as
to what extent existing networks can absorb additional fluctuating power
injection without exceeding thermal limits. At the same time, the resulting
power flow characteristics call for revisiting classical approaches to line
temperature prediction. This paper presents a probabilistic modeling and
simulation methodology for estimating the occurrence of critical line
temperatures in the presence of fluctuating power flows. Cumbersome integration
of the dynamic thermal equations at each Monte Carlo simulation trial is sped
up by a specific algorithm that makes use of a variance reduction technique
adapted from the telecommunications field. The substantial reduction in
computational time allows estimations closer to real time, relevant to
short-term operational assessments. A case study performed on a single line
model provides fundamental insights into the probability of hitting critical
line temperatures under given power flow fluctuations. A transmission system
application shows how the proposed method can be used for a fast yet accurate
operational assessment.
