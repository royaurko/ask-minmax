Previous preliminary results on the application of knowledge networks to
noise reduction in stationary harmonic and weakly chaotic signals are extended
to more general cases. The formalism gives a novel algorithm from which
statistical tests for the identification of deterministic behavior in noisy
stationary time series can be constructed.
