Fifty years have just passed since the first discovery of the extra-solar
X-ray sources by Giacconi and his team which we know today to be some stellar
mass black holes. By 1973, not only a catalog of these enigmatic objects were
made, and their spectra were obtained. Today, forty years have passed since the
revolutionary idea of the thin, axisymmetric, Keplerian, disk model by Shakura
and Sunyaev was published. Yet, the complete predictability of their radiative
properties remains as illusive as ever. The only available and self-consistent
solution to date is the generalized viscous transonic flow solutions where both
heating and cooling effects are included. I demonstrate that the latest
`Avatar' of the accretion/outflow picture, the Generalized Two Component
Advective Flow (GTCAF), is capable of explaining almost all the black hole
observational results, when the results of the time dependent simulation of
viscous and radiative processes are also taken into consideration. I also
discuss the problems with predictability and argue that understanding
companion's behaviour in terms of its habit of mass loss, ellipticity of its
orbit, magnetic properties, etc. is extremely important for the prediction of
emission properties of the accretion flow.
