This paper describes a process for constructing situation-specific belief
networks from a knowledge base of network fragments. A situation-specific
network is a minimal query complete network constructed from a knowledge base
in response to a query for the probability distribution on a set of target
variables given evidence and context variables. We present definitions of query
completeness and situation-specific networks. We describe conditions on the
knowledge base that guarantee query completeness. The relationship of our work
to earlier work on KBMC is also discussed.
