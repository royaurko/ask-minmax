Receptor cells with electrically coupled axons can improve both their input
sensitivity and dynamical range due to collective non-linear wave properties.
This mechanism is illustrated by a network of axons modeled by excitable maps
subjected to a Poison signal process with rate r. We find that, in a network of
N cells, the amplification factor A (number of cells excited by a single signal
event) decreases smoothly from A= O(N) to A=1 as r increases, preventing
saturation in a self-organized way and leading to a Weber-Fechner law behavior.
This self-limited amplification mechanism is generic for excitable media and
could be implemented in other biological contexts and artificial sensor
devices.
