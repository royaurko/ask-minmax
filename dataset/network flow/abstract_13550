Nakariakov et al. (1996) investigated the linear magnetosonic waves trapped
within solar wind flow tubes, where they accounted for a slab having boundaries
at $x = \pm d$ and extended up to infinity in the $y$ and $z$ directions.
Srivastava and Dwivedi (2006) claimed to extend that work by considering a
two-dimensional slab. We find that the work of Srivastava and Dwivedi (2006) is
not for a two-dimensional slab and has a number of discrepancies. Further,
their results for body waves are not reliable.
