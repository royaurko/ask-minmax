The dynamics of Boolean networks (BN) with quenched disorder and thermal
noise is studied via the generating functional method. A general formulation,
suitable for BN with any distribution of Boolean functions, is developed. It
provides exact solutions and insight into the evolution of order parameters and
properties of the stationary states, which are inaccessible via existing
methodology. We identify cases where the commonly used annealed approximation
is valid and others where it breaks down. Broader links between BN and general
Boolean formulas are highlighted.
