The interface temperature of two rods with equal cross section joined at one
end and with different initial temperatures, initially always acquires the
value characteristic for two semi-infinite rods. This value, which is shown to
be a consequence of energy conservation is, in general, different from the
thermal equilibrium temperature in finite rods. To illustrate this result, two
particular cases are discussed.
