Directed flow $v_1$, observable introduced for description of nucleus
collisions is discussed. We consider a possible origin of the flow in hadronic
reactions as a result of rotation of the transient matter and trace analogy
with nucleus collisions. It is argued that the presence of directed flow can
serve as a signal that transient matter is in a liquid state.
