This paper develops a diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) over a
bidirectional random relay set in a wireless network where the distribution of
all nodes is a stationary Poisson point process. This is a nontrivial extension
of the DMT because it requires consideration of the cooperation (or lack
thereof) of relay nodes, the traffic pattern and the time allocation between
the forward and reverse traffic directions. We then use this tradeoff to
compare the DMTs of traditional time-division multihop (TDMH) and network
coding (NC). Our main results are the derivations of the DMT for both TDMH and
NC. This shows, surprisingly, that if relay nodes collaborate NC does not
always have a better DMT than TDMH since it is difficult to simultaneously
achieve bidirectional transmit diversity for both source nodes. In fact, for
certain traffic patterns NC can have a worse DMT due to suboptimal time
allocation between the forward and reverse transmission directions.
