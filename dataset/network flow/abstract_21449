A recent measurement of double peak QPOs frequencies in Sgr A* is consistent
with the 3:2 ratio. The same ratio is firmly established by previous
observations in all double peak kHz QPOs in microquasars and theoretically
explained by orbital epicyclic resonances excited in nearly Keplerian accretion
flow in black hole's strong gravity. If confirmed, the 3:2 ratio of double peak
QPOs in Sgr A$^*$ will be of a fundamental importance for the black hole
accretion theory, by providing another clear argument that the accretion disk
oscillations are indeed governed by non-linear, strong-gravity physics.
