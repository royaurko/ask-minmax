We investigate the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the coexistence of
competing species in the case when the heterogeneity is dynamically generated
by environmental flows with chaotic mixing properties. We show that one of the
effects of chaotic advection on the passively advected species (such as
phytoplankton, or self-replicating macromolecules) is the possibility of
coexistence of more species than that limited by the number of niches they
occupy. We derive a novel set of dynamical equations for competing populations.
