We study the compatibility of a light bottom squark M_{\tilde b}< O(10 GeV)
in the unconstrained MSSM. We consider the one-loop radiative corrections which
are large for a heavy gluino (> O(150 GeV)). We then consider the
renormalization group flow up to the Grand Unified scale. For most regions of
the parameter space with a light sbottom we find colour and charge breaking
minima. Only a small window in gluino mass and tan(beta) is consistent with all
bounds. This is alleviated by a light gluino, which is however only marginally
experimentally allowed.
