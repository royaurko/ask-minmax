We present a new gauge/gravity duality construction of the Klebanov-Strassler
throat which takes corrections to the anomalous mass dimension proposed in [1]
into account on the gauge theory side and both the dilaton and the axion run on
the gravity side. The corresponding supergravity solutions are found using
equations for type IIB flows with N=1 supersymmetry obtained in [2]. We find
that magnetic couplings of the axion to D7-branes filling 4-d spacetime and
wrapping 4-cycles at locations of duality transitions and invisible Dirac
8-branes whose worldvolume emanates from the worldvolume of the D7-branes are
the sources for the runnings of the dilaton and the axion. Our construction
provides the first explicit example of a gauge/gravity duality mapping with a
running dilaton or a running axion which is an important component towards
finding gravity duals to gauge theories with physically more interesting
renormalization group flows such as pure confining gauge theories in four
dimensions. The D7-branes also serve as gravitational source for Seiberg
duality transitions. The supergravity background has distinct features which
could be useful for constructing cosmological models and studying possibilities
for probing stringy signatures from the early universe.
