We study the density modulation that appears in a Bose-Einstein condensate
flowing with supersonic velocity against an obstacle. The experimental density
profiles observed at JILA are reproduced by a numerical integration of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation and then interpreted in terms of Cerenkov emission of
Bogoliubov excitations by the defect. The phonon and the single-particle
regions of the Bogoliubov spectrum are respectively responsible for a conical
wavefront and a fan-shaped series of precursors.
