In a previous paper we proposed a model to study the dynamics of opinion
formation in human societies by a co-evolution process involving two distinct
time scales of fast transaction and slower network evolution dynamics. In the
transaction dynamics we take into account short range interactions as
discussions between individuals and long range interactions to describe the
attitude to the overall mood of society. The latter is handled by a uniformly
distributed parameter $\alpha$, assigned randomly to each individual, as
quenched personal bias. The network evolution dynamics is realized by rewiring
the societal network due to state variable changes as a result of transaction
dynamics. The main consequence of this complex dynamics is that communities
emerge in the social network for a range of values in the ratio between time
scales. In this paper we focus our attention on the attitude parameter $\alpha$
and its influence on the conformation of opinion and the size of the resulting
communities. We present numerical studies and extract interesting features of
the model that can be interpreted in terms of social behaviour.
