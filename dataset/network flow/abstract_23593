Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) are used primarily to solve
curve-fitting problems and for non-linear system modeling. Several algorithms
are known for the approximation of a non-linear curve from a sparse data set by
means of RBFNs. However, there are no procedures that permit to define
constrains on the derivatives of the curve. In this paper, the Orthogonal Least
Squares algorithm for the identification of RBFNs is modified to provide the
approximation of a non-linear 1-in 1-out map along with its derivatives, given
a set of training data. The interest on the derivatives of non-linear functions
concerns many identification and control tasks where the study of system
stability and robustness is addressed. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm is demonstrated by a study on the stability of a single loop feedback
system.
