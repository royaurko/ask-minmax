We investigate the flow of a nano-scale incompressible ridge of
low-volatility liquid along a "chemical channel": a long, straight, and
completely wetting stripe embedded in a planar substrate, and sandwiched
between two extended less wetting solid regions. Molecular dynamics
simulations, a simple long-wavelength approximation, and a full stability
analysis based on the Stokes equations are used, and give qualitatively
consistent results. While thin liquid ridges are stable both statically and
during flow, a (linear) pearling instability develops if the thickness of the
ridge exceeds half of the width of the channel. In the flowing case periodic
bulges propagate along the channel and subsequently merge due to nonlinear
effects. However, the ridge does not break up even when the flow is unstable,
and the qualitative behavior is unchanged even when the fluid can spill over
onto a partially wetting exterior solid region.
