Our interest goes to the power injected in a heated granular gas and to the
possibility to interpret it in terms of entropy flow. We numerically determine
the distribution of the injected power by means of Monte-Carlo simulations.
Then, we provide a kinetic theory approach to the computation of such a
distribution function. Finally, after showing why the injected power does not
satisfy a Fluctuation Relation a la Gallavotti-Cohen, we put forward a new
quantity which does fulfill such a relation, and is not only applicable in a
variety of frameworks outside the granular world, but also experimentally
accessible.
