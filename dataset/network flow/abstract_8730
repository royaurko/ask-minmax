A Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA) with the minimized dependence on the detector
geometry is presented. Current PFA implementation includes procedures of the
track reconstruction, calorimeter clustering, and individual particle
reconstruction and is meant as a tool for the optimization of the International
e+e- Linear Collider detector.
