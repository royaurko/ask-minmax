A \emph{uniform random intersection graph} $G(n,m,k)$ is a random graph
constructed as follows. Label each of $n$ nodes by a randomly chosen set of $k$
distinct colours taken from some finite set of possible colours of size $m$.
Nodes are joined by an edge if and only if some colour appears in both their
labels. These graphs arise in the study of the security of wireless sensor
networks. Such graphs arise in particular when modelling the network graph of
the well known key predistribution technique due to Eschenauer and Gligor.
  The paper determines the threshold for connectivity of the graph $G(n,m,k)$
when $n\to \infty$ with $k$ a function of $n$ such that $k\geq 2$ and
$m=\lfloor n^\alpha\rfloor$ for some fixed positive real number $\alpha$. In
this situation, $G(n,m,k)$ is almost surely connected when \[ \liminf
k^2n/m\log n>1, \] and $G(n,m,k)$ is almost surely disconnected when \[ \limsup
k^2n/m\log n<1. \]
