A novel Rateless-coding-assisted Multi-Packet Relaying (RMPR) protocol is
proposed for large-size data spreading in mobile wireless networks. With this
lightweight and robust protocol, the packet redundancy is reduced by a factor
of $\sqrt n$, while the spreading time is reduced at least by a factor of $\ln
(n)$. Closed-form bounds and explicit non-asymptotic results are presented,
which are further validated through simulations. Besides, the packet
duplication phenomenon in the network setting is analyzed for the first time.
