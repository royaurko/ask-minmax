The Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) specification in the IEEE
802.11e standard supports heterogeneous backoff parameters and arbitration
inter-frame space (AIFS), which makes a selfish node easy to manipulate these
parameters and misbehave. In this case, the network-wide fairness cannot be
achieved any longer. Many existing misbehavior detectors, primarily designed
for legacy IEEE 802.11 networks, become inapplicable in such a heterogeneous
network configuration. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time hybrid-share
(HS) misbehavior detector for IEEE 802.11e based wireless local area networks
(WLANs). The detector keeps updating its state based on every successful
transmission and makes detection decisions by comparing its state with a
threshold. We develop mathematical analysis of the detector performance in
terms of both false positive rate and average detection rate. Numerical results
show that the proposed detector can effectively detect both contention window
based and AIFS based misbehavior with only a short detection window.
