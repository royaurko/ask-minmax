In many social networks, several different link relations will exist between
the same set of users. Additionally, attribute or textual information will be
associated with those users, such as demographic details or user-generated
content. For many data analysis tasks, such as community finding and data
visualisation, the provision of multiple heterogeneous types of user data makes
the analysis process more complex. We propose an unsupervised method for
integrating multiple data views to produce a single unified graph
representation, based on the combination of the k-nearest neighbour sets for
users derived from each view. These views can be either relation-based or
feature-based. The proposed method is evaluated on a number of annotated
multi-view Twitter datasets, where it is shown to support the discovery of the
underlying community structure in the data.
