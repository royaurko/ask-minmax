In this paper we investigate the benefit of base station (BS) cooperation in
the uplink of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) networks. Our figure of merit is
the required BS density required to meet a chosen rate coverage. Our model
assumes a 2-D network of BSs on a regular hexagonal lattice in which path loss,
lognormal shadowing and Rayleigh fading affect the signal received from users.
Accurate closed-form expressions are first presented for the sum-rate coverage
probability and ergodic sum-rate at each point of the cooperation region. Then,
for a chosen quality of user rate, the required density of BS is derived based
on the minimum value of rate coverage probability in the cooperation region.
The approach guarantees that the achievable rate in the entire coverage region
is above a target rate with chosen probability. The formulation allows
comparison between different orders of BS cooperation, quantifying the reduced
required BS density from higher orders of cooperation.
