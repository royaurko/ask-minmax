Recently, it has been demonstrated that many large complex networks display a
scale-free feature, that is, their connectivity distributions have the
power-law form. In this paper, we investigate the synchronization phenomena in
a scale-free dynamical network. We show that its synchronizability is robust
against random removal of nodes, but is fragile to specific removal of the most
highly connected nodes.
