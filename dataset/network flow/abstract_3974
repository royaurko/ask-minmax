The theory of random graphs goes back to the late 1950s when Paul Erd\H{o}s
and Alfr\'ed R\'enyi introduced the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Since then
many models have been developed, and the study of random graph models has
become popular for real-life network modelling such as social networks and
financial networks. The aim of this overview is to review relevant random graph
models for real-life network modelling. Therefore, we analyse their properties
in terms of stylised facts of real-life networks.
