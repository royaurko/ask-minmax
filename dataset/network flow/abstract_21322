Abel-Tauberian theorems relate power law behavior of distributions and their
transforms. We formulate and prove a multivariate version for non-standard
regularly varying measures on $\mathbb{R}_+^p$ and then apply it to prove that
the joint distribution of in- and out-degree in a directed edge preferential
attachement model has jointly regularly varying tails.
