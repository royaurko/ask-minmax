I analyze packet routing on unidirectional ring networks, with an eye towards
establishing bounds on the expected length of the queues. Suppose we route
packets by a greedy "hot potato" protocol. If packets are inserted by a
Bernoulli process and have uniform destinations around the ring, and if the
nominal load is kept fixed, then I can construct an upper bound on the expected
queue length per node that is independent of the size of the ring. If the
packets only travel one or two steps, I can calculate the exact expected queue
length for rings of any size.
  I also show some stability results under more general circumstances. If the
packets are inserted by any ergodic hidden Markov process with nominal loads
less than one, and routed by any greedy protocol, I prove that the ring is
ergodic.
