A wireless relay network (WRN) has recently emerged as an effective way to
increase communication capacity and extend a coverage area with a low cost. In
the WRN, multiple service providers (SPs) can cooperate to share their
resources (e.g., relay nodes and spectrum), to achieve higher utility in terms
of revenue. Such cooperation can improve the capacity of the WRN, and thus
throughput for terminal devices (TDs). However, this cooperation can be
realized only if fair allocation of aggregated utility, which is the sum of the
utility of all the cooperative SPs, can be achieved. In this paper, we
investigate the WRN consisting of SPs at the upper layer and TDs at the lower
layer and present a game theoretic framework to address the cooperation
decision making problem in the WRN. Specifically, the cooperation of SPs is
modeled as an overlapping coalition formation game, in which SPs should form a
stable coalitional structure and obtain a fair share of the aggregated utility.
We also study the problem of allocating aggregated utility based on the concept
of Shapley value, which stabilizes the cooperation of SPs in the WRN. The
cooperation of TDs is modeled as a network formation game, in which TDs
establish links among each other to form a stable network structure. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed distributed algorithm obtains the
aggregated utility approximating the optimal solutions and achieves good
convergence speed.
