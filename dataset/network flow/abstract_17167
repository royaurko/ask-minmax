This paper addresses the challenge of establishing a bridge between deep
convolutional neural networks and conventional object detection frameworks for
accurate and efficient generic object detection. We introduce Dense Neural
Patterns, short for DNPs, which are dense local features derived from
discriminatively trained deep convolutional neural networks. DNPs can be easily
plugged into conventional detection frameworks in the same way as other dense
local features(like HOG or LBP). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated with the Regionlets object detection framework. It achieved 46.1%
mean average precision on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, and 44.1% on the PASCAL
VOC 2010 dataset, which dramatically improves the original Regionlets approach
without DNPs.
