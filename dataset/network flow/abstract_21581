A stationary stable solution of the Stokes equations for three identical
heavy solid spheres falling in a vertical plane is found. It has no analog in
the point-particle approximation. Three spheres aligned horizontally at equal
distances evolve towards the equilibrium relative configuration while the point
particles collapse onto a single point in a finite time.
