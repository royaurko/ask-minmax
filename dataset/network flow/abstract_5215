We encode the variation structure of a quasihomogeneous polynomial with an
isolated singularity as introduced by Nemethi in a set of spectral flows of the
signature operator on the Milnor bundle by varying global elliptic boundary
conditions in a specific way using the quasihomogeneous circle action on the
Brieskorn lattice. For this, we use adiabatic techniques and well-known results
on spectral flow and Maslov index. Furthermore we interpret the inequality of a
certain member of this family of spectral flows with a spectral flow induced by
a Reeb flow on the boundary of the Milnor fibre as giving a sufficient
condition for the 'symplectic monodromy' of the fibration to define an element
of infinite order in the relative symplectic isotopy group of the Milnor fibre,
this uses previous results of P. Seidel resp. of the contributor. We expect
generalizations of the results to wider classes of (algebraic) singularities.
