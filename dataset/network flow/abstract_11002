We study an intermittent random walk on a random network of scale-free degree
distribution. The walk is a combination of simple random walks of duration
$t_w$ and random long-range jumps. While the time the walker needs to cover all
the nodes increases with $t_w$, the corresponding time for the edges displays a
non monotonic behavior with a minimum for some nontrivial value of $t_w$. This
is a heterogeneity-induced effect that is not observed in homogeneous
small-world networks. The optimal $t_w$ increases with the degree of
assortativity in the network. Depending on the nature of degree correlations
and the elapsed time the walker finds an over/under-estimate of the degree
distribution exponent.
