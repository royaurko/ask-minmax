The success of new scientific areas can be assessed by their potential for
contributing to new theoretical approaches and in applications to real-world
problems. Complex networks have fared extremely well in both of these aspects,
with their sound theoretical basis developed over the years and with a variety
of applications. In this survey, we analyze the applications of complex
networks to real-world problems and data, with emphasis in representation,
analysis and modeling, after an introduction to the main concepts and models. A
diversity of phenomena are surveyed, which may be classified into no less than
22 areas, providing a clear indication of the impact of the field of complex
networks.
