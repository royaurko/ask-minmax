We propose that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal in the
sense that its functional form arises as a consequence of the statistics of
random supersonic flows.
  A model is developed for the origin of the stellar IMF, that contains a
dependence on the average physical parameters (temperature, density, velocity
dispersion) of the large scale site of star formation. The model is based on
recent numerical experiments of highly supersonic random flows that have a
strong observational counterpart.
  It is shown that a Miller-Scalo like IMF is naturally produced by the model
for the typical physical conditions in molecular clouds. A more ``massive'' IMF
in star bursts is also predicted.
