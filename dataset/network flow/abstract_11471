This paper outlines a comprehensive model to increase system efficiency,
preserve network bandwidth, monitor incoming and outgoing packets, ensure the
security of confidential files and reduce power wastage in an organization.
This model illustrates the use and potential application of a Network Analysis
Tool (NAT) in a multi-computer set-up of any scale. The model is designed to
run in the background and not hamper any currently executing applications,
while using minimum system resources. It was developed as open source software,
using VB. Net, with a view to overcoming limitations of legacy systems and
financial restrictions in small-to mid-level organizations like businesses and
educational institutes. It is fully-customizable and serves as a simple and
open-source alternative to existing software. The NAT relies on simple
client-server architecture and uses remote access to monitor and maintain the
computers on a network, for example logging off a user or shutting down a
computer after a certain "idle" time, enabling and disabling applications,
troubleshooting and so on. The NAT was tested in a laboratory and resultant
data is presented, along with the results of a survey that was conducted among
users.
