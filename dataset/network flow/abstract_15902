There is growing interest in multiplex networks where individual nodes take
part in several layers of networks simultaneously. This is the case for example
in social networks where each individual node has different kind of social ties
or transportation systems where each location is connected to another location
by different types of transport. Many of these multiplex are characterized by a
significant overlap of the links in different layers. In this paper we
introduce a statistical mechanics framework to describe multiplex ensembles. A
multiplex is a system formed by N nodes and M layers of interactions where each
node belongs to the M layers at the same time. Each layer $\alpha$ is formed by
a network $G^{\alpha}$. Here we introduce the concept of correlated multiplex
ensembles in which the existence of a link in one layer is correlated with the
existence of a link in another layer. This implies that a typical multiplex of
the ensemble can have a significant overlap of the links in the different
layers. Moreover we characterize microcanonical and canonical multiplex
ensembles satisfying respectively hard and soft constraints and we discuss how
to construct multiplex in these ensembles. Finally we provide the expression
for the entropy of these ensembles that can be useful to address different
inference problems involving multiplexes.
