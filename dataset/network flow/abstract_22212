We construct Morse-Smale-Witten complex for an effective orientable orbifold.
For a global quotient orbifold, we also construct a Morse-Bott complex. We show
that certain type of critical points of a Morse function has to be discarded to
construct such a complex, and gradient flows should be counted with suitable
weights. The homology of these complexes are shown to be isomorphic to the
singular homology of the quotient spaces under the self-indexing assumptions.
