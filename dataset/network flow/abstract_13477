We probe the relation between shear induced structural relaxation and
rheology in experiments on sheared two-dimensional foams. The relaxation time,
which marks the crossover to diffusive bubble motion, is found to scale
non-trivially with the local strain rate. The rheology of the foam is shown to
be intimately linked to the scaling of the relaxation time, thus connecting
macroscopic flow and microscopic bubble motion.
