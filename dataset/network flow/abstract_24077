In this paper, iterative multi-user detection techniques for multi-beam
communications are presented. The solutions are based on a successive
interference cancellation architecture and a channel decoding to treat the
co-channel interference. Beams forming and channels coefficients are estimated
and updated iteratively. A developed technique of signals combining allows
power improvement of the useful received signal; and then reduction of the bit
error rates with low signal to noise ratios. The approach is applied to a
synchronous multi-beam satellite link under an additive white Gaussian channel.
Evaluation of the techniques is done with computer simulations, where a noised
and multi-access environment is considered. The simulations results show the
good performance of the proposed solutions.
