We present measurements of a transmission-line network, designed for cloaking
applications in the microwave region. The network is used for channelling
microwave energy through an electrically dense array of metal objects, which is
basically impenetrable to the impinging electromagnetic radiation. With the
designed transmission-line network the waves emitted by a source placed in an
air-filled waveguide, are coupled into the network and guided through the array
of metallic objects. Our goal is to illustrate the simple manufacturing,
assembly, and the general feasibility of these types of cloaking devices.
