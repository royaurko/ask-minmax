We study the spectral problems for the spatially periodic flows of inviscid
incompressible fluid. The basic flows under consideration are the shear flows
whose profiles oscillate on high frequencies. For such flows, we present
asymptotic expansions of the unstable eigenvalues in the case when the limit
spectral problem has multiple eigenvalues.
