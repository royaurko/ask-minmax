Due to the increasing heterogeneity and deployment density of emerging
cellular networks, new flexible and scalable approaches for their modeling,
simulation, analysis and optimization are needed. Recently, a new approach has
been proposed: it is based on the theory of point processes and it leverages
tools from stochastic geometry for tractable system-level modeling, performance
evaluation and optimization. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of this
emerging abstraction for modeling cellular networks, by explicitly taking
realistic base station locations, building footprints, spatial blockages and
antenna radiation patterns into account. More specifically, the base station
locations and the building footprints are taken from two publicly available
databases from the United Kingdom. Our study confirms that the abstraction
model based on stochastic geometry is capable of accurately modeling the
communication performance of cellular networks in dense urban environments.
