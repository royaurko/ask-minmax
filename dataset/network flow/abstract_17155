Two characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities are given for eight
variables. Specifically, the first inequality holds for all finite fields whose
characteristic is not three and does not in general hold over characteristic
three. The second inequality holds for all finite fields whose characteristic
is three and does not in general hold over characteristics other than three.
Applications of these inequalities to the computation of capacity upper bounds
in network coding are demonstrated.
