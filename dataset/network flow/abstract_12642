We introduce a new kind of Information Theory. From a finite number of local,
noisy comparisons, we want to design a robust filter such that the outcome is a
high ranking number, Both analytical and numerical results are encouraging and
we believe our toy model has wide ranging implications in the future
Internet-based information selection mechanism.
