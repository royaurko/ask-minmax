We introduce a kinetic model of coarsening of transient polymer networks
during the intermediate stages of phase separation in polymer systems. The
model explicitly takes into account the effect of the connectivity of polymer
chains. We show that during the intermediate stages the size of the droplet
grows according to an unusual coarsening law $R \sim t^{1/(d + 3)}$. When the
network structure breaks up, the coarsening law may cross over to $R \sim \ln
t^{-1}$, until only at very late stages the Lifshitz-Slyozov coarsening law $R
\sim t^{1/3}$ is recovered.
