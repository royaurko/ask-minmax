Can a graph specifying the pattern of connections of a dynamical network be
reconstructed from statistical properties of a signal generated by such a
system? In this model study, we present an evolutionary algorithm for
reconstruction of graphs from their Laplacian spectra. Through a stochastic
process of mutations and selection, evolving test networks converge to a
reference graph. Applying the method to several examples of random graphs,
clustered graphs, and small-world networks, we show that the proposed
stochastic evolution allows exact reconstruction of relatively small networks
and yields good approximations in the case of large sizes.
