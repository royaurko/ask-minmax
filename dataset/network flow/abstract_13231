The impulse response function (IRF) of a localized bolus in cerebral blood
flow codes important information on the tissue type. It is indirectly
accessible both from MR- and CT-imaging methods, at least in principle. In
practice, however, noise and limited signal resolution render standard
deconvolution techniques almost useless. Parametric signal descriptions look
more promising, and it is the aim of this contribution to develop some
improvements along this line.
