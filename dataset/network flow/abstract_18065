The security of neural cryptography is investigated. A key-exchange protocol
over a public channel is studied where the parties exchanging secret messages
use multilayer neural networks which are trained by their mutual output bits
and synchronize to a time dependent secret key. The weights of the networks
have integer values between $\pm L$. Recently an algorithm for an eavesdropper
which could break the key was introduced by Shamir et al. [adi]. We show that
the synchronization time increases with $L^2$ while the probability to find a
successful attacker decreases exponentially with $L$. Hence for large $L$ we
find a secure key-exchange protocol which depends neither on number theory nor
on injective trapdoor functions used in conventional cryptography.
