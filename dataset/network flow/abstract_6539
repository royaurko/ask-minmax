As social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are becoming
increasingly popular, a growing number of malicious attacks, such as phishing
and malware, are exploiting them. Among these attacks, social botnets have
sophisticated infrastructure that leverages compromised users accounts, known
as bots, to automate the creation of new social networking accounts for
spamming and malware propagation. Traditional defense mechanisms are often
passive and reactive to non-zero-day attacks. In this paper, we adopt a
proactive approach for enhancing security in social networks by infiltrating
botnets with honeybots. We propose an integrated system named SODEXO which can
be interfaced with social networking sites for creating deceptive honeybots and
leveraging them for gaining information from botnets. We establish a
Stackelberg game framework to capture strategic interactions between honeybots
and botnets, and use quantitative methods to understand the tradeoffs of
honeybots for their deployment and exploitation in social networks. We design a
protection and alert system that integrates both microscopic and macroscopic
models of honeybots and optimally determines the security strategies for
honeybots. We corroborate the proposed mechanism with extensive simulations and
comparisons with passive defenses.
