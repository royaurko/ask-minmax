In this paper, we investigate the magnetohydrodynamic viscous flow with
second order slip flow model over a permeable shrinking surface. We have
obtained the closed form of exact solution of Navier-Stokes equations by using
similarity variable technique. The effects of slip, suction and magnetic
parameter have been investigated in detail. The results show that there are two
solution branches, namely lower and upper solution branch. The behavior of
velocity and shear stress profiles for different values of slip, suction and
magnetic parameters has been discussed through graphs.
