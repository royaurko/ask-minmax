Underwater communication is a challenging topic due to its singular channel
characteristics. Most protocols used in terrestrial wireless communication can
not be directly applied in the underwater world. In this paper, we focus on the
issue of energy efficient transmission in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs)
and analyze this problem in a rigorous and theoretical way. We formalize an
optimization problem which aims to minimize energy consumption and
simultaneously accounts for other performance metrics such as the data
reliability and the communication delay. With the help of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
conditions (KKT conditions), we derive a simple and explicit, but nevertheless
accurate, approximate solution under reasonable assumptions. This approximate
solution provides theoretical guidelines for designing durable and reliable
UWSNs. Our result also shows that reliability and communication delay are
crucial factors to the energy consumption for transmission.
