Multi-layered social networks consist of the fixed set of nodes linked by
multiple connections. These connections may be derived from different types of
user activities logged in the IT system. To calculate any structural measures
for multi-layered networks this multitude of relations should be coped with in
the parameterized way. Two separate algorithms for evaluation of shortest paths
in the multi-layered social network are proposed in the paper. The first one is
based on pre-processing - aggregation of multiple links into single
multi-layered edges, whereas in the second approach, many edges are processed
'on the fly' in the middle of path discovery. Experimental studies carried out
on the DBLP database converted into the multi-layered social network are
presented as well.
