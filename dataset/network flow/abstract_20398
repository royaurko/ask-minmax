We report current-induced domain wall motion (CIDWM) in Ta\Co20Fe60B20\MgO
nanowires. Domain walls are observed to move against the electron flow when no
magnetic field is applied, while a field along the nanowires strongly affects
the domain wall motion direction and velocity. A symmetric effect is observed
for up-down and down-up domain walls. This indicates the presence of
right-handed domain walls, due to a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
with a DMI coefficient D=+0.06 mJ/m2. The positive DMI coefficient is
interpreted to be a consequence of boron diffusion into the tantalum buffer
layer during annealing. In a Pt\Co68Fe22B10\MgO nanowire CIDWM along the
electron flow was observed, corroborating this interpretation. The experimental
results are compared to 1D-model simulations including the effects of pinning.
This advanced modelling allows us to reproduce the experiment outcomes and
reliably extract a spin-Hall angle {\theta}SH=-0.11 for Ta in the nanowires,
showing the importance of an analysis that goes beyond the currently used model
for perfect nanowires.
