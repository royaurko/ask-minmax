Using the large acceptance apparatus FOPI, we study pion emission in the
reactions (energies in GeV/nucleon are given in parentheses): 40Ca+40Ca (0.4,
0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 1.93), 96Ru+96Ru (0.4, 1.0, 1.5), 96Zr+96Zr (0.4, 1.0,
1.5), 197Au+197Au (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5). The observables include
longitudinal and transverse rapidity distributions and stopping, polar
anisotropies, pion multiplicities, transverse momentum spectra, ratios for
positively and negatively charged pions of average transverse momenta and of
yields, directed flow, elliptic flow. The data are compared to earlier data
where possible and to transport model simulations.
