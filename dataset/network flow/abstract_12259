k-core percolation is an extension of the concept of classical percolation
and is particularly relevant to understand the resilience of complex networks
under random damage. A new analytical formalism has been recently proposed to
deal with heterogeneous k-cores, where each vertex is assigned a local
threshold k_i. In this paper we identify a binary mixture of heterogeneous
k-core which exhibits a tricritical point. We investigate the new scaling
scenario and calculate the relevant critical exponents, by analytical and
computational methods, for Erdos-Renyi networks and 2d square lattices.
