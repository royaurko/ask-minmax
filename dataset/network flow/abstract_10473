We study the high-power asymptotic behavior of the sum-rate capacity of
multi-user interference networks with an equal number of transmitters and
receivers. We assume that each transmitter is cognizant of the message it
wishes to convey to its corresponding receiver and also of the messages that a
subset of the other transmitters wish to send. The receivers are assumed not to
be able to cooperate in any way so that they must base their decision on the
signal they receive only. We focus on the network's pre-log, which is defined
as the limiting ratio of the sum-rate capacity to half the logarithm of the
transmitted power. We present both upper and lower bounds on the network's
pre-log. The lower bounds are based on a linear partial-cancellation scheme
which entails linearly transforming Gaussian codebooks so as to eliminate the
interference in a subset of the receivers. Inter alias, the bounds give a
complete characterization of the networks and side-information settings that
result in a full pre-log, i.e., in a pre-log that is equal to the number of
transmitters (and receivers) as well as a complete characterization of networks
whose pre-log is equal to the full pre-log minus one. They also fully
characterize networks where the full pre-log can only be achieved if each
transmitter knows the messages of all users, i.e., when the side-information is
"full".
