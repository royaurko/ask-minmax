An integral quantity is presented that relates the wake of a body in
nominally two-dimensional flow to its drag, for Reynolds numbers ranging from
9,000 to 144,000. It is defined as the ratio of the kinetic energy to the
vorticity in the fluid boundary and, for the special case of laminar flow, is
proportional to the angular momentum in the wake bubble. The new quantity is
useful for correlating drag data for circular and rectangular cylinders,
wedges, v-gutters, and normal flat plates with and without splitter plates. The
correlation indicates that the drag force is proportional to the flow speed and
the mass flow rate stored in the boundary of the fluid, where the fluid
boundary is defined so as to include the wake bubble. Order-of-magnitude
arguments indicate that, absent any quantization of vortex size, this mass flow
rate, and hence the drag force, can become unbounded as the vortices contained
in the wake becomes finer.
