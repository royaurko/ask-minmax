One of the major impacts of climatic changes is due to destroying of forest.
Destroying of forest takes place in many ways but the majority of the forest is
destroyed due to wild forest fires. In this paper we have presented a path
planning algorithm for extinguishing fires which uses Wireless Sensor and Actor
Networks (WSANs) for detecting fires. Since most of the works on forest fires
are based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and a collection of work has been
done on coverage, message transmission, deployment of nodes, battery power
depletion of sensor nodes in WSNs we focused our work in path planning approach
of the Actor to move to the target area where the fire has occurred and
extinguish it. An incremental approach is presented in order to determine the
successive moves of the Actor to extinguish fire in an environment with and
without obstacles. This is done by comparing the moves determined with target
location readings obtained using sensors until the Actor reaches the target
area to extinguish fires.
