In 802.11 wireless infrastructure networks, as the mobile node moves from one
access point to another, the active connections will not be badly dropped if
the handoff is smooth and if there are sufficient resources reserved in the
target access point. In a 5x5 grid of access points, within a 6x6 grid of
regions, by location tracking and data mining, we predict the mobility pattern
of mobile node with good accuracy. The pre-scanning of mobile nodes, along with
pre-authenticating neighbouring access points and pre-reassociation is used to
reduce the scan delay, authentication delay and re-association delay
respectively. The model implements first stage reservation by using prediction
results and does second stage reservation based on the packet content type, so
that sufficient resources can be reserved when the mobile node does the handoff
to the next access point. The overall mobility management scheme thus reduces
the handoff delay. The performance simulations are done to verify the proposed
model.
