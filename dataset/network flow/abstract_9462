In this paper, I illustrate the importance of both dynamics and network
constraints in the group formation process. I introduce a class of games called
sequential group formation games, in which players make their group membership
decisions sequentially over time, and show that the dynamics act as an
equilibrium refinement. However, the resulting equilibrium is highly
suboptimal--groups tend to be much too large, relative to the social optimum. I
then introduce a network constraint, which limits a player's action set to
those groups that she is connected to on an exogenous network. The network
constraint mitigates the tendency for groups to get too large and social
welfare is higher when the network is sparse and highly ordered. This result
has the surprising implication that informational, institutional, and
geographic barriers to group membership may actually improve social welfare by
restricting groups from becoming too large.
