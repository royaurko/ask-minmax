We use dynamics of the Teichm$\ddot{\mathrm{u}}$ller geodesic flow to show
that the action of the mapping class group on the space of projective measured
foliations has stable type $III_{\lambda}$ for some $\lambda>0$. We do this by
generalizing a criterion due to Bowen for a number to be in the stable ratio
set, and proving some Patterson-Sullivan type results for the Thurston measure
on $PMF$.
