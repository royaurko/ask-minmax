Neural network models of real-world systems, such as industrial processes,
made from sensor data must often rely on incomplete data. System states may not
all be known, sensor data may be biased or noisy, and it is not often known
which sensor data may be useful for predictive modelling. Genetic algorithms
may be used to help to address this problem by determining the near optimal
subset of sensor variables most appropriate to produce good models. This paper
describes the use of genetic search to optimize variable selection to determine
inputs into the neural network model. We discuss genetic algorithm
implementation issues including data representation types and genetic operators
such as crossover and mutation. We present the use of this technique for neural
network modelling of a typical industrial application, a liquid fed ceramic
melter, and detail the results of the genetic search to optimize the neural
network model for this application.
