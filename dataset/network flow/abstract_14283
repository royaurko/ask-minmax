Traditional models of wormlike chains in shear flows at finite temperature
approximate the equation of motion via finite difference discretization (bead
and rod models). We introduce here a new method based on a spectral
representation in terms of the natural eigenfunctions. This formulation
separates tumbling and bending dynamics, clearly showing their interrelation,
naturally orders the bending dynamics according to the characteristic decay
rate of its modes, and displays coupling among bending modes in a general flow.
This hierarchy naturally yields a low dimensional stochastic dynamical system
which recovers and extends previous numerical results and which leads to a fast
and efficient numerical method for studying the stochastic nonlinear dynamics
of semiflexible polymers in general flows. This formulation will be useful for
studying other physical systems described by constrained stochastic partial
differential equations.
