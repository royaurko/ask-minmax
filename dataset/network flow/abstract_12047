We investigate equilibrium properties of small world networks, in which both
connectivity and spin variables are dynamic, using replicated transfer matrices
within the replica symmetric approximation. Population dynamics techniques
allow us to examine order parameters of our system at total equilibrium,
probing both spin- and graph-statistics. Of these, interestingly, the degree
distribution is found to acquire a Poisson-like form (both within and outside
the ordered phase). Comparison with Glauber simulations confirms our results
satisfactorily.
