Measuring the topological overlap of two graphs becomes important when
assessing the changes between temporally adjacent graphs in a time-evolving
network. Current methods depend on the fraction of nodes that have persisting
edges. This breaks down when there are nodes with no edges, persisting or
otherwise. The following outlines a proposed correction to ensure that
correlation metrics have the expected behavior.
