Networks are mathematical structures that are universally used to describe a
large variety of complex systems such as the brain or the Internet.
Characterizing the geometrical properties of these networks has become
increasingly relevant for routing problems, inference and data mining. In real
growing networks, topological, structural and geometrical properties emerge
spontaneously from their dynamical rules. Nevertheless we still miss a model in
which networks develop an emergent complex geometry. Here we show that a single
two parameter network model, the growing geometrical network, can generate
complex network geometries with non-trivial distribution of curvatures,
combining exponential growth and small-world properties with finite spectral
dimensionality. In one limit, the non-equilibrium dynamical rules of these
networks can generate scale-free networks with clustering and communities, in
another limit planar random geometries with non-trivial modularity. Finally we
find that these properties of the geometrical growing networks are present in a
large set of real networks describing biological, social and technological
systems.
