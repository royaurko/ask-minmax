We propose the object-oriented networking (OON) framework, for meeting the
generalized interconnection, mobility and technology integration requirements
underlining the Internet. In OON, the various objects that need to be accessed
through the Internet (content, smart things, services, people, etc.) are viewed
as network layer resources, rather than as application layer resources as in
the IP communications model. By abstracting them as computing objects -with
attributes and methods- they are identified by expressive, discoverable names,
while data are exchanged between them in the context of their methods, based on
suitably defined system-specific names. An OON-enabled Internet is not only a
global data delivery medium but also a universal object discovery and service
development platform; service-level interactions can be realized through native
network means, without requiring standardized protocols. OON can be realized
through existing software-defined networking or network functions
virtualization technologies and it can be deployed in an incremental fashion.
