We study online scheduling problems on a single processor that can be viewed
as extensions of the well-studied problem of minimizing total weighted flow
time. In particular, we provide a framework of analysis that is derived by
duality properties, does not rely on potential functions and is applicable to a
variety of scheduling problems. A key ingredient in our approach is bypassing
the need for "black-box" rounding of fractional solutions, which yields
improved competitive ratios.
  We begin with an interpretation of Highest-Density-First (HDF) as a
primal-dual algorithm, and a corresponding proof that HDF is optimal for total
fractional weighted flow time (and thus scalable for the integral objective).
Building upon the salient ideas of the proof, we show how to apply and extend
this analysis to the more general problem of minimizing $\sum_j w_j g(F_j)$,
where $w_j$ is the job weight, $F_j$ is the flow time and $g$ is a
non-decreasing cost function. Among other results, we present improved
competitive ratios for the setting in which $g$ is a concave function, and the
setting of same-density jobs but general cost functions. We further apply our
framework of analysis to online weighted completion time with general cost
functions as well as scheduling under polyhedral constraints.
