The elliptic flow of Lambda hyperons has been measured by the NA49 experiment
in semi-central Pb+Pb collisions at 158 AGeV. The standard method of
correlating particles with an event plane has been used. Measurements of v2
near mid-rapidity are reported as a function of rapidity, centrality and
transverse momentum. Elliptic flow of Lambda particles increases both with the
impact parameter and with the transverse momentum. It is compared with v2 for
pions and protons as well as with models predictions.
