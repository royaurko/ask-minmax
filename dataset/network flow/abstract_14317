We discuss the predictions of perturbative QCD for angular flows of final
state particles in two and three jet events including their cms energy and jet
resolution (y_{cut}) dependence. The simple analytical formulae for gluon
bremsstrahlung from primary partons, modified for gluon cascading, reproduce
the main features of the experimental data well. For y_{cut}-selected events,
the particle flow is derived from a superposition of colour dipoles in much the
same way that photon radiation is derived from electric dipoles.
