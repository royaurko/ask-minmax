Although system administrators are frequently urged to protect the machines
in their network, the fact remains that the decision to protect is far from
universal. To better understand this decision, we formulate a
decision-theoretic model of a system administrator responsible for a network of
size n against an attacker attempting to penetrate the network and infect the
machines with a virus or similar exploit. By analyzing the model we are able to
demonstrate the cost sensitivity of smaller networks as well as identify
tipping points that can lead the administrator to switch away from the decision
to protect.
