Name-oriented networks introduce the vision of an information-centric,
secure, globally available publish-subscribe infrastructure. Current approaches
concentrate on unicast-based pull mechanisms and thereby fall short in
automatically updating content at receivers. In this paper, we argue that an
inclusion of multicast will grant additional benefits to the network layer,
namely efficient distribution of real-time data, a many-to-many communication
model, and simplified rendezvous processes. These aspects are comprehensively
reflected by a group-oriented naming concept that integrates the various
available group schemes and introduces new use cases. A first draft of this
name-oriented multicast access has been implemented in the HAMcast middleware.
