Networks of Kuramoto oscillators with a positive correlation between the
oscillators frequencies and the degree of the their corresponding vertices
exhibits the so-called explosive synchronization behavior, which is now under
intensive investigation. Here, we study and report explosive synchronization in
a situation that has not yet been considered, namely when only a part,
typically small, of the vertices is subjected to a degree frequency
correlation. Our results show that in order to have explosive synchronization,
it suffices to have degree-frequency correlations only for the hubs, the
vertices with the highest degrees. Moreover, we show that a partial
degree-frequency correlation does not only promotes but also allows explosive
synchronization to happen in networks for which a full degree-frequency
correlation would not allow it. We perform exhaustive numerical experiments for
synthetic networks and also for the undirected and unweighted version of the
neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The latter is an explicit
example where partial degree-frequency correlation leads to explosive
synchronization with hysteresis, in contrast with the fully correlated case,
for which no explosive synchronization is observed.
