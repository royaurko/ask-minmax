In a wireless network, mobile nodes (MNs) repeatedly perform tasks such as
layer 2 (L2) handoff, layer 3 (L3) handoff and authentication. These tasks are
critical, particularly for real-time applications such as VoIP. We propose a
novel approach, namely Cooperative Roaming (CR), in which MNs can collaborate
with each other and share useful information about the network in which they
move. We show how we can achieve seamless L2 and L3 handoffs regardless of the
authentication mechanism used and without any changes to either the
infrastructure or the protocol. In particular, we provide a working
implementation of CR and show how, with CR, MNs can achieve a total L2+L3
handoff time of less than 16 ms in an open network and of about 21 ms in an
IEEE 802.11i network. We consider behaviors typical of IEEE 802.11 networks,
although many of the concepts and problems addressed here apply to any kind of
mobile network.
