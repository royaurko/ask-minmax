In this letter, we demonstrate that oscillations and excitable behavior can
be imparted to a chemical network by coupling the network to an active
hydrogel. We discuss two mechanisms by which the mechanical response of the gel
to the embedded chemical reactant provides feedback into the chemistry. These
feedback mechanisms can be applied to control existing chemical oscillations as
well as create new oscillations under some conditions. We analyze two model
systems to demonstrate these two effects, respectively: a theoretical system
that exhibits no excitability in the absence of a gel, and the Oregonator model
of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction in which the metal catalyst is
intercalated into the polymer network. This work can aid in designing new
materials that harness these feedbacks to create, control, and stabilize
oscillatory and excitable chemical behavior in both oscillatory and
non-oscillatory chemical networks.
