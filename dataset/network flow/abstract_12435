In the algebraic view, the solution to a network coding problem is seen as a
variety specified by a system of polynomial equations typically derived by
using edge-to-edge gains as variables. The output from each sink is equated to
its demand to obtain polynomial equations. In this work, we propose a method to
derive the polynomial equations using source-to-sink path gains as the
variables. In the path gain formulation, we show that linear and quadratic
equations suffice; therefore, network coding becomes equivalent to a system of
polynomial equations of maximum degree 2. We present algorithms for generating
the equations in the path gains and for converting path gain solutions to
edge-to-edge gain solutions. Because of the low degree, simplification is
readily possible for the system of equations obtained using path gains. Using
small-sized network coding problems, we show that the path gain approach
results in simpler equations and determines solvability of the problem in
certain cases. On a larger network (with 87 nodes and 161 edges), we show how
the path gain approach continues to provide deterministic solutions to some
network coding problems.
