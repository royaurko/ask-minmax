When external stresses in a system - physical, social or virtual - are
relieved through impulsive events, it is natural to focus on the attributes of
these avalanches. However, during the quiescent periods in between, stresses
may be relieved through competing processes, such as slowly flowing water
between earthquakes or thermally activated dislocation flow between plastic
bursts. Such unassuming, smooth responses can have dramatic effects on the
avalanche properties. Here we report a thorough experimental investigation of
slowly compressed Ni microcrystals, covering three orders of magnitude in
nominal strain rate, that exhibits unconventional quasi-periodic avalanche
bursts and higher critical exponents as the strain rate is decreased. Our
analytic and computational study naturally extends dislocation avalanche
modeling to incorporate dislocation relaxations and reveals the emergence of
the self-organized avalanche oscillator, a novel critical state exhibiting
oscillatory approaches toward a depinning critical point. We demonstrate that
the predictions of our theory are faithfully exhibited in our experiments.
