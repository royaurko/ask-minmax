The existence of reduced scalability and delivery leads to the development of
scalable routing by contact information compression. The previous work dealt
with the result of consistent analysis in the performance of DTN hierarchical
routing (DHR). It increases as the source to destination distance increases
with decreases in the routing performance. This paper focuses on improving the
scalability and delivery through contact information compression algorithm and
also addresses the problem of power awareness routing to increase the lifetime
of the overall network. Thus implementing the contact information compression
(CIC) algorithm the estimated shortest path (ESP) is detected dynamically. The
scalability and release are more improved during multipath multicasting, which
delivers the information to a collection of target concurrently in a single
transmission from the source
