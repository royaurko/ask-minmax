Spatially constrained planar networks are frequently encountered in real-life
systems. In this paper, based on a space-filling disk packing we propose a
minimal model for spatial maximal planar networks, which is similar to but
different from the model for Apollonian networks [J. S. Andrade, Jr. et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 94}, 018702 (2005)]. We present an exhaustive analysis of
various properties of our model, and obtain the analytic solutions for most of
the features, including degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average
path length, and degree correlations. The model recovers some striking generic
characteristics observed in most real networks. To address the robustness of
the relevant network properties, we compare the structural features between the
investigated network and the Apollonian networks. We show that topological
properties of the two networks are encoded in the way of disk packing. We argue
that spatial constrains of nodes are relevant to the structure of the networks.
