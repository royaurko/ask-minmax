We report a bi-polar multiple periodic negative differential conductance
(NDC) effect on a single cage-shaped Ru nanoparticle measured using scanning
tunneling spectroscopy. This phenomenon is assigned to the unique
multiply-connected cage architecture providing two (or more) defined routes for
charge flow through the cage. This, in turn, promotes a self- gating effect,
where electron charging of one route affects charge transport along a
neighboring channel, yielding a series of periodic NDC peaks. This picture is
established and analyzed here by a theoretical model.
