Selection comparator networks have been studied for many years. Recently,
they have been successfully applied to encode cardinality constraints for
SAT-solvers. To decrease the size of generated formula there is a need for
constructions of selection networks that can be efficiently generated and
produce networks of small sizes for the practical range of their two
parameters: n - the number of inputs (boolean variables) and k - the number of
selected items (a cardinality bound). In this paper we give and analyze a new
construction of smaller selection networks that are based on the pairwise
selection networks introduced by Codish and Zanon-Ivry. We prove also that
standard encodings of cardinality constraints with selection networks preserve
arc-consistency.
