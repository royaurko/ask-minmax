In this paper we present Deep Secure Encoding: a framework for secure
classification using deep neural networks, and apply it to the task of
biometric template protection for faces. Using deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), we learn a robust mapping of face classes to high entropy
secure codes. These secure codes are then hashed using standard hash functions
like SHA-256 to generate secure face templates. The efficacy of the approach is
shown on two face databases, namely, CMU-PIE and Extended Yale B, where we
achieve state of the art matching performance, along with cancelability and
high security with no unrealistic assumptions. Furthermore, the scheme can work
in both identification and verification modes.
