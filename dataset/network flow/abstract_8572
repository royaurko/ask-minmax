This paper considers some designs for sampling and interventions in dynamic
networks and spatial temporal settings. The sample spreads through the
population largely by tracing network links, although random sampling or
spatial designs may be used in addition. To investigate the effectiveness of
different designs for finding units on which to make observations and introduce
interventions is investigated through simulations. For this purpose a dynamic
spatial network model is developed based on simple stochastic processes. The
sampling processes considered have both acquisition processes and attrition
process by which units are added and removed from the sample. The effect of an
intervention introduced with a given sampling design is assessed by the change
in the resulting equilibrium distribution or, in more detail, by the
distribution of sample paths resulting from the intervention strategy.
