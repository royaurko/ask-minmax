We compare in this paper several feature selection methods for the Naive
Bayes Classifier (NBC) when the data under study are described by a large
number of redundant binary indicators. Wrapper approaches guided by the NBC
estimation of the classification error probability out-perform filter
approaches while retaining a reasonable computational cost.
