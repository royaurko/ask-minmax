We propose a model for growing networks based on a finite memory of the
nodes. The model shows stylized features of real-world networks: power law
distribution of degree, linear preferential attachment of new links and a
negative correlation between the age of a node and its link attachment rate.
Notably, the degree distribution is conserved even though only the most
recently grown part of the network is considered. This feature is relevant
because real-world networks truncated in the same way exhibit a power-law
distribution in the degree. As the network grows, the clustering reaches an
asymptotic value larger than for regular lattices of the same average
connectivity. These high-clustering scale-free networks indicate that memory
effects could be crucial for a correct description of the dynamics of growing
networks.
