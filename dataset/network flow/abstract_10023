The study of vesicles under flow, a model system for red blood cells (RBCs),
is an essential step in understanding various intricate dynamics exhibited by
RBCs in vivo and in vitro. Quantitative 3D analyses of vesicles under flow are
presented. The regions of parameters to produce tumbling (TB), tank-treating
(TT), vacillating-breathing (VB) {and even Kayaking (K)} modes are determined.
New qualitative features are found: (i) a significant widening of the VB mode
region in parameter space upon increasing shear rate $\dot\gamma$ and (ii) a
striking robustness of period of TB and VB with $\dot\gamma$. Analytical
support is also provided. These findings shed new light on the dynamics of
blood flow.
