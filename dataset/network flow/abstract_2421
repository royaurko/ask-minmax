Conventional computer electronics creates a dichotomy between how information
is processed and how it is stored. Silicon chips process information by
controlling the flow of charge through a network of logic gates. This
information is then stored, most commonly, by encoding it in the orientation of
magnetic domains of a computer hard disk. The key obstacle to a more intimate
integration of magnetic materials into devices and circuit processing
information is a lack of efficient means to control their magnetization. This
is usually achieved with an external magnetic field or by the injection of
spin-polarized currents. The latter can be significantly enhanced in materials
whose ferromagnetic properties are mediated by charge carriers. Among these
materials, conductors lacking spatial inversion symmetry couple charge currents
to spin by intrinsic spin-orbit (SO) interactions, inducing nonequilibrium spin
polarization tunable by local electric fields. Here we show that magnetization
of a ferromagnet can be reversibly manipulated by the SO-induced polarization
of carrier spins generated by unpolarized currents. Specifically, we
demonstrate domain rotation and hysteretic switching of magnetization between
two orthogonal easy axes in a model ferromagnetic semiconductor.
