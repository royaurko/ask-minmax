Ad-hoc networks, a promising trend in wireless technology, fail to work
properly in a global setting. In most cases, self-organization and cost-free
local communication cannot compensate the need for being connected, gathering
urgent information just-in-time. Equipping mobile devices additionally with GSM
or UMTS adapters in order to communicate with arbitrary remote devices or even
a fixed network infrastructure provides an opportunity. Devices that operate as
intermediate nodes between the ad-hoc network and a reliable backbone network
are potential injection points. They allow disseminating received information
within the local neighborhood. The effectiveness of different devices to serve
as injection point differs substantially. For practical reasons the
determination of injection points should be done locally, within the ad-hoc
network partitions. We analyze different localized algorithms using at most
2-hop neighboring information. Results show that devices selected this way
spread information more efficiently through the ad-hoc network. Our results can
also be applied in order to support the election process for clusterheads in
the field of clustering mechanisms.
