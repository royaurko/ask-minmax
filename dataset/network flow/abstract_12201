In this paper we explore a connection between two seemingly different
problems from two different domains: the small-set expansion problem studied in
unique games conjecture, and a popular community finding approach for social
networks known as the modularity clustering approach. We show that a
sub-exponential time algorithm for the small-set expansion problem leads to a
sub-exponential time constant factor approximation for some hard input
instances of the modularity clustering problem.
