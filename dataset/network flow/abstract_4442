Quantification is well known to be a major obstacle in the construction of a
probabilistic network, especially when relying on human experts for this
purpose. The construction of a qualitative probabilistic network has been
proposed as an initial step in a network s quantification, since the
qualitative network can be used TO gain preliminary insight IN the projected
networks reasoning behaviour. We extend on this idea and present a new type of
network in which both signs and numbers are specified; we further present an
associated algorithm for probabilistic inference. Building upon these
semi-qualitative networks, a probabilistic network can be quantified and
studied in a stepwise manner. As a result, modelling inadequacies can be
detected and amended at an early stage in the quantification process.
