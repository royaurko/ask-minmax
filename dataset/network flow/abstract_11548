Memristive systems, namely resistive systems with memory, are attracting
considerable attention due to their ubiquity in several phenomena and
technological applications. Here, we show that even the simplest
one-dimensional network formed by the most common memristive elements with
voltage threshold bears non-trivial physical properties. In particular, by
taking into account the single element variability we find i) dynamical
acceleration and slowing down of the total resistance in adiabatic processes,
ii) dependence of the final state on the history of the input signal with same
initial conditions, iii) existence of switching avalanches in memristive
ladders, and iv) independence of the dynamics voltage threshold with respect to
the number of memristive elements in the network (scale invariance). An
important criterion for this scale invariance is the presence of memristive
systems with very small threshold voltages in the ensemble. These results
elucidate the role of memory in complex networks and are relevant to
technological applications of these systems.
