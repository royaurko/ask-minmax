We present an extension of the multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics
(MRxMHD) equilibrium model that includes plasma flow. This new model is a
generalization of Woltjer's model of relaxed magnetohydrodynamics equilibria
with flow. We prove that as the number of plasma regions becomes infinite our
extension of MRxMHD reduces to ideal MHD with flow. We also prove that some
solutions to MRxMHD with flow are not time-independent in the laboratory frame,
and instead have 3D structure which rotates in the toroidal direction with
fixed angular velocity. This capability gives MRxMHD potential application to
describing rotating 3D MHD structures such as 'snakes' and long-lived modes.
