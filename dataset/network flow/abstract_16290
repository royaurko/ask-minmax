We consider the standard first passage percolation model in $\mathbb{Z}^d$
for $d\geq 2$. We are interested in two quantities, the maximal flow $\tau$
between the lower half and the upper half of the box, and the maximal flow
$\phi$ between the top and the bottom of the box. A standard subadditive
argument yields the law of large numbers for $\tau$ in rational directions.
Kesten and Zhang have proved the law of large numbers for $\tau$ and $\phi$
when the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate hyperplanes: the two
variables grow linearly with the surface $s$ of the basis of the box, with the
same deterministic speed. We study the probabilities that the rescaled
variables $\tau /s$ and $\phi /s$ are abnormally small. For $\tau$, the box can
have any orientation, whereas for $\phi$, we require either that the box is
sufficiently flat, or that its sides are parallel to the coordinate
hyperplanes. We show that these probabilities decay exponentially fast with
$s$, when $s$ grows to infinity. Moreover, we prove an associated large
deviation principle of speed $s$ for $\tau /s$ and $\phi /s$, and we improve
the conditions required to obtain the law of large numbers for these variables.
