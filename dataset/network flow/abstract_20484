We introduce a kinetic model for traffic flow, based on Boltzmann like binary
interactions. We illustrate two possible examples of this type, using two
different patterns to model interactions resulting in acceleration, both based
on a parameter that describes the maximum acceleration of a vehicle. Under
suitable and reasonable hypotheses on the microscopic interactions among
vehicles, we can compute the asymptotic behaviour of the resulting kinetic
distribution functions. In both cases, we find that these models permit to
recover the phase change observed in experimental fundamental diagrams.
Further, the analysis of the exact equilibria shows that it is possible to have
the full richness of a kinetic approach with the simplicity of a space of
microscopic velocities characterized by a small number of modes.
