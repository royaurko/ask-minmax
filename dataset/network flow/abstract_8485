This paper introduces the Discrete Dithered Desynchronization (D3sync)
algorithm which is a decentralized Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
technique in which a set of network nodes computes iteratively a conflict-free
schedule so that each node obtains a portion of a frame that is an integer
multiple of a fixed slot size. The algorithm is inspired by the dynamics of
Pulse Coupled Oscillators (PCO), but unlike its predecessors that divide
arbitrarily the frame among the nodes in the network, the D3sync allocates
discrete resources among the network nodes.
  Our paper proves the convergence of the D3sync algorithm and gives an upper
bound on the convergence time of the algorithm.
