We consider evolution of a passive scalar (concentration of pollutants or
temperature) in a chaotic (turbulent) flow. A universal asymptotic behavior of
the passive scalar decay (homogenization) related to peripheral regions (near
walls) is established. The passive scalar moments and its pair correlation
function in the peripheral region are analyzed. A special case investigated in
our paper is the passive scalar decay along a pipe.
