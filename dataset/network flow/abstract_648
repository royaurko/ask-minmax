We study the splitting of regular square lattices subject to stochastic
intermittent flows. Various flow patterns are produced by different groupings
of the nodes, based on their random alternation between two possible states.
The resulting flows on the lattices decrease with the number of groups
according to a power law. By Monte Carlo simulations we reveal how the time
span until the occurrence of a splitting depends on the flow patterns.
Increasing the flow fluctuation frequency shortens this time span which reaches
a minimum before rising again due to inertia effects incorporated in the model.
The size of the largest connected component after the splitting is rather
independent of the flow fluctuation frequency but slightly decreases with the
link capacities. Our findings carry important implications for real-world
networks, such as electric power grids with a large share of renewable
intermittent energy sources.
