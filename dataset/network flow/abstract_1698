The existing studies of RObust Header Compression (ROHC) have provided some
understanding for memoryless channel, but the behavior of ROHC for correlated
wireless channels is not well investigated in spite of its practical
importance. In this paper, the dependence of ROHC against its design parameters
for the Gilbert Elliot channel is studied by means of three analytical models.
A first more elaborated approach accurately predicts the behavior of the
protocol for the single RTP flow profile, while a simpler, analytically
tractable model yields clear and insightful mathematical relationships that
explain the qualitative trends of ROHC. The results are validated against a
real world implementation of this protocol. Moreover, a third model studies
also the less conventional yet practically relevant setting of multiple RTP
flows.
