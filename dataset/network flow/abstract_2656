We perform kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of flow-induced nucleation in
polymer melts with an algorithm that is tractable even at low undercooling. The
configuration of the non-crystallized chains under flow is computed with a
recent non-linear tube model. Our simulations predict both enhanced nucleation
and the growth of shish-like elongated nuclei for sufficiently fast flows. The
simulations predict several experimental phenomena and theoretically justify a
previously empirical result for the flow-enhanced nucleation rate. The
simulations are highly pertinent to both the fundamental understanding and
process modeling of flow-induced crystallization in polymer melts.
