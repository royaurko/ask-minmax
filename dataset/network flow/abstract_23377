As part of a program to identify the physical conditions in the jets of
gamma-ray-flaring blazars detected by Fermi, including the role of shocks in
the production of high-energy flaring, we obtained 4 years of 3-frequency,
centimeter-band total flux density and linear polarization monitoring
observations of the radio-bright blazar S5 0716+714 with the University of
Michigan 26-m paraboloid. Light curves constructed from these data exhibit a
series of rapid, high-amplitude, centimeter-band total flux density outbursts,
and changes in the linear polarization consistent with the passage of shocks
during the gamma-ray flaring. The observed spectral evolution of the radio-band
flares, in combination with radiative transfer simulations incorporating
propagating shocks, was used to constrain the shock and jet flow conditions in
the parsec-scale regions of the jet. Eight forward-moving, transverse shocks
with unusually-strong shock compression factors, a very fast Lorentz factor of
the shocks of 77, a bulk Lorentz factor of the flow of 20, a viewing angle of
12 degrees, and an intrinsic opening angle of the radio jet of 5.2 degrees were
identified.
