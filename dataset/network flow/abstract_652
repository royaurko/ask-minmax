In this article, Guarantee of Service (GoS) is defined as a proposal to
improve the integration of Mission Critical Networking (MCN) services in the
Internet, analyzing the congestion impact on those privileged flows with high
requirements of trust and delay. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a
technology that offers flow differentiation and QoS in the Internet. Therefore,
in order to improve network performance in case of congested domains, GoS is
proposed as a technique that allows the local recovering of lost packets of
MPLS privileged flows. To fulfill the GoS requirements for integration of MCN
in MPLS, a minimum set of extensions to RSVPTE has been proposed to provide GoS
capable routes. Moreover, we have carried out an analytical study of GoS
scalability and a performance improvement analysis by means of simulations.
