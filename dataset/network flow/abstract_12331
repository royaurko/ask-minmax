An extension to a recently introduced architecture of clique-based neural
networks is presented. This extension makes it possible to store sequences with
high efficiency. To obtain this property, network connections are provided with
orientation and with flexible redundancy carried by both spatial and temporal
redundancy, a mechanism of anticipation being introduced in the model. In
addition to the sequence storage with high efficiency, this new scheme also
offers biological plausibility. In order to achieve accurate sequence
retrieval, a double layered structure combining hetero-association and
auto-association is also proposed.
