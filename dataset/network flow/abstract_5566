Sensor network has been recognized as the most significant technology for
next century. Despites of its potential application, wireless sensor network
encounters resource restriction such as low power, reduced bandwidth and
specially limited power sources. This work proposes an efficient technique for
the conservation of energy in a wireless sensor network (WSN) by forming an
effective cluster of the network nodes distributed over a wide range of
geographical area. The clustering scheme is developed around a specified class
of cellular automata (CA) referred to as the modified cyclic cellular automata
(mCCA). It sets a number of nodes in stand-by mode at an instance of time
without compromising the area of network coverage and thereby conserves the
battery power. The proposed scheme also determines an effective cluster size
where the inter-cluster and intra-cluster communication cost is minimum. The
simulation results establish that the cyclic cellular automata based clustering
for energy conservation in sensor networks (CCABC) is more reliable than the
existing schemes where clustering and CA based energy saving technique is used.
