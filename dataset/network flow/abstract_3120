Networks are structures that pervade many natural and man-made phenomena.
Recent findings have characterized many networks as not random structures, but
as efficent complex formations. Current research has examined complex networks
as largely non-spatial phenomena. Location, distance, and geograhpy, though,
are vital aspects of a wide variety of networks. This paper will examine the
United State's portion of the Internet's infrastructure as a complex network
and what role distance and geography play in its formation. From these findings
implications will be drawn on the economic, political, and national security
impacts of network formation and evolution in an information economy.
