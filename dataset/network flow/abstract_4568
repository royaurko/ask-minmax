We propose an information theoretic model for sociological networks. The
model is a microcanonical ensemble of states and particles. The states are the
possible pairs of nodes (i.e. people, sites and alike) which exchange
information. The particles are the energetic information bits. With analogy to
bosons gas, we define for these networks model: entropy, volume, pressure and
temperature. We show that these definitions are consistent with Carnot
efficiency (the second law) and ideal gas law. Therefore, if we have two large
networks: hot and cold having temperatures TH and TC and we remove Q energetic
bits from the hot network to the cold network we can save W profit bits. The
profit will be calculated from W equal or smaller than Q (1-TH/TC), namely,
Carnot formula. In addition it is shown that when two of these networks are
merged the entropy increases. This explains the tendency of economic and social
networks to merge.
