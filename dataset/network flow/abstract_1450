Turbulent shear flows have triggered fundamental research in nonlinear
dynamics, like transition scenarios, pattern formation and dynamical modeling.
In particular, the control of nonlinear dynamics is subject of research since
decades. In this publication, actuated turbulent shear flows serve as test-bed
for a nonlinear feedback control strategy which can optimize an arbitrary cost
function in an automatic self-learning manner. This is facilitated by genetic
programming providing an analytically treatable control law. Unlike control
based on PID laws or neural networks, no structure of the control law needs to
be specified in advance. The strategy is first applied to low-dimensional
dynamical systems featuring aspects of turbulence and for which linear control
methods fail. This includes stabilizing an unstable fixed point of a
nonlinearly coupled oscillator model and maximizing mixing, i.e.\ the Lyapunov
exponent, for forced Lorenz equations. For the first time, we demonstrate the
applicability of genetic programming control to four shear flow experiments
with strong nonlinearities and intrinsically noisy measurements. These
experiments comprise mixing enhancement in a turbulent shear layer, the
reduction of the recirculation zone behind a backward facing step, and the
optimized reattachment of separating boundary layers. Genetic programming
control has outperformed tested optimized state-of-the-art control and has even
found novel actuation mechanisms.
