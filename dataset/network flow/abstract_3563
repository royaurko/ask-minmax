In the past few years, the storage and analysis of large-scale and fast
evolving networks present a great challenge. Therefore, a number of different
techniques have been proposed for sampling large networks. In general, network
exploration techniques approximate the original networks more accurately than
random node and link selection. Yet, link selection with additional subgraph
induction step outperforms most other techniques. In this paper, we apply
subgraph induction also to random walk and forest-fire sampling. We analyze
different real-world networks and the changes of their properties introduced by
sampling. We compare several sampling techniques based on the match between the
original networks and their sampled variants. The results reveal that the
techniques with subgraph induction underestimate the degree and clustering
distribution, while overestimate average degree and density of the original
networks. Techniques without subgraph induction step exhibit exactly the
opposite behavior. Hence, the performance of the sampling techniques from
random selection category compared to network exploration sampling does not
differ significantly, while clear differences exist between the techniques with
subgraph induction step and the ones without it.
