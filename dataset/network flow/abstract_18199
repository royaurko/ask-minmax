The efficiency of traffic routing on complex networks can be reflected by two
key measurements i.e. the system capacity and the average data packets travel
time. In this paper, we propose a mixing routing strategy by integrating local
static and dynamic information for enhancing the efficiency of traffic on
scale-free networks. The strategy is governed by a single parameter. Simulation
results show that there exists a optimal parameter value by considering both
maximizing the network capacity and reducing the packet travel time. Comparing
with the strategy by adopting exclusive local static information, the new
strategy shows its advantages in improving the efficiency of the system. The
detailed analysis of the mixing strategy is provided. This work suggests that
how to effectively utilize the larger degree nodes plays the key role in the
scale-free traffic systems.
