We discuss the results of long-term hard x-ray monitoring of Galactic
black-hole candidates 1E 1740.7-2942, GRS 1758-258, Cyg X-1, GX 339-4, and Cyg
X-3 with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The objects divide into two
classes. In the first class, exemplified by Cyg X-1, luminosity and spectral
hardness evolve simultaneously. In the second class, the relation is more
complicated: the softest spectra occur while the count rate is dropping. Most
models of accretion, tailored to Cyg X-1, do not predict the second sort of
behavior. One interpretation is a simple model with two simultaneous,
independent accretion flows: a thin disk and a hot halo. A drop in the
accretion rate affecting both flows would propagate through the halo
immediately but might take up to several weeks to propagate through the disk.
While the inner halo is thus temporarily depleted compared to the disk, a
temporary soft state is expected. This picture is supported by the observation
that those sources which show delays (1E 1740.7-2942, GRS 1758-258, and GX
339-4) are expected to have low-mass companions, and those which do not (Cyg
X-1, Cyg X-3) are known or thought to have high-mass companions. Low-mass
companions imply accretion by Roche-lobe overflow, with a high specific angular
momentum in the accreting material, and therefore a large disk with a long
viscous timescale. Wind accretion from massive companions is expected to result
in a much smaller disk, and thus little viscous delay.
