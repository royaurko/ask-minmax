This paper adapts the corner classification algorithm (CC4) to train the
neural networks using spread unary inputs. This is an important problem as
spread unary appears to be at the basis of data representation in biological
learning. The modified CC4 algorithm is tested using the pattern classification
experiment and the results are found to be good. Specifically, we show that the
number of misclassified points is not particularly sensitive to the chosen
radius of generalization.
