In this paper we discuss a model describing global behavior of the two phase
incompressible flow in fractured porous media. The fractured media is regarded
as a porous medium consisting of two superimposed continua, a connected
fracture system, which is assumed to be thin of order $\varepsilon\delta$, and
an $\varepsilon$-periodic system of disjoint matrix blocks. We derive global
behavior of the fractured media by passing to the limit as
$\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ and then as the relative fracture thickness
$\delta\rightarrow 0$, taking into account that the permeability of the blocks
is proportional to $(\varepsilon\delta)^2$, while permeability of the fractures
is of order one. The macroscopic model obtained is then a fully homogenized
model, i.e., where all the coefficients are calculated in terms of given data
and do not depend on the additional coupling or cell problems.
