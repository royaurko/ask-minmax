Dominance hierarchy among animals is widespread in various species and
believed to serve to regulate resource allocation within an animal group.
Unlike small groups, however, detection and quantification of linear hierarchy
in large groups of animals are a difficult task. Here, we analyse
aggression-based dominance hierarchies formed by worker ants in Diacamma sp. as
large directed networks. We show that the observed dominance networks are
perfect or approximate directed acyclic graphs, which are consistent with
perfect linear hierarchy. The observed networks are also sparse and random but
significantly different from networks generated through thinning of the perfect
linear tournament (i.e., all individuals are linearly ranked and dominance
relationship exists between every pair of individuals). These results pertain
to global structure of the networks, which contrasts with the previous studies
inspecting frequencies of different types of triads. In addition, the
distribution of the out-degree (i.e., number of workers that the focal worker
attacks), not in-degree (i.e., number of workers that attack the focal worker),
of each observed network is right-skewed. Those having excessively large
out-degrees are located near the top, but not the top, of the hierarchy. We
also discuss evolutionary implications of the discovered properties of
dominance networks.
