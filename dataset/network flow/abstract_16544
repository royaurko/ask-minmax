We demonstrate for the first time that a periodic array of submicrometer
holes (antidots) can be patterned into thin single NbSe3 crystals. We report on
the study of charge density wave (CDW) transport of the network of mesoscopic
units between antidots. Size of the elementary unit can be as small as 0.5
micron along the chain axis and (0.2 micron) x (0.3 micron) in cross section.
We observe size effects for Ohmic residual resistance and in CDW transport
current-voltage characteristics in submicronic networks.
