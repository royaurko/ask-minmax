Analysis of stochastic models of networks is quite important in light of the
huge influx of network data in social, information and bio sciences. But a
proper statistical analysis of features of different stochastic models of
networks is still underway. We propose bootstrap subsampling methods for
finding empirical distribution of count features or 'moments' (Bickel, Chen &
Levina, AoS, 2011) and smooth functions of these features for the networks.
Using these methods, we can not only estimate the variance of count features
but also get good estimates of such feature counts, which are usually expensive
to compute numerically in large networks. In our paper, we prove theoretical
properties of the bootstrap estimates of variance of the count features as well
as show their efficacy through simulation. We also use the method on some real
network data for estimation of variance and expectation of some count features.
