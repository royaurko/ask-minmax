A class of channels is introduced for which there is memory inside blocks of
a specified length and no memory across the blocks. The multi-user model is
called an information network with in-block memory (NiBM). It is shown that
block-fading channels, channels with state known causally at the encoder, and
relay networks with delays are NiBMs. A cut-set bound is developed for NiBMs
that unifies, strengthens, and generalizes existing cut bounds for discrete
memoryless networks. The bound gives new finite-letter capacity expressions for
several classes of networks including point-to-point channels, and certain
multiaccess, broadcast, and relay channels. Cardinality bounds on the random
coding alphabets are developed that improve on existing bounds for channels
with action-dependent state available causally at the encoder and for relays
without delay. Finally, quantize-forward network coding is shown to achieve
rates within an additive gap of the new cut-set bound for linear, additive,
Gaussian noise channels, symmetric power constraints, and a multicast session.
