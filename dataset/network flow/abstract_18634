Networked Control Systems (NCSs) often suffer from random packet dropouts
which deteriorate overall system's stability and performance. To handle the ill
effects of random packet losses in feedback control systems, closed over
communication network, a state feedback controller with predictive gains has
been designed. To achieve improved performance, an optimization based
controller design framework has been proposed in this paper with Linear Matrix
Inequality (LMI) constraints, to ensure guaranteed stability. Different
conflicting objective functions have been optimized with Non-dominated Sorting
Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The methodology proposed in this paper not only
gives guaranteed closed loop stability in the sense of Lyapunov, even in the
presence of random packet losses, but also gives an optimization trade-off
between two conflicting time domain control objectives.
