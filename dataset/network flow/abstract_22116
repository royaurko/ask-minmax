We describe laboratory-grown snow crystals that exhibit a triangular,
plate-like morphology, and we show that the occurrence of these crystals is
much more frequent than one would expect from random growth perturbations of
the more-typical hexagonal forms. We then describe an aerodynamic model that
explains the formation of these crystals. A single growth perturbation on one
facet of a hexagonal plate leads to air flow around the crystal that promotes
the growth of alternating facets. Aerodynamic effects thus produce a weak
growth instability that can cause hexagonal plates to develop into triangular
plates. This mechanism solves a very old puzzle, as observers have been
documenting the unexplained appearance of triangular snow crystals in nature
for nearly two centuries.
