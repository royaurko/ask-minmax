The traffic in telephone networks is analyzed in this paper. Unlike the
classical traffic analysis where call blockings are due to the limited channel
capacity, we consider here a more realistic cause for call blockings which is
due to the way in which users are networked in a real-life human society.
Furthermore, two kinds of user network, namely, the fully-connected user
network and the scale-free network, are employed to model the way in which
telephone users are connected. We show that the blocking probability is
generally higher in the case of the scale-free user network, and that the
carried traffic intensity is practically limited not only by the network
capacity but also by the property of the user network.
