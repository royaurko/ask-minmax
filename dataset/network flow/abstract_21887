Jet Tomography is proposed as a new test of Color Glass Condensate (CGC)
initial conditions in non-central $A+A$ collisions. The $k_{T}$ factorized CGC
formalism is used to calculate the rapidity twist in the reaction plane of both
the bulk low $p_T< 2$ GeV matter as well as the rare high $p_T> 6$ GeV partons.
Unlike conventional perturbative QCD, the initial high $p_{T}$ CGC gluons are
shown to be twisted even further away from the beam axis than the the low $p_T$
bulk at high rapidities $|\eta|>2$. Differential directed flow
$v_{1}(p_{T}>6,|\eta|>2)$ is proposed to test this novel high $p_T$ rapidity
twist predicted by the CGC model.
