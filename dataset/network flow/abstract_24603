Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is an appealing
solution to balance the energy distribution in wireless networks and improve
the energy-efficiency of the entire network. In this paper, we study the
optimal policies for SWIPT over the flat-fading channel subject to the
co-channel interference. The SWIPT receiver using dynamic power splitting (DPS)
is expected to achieve the maximum information rate given an average harvested
energy constraint. In the case that channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT) is not available, the optimal power splitting is derived.
For the case with CSIT, the joint optimal policy of the transmit power and the
power splitting are also provided. Through simulations, we show the optimal
rate-energy (R-E) trade-offs of our proposed policies. The case with CSIT
achieves better R-E trade-off than the case with no CSIT.
