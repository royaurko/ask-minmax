Genetic switch systems with mutual repression of two transcription factors
are studied using deterministic and stochastic methods. Numerous studies have
concluded that cooperative binding is a necessary condition for the emergence
of bistability in these systems. Here we show that for a range of biologically
relevant conditions, a suitable combination of network structure and stochastic
effects gives rise to bistability even without cooperative binding.
