Current tests for contagion in social network studies are vulnerable to the
confounding effects of latent homophily (i.e., ties form preferentially between
individuals with similar hidden traits). We demonstrate a general method to
lower bound the strength of causal effects in observational social network
studies, even in the presence of arbitrary, unobserved individual traits. Our
tests require no parametric assumptions and each test is associated with an
algebraic proof. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by correctly
deducing the causal effects for examples previously shown to expose defects in
existing methodology. Finally, we discuss preliminary results on data taken
from the Framingham Heart Study.
