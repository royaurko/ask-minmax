The transverse mass spectra of J/psi and psi' mesons and Omega hyperons
produced in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies are discussed within a
statistical model used successfully for the interpretation of the SPS results.
The comparison of the presented model with the future RHIC data should serve as
a further crucial test of the hypothesis of statistical production of charmonia
at hadronization. Finally, in case of validity, the approach should allow to
estimate the mean transverse flow velocity at the quark gluon plasma
hadronization.
