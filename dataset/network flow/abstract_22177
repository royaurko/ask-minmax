We study how dynamical quantities such as Lyapunov exponents, metric entropy,
topological pressure, recurrence rates, and dimension-like characteristics
change under a time reparameterization of a dynamical system. These quantities
are shown to either remain invariant, transform according to a multiplicative
factor or transform through a convoluted dependence that may take the form of
an integral over the initial local values. We discuss the significance of these
results for the apparent non-invariance of chaos in general relativity and
explore applications to the synchronization of equilibrium states and the
elimination of expansions.
