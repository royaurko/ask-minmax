Towards next generation communications, Energy Efficiency (EE) attracts lots
of attentions nowadays. Some innovative techniques have been proposed in prior
literatures, especially the sleep mechanism of base station (BS). Yet how to
sleep and when to sleep are still vague concepts. Another, most of the studies
focus on the cellular section or core networks separately while integral and
comprehensive version is neglected in prior literatures. In this paper,the
integral optimization structure is studied based on cloud radio network (C-RAN)
and information centric network (ICN) that raised latest combined with the
sleep mode. The original C-RAN and ICN structures are amended in terms of
reality application of sleep techniques. While adopting the sleep techniques
both in core and cellular, apart from previous works, a transition smooth
method that solve the current surge problems which is ignored before is further
proposed. Based on the new method, it will be much more feasible to adopt the
sleep techniques by knowing the appropriate occasion for transition between
sleep and idle mode. Comprehensive computer based simulation results
demonstrate that this integer proposal achieves better EE feature with
negligible impact on quality of service (QoS) of user equipments (UEs).
