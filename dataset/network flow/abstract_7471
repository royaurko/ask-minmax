We report the first results of the nuclear modification factors and elliptic
flow of the phi mesons measured by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in high
luminosity Au+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV. The nuclear modification
factors R_AA and R_CP of the phi follow the same trend of suppression as pi0's
in Au+Au collisions. In d+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV, the phi mesons
are not suppressed. The elliptic flow of the phi mesons, measured in the
minimum bias Au+Au events, is statistically consistent with other identified
particles.
