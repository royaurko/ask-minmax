Mobile operators currently prefer optimizing their radio networks via
re-homing or cutting over the cell sites in 2G or 3G networks. The core
network, as the parental part of radio network, is inevitably impacted by the
re-homing in radio domain. This paper introduces the cell site re-homing in
radio network and analyzes its impact on the performance of GSM/UMTS core
network. The possible re-homing models are created and analyzed for core
networks. The paper concludes that appropriate re-homing in radio domain, using
correct algorithms, not only optimizes the radio network but also helps improve
the QoS of the core network and saves the carriers' OPEX and CAPEX on their
core networks.
