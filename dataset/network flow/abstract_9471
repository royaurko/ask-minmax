We study the traffic dynamics in complex networks where each link is assigned
a limited and identical bandwidth. Although the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
queuing rule is widely applied in the routing protocol of information packets,
here we argue that if we drop this rule, the overall throughput of the network
can be remarkably enhanced. We proposed some efficient routing strategies that
do not strictly obey the FIFO rule. Comparing with the routine shortest path
strategy, the throughput for both Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) networks and the real
Internet, the throughput can be improved more than five times. We calculate the
theoretical limitation of the throughput. In BA networks, our proposed strategy
can achieve 88% of the theoretical optimum, yet for the real Internet, it is
about 12%, implying that we have a huge space to further improve the routing
strategy for the real Internet. Finally we discuss possibly promising ways to
design more efficient routing strategies for the Internet.
