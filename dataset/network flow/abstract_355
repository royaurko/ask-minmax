This article is a mini-review about electrical current flows in networks from
the perspective of statistical physics. We briefly discuss analytical methods
to solve the conductance of an arbitrary resistor network. We then turn to
basic results related to percolation: namely, the conduction properties of a
large random resistor network as the fraction of resistors is varied. We focus
on how the conductance of such a network vanishes as the percolation threshold
is approached from above. We also discuss the more microscopic current
distribution within each resistor of a large network. At the percolation
threshold, this distribution is multifractal in that all moments of this
distribution have independent scaling properties. We will discuss the meaning
of multifractal scaling and its implications for current flows in networks,
especially the largest current in the network. Finally, we discuss the relation
between resistor networks and random walks and show how the classic phenomena
of recurrence and transience of random walks are simply related to the
conductance of a corresponding electrical network.
