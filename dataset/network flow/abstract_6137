The heterogeneity in cellular networks that comprise multiple base stations
types imposes new challenges in network planning and deployment. The Radio
Resource Management (RRM) techniques, such as dynamic sharing of the available
resources and advanced user association strategies determine the overall
network capacity and the network/spectrum efficiency. This paper evaluates the
downlink performance of a two-tier heterogeneous LTE network (consisting of
macro and femto tiers) in terms of rate distribution, i.e. the percentage of
users that achieve certain rate in the system. The paper specifically
addresses: (1) the femto tier RRM by randomization of the allocated resources;
(2) the user association process by introducing novel proactive offloading
scheme and (3) femto tier access control. System level simulation results show
that an optimal RRM strategy can be designed for different scenarios (e.g.
congested and uncongested networks). The proposed proactive offloading scheme
in the association phase improves the performance of congested networks by
efficiently utilizing the available femto tier resources. Finally, the
introduced hybrid access in femto tier is shown to perform nearly identical as
the open access.
