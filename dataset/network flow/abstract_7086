Recently, highly resolved experiments and simulations have provided detailed
insight into the dynamics of turbulent pipe flow. This has revived the interest
to identify mechanisms that generate chaotic transients with super-exponential
growth of lifetime as a function of a control parameter, the Reynolds number
for pipe flow, and with transitions from bounded chaotic patches to an invasion
of space of irregular motion. Dynamical systems models are unique tools in this
respect because they can provide insight into the origin of the very long life
time of puffs, and the dynamical mechanism leading to the transition from puffs
to slugs in pipe flow. The present paper contributes to this enterprise by
introducing a unidirectionally coupled map lattice. It mimics three of the
salient features of pipe-flow turbulence: (i) the transition from laminar flow
to puffs, (ii) a super-exponential scaling of puff lifetime, and (iii) the
transition from puffs to slugs by an unbinding transition in an intermittency
scenario. In our model all transitions and scalings are theoretically described
from a dynamical systems point of view.
