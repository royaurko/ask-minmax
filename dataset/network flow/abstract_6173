Data on low-pT hadronic spectra are widely regarded as evidence of a
hydrodynamic expansion in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In this interpretation,
different hadron species emerge from a common medium that has built up a strong
collective velocity field. Here, we show that the existence of a collective
flow field implies characteristic modifications of high-pT parton
fragmentation. We generalize the formalism of parton energy loss to the case of
flow-induced, oriented momentum transfer. We also discuss how to embed this
calculation in hydrodynamic simulations. Flow effects are found to result
generically in characteristic asymmetries in the eta-phi-plane of jet energy
distributions and of multiplicity distributions associated to high-pT trigger
particles. But collective flow also contributes to the medium-induced
suppression of single inclusive high-pT hadron spectra. In particular, we find
that low-pT elliptic flow can induce a sizeable additional contribution to the
high-pT azimuthal asymmetry by selective elimination of those hard partons
which propagate with significant inclination against the flow field. This
reduces at least partially the recently observed problem that models of parton
energy loss tend to underpredict the large azimuthal asymmetry v2 of high-pT
hadronic spectra in semi-peripheral Au+Au collisions.
