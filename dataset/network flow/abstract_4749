We report that both shear and bulk moduli, not only shear modulus, are
critical parameters involved in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous flows in
metallic glass. The flow activation energy (\Delta F) of various glasses when
scaled with average molar volume Vm, which is defined as flow activation energy
density \rho_E =\Delta F/Vm, can be expressed as: D=(10G+K)/11 . The extended
elastic model is suggestive for understanding the glass transition and
deformation in metallic glasses.
