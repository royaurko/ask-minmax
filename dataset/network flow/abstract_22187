Consider the general scalar balance law $\partial_t u + \mathrm{Div} f(t, x,
u) = F(t, x, u)$ in several space dimensions. The aim of this note is to
improve the results of Colombo, Mercier, Rosini who gave an estimate of the
dependence of the solutions from the flow f and from the source F. The
improvements are twofold: first the expression of the coefficients in these
estimates are more precise; second, we eliminate some regularity hypotheses
thus extending significantly the applicability of our estimates.
