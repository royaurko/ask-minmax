As we know, the member-only algorithm in provides the best links stress and
wavelength usage for the construction of multicast light-trees in WDM networks
with sparse splitting. However, the diameter of tree is too big and the average
delay is also too large, which are intolerant for QoS required multimedia
applications. In this paper, a distance priority based algorithm is proposed to
build light-trees for multicast routing, where the Candidate Destinations and
the Candidate Connectors are introduced. Simulations show the proposed
algorithm is able to greatly reduce the diameter and average delay of the
multicast tree (up to 51% and 50% respectively), while keep the same or get a
slightly better link stress as well as the wavelength usage than the famous
Member-Only algorithm.
