Damage scenarios for large networks are considered. The cascade scenario is
described by means of powers of adjacency matrix. More difficult probabilistic
variants of the large network damage are modeling by Markov chains. For
reliability augmentation of networks we add a set of random intermediate agents
with big dimensionality. It provides high reliability of all system even with
low reliability of single components. Probabilistic estimation of reliability
for reinforced network is made.
