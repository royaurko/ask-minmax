Building on the Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON) and Gigabit PON
(GPON) standards, Next-Generation (NG) PONs (i) provide increased data rates,
split ratios, wavelengths counts, and fiber lengths, as well as (ii) allow for
all-optical integration of access and metro networks. In this paper we provide
a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of the capacity (maximum mean packet
throughput) and packet delay of subnetworks that can be used to form NG-PONs.
Our analysis can cover a wide range of NG-PONs through taking the minimum
capacity of the subnetworks making up the NG-PON and weighing the packet delays
of the subnetworks. Our numerical and simulation results indicate that our
analysis quite accurately characterizes the throughput-delay performance of
EPON/GPON tree networks, including networks upgraded with higher data rates and
wavelength counts. Our analysis also characterizes the trade-offs and
bottlenecks when integrating EPON/GPON tree networks across a metro area with a
ring, a Passive Star Coupler (PSC), or an Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) for
uniform and non-uniform traffic. To the best of our knowledge, the presented
analysis is the first to consider multiple PONs interconnected via a metro
network.
