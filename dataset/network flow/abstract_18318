Southeastern European countries undergo significant changes in the
demand/supply ratio on the labour market and in the structure of professional
competences that are necessary for undertaking a professional activity. In
addition, brain-drain process and decrease of interest for a career in basic
sciences put many challenges for our community. Consequently, based on the
activity of the Southeastern European Network in Mathematical and Theoretical
Physics (SEENET MTP Network) in connecting groups and persons working in
mathematics and theoretical physics, we investigate specific qualifications
recognized in these fields in all the countries from the region, and the
related competences necessary for practicing the respective occupations. A list
of new possible occupations will be promoted for inclusion in the National
Qualifications Register for Higher Education. Finally, we analyze the vision
existing in this region on the higher education qualifications against the
European vision and experience, in particular in training of Master students,
PhD students, and senior teaching and research staff through the Network, i.e.
multilateral and bilateral programs.
