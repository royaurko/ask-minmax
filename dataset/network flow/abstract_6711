Handover measurement is responsible for finding a handover target and
directly decides the performance of mobility management. It is governed by a
complex combination of parameters dealing with multi-cell scenarios and system
dynamics. A network design has to offer an appropriate handover measurement
procedure in such a multi-constraint problem. The present paper proposes a
unified framework for the network analysis and optimization. The exposition
focuses on the stochastic modeling and addresses its key probabilistic events
namely (i) suitable handover target found, (ii) service failure, (iii) handover
measurement triggering, and (iv) handover measurement withdrawal. We derive
their closed-form expressions and provide a generalized setup for the analysis
of handover measurement failure and target cell quality by the best signal
quality and \st{minimum duration outage} \textit{level crossing properties}.
Finally, we show its application and effectiveness in today's 3GPP-LTE cellular
networks.
