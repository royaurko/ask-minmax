In epidemic modeling, the term infection strength indicates the ratio of
infection rate and cure rate. If the infection strength is higher than a
certain threshold -- which we define as the epidemic threshold - then the
epidemic spreads through the population and persists in the long run. For a
single generic graph representing the contact network of the population under
consideration, the epidemic threshold turns out to be equal to the inverse of
the spectral radius of the contact graph. However, in a real world scenario it
is not possible to isolate a population completely: there is always some
interconnection with another network, which partially overlaps with the contact
network. Results for epidemic threshold in interconnected networks are limited
to homogeneous mixing populations and degree distribution arguments. In this
paper, we adopt a spectral approach. We show how the epidemic threshold in a
given network changes as a result of being coupled with another network with
fixed infection strength. In our model, the contact network and the
interconnections are generic. Using bifurcation theory and algebraic graph
theory, we rigorously derive the epidemic threshold in interconnected networks.
These results have implications for the broad field of epidemic modeling and
control. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.
