RNAnet provides a bridge between two widely used Human gene databases.
Ensembl describes DNA sequences and transcripts but not experimental gene
expression. Whilst NCBI's GEO contains actual expression levels from Human
samples. RNAnet provides immediate access to thousands of Affymetrix HG-U133
2plus GeneChip measurements Homo sapiens genes in most medically interesting
tissues.
  Without RNAnet comparison across experiments in GEO is very labour intensive
requiring man months of effort to down load and clean data. With RNAnet anyone
can access cleaned quantile normalised data in seconds. It can be used to data
mine patterns of co-expression. The network of strongly correlated genes is
huge but sparse. Thousands of genes interact strongly with thousands of others.
Conversely there are tens of thousands of genes which interact strongly with
less than 100 others. I.e. RNAnet gives new views for RNA Systems Biology.
