Hybrid intra-data centre networks, with optical and electrical capabilities,
are attracting research interest in recent years. This is attributed to the
emergence of new bandwidth greedy applications and novel computing paradigms. A
key decision to make in networks of this type is the selection and placement of
suitable flows for switching in circuit network. Here, we propose an efficient
strategy for flow selection and placement suitable for hybrid Intra-cloud data
centre networks. We further present techniques for investigating bottlenecks in
a packet networks and for the selection of flows to switch in circuit network.
The bottleneck technique is verified on a Software Defined Network (SDN)
testbed. We also implemented the techniques presented here in a scalable
simulation experiment to investigate the impact of flow selection on network
performance. Results obtained from scalable simulation experiment indicate a
considerable improvement on average throughput, lower configuration delay, and
stability of offloaded flows
