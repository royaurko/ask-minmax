This paper considers a two-hop interference network, where two users transmit
independent messages to their respective receivers with the help of two relay
nodes. The transmitters do not have direct links to the receivers; instead, two
relay nodes serve as intermediaries between the transmitters and receivers.
Each hop, one from the transmitters to the relays and the other from the relays
to the receivers, is modeled as a Gaussian interference channel, thus the
network is essentially a cascade of two interference channels. For this
network, achievable symmetric rates for different parameter regimes under
decode-and- forward relaying and amplify-and-forward relaying are proposed and
the corresponding coding schemes are carefully studied. Numerical results are
also provided.
