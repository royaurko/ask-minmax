Network management and security is currently one of the most vibrant research
areas, among which, research on detecting and identifying anomalies has
attracted a lot of interest. Researchers are still struggling to find an
effective and lightweight method for anomaly detection purpose. In this paper,
we propose a simple, robust method that detects network anomalous traffic data
based on flow monitoring. Our method works based on monitoring the four
predefined metrics that capture the flow statistics of the network. In order to
prove the power of the new method, we did build an application that detects
network anomalies using our method. And the result of the experiments proves
that by using the four simple metrics from the flow data, we do not only
effectively detect but can also identify the network traffic anomalies.
