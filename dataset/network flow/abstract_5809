In a recent paper, it has been suggested that the controllability of a
diffusively coupled complex network, subject to localized feedback loops at
some of its vertices, can be assessed by means of a Master Stability Function
approach, where the network controllability is defined in terms of the spectral
properties of an appropriate Laplacian matrix. Following that approach, a
comparison study is reported here among different network topologies in terms
of their controllability. The effects of heterogeneity in the degree
distribution, as well as of degree correlation and community structure, are
discussed.
