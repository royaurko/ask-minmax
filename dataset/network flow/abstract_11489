In this paper, the severity prediction of drought through the implementation
of modern sensor networks is discussed. We describe how to design a drought
prediction system using wireless sensor networks. This paper will describe a
terrestrial interconnected wireless sensor network paradigm for the prediction
of severity of drought over a vast area of 10,000 sq km. The communication
architecture for sensor network is outlined and the protocols developed for
each layer is explored. The data integration model and sensor data analysis at
the central computer is explained. The advantages and limitations are discussed
along with the use of wireless standards. They are analyzed for its relevance.
Finally a conclusion is presented along with open research issues.
