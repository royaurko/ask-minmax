We study structural properties of growing networks where both addition and
deletion of nodes are possible. Our model network evolves via two independent
processes. With rate r, a node is added to the system and this node links to a
randomly selected existing node. With rate 1, a randomly selected node is
deleted, and its parent node inherits the links of its immediate descendants.
We show that the in-component size distribution decays algebraically, c_k ~
k^{-beta}, as k-->infty. The exponent beta=2+1/(r-1) varies continuously with
the addition rate r. Structural properties of the network including the height
distribution, the diameter of the network, the average distance between two
nodes, and the fraction of dangling nodes are also obtained analytically.
Interestingly, the deletion process leads to a giant hub, a single node with a
macroscopic degree whereas all other nodes have a microscopic degree.
