Evolutionary game theory is one of the key paradigms behind many scientific
disciplines from science to engineering. Previous studies proposed a strategy
updating mechanism, which successfully demonstrated that the scale-free network
can provide a framework for the emergence of cooperation. Instead, individuals
in random graphs and small-world networks do not favor cooperation under this
updating rule. However, a recent empirical result shows the heterogeneous
networks do not promote cooperation when humans play a Prisoner's Dilemma. In
this paper, we propose a strategy updating rule with payoff memory. We observe
that the random graphs and small-world networks can provide even better
frameworks for cooperation than the scale-free networks in this scenario. Our
observations suggest that the degree heterogeneity may be neither a sufficient
condition nor a necessary condition for the widespread cooperation in complex
networks. Also, the topological structures are not sufficed to determine the
level of cooperation in complex networks.
