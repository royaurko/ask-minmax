Statistical inference using social sensors is an area that has witnessed
remarkable progress in the last decade. It is relevant in a variety of
applications including localizing events for targeted advertising, mar- keting,
localization of natural disasters and predicting sentiment of investors in
financial markets. This paper presents a tutorial description of three
important aspects of sensing-based information diffusion in social networks
from a communications/signal processing perspective. First, diffusion models
for information exchange in large scale social networks together with social
sensing via social media networks such as Twitter is considered. Second,
Bayesian social learning models in online reputation systems are presented.
Finally, the principle of revealed preferences arising in micro-economics
theory is used to parse datasets to determine if social sensors are utility
maximizers and then determine their utility functions. All three topics are
explained in the context of actual experimental datasets from health networks,
social media and psychological experiments. Also, algorithms are given that
exploit the above models to infer underlying events based on social sensing.
The overview, insights, models and algorithms presented in this paper stem from
recent developments in computer-science, economics, psychology and electrical
engineering.
