Basing on the increasing evidence for the cosmological relevance of the local
Hubble flow, we consider a simple analytical cosmological model for the Local
Universe. This is a non-Friedmann model with a non-uniform static space-time.
The major dynamical factor controlling the local expansion is the antigravity
produced by the omnipresent and permanent dark energy of the cosmic vacuum (or
the cosmological constant). The antigravity dominates at distances larger than
1-2 Mpc from the center of the Local Group. The model gives a natural
explanation of the two key quantitative characteristics of the local expansion
flow, which are the local Hubble constant and the velocity dispersion of the
flow. The observed kinematical similarity of the local and global flows of
expansion is clarified by the model. We demonstrate analytically the efficiency
of the vacuum cooling mechanism that allows one to see the Hubble flow so close
to the Local Group. Special significance is argued for the 'universal Hubble
constant' H_V, depending only on the vacuum density (H_V \approx 60 km/s/Mpc).
The model makes a number of testable predictions. It also shows unexpectedly
that it is the dwarf galaxies of the local flow with the shortest distances and
lowest redshifts that may be the most sensitive indicators of dark energy in
our neighborhood.
