This work considers optimizing LDPC codes in the physical-layer network coded
two-way relay channel using noncoherent FSK modulation. The error-rate
performance of channel decoding at the relay node during the multiple-access
phase was improved through EXIT-based optimization of Tanner graph variable
node degree distributions. Codes drawn from the DVB-S2 and WiMAX standards were
used as a basis for design and performance comparison. The computational
complexity characteristics of the standard codes were preserved in the
optimized codes by maintaining the extended irregular repeat-accumulate (eIRA).
The relay receiver performance was optimized considering two modulation orders
M = {4, 8} using iterative decoding in which the decoder and demodulator refine
channel estimates by exchanging information. The code optimization procedure
yielded unique optimized codes for each case of modulation order and available
channel state information. Performance of the standard and optimized codes were
measured using Monte Carlo simulation in the flat Rayleigh fading channel, and
error rate improvements up to 1.2 dB are demonstrated depending on system
parameters.
