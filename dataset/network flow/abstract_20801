In a previous FAST paper, I presented a quantitative model of the process of
trust building, and showed that trust is accumulated like wealth: the rich get
richer. This explained the pervasive phenomenon of adverse selection of trust
certificates, as well as the fragility of trust networks in general. But a
simple explanation does not always suggest a simple solution. It turns out that
it is impossible to alter the fragile distribution of trust without sacrificing
some of its fundamental functions. A solution for the vulnerability of trust
must thus be sought elsewhere, without tampering with its distribution. This
observation was the starting point of the present paper. It explores a
different method for securing trust: not by redistributing it, but by mining
for its sources. The method used to break privacy is thus also used to secure
trust. A high level view of the mining methods that connect the two is provided
in terms of *similarity networks*, and *spectral decomposition* of similarity
preserving maps. This view may be of independent interest, as it uncovers a
common conceptual and structural foundation of mathematical classification
theory on one hand, and of the spectral methods of graph clustering and data
mining on the other hand.
