We argue that the presence of diffuse synchrotron emission forming the
so-called radio mini-halos in some cooling flow clusters can be explained by
reacceleration of relativistic electrons, the necessary energetics being
supplied by the cooling flows themselves. In particular, the reacceleration due
to MHD turbulence has the correct radial dependence on the parameters to
naturally balance the radiative losses. As an application we show that the main
properties of the radio mini-halo in the Perseus cluster (brightness profile,
total radio spectrum and radial spectral steepening) can be accounted for by
the synchrotron radiation from relic relativistic electrons in the cluster,
which are efficiently reaccelerated by MHD turbulence via Fermi-like processes
due to the compression of the cluster magnetic field in the cooling flow
region. Since the presence of an observable radio mini-halo in a cooling flow
region critically depends on the combination of several physical parameters, we
suggest that the rarity of radio mini-halos found in cooling flow clusters is
due to the fact that the physical conditions of the ICM are intermediate
between those which lead to the formation of extended radio halos and those
holding in cooling flows without radio halos. The basic results of our model
remain unchanged even if the cooling flow is stopped somewhere in the innermost
region of the cluster.
