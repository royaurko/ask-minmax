The timing patterns of human communication in social networks is not random.
On the contrary, communication is dominated by emergent statistical laws such
as non-trivial correlations and clustering. Recently, we found long-term
correlations in the user's activity in social communities. Here, we extend this
work to study collective behavior of the whole community. The goal is to
understand the origin of clustering and long-term persistence. At the
individual level, we find that the correlations in activity are a byproduct of
the clustering expressed in the power-law distribution of inter-event times of
single users. On the contrary, the activity of the whole community presents
long-term correlations that are a true emergent property of the system, i.e.
they are not related to the distribution of inter-event times. This result
suggests the existence of collective behavior, possible arising from nontrivial
communication patterns through the embedding social network.
