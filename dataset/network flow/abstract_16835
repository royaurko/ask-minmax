We analyze the capacity scaling laws of clustered ad hoc networks in which
nodes are distributed according to a doubly stochastic shot-noise Cox process.
We identify five different operational regimes, and for each regime we devise a
communication strategy that allows to achieve a throughput to within a
poly-logarithmic factor (in the number of nodes) of the maximum theoretical
capacity.
