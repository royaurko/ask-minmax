Statistical modeling of nuclear data using artificial neural networks (ANNs)
and, more recently, support vector machines (SVMs), is providing novel
approaches to systematics that are complementary to phenomenological and
semi-microscopic theories. We present a global model of $\beta^-$-decay
halflives of the class of nuclei that decay 100% by $\beta^-$ mode in their
ground states. A fully-connected multilayered feed forward network has been
trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Bayesian regularization, and
cross-validation. The halflife estimates generated by the model are discussed
and compared with the available experimental data, with previous results
obtained with neural networks, and with estimates coming from traditional
global nuclear models. Predictions of the new neural-network model are given
for nuclei far from stability, with particular attention to those involved in
r-process nucleosynthesis. This study demonstrates that in the framework of the
$\beta^-$-decay problem considered here, global models based on ANNs can at
least match the predictive performance of the best conventional global models
rooted in nuclear theory. Accordingly, such statistical models can provide a
valuable tool for further mapping of the nuclidic chart.
