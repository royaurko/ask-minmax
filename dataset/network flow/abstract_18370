We analyse an associative memory based on a ferrofluid, consisting of a
system of magnetic nano-particles suspended in a carrier fluid of variable
viscosity subject to patterns of magnetic fields from an array of input and
output magnetic pads. The association relies on forming patterns in the
ferrofluid during a trainingdphase, in which the magnetic dipoles are free to
move and rotate to minimize the total energy of the system. Once equilibrated
in energy for a given input-output magnetic field pattern-pair the particles
are fully or partially immobilized by cooling the carrier liquid. Thus produced
particle distributions control the memory states, which are read out
magnetically using spin-valve sensors incorporated in the output pads. The
actual memory consists of spin distributions that is dynamic in nature,
realized only in response to the input patterns that the system has been
trained for. Two training algorithms for storing multiple patterns are
investigated. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the physical system we
demonstrate that the device is capable of storing and recalling two sets of
images, each with an accuracy approaching 100%.
