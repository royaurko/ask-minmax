Elastic effects in a model of disordered nematic elastomers are numerically
investigated in two dimensions. Networks crosslinked in the isotropic phase
exhibit unusual soft mechanical response against stretching. It arises from
gradual alignment of orientationally correlated regions that are elongated
along the director. A sharp crossover to a macroscopically aligned state is
obtained on further stretching. The effect of random internal stress is also
discussed.
