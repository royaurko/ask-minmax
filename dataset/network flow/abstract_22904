Using numerical holography, we study the collision of a planar sheet of
energy with a bounded localized distribution of energy. The collision, which
mimics proton-nucleus collisions, produces a localized lump of debris with
transverse size $R \sim 1/T_{\rm eff}$ with $T_{\rm eff}$ the effective
temperature, and has large gradients and large transverse flow. Nevertheless,
the post-collision evolution is well-described by viscous hydrodynamics. Our
results bolster the notion that debris produced in proton-nucleus collisions
may be modeled using hydrodynamics.
