We introduce CTCP, a novel multi-path transport protocol using network
coding. CTCP is designed to incorporate TCP's good features, such as congestion
control and reliability, while improving on TCP's performance in lossy and/or
dynamic networks. CTCP builds upon the ideas of TCP/NC introduced by
Sundararajan et al. and uses network coding to provide robustness against
losses. We introduce the use of multiple paths to provide robustness against
mobility and network failures. We provide an implementation of CTCP (in
userspace) to demonstrate its performance.
