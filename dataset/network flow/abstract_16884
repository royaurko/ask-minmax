Interference in wireless systems is both temporally and spatially correlated.
Yet very little research has analyzed the effect of such correlation. Here we
focus on its impact on the diversity in Poisson networks with multi-antenna
receivers. Most work on multi-antenna communication does not consider
interference, and if it is included, it is assumed independent across the
receive antennas. Here we show that interference correlation significantly
reduces the probability of successful reception over SIMO links. The diversity
loss is quantified via the diversity polynomial. For the two-antenna case, we
provide the complete joint SIR distribution.
