Unlike telephone operators, which pay termination fees to reach the users of
another network, Internet Content Providers (CPs) do not pay the Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) of users they reach. While the consequent cross
subsidization to CPs has nurtured content innovations at the edge of the
Internet, it reduces the investment incentives for the access ISPs to expand
capacity. As potential charges for terminating CPs' traffic are criticized
under the net neutrality debate, we propose to allow CPs to voluntarily
subsidize the usagebased fees induced by their content traffic for end-users.
We model the regulated subsidization competition among CPs under a neutral
network and show how deregulation of subsidization could increase an access
ISP's utilization and revenue, strengthening its investment incentives.
Although the competition might harm certain CPs, we find that the main cause
comes from high access prices rather than the existence of subsidization. Our
results suggest that subsidization competition will increase the
competitiveness and welfare of the Internet content market; however, regulators
might need to regulate access prices if the access ISP market is not
competitive enough. We envision that subsidization competition could become a
viable model for the future Internet.
