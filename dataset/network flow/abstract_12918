The interacting lattice gas model is used to simulate fluid flow through an
open percolating porous medium with the fluid entering at the source-end and
leaving from the opposite end. The shape of the steady-state concentration
profile and therefore the gradient field depends on the is found to scale with
the porosity according to porosity p. The root mean square (rms) displacements
of fluid and its constituents (tracers) show a drift power-law behavior, in the
asymptotic regime. The flux current density is found to scale with the porosity
according to an exponent near 1.7.
