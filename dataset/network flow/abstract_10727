The evolution of a small-amplitude localized vortex disturbance in an
unbounded shear flow with the linear velocity profile is investigated. Based on
the exact solution of the initial problem for basic flow, a revision is made of
the theoretical approach (suggested by Levinski (1991) and subsequently further
developed in a series of other publications) in which the vortex evolution is
described in terms of Fluid Impulse of the vortex "core". Although the
theoretical predictions obtained on the basis of this approach were excellently
confirmed in subsequent experimental studies, its inconsistency is demonstrated
in this study.
  According to the solution obtained, the localized vortex increases slowly (as
power-law with the time) and attains an almost "horizontal" orientation, unlike
the previous theory (Levinski, 1991) that predicts the more rapid growth and
vortex orientation at the angle of 45 degrees to the flow direction. On the
other hand, just the rapid increase and the angle of 45 degrees to the outer
flow direction are characteristic for hairpin vortices observed in turbulent
boundary layers or artificially synthesized vortices in laminar boundary
layers. Thus the issue of adequate theoretical interpretation of the evolution
of localized vortices is again on the agenda.
