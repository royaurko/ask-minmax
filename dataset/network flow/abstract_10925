Variable Star Network (VSNET, http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/) is a
global professional-amateur network of researchers in variable stars and
related objects, particularly in transient objects, such as cataclysmic
variables, black hole binaries, supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. The VSNET has
been playing a pioneering role in establishing the field of "transient object
astronomy", by effectively incorporating modern advance in observational
astronomy and global electronic network, as well as collaborative progress in
theoretical astronomy and astronomical computing. The VSNET is now one of the
best-featured global networks in this field of astronomy. We review on the
historical progress, design concept, associated technology, and a wealth of
scientific achievements powered by the VSNET.
