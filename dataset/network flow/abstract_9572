In this paper, we describe an algorithm for sensor network localization (SNL)
that proceeds by dividing the whole network into smaller subnetworks, then
localizes them in parallel using some fast and accurate algorithm, and finally
registers the localized subnetworks in a global coordinate system. We
demonstrate that this divide-and-conquer algorithm can be used to leverage
existing high-precision SNL algorithms to large-scale networks, which could
otherwise only be applied to small-to-medium sized networks. The main
contribution of this paper concerns the final registration phase. In
particular, we consider a least-squares formulation of the registration problem
(both with and without anchor constraints) and demonstrate how this otherwise
non-convex problem can be relaxed into a tractable convex program. We provide
some preliminary simulation results for large-scale SNL demonstrating that the
proposed registration algorithm (together with an accurate localization scheme)
offers a good tradeoff between run time and accuracy.
