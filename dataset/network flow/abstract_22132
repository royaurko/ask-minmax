Recent measurements at RHIC of angular correlations of same-sign vs. opposite
sign pairs have been interpreted as evidence for large-scale fluctuations of
parity-odd fields. In this paper, we provide alternative explanations of the
same phenomena based on correlations from charge and momentum conservation
overlaid with elliptic flow. These effects are shown to produce correlations
with similar magnitudes as those measured. Other correlations are also
considered, but estimates of their size suggest they are inconsequential.
