We present a ballistic description of the propagation of the working surface
of a relativistic jet. Using simple laws of conservation of mass and linear
momentum at the working surface, we obtain a full description of the jet flow
parametrised by the initial velocity and mass injection. This analysis will
soon be applied to particular cases of time-dependent injection of mass and
velocity into the jet.
