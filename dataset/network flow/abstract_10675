Online social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Flickr are among
the most popular sites on the Web, providing platforms for sharing information
and interacting with a large number of people. The different ways for users to
interact, such as liking, retweeting and favoriting user-generated content, are
among the defining and extremely popular features of these sites. While
empirical studies have been done to infer network growth processes in these
sites, few studies have characterized social interaction behavior and the role
of social interaction in network growth.
  In this paper, we analyze large-scale data collected from the Flickr social
network to understand favoriting behavior and study the effect of a favorite on
network growth. We do this using a systematic formulation of Flickr as a
two-layer temporal multiplex network: the first layer describes the follow
relationship between users and the second layer describes the social
interaction between users in the form of favorite markings to photos uploaded
by them. Our investigation reveals that (a) favoriting is well-described by
preferential attachment, (b) over 50% of favorites are reciprocated within 10
days if at all they are reciprocated, (c) different kinds of favorites differ
in how fast they are reciprocated, and (d) favoriting leads to link formation
in the follow layer through multiplex triadic closure.
