We conjecture that Vasiliev's theory of higher spin gravity in
four-dimensional de Sitter space (dS) is holographically dual to a
three-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) living on the spacelike boundary
of dS at future timelike infinity. The CFT is the Euclidean Sp(N) vector model
with anticommuting scalars. The free CFT flows under a double-trace deformation
to an interacting CFT in the IR. We argue that both CFTs are dual to Vasiliev
dS gravity but with different future boundary conditions on the bulk scalar
field. Our analysis rests heavily on analytic continuations of bulk and
boundary correlators in the proposed duality relating the O(N) model with
Vasiliev gravity in AdS.
