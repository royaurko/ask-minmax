The spread of radical ideologies is a key to fanaticism, recruitment and
terrorist activities. Hence, preventing such activities requires predictive
models capable of identifying areas and agents before occurrence of
catastrophic terrorist act. In this paper, we develop a model that captures a
radicalization mechanism through several intermediate stages of individuals. We
propose a radicalizatiom mechanism using individual-based approach constructed
from epidemiological model of contagion. Our model builds on insights from
contagion models used in theoretical epidemiology and entails a mechanism for
controlling the spread of radical ideologies on social spatial networks by
identifying suspicious individuals and monitoring them, and taking action when
necessary. We show how our model can combat the development of terrorist
networks even with limited information on a target terrorist network.
