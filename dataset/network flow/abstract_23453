An approach is proposed to the Hopfield model where the mean-field treatment
is made for a given set of stored patterns (sample) and then the statistical
average over samples is taken. This corresponds to the approach made by
Thouless, Anderson and Palmer (TAP) to the infinite-range model of spin
glasses. Taking into account the fact that in the Hopfield model there exist
correlations between different elements of the interaction matrix, we obtain
its TAP free energy explicitly, which consists of a series of terms exhibiting
the cluster effect. Nature of the spin-glass transition in the model is also
examined and compared with those given by the replica method as well as the
cavity method.
