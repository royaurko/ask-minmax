We undertake an extensive numerical investigation of the graph spectra of
thousands regular graphs, a set of random Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs, the two most
popular types of complex networks and an evolving genetic network by using
novel conceptual and experimental tools. Our objective in so doing is to
contribute to an understanding of the meaning of the Eigenvalues of a graph
relative to its topological and information-theoretic properties. We introduce
a technique for identifying the most informative Eigenvalues of evolving
networks by comparing graph spectra behavior to their algorithmic complexity.
We suggest that extending techniques can be used to further investigate the
behavior of evolving biological networks. In the extended version of this paper
we apply these techniques to seven tissue specific regulatory networks as
static example and network of a na\"ive pluripotent immune cell in the process
of differentiating towards a Th17 cell as evolving example, finding the most
and least informative Eigenvalues at every stage.
