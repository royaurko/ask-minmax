The shear flow and the dielectric alpha-process in molecular glass formers is
modeled in terms of local structural rearrangements which reverse a strong
local shear. Using Eshelby's solution of the corresponding elasticity theory
problem (J. D. Eshelby, Proc. Roy. Soc. A241, 376 (1957)), one can calculate
the recoverable compliance and estimate the lifetime of the symmetric
double-well potential characterizing such a structural rearrangement. A full
modeling of the shear relaxation spectra requires an additional parametrization
of the barrier density of these structural rearrangements. The dielectric
relaxation spectrum can be described as a folding of these relaxations with the
Debye process.
