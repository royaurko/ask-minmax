We report measurements of the dissipation in the Superfluid Helium high
REynold number von Karman flow (SHREK) experiment for different forcing
conditions, through a regime of global hysteretic bifurcation. Our
macroscopical measurements indicate no noticeable difference between the
classical fluid and the superfluid regimes, thereby providing evidence of the
same dissipative anomaly and response to asymmetry in fluid and superfluid
regime. %In the latter case, A detailed study of the variations of the
hysteretic cycle with Reynolds number supports the idea that (i) the stability
of the bifurcated states of classical turbulence in this closed flow is partly
governed by the dissipative scales and (ii) the normal and the superfluid
component at these temperatures (1.6K) are locked down to the dissipative
length scale.
