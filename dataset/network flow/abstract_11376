Inspired by dengue and yellow fever epidemics, we investigated the contact
process (CP) in a multiscale network constituted by one-dimensional chains
connected through a Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network. In addition to the CP
dynamics inside the chains, the exchange of individuals between connected
chains (travels) occurs at a constant rate. A finite epidemic threshold and an
epidemic mean lifetime diverging exponentially in the subcritical phase,
concomitantly with a power law divergence of the outbreak's duration, were
found. A generalized scaling function involving both regular and SF components
was proposed for the quasistationary analysis and the associated critical
exponents determined, demonstrating that the CP on this hybrid network and
nonvanishing travel rates establishes a new universality class.
