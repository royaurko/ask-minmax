Interactions in time-varying complex systems are often very heterogeneous at
the topological level (who interacts with whom) and at the temporal level (when
interactions occur and how often). While it is known that temporal
heterogeneities often have strong effects on dynamical processes, e.g. the
burstiness of contact sequences is associated with slower spreading dynamics,
the picture is far from complete. In this paper, we show that temporal
heterogeneities result in temporal sparsity} at the time scale of average
inter-event times, and that temporal sparsity determines the amount of slowdown
of Susceptible-Infectious (SI) spreading dynamics on temporal networks. This
result is based on the analysis of several empirical temporal network data
sets. An approximate solution for a simple network model confirms the
association between temporal sparsity and slowdown of SI spreading dynamics.
Since deterministic SI spreading always follows the fastest temporal paths, our
results generalize -- paths are slower to traverse because of temporal
sparsity, and therefore all dynamical processes are slower as well.
