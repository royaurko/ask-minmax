In this report, We investigated the nonlinear phenomena in the study of flow
dynamics of velocity component. In our studies, we observed nonlinear term in
the vertical component of velocity by vittori et al \cite{vit} The time series
simulation of vertical component which increases with Reynold stress value. We
developed direct numerical simulation under two dimensional grid system to
study the flow dynamics and vorticity parameter. Flow pattern and flow dynamics
near wavy boundary wall in the victinity of ripple bottom was readdressed under
direct numerical simualtion(DNS) framework.
