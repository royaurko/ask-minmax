Downlink spatial intercell interference cancellation (ICIC) is considered for
mitigating other-cell interference using multiple transmit antennas. A
principle question we explore is whether it is better to do ICIC or simply
standard single-cell beamforming. We explore this question analytically and
show that beamforming is preferred for all users when the edge SNR
(signal-to-noise ratio) is low ($<0$ dB), and ICIC is preferred when the edge
SNR is high ($>10$ dB), for example in an urban setting. At medium SNR, a
proposed adaptive strategy, where multiple base stations jointly select
transmission strategies based on the user location, outperforms both while
requiring a lower feedback rate than the pure ICIC approach. The employed
metric is sum rate, which is normally a dubious metric for cellular systems,
but surprisingly we show that even with this reward function the adaptive
strategy also improves fairness. When the channel information is provided by
limited feedback, the impact of the induced quantization error is also
investigated. It is shown that ICIC with well-designed feedback strategies
still provides significant throughput gain.
