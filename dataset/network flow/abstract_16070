Despite the large effort devoted to cybersecurity research over the last
decades, cyber intrusions and attacks are still increasing, constantly
challenging the design of the current system. The increasingly frequent events
of BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) route hijacking have brought the topic of
traffic interception into attention. While numerous edits and improvements are
proposed for BGP, a theoretical understanding of the fundamental design of this
system is missing. Here we define and analyze an abstract model of information
monitoring in routing networks. Specifically, we study algorithms that measure
the potential of groups of dishonest agents to divert traffic through their
infrastructure under the constraint that messages must reach their intended
destinations. We relate two variants of our model based on the allowed kinds of
lies, define strategies for colluding agents, and prove optimality in special
cases. In our main theorem we derive a provably optimal monitoring strategy for
subsets of agents in which no two are adjacent, and we extend this strategy to
the general case. Finally, we use our results to analyze the susceptibility of
real and synthetic networks to endogenous information monitoring. In the
Autonomous Systems (AS) graph of the United States, we show that compromising
only 18 random nodes in the AS graph surprisingly captures 10\% of all traffic
of the network in expectation.
