The vacuum structure is probed by boundary conditions. The behaviour of
thermodynamical quantities like free energy, boundary entropy and entanglement
entropy under the boundary renormalization group flow are analysed in 2D
conformal field theories. The results show that whereas vacuum energy and
boundary entropy turn out to be very sensitive to boundary conditions, the
vacuum entanglement entropy is independent of boundary properties when the
boundary of the entanglement domain does not overlap the boundary of the
physical space. In all cases the second law of thermodynamics holds along the
boundary renormalization group flow.
