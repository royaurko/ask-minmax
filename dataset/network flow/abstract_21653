Correlation data from high-energy p-p collisions indicate substantial
anticorrelation of like-sign pions and correlation of unlike-sign pions on
rapidity and azimuth at small length scale suggesting approach to a 1D lattice
structure during string hadronization. I generalize this result to propose that
an {\em incipient} 3D pion lattice structure may be formed during hadronization
of a QGP. I then present a method to detect this structure in the transverse
phase space of heavy-ion collisions which depends on local transverse Hubble
flow. I also relate this correlation structure to recently proposed suppression
of net charge and baryon-number fluctuations on rapidity after sudden traversal
of the QCD phase boundary.
