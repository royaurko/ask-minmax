The purpose of this paper is to study Toda-Darboux transforms, i.e., Darboux
transforms for operators L(t) flowing according to the Toda lattice. Each
element of the null-space $L(t)-z$ specifies a factorization for all t and thus
a Toda-Darboux transform on $L(t)$. The Toda-Darboux map induces a
transformation on the tau-vectors, given by a certain vertex operator, and on
eigenfunctions, given by a Wronskian. .
