We analytically investigate the heat current $I$ and its thermal fluctuations
$\Delta$ in a branching network without loops (Cayley tree). The network
consists of two type of harmonic masses: vertex masses $M$ placed at the
branching points where phononic scattering occurs and masses $m$ at the bonds
between branching points where phonon propagation take place. The network is
coupled to thermal reservoirs consisting of one-dimensional harmonic chains of
coupled masses $m$. Due to impedance missmatching phenomena, both ${\cal I}$
and $\Delta$, are non-monotonic functions of the mass ratio $\mu=M/m$. In
particular, there are cases where they are strictly zero below some critical
value $\mu^*$.
