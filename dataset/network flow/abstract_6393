The Internet is constantly changing, and its hierarchy was recently shown to
become flatter. Recent studies of inter-domain traffic showed that large
content providers drive this change by bypassing tier-1 networks and reaching
closer to their users, enabling them to save transit costs and reduce reliance
of transit networks as new services are being deployed, and traffic shaping is
becoming increasingly popular.
  In this paper we take a first look at the evolving connectivity of large
content provider networks, from a topological point of view of the autonomous
systems (AS) graph. We perform a 5-year longitudinal study of the topological
trends of large content providers, by analyzing several large content providers
and comparing these trends to those observed for large tier-1 networks. We
study trends in the connectivity of the networks, neighbor diversity and
geographical spread, their hierarchy, the adoption of IXPs as a convenient
method for peering, and their centrality. Our observations indicate that
content providers gradually increase and diversify their connectivity, enabling
them to improve their centrality in the graph, and as a result, tier-1 networks
lose dominance over time.
