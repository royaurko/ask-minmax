We investigate the conformal geometry of spherically symmetric spacetimes in
general without specifying the form of the matter distribution. The general
conformal Killing symmetry is obtained subject to a number of integrability
conditions. Previous results relating to static spacetimes are shown to be a
special case of our solution. The general inheriting conformal symmetry vector,
which maps fluid flow lines conformally onto fluid flow lines, is generated and
the integrability conditions are shown to be satisfied. We show that there
exists a hypersurface orthogonal conformal Killing vector in an exact solution
of Einstein's equations for a relativistic fluid which is expanding,
accelerating and shearing.
