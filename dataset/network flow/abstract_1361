The optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which plays a central role in operating
electrical networks is considered. The problem is nonconvex and is in fact NP
hard. Therefore, designing efficient algorithms of practical relevance is
crucial, though their global optimality is not guaranteed. Existing
semi-definite programming relaxation based approaches are restricted to OPF
problems where zero duality holds. In this paper, an efficient novel method to
address the general nonconvex OPF problem is investigated. The proposed method
is based on alternating direction method of multipliers combined with
sequential convex approximations. The global OPF problem is decomposed into
smaller problems associated to each bus of the network, the solutions of which
are coordinated via a light communication protocol. Therefore, the proposed
method is highly scalable. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithm
are mathematically substantiated. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated
on a number of test examples, where the convergence properties of the proposed
algorithm are numerically substantiated and the performance is compared with a
global optimal method.
