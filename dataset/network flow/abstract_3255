We study the Ricci flow for initial metrics which are C^0 small perturbations
of the Euclidean metric on R^n. In the case that this metric is asymptotically
Euclidean, we show that a Ricci harmonic map heat flow exists for all times,
and converges uniformly to the Euclidean metric as time approaches infinity. In
proving this stability result, we introduce a monotone integral quantity which
measures the deviation of the evolving metric from the Euclidean metric. We
also investigate the convergence of the diffeomorphisms relating Ricci harmonic
map heat flow to Ricci flow.
