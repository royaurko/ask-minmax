The deployment of small cells is expected to gain huge momentum in the near
future, as a solution for managing the skyrocketing mobile data demand growth.
Local caching of popular files at the small cell base stations has been
recently proposed, aiming at reducing the traffic incurred when transferring
the requested content from the core network to the users. In this paper, we
propose and analyze a novel caching approach that can achieve significantly
lower traffic compared to the traditional caching schemes. Our cache design
policy carefully takes into account the fact that an operator can serve the
requests for the same file that happen at nearby times via a single multicast
transmission. The latter incurs less traffic as the requested file is
transmitted to the users only once, rather than with many unicast
transmissions. Systematic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, as compared to the existing caching schemes.
