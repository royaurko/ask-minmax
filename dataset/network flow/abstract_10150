This paper is to describe a design and fabrication method for a valve-less
peristaltic micro-pump. The valve-less peristaltic micro-pump with three
membrane chambers in a serial is actuated by three piezoelectric (PZT)
actuators. With the fluidic flow design, liquid in the flow channel is pumped
to a constant flow speed ranged from 0.4 to 0.48 mm/s. In term of the maximum
flow rate of the micro-pump is about 365 mircoliters/min, when the applied
voltage is 24V and frequency 50 Hz. Photolithography process was used to
fabricate the micro-pump mold. PDMS molding and PDMS bonding method were used
to fabricate the micro-channel and actuator chambers. A portable drive
controller was designed to control three PZT actuators in a proper sequence to
drive the chamber membrane. Then, all parts were integrated into the portable
valve-less peristaltic micro-pump system.
