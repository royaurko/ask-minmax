Future communication scenarios for NASA spacecraft may involve multiple
communication links and relay nodes, so that there is essentially a network in
which there may be multiple paths from a sender to a destination. The
availability of individual links may be uncertain. In this paper, scenarios are
considered in which the goal is to maximize a payoff that assigns weight based
on the worth of data and the probability of successful transmission. Ideally,
the choice of what information to send over the various links will provide
protection of high value data when many links are unavailable, yet result in
communication of significant additional data when most links are available.
Here the focus is on the simple network of multiple parallel links, where the
links have known capacities and outage probabilities. Given a set of simple
inter-link codes, linear programming can be used to find the optimal
timesharing strategy among these codes. Some observations are made about the
problem of determining all potentially useful codes, and techniques to assist
in such determination are presented.
