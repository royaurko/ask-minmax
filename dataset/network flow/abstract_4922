We experimentally probe the anisotropy of the fabric of weakly vibrated,
flowing granular media. Depending on the driving parameters --- flow rate and
vibration strength --- this anisotropy varies significantly. We show how the
anisotropy collapses when plotted as function of the driving stresses,
uncovering a direct link between stresses and anisotropy. Moreover, our data
suggests that for small anisotropies, the shear stresses vanish. Anisotropy of
the fabric of granular media thus plays a crucial role in determining the
rheology of granular flows.
