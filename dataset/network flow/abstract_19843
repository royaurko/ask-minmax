\noindent In [1] L. Polterovich and Z. Rudnick considered the behavior of a
one-parameter subgroup of a Lie group under the influence of a sequence of
kicks. Among others they raise the following problem: {\it is the horocycle
flow stably quasi-mixing on $SL(2,\mathbb{R})/\Gamma$?} Equivalently it can be
reformulated in terms of boundedness of the sequences of products $ P_n(t) =
\Phi_n H(t)\Phi_{n-1} H(t) \, ... \, \Phi_1 H(t) $ where $H(t) =
\begin{pmatrix} 1 & t
  0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\Phi=\{\Phi_n\} \subset SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. We solve
this problem positively and as a consequence obtain the following application
to the discrete Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation*} q_{k+1} - (2+tc_k)q_k
+ q_{k-1}=0, \qquad k\geq 1: \end{equation*} the set of values of the parameter
$t$ for which the equation has only bounded solutions, has finite measure.
