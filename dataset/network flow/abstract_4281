We perform a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of Poisson
networks and show that the metric and topological properties of random cellular
structures, can not be derived from simple models of random networks based on a
poisson point distribution [1]. In particular we show that Lewis and
Aboav-Wieare laws are not obeyed in these network.
