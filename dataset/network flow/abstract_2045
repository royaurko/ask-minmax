The data production farm for the CDF experiment is designed and constructed
to meet the needs of the Run II data collection at a maximum rate of 20
MByte/sec during the run. The system is composed of a large cluster of personal
computers (PCs) with a high-speed network interconnect and a custom design
control system for the flow of data and the scheduling of tasks on this PC
farm. The farm explores and exploits advances in computing and communication
technology. The data processing has achieved a stable production rate of
approximately 2 TByte per day. The software and hardware of the CDF production
farms has been successful in providing large computing and data throughput
capacity to the experiment.
