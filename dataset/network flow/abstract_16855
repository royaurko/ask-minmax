Inverse phase transitions are striking phenomena in which an apparently more
ordered state disorders under cooling. This behavior can naturally emerge in
tricritical systems on heterogeneous networks and it is strongly enhanced by
the presence of disassortative degree correlations. We show it both
analytically and numerically, providing also a microscopic interpretation of
inverse transitions in terms of freezing of sparse subgraphs and coupling
renormalization.
