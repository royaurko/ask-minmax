We investigate a two-dimensional network simulator capable of modeling
different time dependencies in two-phase drainage displacements. In particular,
we focus on the temporal evolution of the pressure due to capillary and viscous
forces and the time dependence of the interface between the two liquids. The
dynamics of the capillary effect are taken into account and we report on high
accuracy pressure measurements. Moreover, the simulator includes important
features in drainage, like burst dynamics of the invading fluid and
simultaneous flow of two liquids in a section of a tube. The validity of the
model is checked by comparing simulation results with well known experimental
properties in drainage displacement.
