The contributor is developing a numerical code with thousands of emission zones to
simulate the time-dependent multi-waveband emission from blazars. The code is
based on a model in which turbulent plasma flowing at a relativistic speed down
a jet crosses a standing conical collimation shock that accelerates electrons
to maximum energies in the 5-100 GeV range. This paper reports early results
produced by the model. The simulated light curves and time profiles of the
degree and position angle of polarization have a number of features in common
with the observational data of blazars. Maps of the polarized intensity
structure can be compared with those of blazars observed with very long
baseline interferometry at short millimeter wavelengths.
