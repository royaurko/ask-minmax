Many real-world complex systems such as social, biological, information as
well as technological systems results of a decentralized and unplanned
evolution which leads to a common structuration. Irrespective of their origin,
these so-called complex networks typically exhibit small-world and scale-free
properties. Another common feature is their organisation into communities. In
this paper, we introduce models of interaction networks based on the
composition process of syntactic and semantic Web services. An extensive
experimental study conducted on a benchmark of real Web services shows that
these networks possess the typical properties of complex networks (small-world,
scale-free). Unlike most social networks, they are not transitive. Using a
representative sample of community detection algorithms, a community
structuration is revealed. The comparative evaluation of the discovered
community structures shows that they are very similar in terms of content.
Furthermore, the analysis performed on the community structures and on the
communities themselves, leads us to conclude that their topological properties
are consistent.
