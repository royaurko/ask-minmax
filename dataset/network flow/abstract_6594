Network coding-based link failure recovery techniques provide near-hitless
recovery and offer high capacity efficiency. Diversity coding is the first
technique to incorporate coding in this field and is easy to implement over
small arbitrary networks. However, its capacity efficiency is restricted by its
systematic coding and high design complexity even though its design complexity
is lower than the other coding-based recovery techniques. Alternative
techniques mitigate some of these limitations, but they are difficult to
implement over arbitrary networks. In this paper, we propose a simple column
generation-based design algorithm and a novel advanced diversity coding
technique to achieve near-hitless recovery over arbitrary networks. The design
framework consists of two parts: a main problem and subproblem. Main problem is
realized with Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP),
whereas the subproblem can be realized with different methods. The simulation
results suggest that both the novel coding structure and the novel design
algorithm lead to higher capacity efficiency for near-hitless recovery. The
novel design algorithm simplifies the capacity placement problem which enables
implementing diversity coding-based techniques on very large arbitrary
networks.
