This paper deals with providing Quality of Service (QoS) over IP based
networks. We are going to give a brief survey about this topic, and present our
work at this area. There are many solutions of the problem, but the
standardization of the methods is not finished yet. At the moment there are two
kinds of approaches of the reservation problem. The distributed method handles
the network nodes independently, and get the nodes making their own admittance
decisions along the reservation path (i.e. Border Gateway Reservation Protocol
BGRP. The centralized way -we discuss in details-, which collects the network
nodes into domains, and handles them using a network manager. Generally there
are two significant parts of the network management: intra domain, and
inter-domain. This article focuses on making reservations over several domains,
which is the part of the inter-domain functions.
