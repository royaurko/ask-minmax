Google's Project Loon was launched in 2013 with the aim of providing Internet
access to rural and remote areas. In the Loon network, balloons travel around
the Earth and bring access points to the users who cannot connect directly to
the global wired Internet. The signals from the users will be transmitted
through the balloon network to the base stations connected to the Internet
service provider (ISP) on Earth. The process of transmitting and receiving data
consume a certain amount of energy from the balloon, while the energy on
balloons cannot be supplied by stable power source or by replacing batteries
frequently. Instead, the balloons can harvest energy from natural energy
sources, e.g., solar energy, or from radio frequency energy by equipping with
appropriate circuits. However, such kinds of energy sources are often dynamic
and thus how to use this energy efficiently is the main goal of this paper. In
this paper, we study the optimal energy allocation problem for the balloons
such that network performance is optimized and the revenue for service
providers is maximized. We first formulate the stochastic optimization problem
as a Markov decision process and then apply a learning algorithm based on
simulation-based method to obtain optimal policies for the balloons. Numerical
results obtained by extensive simulations clearly show the efficiency and
convergence of the proposed learning algorithm.
