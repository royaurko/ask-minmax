Information-centric networking (ICN) proposes to redesign the Internet by
replacing its host centric design with an information centric one, by
establishing communication at the naming level, with the receiver side acting
as the driving force behind content delivery. Such design promises great
advantages for the delivery of content to and from mobile hosts. This, however,
is at the expense of increased networking overhead, specifically in the case of
Named-data Networking (NDN) due to use of flooding for path recovery. In this
paper, we propose a mobility centric solution to address the overhead and
scalability problems in NDN by introducing a novel forwarding architecture that
leverages decentralized server-assisted routing over flooding based strategies.
We present an in-depth study of the proposed architecture and provide
demonstrative results on its throughput and overhead performance at different
levels of mobility proving its scalability and effectiveness, when compared to
the current NDN based forwarding strategies.
