A bi--Hamiltonian formulation for stationary flows of the KdV hierarchy
is derived in an extended phase space. A map between stationary flows and
restricted flows is constructed: in a case it connects an integrable
Henon--Heiles system and the Garnier system. Moreover a new integrability
scheme for Hamiltonian systems is proposed, holding in the standard phase
space.
