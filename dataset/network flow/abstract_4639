In this paper, we investigate the use of compactly supported divergence-free
wavelets for the representation of the Navier-Stokes solution. After reminding
the theoretical construction of divergence-free wavelet vectors, we present in
detail the bases and corresponding fast algorithms for 2D and 3D incompressible
flows. In order to compute the nonlinear term, we propose a new method which
provides in practice with the Hodge decomposition of any flow: this
decomposition enables us to separate the incompressible part of the flow from
its orthogonal complement, which corresponds to the gradient component of the
flow. Finally we show numerical tests to validate our approach.
