We consider a shallow, two-dimensional flow of a liquid in which the radial
and the azimuthal dynamics are coupled to each other. The steady and radial
background flow of this system creates an axially symmetric circular hydraulic
jump. On this background we apply time-dependent perturbations of the matter
flow rate and the azimuthal flow velocity, with the latter strongly localized
at the hydraulic jump. The perturbed variables depend spatially on both the
radial and azimuthal coordinates. Linearization of the perturbations gives a
coupled system of wave equations. The characteristic equations extracted from
these wave equations show that under a marginally stable condition a
spontaneous breaking of axial symmetry occurs at the position of the hydraulic
jump. Departure from the marginal stability shows further that a linear
instability develops in the azimuthal direction, resulting in an azimuthal
transport of liquid at the hydraulic jump. The time for the growth of azimuthal
instability is scaled by viscosity, and using this time scale we argue why an
azimuthal breakout is observed for liquids whose viscosity is high.
