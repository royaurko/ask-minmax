In a recent paper, Bassett et al. (2011) have analyzed the static and dynamic
organization of functional brain networks in humans. We here focus on the first
claim made in this paper, which states that the static modular structure of
such networks is nested with respect to time. Bassett et al. (2011) argue that
this graded structure underlines a "multiscale modular structure". In this
letter, however, we show that such a relationship is substantially mediated by
an increase in the random variation of the correlation coefficients computed at
different time scales.
