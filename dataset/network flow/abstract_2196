We investigate conditions of singularity formation of mean curvature flow and
volume preserving mean curvature flow in an axially symmetric setting. We prove
that no singularities can develop during a finite time interval, if the mean
curvature is bounded within that time interval on the entire surface. We prove
this for volume preserving mean curvature flow as well as for mean curvature
flow.
