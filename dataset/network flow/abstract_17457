In this paper we classify the four dimensional gradient shrinking solitons
under certain curvature conditions satisfied by all solitons arising from
finite time singularities of Ricci flow on compact four manifolds with positive
isotropic curvature. As a corollary we generalize a result of Perelman on three
dimensional gradient shrinking solitons to dimension four.
