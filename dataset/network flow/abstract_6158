An interrelation between a topological design of network and efficient
algorithm on it is important for its applications to communication or
transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a design principle for a
reliable routing in a store-carry-forward manner based on autonomously moving
message-ferries on a special structure of fractal-like network, which consists
of a self-similar tiling of equilateral triangles. As a collective adaptive
mechanism, the routing is realized by a relay of cyclic message-ferries
corresponded to a concatenation of the triangle cycles and using some good
properties of the network structure. It is recoverable for local accidents in
the hierarchical network structure. Moreover, the design principle is
theoretically supported with a calculation method for the optimal service rates
of message-ferries derived from a tandem queue model for stochastic processes
on a chain of edges in the network. These results obtained from a combination
of complex network science and computer science will be useful for developing a
resilient network system.
