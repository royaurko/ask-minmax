We present the design and evaluation of a predictable Network-on-Chip (NoC)
to interconnect processing units running multimedia applications with
variable-bit-rate. The design is based on a connectionless strategy in which
flits from different communication flows are interleaved in the same
communication channel between routers. Each flit carries routing information
used by routers to perform arbitration and scheduling of the corresponding
output communication channel. Analytic comparisons show that our approach keeps
average latency lower than a network based on resource reservation, when both
networks are working over 80% of offered load. We also evaluate the proposed
NoC on FPGA and ASIC technologies to understand the trade-off due to our
approach, in terms of silicon consumption.
