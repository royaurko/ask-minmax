This paper studies properties of the back end of a sorting network and
illustrates the utility of these in the search for networks of optimal size or
depth. All previous works focus on properties of the front end of networks and
on how to apply these to break symmetries in the search. The new properties
help shed understanding on how sorting networks sort and speed-up solvers for
both optimal size and depth by an order of magnitude.
