The use of heterogeneous networks with multiple radio access technologies
(RATs) is a system concept that both academia and industry are studying and
exploring for next generation wireless networks. A multi-RAT cross-layer
technique to minimize average packet end-to-end delay for a system with a
single user terminal and a single QoS class is proposed in [1]. In this paper,
we present a generic theoretical framework to obtain the optimal packet
distribution over multiple RATs when multiple user terminals are present in the
system and also when the system supports different QoS classes simultaneously.
We also propose a packet scheduling algorithm, called OMMA Leaky Bucket, to
achieve the optimal packet distribution scheme. A description of the
Opportunistic Multi-MAC Aggregation (OMMA) system architecture is presented
which includes functional description, discovery and association processes
between multi-RAT devices and dynamic RAT update management. We finally present
simulation results which show performance gains with the proposed OMMA Leaky
Bucket scheme in comparison to other existing mechanisms.
