Transport processes are considered for their abilities to generate flow in a
mixed-phase system of hadrons plus quark-gluon plasma exhibiting temperature
and density gradients. Diffusive mechanisms are found to be the leading
sources. Even after overcoming viscous effects, conductive and diffusive forces
generate flow velocities for pions in a model using kinetic theory to within
fifteen percent of light speed. Since such flow is not observed, this could
possibly rule out the mixed phase in the evolution of high energy heavy ion
collisions.
