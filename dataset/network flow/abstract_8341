A model of an evolving network of interacting molecular species is shown to
exhibit repeated rounds of crashes in which several species get rapidly
depopulated, followed by recoveries. The network inevitably self-organizes into
an autocatalytic structure, which consists of an irreducible `core' surrounded
by a parasitic `periphery'. Crashes typically occur when the existing
autocatalytic set becomes fragile and suffers a `core-shift', defined graph
theoretically. The nature of the recovery after a crash, in particular the time
of recovery, depends upon the organizational structure that survives the crash.
The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph is an important
signal of network fragility or robustness.
