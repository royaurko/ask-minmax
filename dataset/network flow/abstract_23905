Multicast data transfers occur in many distributed systems and applications
(e.g. IPTV, Grids, content delivery networks). Because of this, efficient
multicast data distribution optimization techniques are required. In the first
part of this paper we present a small diameter, bounded degree, collaborative
peer-to-peer multicast tree architecture, which supports dynamic node arrivals
and departures making local decisions only. The architecture is fault tolerant
and, at low arrival and departure rates, converges towards a theoretically
optimal structure. In the second part of the paper we consider several offline
data distribution optimization problems, for which we present novel and
time-efficient algorithmic solutions.
