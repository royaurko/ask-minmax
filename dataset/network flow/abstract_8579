Statistical properties of position-dependent ball-passing networks in real
football games are examined. We find that the networks have the small-world
property, and their degree distributions are fitted well by a truncated gamma
distribution function. In order to reproduce these properties of networks, a
model based on a Markov chain is proposed.
