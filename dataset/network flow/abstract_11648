Secure Transmission of data packets in Wireless Sensor Networks is an
important area of Research. There is a possibility of an attacker creating
security holes in the network. Hence, network security and reliability can be
achieved by discovering random multiple paths using multiple domains, and
forwarding data packets from the source node to the destination node. We have
designed, Multiple Domain Routing with Overlap of Nodes (MDRON) and Multiple
Domain Routing Without Overlap of Nodes (MDRWON) algorithms, in which packets
follow multiple optimized paths simultaneously. The Special node algorithm
searches the node which has maximum power and these nodes are used for
transferring the packet from one domain to another domain. Simulation results
using MATLAB shows that performance is better than Purely Random Propagation
(PRP) and Non Repetitive Random Propagation(NRRP) Algorithms.
