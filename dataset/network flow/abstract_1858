In this paper, an analytical model for DDoS attacks detection is proposed, in
which propagation of abrupt traffic changes inside public domain is monitored
to detect a wide range of DDoS attacks. Although, various statistical measures
can be used to construct profile of the traffic normally seen in the network to
identify anomalies whenever traffic goes out of profile, we have selected
volume and flow measure. Consideration of varying tolerance factors make
proposed detection system scalable to the varying network conditions and attack
loads in real time. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as
simulation testbed. Simulation results show that our proposed solution gives a
drastic improvement in terms of detection rate and false positive rate.
However, the mammoth volume generated by DDoS attacks pose the biggest
challenge in terms of memory and computational overheads as far as monitoring
and analysis of traffic at single point connecting victim is concerned. To
address this problem, a distributed cooperative technique is proposed that
distributes memory and computational overheads to all edge routers for
detecting a wide range of DDoS attacks at early stage.
