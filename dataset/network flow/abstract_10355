Recently a new method to set the scale in lattice gauge theories, based on
the gradient flow generated by the Wilson action, has been proposed, and the
systematic errors of the new scales t0 and w0 have been investigated by various
groups. The Wilson flow provides also an interesting alternative smoothing
procedure in particular useful for the measurement of the topological charge as
a pure gluonic observable. We show the viability of this method for N=1
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by analysing the configurations produced by
the DESY-Muenster collaboration. For increasing flow time the topological
charge quickly approaches near-integer values. The topological susceptibility
has been measured for different fermion masses and its value is observed to
approach zero in the chiral limit. Finally, the relation between the scale
defined by the Wilson flow and the topological charge has been investigated,
demonstrating a correlation between these two quantities.
