Thermal instabilities can cause a radiative shock to oscillate, thereby
modulating the emission from the post-shock region. The mode frequencies are
approximately quantised in analogy to those of a vibrating pipe. The stability
properties depend on the cooling processes, the electron-ion energy exchange
and the boundary conditions. This paper considers the effects of the lower
boundary condition on the post-shock flow, both ideally and for some specific
physical models. Specific cases include constant perturbed velocity, pressure,
density, flow rate, or temperature at the lower boundary, and the situation
with nonzero stationary flow velocity at the lower boundary. It is found that
for cases with zero terminal stationary velocity, the stability properties are
insensitive to the perturbed hydrodynamic variables at the lower boundary. The
luminosity responses are generally dependent on the lower boundary condition.
