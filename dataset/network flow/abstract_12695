We consider approaches for controlling the buildup of noise by design of
gates for chemical and biomolecular computing, in order to realize stable,
scalable networks for multi-step information processing. Solvable rate-equation
models are introduced and used to illustrate several recently developed
concepts and methodologies. We also outline future challenges and possible
research directions.
