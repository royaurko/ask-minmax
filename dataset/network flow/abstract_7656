In the first moments of a relativistic heavy ion collision explosive
collective flow begins to grow before the matter has yet equilibrated. Here it
is found that as long as the stress-energy tensor is traceless, early flow is
independent of whether the matter is composed of fields or particles,
equilibrated or not, or whether the stress-energy tensor is isotropic. This
eliminates much of the uncertainty in modeling early stages of a collision.
