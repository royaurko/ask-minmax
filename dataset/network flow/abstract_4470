We provide a Jacobian criterion that applies to arbitrary chemical reaction
networks taken with mass-action kinetics to preclude the existence of multiple
positive steady states within any stoichiometric class for any choice of rate
constants. We are concerned with the characterization of injective networks,
that is, networks for which the species formation rate function is injective in
the interior of the positive orthant within each stoichiometric class. We show
that a network is injective if and only if the determinant of the Jacobian of a
certain function does not vanish. The function consists of components of the
species formation rate function and a maximal set of independent conservation
laws. The determinant of the function is a polynomial in the species
concentrations and the rate constants (linear in the latter) and its
coefficients are fully determined. The criterion also precludes the existence
of degenerate steady states. Further, we relate injectivity of a chemical
reaction network to that of the chemical reaction network obtained by adding
outflow, or degradation, reactions for all species.
