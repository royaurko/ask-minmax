Recently, applications of millimeter (mm) waves for high-speed broadband
wireless local area network communication systems in indoor environment are
increasingly gaining recognition as it provides gigabit-speed wireless
communications with carrier-class performances over distances of a mile or more
due to spectrum availability and wider bandwidth requirements. Collectively
referred to as E-Band, the millimeter wave wireless technology present the
potential to offer bandwidth delivery comparable to that of fiber optic, but
without the financial and logistic challenges of deploying fiber. This paper
investigates the wideband parameters using the ray tracing technique for indoor
propagation systems with rms delay spread for Omnidirectional and Horn Antennas
for Bent Tunnel at 80GHz. The results obtained were 2.03 and 1.95 respectively,
besides, the normalized received power with 0:55?x10^8 excess delay at 70GHz
for Isotropic Antenna was at 0.97.
