There is currently limited understanding of the role played by haemodynamic
forces on the processes governing vascular development. One of many obstacles
to be overcome is being able to measure those forces, at the required
resolution level, on vessels only a few micrometres thick. In the current
paper, we present an in silico method for the computation of the haemodynamic
forces experienced by murine retinal vasculature (a widely used vascular
development animal model) beyond what is measurable experimentally. Our results
show that it is possible to reconstruct high-resolution three-dimensional
geometrical models directly from samples of retinal vasculature and that the
lattice-Boltzmann algorithm can be used to obtain accurate estimates of the
haemodynamics in these domains. We generate flow models from samples obtained
at postnatal days (P) 5 and 6. Our simulations show important differences
between the flow patterns recovered in both cases, including observations of
regression occurring in areas where wall shear stress gradients exist. We
propose two possible mechanisms to account for the observed increase in
velocity and wall shear stress between P5 and P6: i) the measured reduction in
typical vessel diameter between both time points, ii) the reduction in network
density triggered by the pruning process. The methodology developed herein is
applicable to other biomedical domains where microvasculature can be imaged but
experimental flow measurements are unavailable or difficult to obtain.
