In this paper we present the design and evaluation of intrusion detection
models for MANETs using supervised classification algorithms. Specifically, we
evaluate the performance of the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), the Linear
classifier, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), the Naive Bayes classifier and
the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of the classification
algorithms is evaluated under different traffic conditions and mobility
patterns for the Black Hole, Forging, Packet Dropping, and Flooding attacks.
The results indicate that Support Vector Machines exhibit high accuracy for
almost all simulated attacks and that Packet Dropping is the hardest attack to
detect.
