Bound vesicles subject to lateral forces such as arising from shear flow are
investigated theoretically by combining a lubrication analysis of the bound
part with a scaling approach to the global motion. A minor inclination of the
bound part leads to significant lift due to the additive effects of lateral and
tank-treading motions. With increasing shear rate, the vesicle unbinds from the
substrate at a critical value. Estimates are in agreement with recent
experimental data.
