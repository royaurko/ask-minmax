We combine wideband (1-20 GHz) Corbino disk and dielectric resonator (8.2
GHz) techniques to study the microwave properties in Nb/PdNi/Nb trilayers,
grown by UHV dc magnetron sputtering, composed by Nb layers of nominal
thickness $d_S$=15 nm, and a ferromagnetic PdNi layer of thickness $d_F$= 1, 2,
8 and 9 nm. We focus on the vortex state. Magnetic fields up to $H_{c2}$ were
applied. The microwave resistivity at fixed $H/H_{c2}$ increases with $d_F$,
eventually exceeding the Bardeen Stephen flux flow value.
