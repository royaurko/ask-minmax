A two-lane extension of a recently proposed cellular automaton model for
traffic flow is discussed. The analysis focuses on the reproduction of the lane
usage inversion and the density dependence of the number of lane changes. It is
shown that the single-lane dynamics can be extended to the two-lane case
without changing the basic properties of the model which are known to be in
good agreement with empirical single-vehicle data. Therefore it is possible to
reproduce various empirically observed two-lane phenomena, like the
synchronization of the lanes, without fine-tuning of the model parameters.
