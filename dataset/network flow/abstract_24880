Vehicular networks allow vehicles to constantly share information with each
other and their surrounding, and are expected to be an integral part in future
intelligent transportation system (ITS). However, the diversity of ITS
applications in combination with the extremely stringent demands in particular
posed by safety critical applications makes the design of vehicular
communication a challenging task. 5G device-to-device communication as well as
802.11p are promising to address this challenge. In order to guide and validate
the design process, analytical expressions of key performance metrics such as
outage probability an throughput are necessary. In this paper, we focus on the
intersection scenario, and present a general procedure to analytically
determine the success probability of a selected link as well as system-wide
throughput. We provide an overview of the salient properties of vehicular
communication systems near intersections and show how the procedure can be used
to model signal propagation conditions typical to different environments of
practical relevance, for instance rural and urban scenarios. The results
indicate that the procedure is sufficiently general and flexible to deal with a
variety of scenarios, and can thus serve as a useful design tool for
communication system engineers, complementing simulations and experiments.
