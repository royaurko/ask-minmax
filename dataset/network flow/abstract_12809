In the letter by Stadnik and Flambaum [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 151301 (2014)]
it is claimed that topological defects passing through pulsars could be
responsible for the observed pulsar glitches. Here, we show that, independently
of the detailed network dynamics and defect dimensionality, defect networks
cannot be at the origin of the pulsar glitch phenomenon.
