Recently, a minimal kinetic model for fluid flow, known as entropic lattice
Boltzmann method, has been proposed for the simulation of isothermal
hydrodynamic flows. At variance with previous Lattice Boltzmann methods, the
entropic version permits to describe the non-linear dynamics of short scales in
a controlled and stable way. In this paper, we provide the first numerical
evidence that the entropic lattice Boltzmann scheme provides a quantitatively
correct description of the large-scale structures of two-dimensional
turbulence, free of numerical instabilities. This indicates that the entropic
lattice Boltzmann method might provide a starting basis for the formulation of
a new class of turbulence models based on genuinely kinetic principles.
