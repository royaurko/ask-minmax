We investigate the Majority-Vote Model with two states ($-1,+1$) and a noise
$q$ on Apollonian networks. The main result found here is the presence of the
phase transition as a function of the noise parameter $q$. We also studies de
effect of redirecting a fraction $p$ of the links of the network. By means of
Monte Carlo simulations, we obtained the exponent ratio $\gamma/\nu$,
$\beta/\nu$, and $1/\nu$ for several values of rewiring probability $p$. The
critical noise was determined $q_{c}$ and $U^{*}$ also was calculated. The
effective dimensionality of the system was observed to be independent on $p$,
and the value $D_{eff} \approx1.0$ is observed for these networks. Previous
results on the Ising model in Apollonian Networks have reported no presence of
a phase transition. Therefore, the results present here demonstrate that the
Majority-Vote Model belongs to a different universality class as the
equilibrium Ising Model on Apollonian Network.
