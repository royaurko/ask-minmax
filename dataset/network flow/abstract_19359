According to the fireball model GRBs are produced when a relativistic flow is
dissipated by shocks. The questions how does a GRB's "inner engine" accelerates
and collimated the relativistic flow is today the most interesting (and most
difficult) open question concerning GRBs. We summarize, here, the known
constrains on the "inner engines". These constrains arise mostly from the
temporal structure seen in the light curves of GRBs. We discuss the well-known
NO GO theorem: An explosive source cannot produce a variable GRB. We show that
various attempts to find a way around this theorem are rules out by new
observational data: similarity between pulse width and pulse intervals and a
correlation between a pulse and the preceding interval. We show that a simple
toy model explains these features in terms of the internal shocks model. We
discuss the implications of these findings to GRBs' inner engines.
