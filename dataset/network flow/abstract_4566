There has been a surge of interest in community detection in homogeneous
single-relational networks which contain only one type of nodes and edges.
However, many real-world systems are naturally described as heterogeneous
multi-relational networks which contain multiple types of nodes and edges. In
this paper, we propose a new method for detecting communities in such networks.
Our method is based on optimizing the composite modularity, which is a new
modularity proposed for evaluating partitions of a heterogeneous
multi-relational network into communities. Our method is parameter-free,
scalable, and suitable for various networks with general structure. We
demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in detecting
pre-planted communities in synthetic networks. Applied to a real-world Digg
network, it successfully detects meaningful communities.
