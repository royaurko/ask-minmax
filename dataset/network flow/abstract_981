Based on a non-equilibrium mechanism for spatial pattern formation we study
how position information can be controlled by locally coupled discrete
dynamical networks, similar to gene regulation networks of cells in a
developing multicellular organism. As an example we study the developmental
problems of domain formation and proportion regulation in the presence of
noise, as well as in the presence of cell flow. We find that networks that
solve this task exhibit a hierarchical structure of information processing and
are of similar complexity as developmental circuits of living cells. Proportion
regulation is scalable with system size and leads to sharp, precisely localized
boundaries of gene expression domains, even for large numbers of cells. A
detailed analysis of noise-induced dynamics, using a mean-field approximation,
shows that noise in gene expression states stabilizes (rather than disrupts)
the spatial pattern in the presence of cell movements, both for stationary as
well as growing systems. Finally, we discuss how this mechanism could be
realized in the highly dynamic environment of growing tissues in multi-cellular
organisms.
