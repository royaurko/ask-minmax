The electrical structure of the power grid is utilized to address the phasor
measurement unit (PMU) placement problem. First, we derive the connectivity
matrix of the network using the resistance distance metric and employ it in the
linear program formulation to obtain the optimal number of PMUs, for complete
network observability without zero injection measurements. This approach was
developed by the contributor in an earlier work, but the solution methodology to
address the location problem did not fully utilize the electrical properties of
the network, resulting in an ambiguity. In this paper, we settle this issue by
exploiting the coupling structure of the grid derived using the singular value
decomposition (SVD)-based analysis of the resistance distance matrix to solve
the location problem. Our study, which is based on recent advances in complex
networks that promote the electrical structure of the grid over its topological
structure and the SVD analysis which throws light on the electrical coupling of
the network, results in a unified framework for the electrical structure-based
PMU placement. The proposed method is tested on IEEE bus systems, and the
results uncover intriguing connections between the singular vectors and average
resistance distance between buses in the network.
