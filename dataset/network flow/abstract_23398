The merger of two like-signed vortices is a well-studied problem, but in a
turbulent flow, we may often have more than two like-signed vortices
interacting. We study the merger of three or more identical co-rotating
vortices initially arranged on the vertices of a regular polygon. At low to
moderate Reynolds numbers, we find an additional stage in the merger process,
absent in the merger of two vortices, where an annular vortical structure is
formed and is long-lived. Vortex merger is slowed down significantly due to
this. Such annular vortices are known at far higher Reynolds numbers in studies
of tropical cyclones, which have been noticed to break down into individual
vortices. In the pre-annular stage, vortical structures in a viscous flow tilt
and realign in a manner similar to the inviscid case, but the pronounced
filaments visible in the latter are practically absent in the former. Five or
fewer vortices initially elongate radially, and then reorient their long axis
closer to the azimuthal direction so as to form an annulus. With six or more
vortices, the initial alignment is already azimuthal. At higher Reynolds
numbers, the merger of an odd number of vortices proceeds very differently from
that of an even number. The former process is rapid and chaotic whereas the
latter proceeds more slowly via pairing events.
  It is hoped that the present findings will motivate studies on how multiple
vortex interactions affect the inverse cascade in two-dimensional turbulence.
