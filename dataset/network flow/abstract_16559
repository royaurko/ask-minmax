We present a continuum model for a nematic elastomer network formed in a
chiral environment, for instance in the presence of a chiral solvent. When this
environment is removed, the network can retain some memory of its chiral
genesis. We predict the residual chiral order parameter for a number of
possible scenarios, and go on to examine the robustness (stability) of the
imprinted chirality. We show that a twist-untwist transition can take place,
which determines whether the imprinting has been successful. A transition is
via a coarsening of the helical director pattern and a lengthening of its
pitch. Finally, the effect due to a subsequent swelling by an achiral solvent,
or by a solvent of differing chirality, is considered.
