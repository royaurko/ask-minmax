We study the dynamics of stellar wind from one of the bodies in the binary
system, where the other body interacts only gravitationally. We focus on
following three issues: (i) we explore the origin of observed periodic
variations in maser intensity; (ii) we address the nature of bipolar molecular
outflows; and (iii) we show generation of baroclinicity in the same model
setup. From direct numerical simulations and further numerical modelling, we
find that the maser intensity along a given line of sight varies periodically
due to periodic modulation of material density. This modulation period is of
the order of the binary period. Another feature of this model is that the
velocity structure of the flow remains unchanged with time in late stages of
wind evolution. Therefore the location of the masing spot along the chosen
sightline stays at the same spatial location, thus naturally explaining the
observational fact. This also gives an appearance of bipolar nature in the
standard position-velocity diagram, as has been observed in a number of
molecular outflows. Remarkably, we also find the generation of baroclinicity in
the flow around binary system, offering another site where the seed magnetic
fields could possibly be generated due to the Biermann battery mechanisms,
within galaxies.
