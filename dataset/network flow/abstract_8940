Long and thin covers of flow spaces are important ingredients in the proof of
the Farrell--Jones conjecture for certain classes of groups, like hyperbolic
and CAT(0)-groups. In this paper we provide an alternative construction of such
covers which holds in a more general setting and simplifies some of the
arguments.
