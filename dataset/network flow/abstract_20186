In the linear response approximation, coherently driven microcavity
polaritons in the pump-only configuration are expected to satisfy the Landau
criterion for superfluidity at either strong enough pump powers or small flow
velocities. Here, we solve non-perturbatively the time dependent
Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing the resonantly-driven polariton system. We
show that, even in the limit of asymptotically large densities, where in linear
response approximation the system satisfies the Landau criterion, the fluid
always experiences a residual drag force when flowing through the defect. We
illustrate the result in terms of the polariton lifetime being finite, finding
that the equilibrium limit of zero drag can only be recovered in the case of
perfect microcavities. In general, both the drag force exerted by the defect on
the fluid, as well as the height of Cerenkov radiation, and the percentage of
particles scattered by the defect, show a smooth crossover rather than a sharp
threshold-like behaviour typical of superfluids which obey the Landau
criterion.
