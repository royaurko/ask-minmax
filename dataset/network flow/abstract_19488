A detailed analysis is presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the
lattice Boltzmann method. Thorough comparisons with other numerical solutions
for the two-dimensional, driven cavity flow show that the lattice Boltzmann
method gives accurate results over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Studies of
errors and convergence rates are carried out. Compressibility effects are
quantified for different maximum velocities, and parameter ranges are found for
stable simulations. The paper's objective is to stimulate further work using
this relatively new approach for applied engineering problems in transport
phenomena utilizing parallel computers.
