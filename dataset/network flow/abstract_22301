A regression modeling method of space weather prediction is proposed. It
allows forecasting Dst index up to 6 hours ahead with about 90% correlation. It
can also be used for constructing phenomenological models of interaction
between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. With its help two new
geoeffective parameters were found: latitudinal and longitudinal flow angles of
the solar wind. It was shown that Dst index remembers its previous values for
2000 hours.
