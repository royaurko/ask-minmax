Consider the Kahler-Ricci flow with finite time singularities over any closed
Kahler manifold. We prove the existence of the flow limit in the sense of
current towards the time of singularity. This answers affirmatively a problem
raised by Tian on the uniqueness of the weak limit from sequential convergence
construction. The notion of minimal singularity in the study of positive
current, introduced by Demailly, comes up naturally. We also provide some
discussion on the infinite time singularity case for comparison. The
consideration can be applied to more flexible evolution equation of
Kahler-Ricci flow type for any cohomology class. The study is related to
general conjectures on the singularities of Kahler-Ricci flows.
