Because Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become increasingly important in
the last decade, they have motivated a great deal of research on social network
analysis (SNA). Currently, SNA algorithms are evaluated on real datasets
obtained from large-scale OSNs, which are usually sampled by
Breadth-First-Search (BFS), Random Walk (RW), or some variations of the latter.
However, none of the released datasets provides any statistical guarantees on
the difference between the crawled datasets and the ground truth. Moreover, all
existing sampling algorithms only focus on crawling a single OSN, but each OSN
is actually a sampling of a global offline social network. Hence, even if the
whole dataset from a single OSN is crawled, the results may still be skewed and
may not fully reflect the properties of the global offline social network. To
address the above issues, we have made the first attempt to explore the joint
sampling of multiple OSNs and propose an approach called Quality-guaranteed
Multi-network Sampler (QMSampler) that can crawl and jointly sample multiple
OSNs. QMSampler provides a statistical guarantee on the difference between the
crawled real dataset and the ground truth (the perfect integration of all
OSNs). Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
generates a much smaller bias than any existing method. QMSampler has also been
released as a free download.
