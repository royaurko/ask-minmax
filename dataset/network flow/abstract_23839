We study the connectivity properties of random Bluetooth graphs that model
certain "ad hoc" wireless networks. The graphs are obtained as "irrigation
subgraphs" of the well-known random geometric graph model. There are two
parameters that control the model: the radius $r$ that determines the "visible
neighbors" of each node and the number of edges $c$ that each node is allowed
to send to these. The randomness comes from the underlying distribution of data
points in space and from the choices of each vertex. We prove that no
connectivity can take place with high probability for a range of parameters $r,
c$ and completely characterize the connectivity threshold (in $c$) for values
of $r$ close the critical value for connectivity in the underlying random
geometric graph.
