We present angular momentum transport (torque) measurements in two recent
experimental studies of the turbulent flow between independently rotating
cylinders. In addition to these studies, we reanalyze prior torque measurements
to expand the range of control parameters for the experimental Taylor-Couette
flows. We find that the torque may be described as a product of functions that
depend only on the Reynolds number, which describes the turbulent driving
intensity, and the rotation number, which characterizes the effects of global
rotation. For a given Reynolds number, the global angular momentum transport
for Keplerian-like flow profiles is approximately 14% of the maximum achievable
transport rate. We estimate that this level of transport would produce an
accretion rate of $\dot{M}/\dot{M_0} \sim 10^{-3}$ in astrophysical disks. We
argue that this level of transport from hydrodynamics alone could be
significant.
