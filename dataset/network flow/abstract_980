Suppose that under the action of gravity, liquid drains through the unit
$d$-cube via a minimal-length network of channels constrained to pass through
random sites and to flow with nonnegative component in one of the canonical
orthogonal basis directions of $\R^d$, $d \geq 2$. The resulting network is a
version of the so-called minimal directed spanning tree. We give laws of large
numbers and convergence in distribution results on the large-sample asymptotic
behaviour of the total power-weighted edge-length of the network on uniform
random points in $(0,1)^d$. The distributional results exhibit a
weight-dependent phase transition between Gaussian and boundary-effect-derived
distributions. These boundary contributions are characterized in terms of
limits of the so-called on-line nearest-neighbour graph, a natural model of
spatial network evolution, for which we also present some new results. Also, we
give a convergence in distribution result for the length of the longest edge in
the drainage network; when $d=2$, the limit is expressed in terms of
Dickman-type variables.
