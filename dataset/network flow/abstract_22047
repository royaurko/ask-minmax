The diffusive motion of colloidal particles dispersed in a premelting solid
is analyzed within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics. We determine
the mass diffusion coefficient, thermal diffusion coefficient and Soret
coefficient of the particles in the dilute limit, and find good agreement with
experimental data. In contrast to liquid suspensions, the unique nature of
premelting solids allows us to derive an expression for the Dufour coefficient
and independently verify the Onsager reciprocal relation coupling diffusion to
the flow of heat.
