IEEE 802.11 is a widely used wireless LAN standard for medium access control.
TCP is a prominent transport protocol originally designed for wired networks.
TCP treats packet loss as congestion and reduces the data rate. In wireless
networks packets are lost not only due to congestion but also due to various
other reasons. Hence there is need for making TCP adaptable to wireless
networks. Various parameters of TCP and IEEE 802.11 can be set to appropriate
values to achieve optimum performance results. In this paper optimum values for
various parameters of IEEE 802.11 are determined. Network simulator NS2 is used
for simulation.
