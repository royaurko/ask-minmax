The transverse momentum flow inside jets is a sensitive measure of internal
jet structure. For the current jets in deep inelastic scattering this jet shape
measure is determined at order alpha_s^2, i.e. with up to three partons inside
a single jet. The scale dependence of jet shapes in various jet algorithms is
discussed. Results agree well with recent measurements by the ZEUS
Collaboration, without introducing the hadronization parameter R_sep.
