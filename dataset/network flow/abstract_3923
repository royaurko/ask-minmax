Our current world is revolutionned by the networks which are interconnecting
any machine to any other one. Nowadays equipments are plugged to the network by
the way of many different network adapters (Ethernet, wifi, GSM), and network
equipments are more and more interconnected to each other creating a highly
mesh network. Thus, redundant paths are created between any two endpoints
enabling multipath or the use of multiple paths to handle a communication. The
benefits of multipath are the enhancement of robustness against failure, and
minimizing communication cost. In the present work, we will talk about some
solutions of multipath applied to the transport level. We will expose the most
important problem facing multipath which is packet reordering, and we will also
expose results of our simulations.
