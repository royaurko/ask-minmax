We introduce a variant of the asymmetric random average process with
continuous state variables where the maximal transport is restricted by a
cutoff. For periodic boundary conditions, we show the existence of a phase
transition between a pure high flow phase and a mixed phase, whereby the latter
consists of a homogeneous high flow and a condensed low flow substate without
translation invariance. The finite system alternates between these substates
which both have diverging lifetimes in the thermodynamic limit, so ergodicity
is broken in the infinite system. However, the scaling behaviour of the
lifetimes in dependence of the system size is different due to different
underlying flipping mechanisms.
