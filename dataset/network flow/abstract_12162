IEEE 802.16 standard supports two different topologies: point to multipoint
(PMP) and Mesh. In this paper, a QoS mechanism for point to multipoint of IEEE
802.16 and BS scheduler for PMP Mode is proposed. This paper also describes
quality of service over WiMAX networks. Average WiMAX delay, Average WiMAX load
and Average WiMAX throughput at base station is analyzed and compared by
applying different scheduler at Base station and at fixed nodes.
