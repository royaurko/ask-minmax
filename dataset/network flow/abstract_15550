Energy efficiency is an important performance measure of wireless network
protocols, especially for battery-powered mobile devices such as smartphones.
This paper presents a new energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) scheme
for fully connected wireless ad hoc networks. The proposed scheme reduces
energy consumption by putting radio interfaces in the sleep state periodically
and by reducing transmission collisions, which results in high throughput and
low packet transmission delay. The proposed MAC scheme can also address the
energy saving in realtime traffics which require very low packet transmission
delay. An analytical model is established to evaluate the performance of the
proposed MAC scheme. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme has a significantly lower power consumption, achieves
substantially higher throughput, and has lower packet transmission delay in
comparison with existing power saving MAC protocols.
