We consider the Landau-Lifshitz equations of ferromagnetism (including the
harmonic map heat-flow and Schroedinger flow as special cases) for degree m
equivariant maps from R^2 to S^2. If m \geq 3, we prove that near-minimal
energy solutions converge to a harmonic map as t goes to infinity (asymptotic
stability), extending previous work down to degree m = 3. Due to slow spatial
decay of the harmonic map components, a new approach is needed for m=3,
involving (among other tools) a "normal form" for the parameter dynamics, and
the 2D radial double-endpoint Strichartz estimate for Schroedinger operators
with sufficiently repulsive potentials (which may be of some independent
interest). When m=2 this asymptotic stability may fail: in the case of
heat-flow with a further symmetry restriction, we show that more exotic
asymptotics are possible, including infinite-time concentration (blow-up), and
even "eternal oscillation".
