The Cisco router in Low Earth Orbit (CLEO) was launched into space as an
experimental secondary payload onboard the UK Disaster Monitoring Constellation
(UK-DMC) satellite in September 2003. The UK-DMC satellite is one of an
increasing number of DMC satellites in orbit that rely on the Internet Protocol
(IP) for command and control and for delivery of data from payloads. The DMC
satellites, built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), have imaged the
effects of Hurricane Katrina, the Indian Ocean Tsunami, and other events for
disaster relief under the International Space and Major Disasters Charter. It
was possible to integrate the Cisco mobile access router into the UK-DMC
satellite as a result of the DMC satellites' adoption of existing commercial
networking standards, using IP over Frame Relay over standard High-Level Data
Link Control, or HDLC (ISO 13239) on standard serial interfaces. This approach
came from work onboard SSTL's earlier UoSAT-12 satellite
