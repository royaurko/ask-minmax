An extension of hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode of inhomogeneous sheared plasma
flow along the magnetic field into the short-wavelength limit, where the
hydrodynamic treatment is not valid, has been considered. We find that D'Angelo
mode in this wavelength range is excited by inverse ion Landau damping and
becomes the shear flow driven ion-kinetic mode.
