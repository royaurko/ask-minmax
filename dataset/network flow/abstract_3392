We describe a new type of dynamical model for hot gas in galaxy groups and
clusters in which gas moves simultaneously in both radial directions.
Circulation flows are consistent with (1) the failure to observe cooling gas in
X-ray spectra, (2) multiphase gas observed near the centers of these flows and
(3) the accumulation of iron in the hot gas from Type Ia supernovae in the
central galaxy. Dense inflowing gas cools, producing a positive central
temperature gradient, as in normal cooling flows. Bubbles of hot, buoyant gas
flow outward. Circulation flows eventually cool catastrophically if the outward
flowing gas transports mass but no heat; to maintain the circulation both mass
and energy must be supplied to the inflowing gas over a large volume, extending
to the cooling radius. The rapid radial recirculation of gas produces a flat
central core in the gas iron abundance, similar to many observations. We
believe the circulation flows described here are the first gasdynamic,
long-term evolutionary models that are in good agreement with all essential
features observed in the hot gas: little or no gas cools as required by XMM
spectra, the gas temperature increases outward near the center, and the gaseous
iron abundance is about solar near the center and decreases outward.
