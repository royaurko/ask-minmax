Network Constructors are an extension of the standard population protocol
model in which finite-state agents interact in pairs under the control of an
adversary scheduler. In this work we present NETCS, a simulator designed to
evaluate the performance of various network constructors and population
protocols under different schedulers and network configurations. Our simulator
provides researchers with an intuitive user interface and a quick
experimentation environment to evaluate their work. It also harnesses the power
of the cloud, as experiments are executed remotely and scheduled through the
web interface provided. To prove the validity and quality of our simulator we
provide an extensive evaluation of multiple protocols with more than 100000
experiments for different network sizes and configurations that validate the
correctness of the theoretical analysis of existing protocols and estimate the
real values of the hidden asymptotic coefficients. We also show experimentally
(with more than 40000 experiments) that a probabilistic algorithm is capable of
counting the actual size of the network in bounded time given a unique leader.
