We provide a quick overview of various calculus tools and of the main results
concerning the heat flow on compact metric measure spaces, with applications to
spaces with lower Ricci curvature bounds.
  Topics include the Hopf-Lax semigroup and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in
metric spaces, a new approach to differentiation and to the theory of Sobolev
spaces over metric measure spaces, the equivalence of the L^2-gradient flow of
a suitably defined "Dirichlet energy" and the Wasserstein gradient flow of the
relative entropy functional, a metric version of Brenier's Theorem, and a new
(stronger) definition of Ricci curvature bound from below for metric measure
spaces. This new notion is stable w.r.t. measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence
and it is strictly connected with the linearity of the heat flow.
