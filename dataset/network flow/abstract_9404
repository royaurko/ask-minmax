We investigate the evolutionary dynamics in directed and/or weighted
networks. We study the fixation probability of a mutant in finite populations
in stochastic voter-type dynamics for several update rules. The fixation
probability is defined as the probability of a newly introduced mutant in a
wild-type population taking over the entire population. In contrast to the case
of undirected and unweighted networks, the fixation probability of a mutant in
directed networks is characterized not only by the degree of the node that the
mutant initially invades but by the global structure of networks. Consequently,
the gross connectivity of networks such as small-world property or modularity
has a major impact on the fixation probability.
