In the compromise model of continuous opinions proposed by Deffuant et al,
the states of two agents in a network can start to converge if they are
neighbors and if their opinions are sufficiently close to each other, below a
given threshold of tolerance $\epsilon$. In directed networks, if agent i is a
neighbor of agent j, j need not be a neighbor of i. In Watts-Strogatz networks
we performed simulations to find the averaged number of final opinions $<F>$
and their distribution as a function of $\epsilon$ and of the network
structural disorder. In directed networks $<F>$ exhibits a rich structure,
being larger than in undirected networks for higher values of $\epsilon$, and
smaller for lower values of $\epsilon$.
