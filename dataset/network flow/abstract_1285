In order to accommodate increasing need and offer communication with high
performance, both vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
communications are exploited. The advantages of static nodes and vehicular
nodes are combined to achieve an optimal routing scheme. In this paper, we
consider the communications between a static node and the vehicular nodes
moving in an adjacent area of it. The adjacent area is defined as the zone
where a vehicular can communicate with the static node within maximum two hops.
We only consider single-hop and two-hop transmissions because these
transmissions can be considered as building blocks to construct transmissions
with a higher number of hops. Different cases in which an uplink or a downlink
for the two-hop user combined with an uplink or a downlink for the single-hop
user correspond to different CDR schemes. Using side information to
intentionally cancel the interference, Network Coding (NC), CDR, overhearing
and multi-way schemes aggregate communications flows in order to increase the
performance of the network. We apply the mentioned schemes to a V2I network and
propose novel schemes to optimally arrange and combine the transmissions.
