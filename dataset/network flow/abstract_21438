The Chandra discovery of bright X-ray emission from kpc-scale jets provides
us unprecedented insights into the physical state of the plasma in the flow. In
particular it is possible to get good constraints on the power and pressure in
bright knots. For a group of selected sources with blazar-type cores it is also
possible to constrain the physical quantities of the jet at sub-pc scale. We
discuss how these results can help us to connect the properties of the jet at
different scales.
