The aim of this paper is to discuss potential advances in PET kinetic models
and direct reconstruction of kinetic parameters. As a prominent example we
focus on a typical task in perfusion imaging and derive a system of
transport-reaction-diffusion equations, which is able to include macroscopic
flow properties in addition to the usual exchange between arteries, veins, and
tissues.
  For this system we propose an inverse problem of estimating all relevant
parameters from PET data. We interpret the parameter identification as a
nonlinear inverse problem, for which we formulate and analyze variational
regularization approaches. For the numerical solution we employ gradient-based
methods and appropriate splitting methods, which are used to investigate some
test cases.
