We compute the renormalization group flow of O(N) scalar field theories in de
Sitter space using nonperturbative renormalization group techniques in the
local potential approximation. We obtain the flow of the effective potential on
superhorizon scales for arbitrary space-time dimension D=d+1. We show that, due
to strong infrared fluctuations, the latter is qualitatively similar to the
corresponding one in Euclidean space with D=0. It follows that spontaneously
broken symmetries are radiatively restored in any space-time dimension and for
any value of N.
