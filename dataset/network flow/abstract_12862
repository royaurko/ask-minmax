A method of construction of decomposition of correlation functions of
developed turbulence in a compressible fluid on Mach number {\em Ma} is
generalized now for a model of stochastic magnetic hydrodynamics. With the help
of the field theory renormalization group method the composite operators of
transversal fields are studied. It is shown, that in the case of hydrodynamical
interaction of fluid flows is prevalent the compressible effects are essential
in inertial range. On the contrary the corrections to developed turbulent
spectra due to compressibility are insignificant if the magnetic interaction of
flows is more important one.
