The rigidity of elastic networks depends sensitively on their internal
connectivity and the nature of the interactions between constituents. Particles
interacting via central forces undergo a zero-temperature rigidity-percolation
transition near the isostatic threshold, where the constraints and internal
degrees of freedom are equal in number. Fibrous networks, such as those that
form the cellular cytoskeleton, become rigid at a lower threshold due to
additional bending constraints. However, the degree to which bending governs
network mechanics remains a subject of considerable debate. We study disordered
fibrous networks with variable coordination number, both above and below the
central-force isostatic point. This point controls a broad crossover from
stretching- to bending-dominated elasticity. Strikingly, this crossover
exhibits an anomalous power-law dependence of the shear modulus on both
stretching and bending rigidities. At the central-force isostatic point---well
above the rigidity threshold---we find divergent strain fluctuations together
with a divergent correlation length $\xi$, implying a breakdown of continuum
elasticity in this simple mechanical system on length scales less than $\xi$.
