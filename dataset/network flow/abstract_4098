The present thesis deals with the theoretical study of multi-fragmentation
and its related phenomena's like directed transverse flow, rapidity
distribution, elliptical flow and nuclear stopping in intermediate energy
heavy-ion collisions for asymmetric colliding nuclei. We aim to discuss the
role of Coulomb interactions, nuclear equations of state (NEOS) and various
rapidity bins by taking mass asymmetry into account.
