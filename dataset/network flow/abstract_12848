We study experimentally the flow of a liquid metal confined between
differentially rotating cylinders, in the presence of externally imposed axial
and azimuthal magnetic fields. For increasingly large azimuthal fields a
wave-like disturbance arises, traveling along the axis of the cylinders. The
wavelengths and speeds of these structures, as well as the field strengths and
rotation rates at which they arise, are broadly consistent with theoretical
predictions of such a traveling wave magnetorotational instability.
