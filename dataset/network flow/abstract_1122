A dynamical transition separating intermittent and continuous flow is
observed in a sandpile model, with scaling functions relating the transport
behaviors between both regimes. The width of the active zone diverges with
system size in the avalanche regime but becomes very narrow for continuous
flow. The change of the mean slope, Delta z, on increasing the driving rate, r,
obeys Delta z ~ r^{1/theta}. It has nontrivial scaling behavior in the
continuous flow phase with an exponent theta given, paradoxically, only in
terms of exponents characterizing the avalanches theta = (1+z-D)/(3-D).
