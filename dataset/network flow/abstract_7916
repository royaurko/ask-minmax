This thesis analyze the Wasserstein gradient flow of a functional defined as
a double convolution of a non-smooth repulsive interaction potential. To be
more precise, the potential under investigation has a -|x| behavior close to
the origin. The already existent machinery of Wasserstein gradient flow is well
posed for lambda-convex potential. In this case this property is lost, but it
is proven that in the one dimensional case existence and uniqueness of the
solution is still achieved.
