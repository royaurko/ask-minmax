Metabolic systems are governed by a compromise between metabolic benefit and
enzyme cost. This hypothesis and its consequences can be studied by kinetic
models in which enzyme profiles are chosen by optimality principles. In
enzyme-optimal states, active enzymes must provide benefits: a higher enzyme
level must provide a metabolic benefit to justify the additional enzyme cost.
This entails general relations between metabolic fluxes, reaction elasticities,
and enzyme costs, the laws of metabolic economics. The laws can be formulated
using economic potentials and loads, state variables that quantify how
metabolites, reactions, and enzymes affect the metabolic performance in a
steady state. Economic balance equations link them to fluxes, reaction
elasticities, and enzyme levels locally in the network. Economically feasible
fluxes must be free of futile cycles and must lead from lower to higher
economic potentials, just like thermodynamics makes them lead from higher to
lower chemical potentials. Metabolic economics provides algebraic conditions
for economical fluxes, which are independent of the underlying kinetic models.
It justifies and extends the principle of minimal fluxes and shows how to
construct kinetic models in enzyme-optimal states, where all enzymes have a
positive influence on the metabolic performance.
