We study gauge-string duality of D3-branes localized at a point on the
resolution of the ALE orbifold $\IC^3/\IZ_3$. By explicitly solving for the
warp factor, we demonstrate the holographic RG flow from $AdS_5 \times
S^5/\IZ_3$ (far away from the resolution) to the usual $AdS_5\times S^5$ (close
to the stack). On the gauge theory side, this maps to the flow between the
quiver gauge theory and ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. We present two possible
scenarios for this RG flow depending on the choice of the VEVs. In particular,
one of the scenarios proceeds by two steps involving both Higgsing and
confinement.
