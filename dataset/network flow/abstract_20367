Efficient mixing of colloids, particles or molecules is a central issue in
many processes. It results from the complex interplay between flow deformations
and molecular diffusion, which is generally assumed to control the
homogenization processes. In this work we demonstrate on the contrary that
despite fixed flow and self-diffusion conditions, the chaotic mixing of
colloidal suspensions can be either boosted or inhibited by the sole addition
of trace amount of salt as a co-mixing species. Indeed, this shows that local
saline gradients can trigger a chemically-driven transport phenomenon,
diffusiophoresis, which controls the rate and direction of molecular transport
far more efficiently than usual Brownian diffusion. A simple model combining
the elementary ingredients of chaotic mixing with diffusiophoretic transport of
the colloids allows to rationalize our observations and highlights how
small-scale out-of-equilibrium transport bridges to mixing at much larger
scales in a very effective way. Considering chaotic mixing as a prototypal
building block for turbulent mixing, this suggests that these phenomena,
occurring whenever the chemical environment is inhomogeneous, might bring
interesting perspective from micro-systems up to large-scale situations, with
examples ranging from ecosystems to industrial contexts.
