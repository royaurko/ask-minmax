A model of cellular metabolism due to S. Kauffman is analyzed. It consists of
a network of Boolean gates randomly assembled according to a probability
distribution. It is shown that the behavior of the network depends very
critically on certain simple algebraic parameters of the distribution. In some
cases, the analytic results support conclusions based on simulations of random
Boolean networks, but in other cases, they do not.
