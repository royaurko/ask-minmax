As ATM applications deploy for a banking system, the need to secure
communications will become critical. However, multicast protocols do not fit
the point-to-point model of most network security protocols which were designed
with unicast communications in mind. In recent years, we have seen the
emergence and the growing of ATMs (Automatic Teller Machines) in banking
systems. Many banks are extending their activity and increasing transactions by
using ATMs. ATM will allow them to reach more customers in a cost effective way
and to make their transactions fast and efficient. However, communicating in
the network must satisfy integrity, privacy, confidentiality, authentication
and non-repudiation. Many frameworks have been implemented to provide security
in communication and transactions. In this paper, we analyze ATM communication
protocol and propose a novel framework for ATM systems that allows entities
communicate in a secure way without using a lot of storage. We describe the
architecture and operation of SFAMSS in detail. Our framework is implemented
with Java and the software architecture, and its components are studied in
detailed.
