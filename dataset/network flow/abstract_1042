A class of models describing the flow of information within networks via
routing processes is proposed and investigated, concentrating on the effects of
memory traces on the global properties. The long-term flow of information is
governed by cyclic attractors, allowing to define a measure for the information
centrality of a vertex given by the number of attractors passing through this
vertex. We find the number of vertices having a non-zero information centrality
to be extensive/sub-extensive for models with/without a memory trace in the
thermodynamic limit. We evaluate the distribution of the number of cycles, of
the cycle length and of the maximal basins of attraction, finding a complete
scaling collapse in the thermodynamic limit for the latter. Possible
implications of our results on the information flow in social networks are
discussed.
