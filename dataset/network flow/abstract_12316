A novel distributed compressed wideband sensing scheme for Cognitive Radio
Sensor Networks (CRSN) is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of the
distributive nature of CRSN, the proposed scheme deploys only one single
narrowband sampler with ultra-low sampling rate at each nodes to accomplish the
wideband spectrum sensing. First, the practical structure of the compressed
sampler at each node is described in detail. Second, we show how the Fusion
Center (FC) exploits the sampled signals with their spectrum randomly-aliased
to detect the global wideband spectrum activity. Finally, the proposed scheme
is validated through extensive simulations, which shows that it is particularly
suitable for CRSN.
