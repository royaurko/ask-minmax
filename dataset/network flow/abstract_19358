The extreme hypothesis that essentially all types of ultrarelativistic
outflow -- specifically AGN jets, pulsar wind nebulae and GRB --are
electromagnetic, rather than gas dynamical, phenomena is considered.
Electromagnetic flows are naturally anisotropic and self-collimating so as to
produce jet-like features. The relativistic force-free description of these
flows, which is simpler than the relativistic MHD description, is explained. It
is suggested that the magnetic field associated with AGN jets and GRB is quite
extensively distributed in latitude, without necessarily increasing by much the
total power. It is also proposed that the observed emission from these sources
traces out regions of high current density where global instabilities drive a
turbulence spectrum that is ultimately responsible for the particle
acceleration and the synchrotron, inverse Compton and synchro-Compton emission.
The direct extraction of spin energy from a black hole is re-examined and an
electromagnetic model of GRB explosions is developed. It is also suggested that
some GRB ``lighthouses'' be identified with accretion-induced collapse of a
neutron star to form a black hole in a binary system.
