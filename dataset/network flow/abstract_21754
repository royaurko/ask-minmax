We discuss the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes in the context of
dS/CFT correspondence by using static and planar coordinates. The boundary
stress tensor and the mass of the solutions are computed. Also, we investigate
how the RG flow is changed for different foliations. The Kastor-Traschen
multi-black hole solution is considered as well as AdS counterparts of these
configurations. In particular, we find that in planar coordinates the black
holes appear like punctures in the dual boundary theory.
