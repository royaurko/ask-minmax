We present a numerical study of thermoviscous effects on the acoustic
streaming flow generated by an ultrasound standing-wave resonance in a long
straight microfluidic channel containing a Newtonian fluid. These effects enter
primarily through the temperature and density dependence of the fluid
viscosity. The resulting magnitude of the streaming flow is calculated and
characterized numerically, and we find that even for thin acoustic boundary
layers, the channel height affects the magnitude of the streaming flow. For the
special case of a sufficiently large channel height we have successfully
validated our numerics with analytical results from 2011 by Rednikov and Sadhal
for a single planar wall. We analyze the time-averaged energy transport in the
system and the time-averaged second-order temperature perturbation of the
fluid. Finally, we have made three main changes in our previously published
numerical scheme to improve the numerical performance: (i) The time-averaged
products of first-order variables in the time-averaged second-order equations
have been recast as flux densities instead of as body forces. (ii) The order of
the finite element basis functions has been increased in an optimal manner.
(iii) Based on the International Association for the Properties of Water and
Steam (IAPWS 1995, 2008, and 2011), we provide accurate polynomial fits in
temperature for all relevant thermodynamic and transport parameters of water in
the temperature range from 10 C to 50 C.
