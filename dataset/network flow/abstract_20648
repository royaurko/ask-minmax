Carbon nanotube (CNT) is expected for much more important and broader
applications in the future, because of its amazing electrical and mechanical
properties. However, today, the prospect is detained by the fact that the
growth of CNTs cannot be well controlled. In particular, controlling the
chirality of CNTs seems formidable to any existing growth method. In addition,
a systematic method for a designed interconnected network has not been
established yet, which is focused particularly in nano-electronics field. Up to
now, there is a strong need for novel synthetic method that is controllable for
chirality and architecture and applicable to mass production. Recently, the
experimental evidences were reported for the growth of pure carbon-arc-product
nanotubes from a liquid precursor. Here we show the simulation results of
elongated growth process of CNT by drawing out a well-formed nanotube from
liquid carbon and discuss the mechanism and suitable synthesis conditions. The
process is also simulated for creation of a Y junction from two isolated CNTs
as first step to CNT network. We propose this novel synthetic method as a
promising one for catalyst-free mechanical design of interconnected CNT network
and CNT cloning.
