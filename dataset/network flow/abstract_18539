We develop a new metric for quantifying end-to-end throughput in multihop
wireless networks, which we term random access transport capacity, since the
interference model presumes uncoordinated transmissions. The metric quantifies
the average maximum rate of successful end-to-end transmissions, multiplied by
the communication distance, and normalized by the network area. We show that a
simple upper bound on this quantity is computable in closed-form in terms of
key network parameters when the number of retransmissions is not restricted and
the hops are assumed to be equally spaced on a line between the source and
destination. We also derive the optimum number of hops and optimal per hop
success probability and show that our result follows the well-known square root
scaling law while providing exact expressions for the preconstants as well.
Numerical results demonstrate that the upper bound is accurate for the purpose
of determining the optimal hop count and success (or outage) probability.
