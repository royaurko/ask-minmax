We introduce a graph generating model aimed at representing the evolution of
protein interaction networks. The model is based on the hypotesis of evolution
by duplications and divergence of the genes which produce proteins. The
obtained graphs shows multifractal properties recovering the absence of a
characteristic connectivity as found in real data of protein interaction
networks. The error tolerance of the model to random or targeted damage is in
very good agreement with the behavior obtained in real protein networks
analysis. The proposed model is a first step in the identification of the
evolutionary dynamics leading to the development of protein functions and
interactions.
