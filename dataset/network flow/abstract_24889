When multiple radio-frequency sources are connected to multiple loads through
a passive multiport matching network, perfect power transfer to the loads
across all frequencies is generally impossible. We provide an analysis of
bandwidth over which power transfer is possible. Our principal tools include
broadband multiport matching upper bounds, derived herein, on the integral over
all frequency of the logarithm of a suitably defined power loss ratio. In
general, the larger the integral, the wider the bandwidth over which power
transfer can be accomplished. We apply these bounds in several ways: We show
how the number of sources and loads, and the coupling between loads, affect
achievable bandwidth. We analyze the bandwidth of networks constrained to have
certain architectures. We characterize systems whose bandwidths scale as the
ratio between the numbers of loads and sources. Numerical examples are also
presented.
