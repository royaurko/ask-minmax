This paper studies interference channels with security constraints. The
existence of an external eavesdropper in a two-user interference channel is
assumed, where the network users would like to secure their messages from the
external eavesdropper. The cooperative binning and channel prefixing scheme is
proposed for this system model which allows users to cooperatively add
randomness to the channel in order to degrade the observations of the external
eavesdropper. This scheme allows users to add randomness to the channel in two
ways: 1) Users cooperate in their design of the binning codebooks, and 2) Users
cooperatively exploit the channel prefixing technique. As an example, the
channel prefixing technique is exploited in the Gaussian case to transmit a
superposition signal consisting of binning codewords and independently
generated noise samples. Gains obtained form the cooperative binning and
channel prefixing scheme compared to the single user scenario reveals the
positive effect of interference in increasing the network security. Remarkably,
interference can be exploited to cooperatively add randomness into the network
in order to enhance the security.
