Cascades represent an important phenomenon across various disciplines such as
sociology, economy, psychology, political science, marketing, and epidemiology.
An important property of cascades is their morphology, which encompasses the
structure, shape, and size. However, cascade morphology has not been rigorously
characterized and modeled in prior literature. In this paper, we propose a
Multi-order Markov Model for the Morphology of Cascades ($M^4C$) that can
represent and quantitatively characterize the morphology of cascades with
arbitrary structures, shapes, and sizes. $M^4C$ can be used in a variety of
applications to classify different types of cascades. To demonstrate this, we
apply it to an unexplored but important problem in online social networks --
cascade size prediction. Our evaluations using real-world Twitter data show
that $M^4C$ based cascade size prediction scheme outperforms the baseline
scheme based on cascade graph features such as edge growth rate, degree
distribution, clustering, and diameter. $M^4C$ based cascade size prediction
scheme consistently achieves more than 90% classification accuracy under
different experimental scenarios.
