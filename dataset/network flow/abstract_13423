The dynamic resistance of a sphere with a general inhomogeneous slip boundary
condition is analysed in Newtonian unbounded uniform flow at low Reynolds
number. The boundary condition is treated as a perturbation to a homogeneous
sphere, assuming that the slip length magnitude b is much smaller than the
sphere radius a. To first order, the effect of inhomogeneous slip is the same
as that of a radial deformity of magnitude b. Full resistance tensors are
presented and the dynamics of a hemispherical inhomogeneous sphere, such as a
Janus particle, are explicitly calculated.
