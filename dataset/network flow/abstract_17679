This memoire consists of two main results. In the first one we describe Ricci
flow theory and we give an educative way for proving Elliptization Conjecture
and then we prove Poincare conjecture which is the second proof of Perelman for
Poincare conjecture. In the second one which is the main propose of our
memoire, we exhibit a complete proof of Calabi-Yau conjecture.
