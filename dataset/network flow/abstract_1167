We present a description of granular dynamics based on the idea of
differentiation between fluid and solid components. First, we construct a model
of completely fluidized phase. Then we discuss a shear surface motion on the
boundary of the bulk solid phase, induced by a moving wall. Our results include
the thickness dependence of the velocity of a developed avalanche, density and
velocity profiles in granular Couette flow experiment.
