Kerov, Olshanski and Vershik introduced the so-called virtual permutations,
defined as families of permutations $(\sigma_N)_{N \geq 1}$, $\sigma_N$ in the
symmetric group of order $N$, such that the cycle structure of $\sigma_N$ can
be deduced from the structure of $\sigma_{N+1}$ simply by removing the element
$N+1$. The virtual permutations, and in particular the probability measures on
the corresponding space which are invariant by conjugation, have been studied
in a details by Tsilevich. In the present article, we prove that for a large
class of such invariant measures (containing in particular the Ewens measure of
any parameter $\theta \geq 0$), it is possible to associate a flow
$(T^{\alpha})_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}}$ of random operators on a suitable
functional space. Moreover, if $(\sigma_N)_{N \geq 1}$ is a random virtual
permutation following a distribution in the class described above, the operator
$T^{\alpha}$ can be interpreted as the limit, in a sense which has to be made
precise, of the permutation $\sigma_N^{\alpha_N}$, where $N$ goes to infinity
and $\alpha_N$ is equivalent to $\alpha N$. In relation with this
interpretation, we prove that the eigenvalues of the infinitesimal generator of
$(T^{\alpha})_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}}$ are equal to the limit of the rescaled
eigenangles of the permutation matrix associated to $\sigma_N$.
