Spreadsheets are used extensively in industry, often for business critical
purposes. In previous work we have analyzed the information needs of
spreadsheet professionals and addressed their need for support with the
transition of a spreadsheet to a colleague with the generation of data flow
diagrams. In this paper we describe the application of these data flow diagrams
for the purpose of understanding a spreadsheet with three example cases. We
furthermore suggest an additional application of the data flow diagrams: the
assessment of the quality of the spreadsheet's design.
