Let $\Omega$ be an open set in a geodesically complete, non-compact,
$m$-dimen-sional Riemannian manifold $M$ with non-negative Ricci curvature. We
study the heat flow from $\Omega$ into $M-\Omega$ if the initial temperature
distribution is the characteristic function of $\Omega$. We obtain a necessary
and sufficient condition which ensures that an open set $\Omega$ with infinite
measure has finite heat content for all $t>0$. We also obtain upper and lower
bounds for the heat content of $\Omega$ in $M$. Two-sided bounds are obtained
for the heat loss of $\Omega$ in $M$ if the measure of $\Omega$ is finite.
