We study the properties of the Google matrix of an Ulam network generated by
intermittency maps. This network is created by the Ulam method which gives a
matrix approximant for the Perron-Frobenius operator of dynamical map. The
spectral properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix are
analyzed. We show that the PageRank of the system is characterized by a power
law decay with the exponent $\beta$ dependent on map parameters and the Google
damping factor $\alpha$. Under certain conditions the PageRank is completely
delocalized so that the Google search in such a situation becomes inefficient.
