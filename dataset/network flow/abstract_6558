Identifying the importance of nodes of complex networks is of interest to the
research of Social Networks, Biological Networks etc.. Current researchers have
proposed several measures or algorithms, such as betweenness, PageRank and HITS
etc., to identify the node importance. However, these measures are based on
different aspects of properties of nodes, and often conflict with the others. A
reasonable, fair standard is needed for evaluating and comparing these
algorithms. This paper develops a framework as the standard for ranking the
importance of nodes. Four intuitive rules are suggested to measure the node
importance, and the equivalence classes approach is employed to resolve the
conflicts and aggregate the results of the rules. To quantitatively compare the
algorithms, the performance indicators are also proposed based on a similarity
measure. Three widely used real-world networks are used as the test-beds. The
experimental results illustrate the feasibility of this framework and show that
both algorithms, PageRank and HITS, perform well with bias when dealing with
the tested networks. Furthermore, this paper uses the proposed approach to
analyze the structure of the Internet, and draws out the kernel of the Internet
with dense links.
