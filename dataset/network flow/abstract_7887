We study the long time behaviour of Ricci flow with bubbling-off on a
possibly noncompact $3$-manifold of finite volume whose universal cover has
bounded geometry. As an application, we give a Ricci flow proof of Thurston's
hyperbolisation theorem for $3$-manifolds with toral boundary that generalizes
Perelman's proof of the hyperbolisation conjecture in the closed case.
