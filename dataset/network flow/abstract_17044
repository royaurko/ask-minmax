Patterns of silver metal were prepared on DNA networks by a template-directed
selective deposition and subsequent metallization process. Scanning force
microscopic observations and XPS investigations demonstrated that uniform
networks of nanosized silver metal clusters formed after incubation of DNA LB
films with silver ions and subsequent chemical reduction of silver ions/DNA
films samples. The results showed that this template-directed metallization on
DNA LB films provided a simple and effective method for the construction of
functional nanocomposite films.
