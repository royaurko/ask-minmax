Radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting and transfer techniques have recently
become alternative methods to power the next generation of wireless networks.
As this emerging technology enables proactive replenishment of wireless
devices, it is advantageous in supporting applications with quality-of-service
(QoS) requirement. This article focuses on the resource allocation issues in
wireless networks with RF energy harvesting capability, referred to as RF
energy harvesting networks (RF-EHNs). First, we present an overview of the
RF-EHNs, followed by a review of a variety of issues regarding resource
allocation. Then, we present a case study of designing in the receiver
operation policy, which is of paramount importance in the RF-EHNs. We focus on
QoS support and service differentiation, which have not been addressed by
previous literatures. Furthermore, we outline some open research directions.
