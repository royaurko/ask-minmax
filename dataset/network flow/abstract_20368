McDonald (2007) presented an approach to improving perturbation theory (PT)
calculations of the dark matter power spectrum, with a derivation based on the
idea of renormalization group flow with time. In spite of a questionable
approximation made in deriving it, subsequent comparisons by several groups
between the predictions of the resulting equation and N-body simulations showed
remarkable improvement relative to "standard" PT (SPT) at similar order. In
this brief note I show that the same final equation can be derived cleanly from
the point of view not of flowing with time but with non-linear coupling
strength, i.e., gradually dialing the coupling from the trivial value zero to
the physical one. This understanding makes it clear how to extend the approach
to higher order and other statistics. While I do not necessarily think this
approach is best among the many, it may be interesting in that it contains a
unique way of suppressing UV sensitivity. In passing I remind the reader of
references demonstrating that SPT works remarkably well without improvement
(except near redshift zero, where, fortunately for SPT, there is very little
volume in the Universe).
