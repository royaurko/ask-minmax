We consider the role magnetic fields play in guiding and controlling
mass-loss via evaporative outflows from exoplanets that experience UV
irradiation. First we present analytic results that account for planetary and
stellar magnetic fields, along with mass-loss from both the star and planet. We
then conduct series of numerical simulations for gas giant planets, and vary
the planetary field strength, background stellar field strength, UV heating
flux, and planet mass. These simulations show that the flow is magnetically
controlled for moderate field strengths and even the highest UV fluxes, i.e.,
planetary surface fields $B_P\gtrsim 0.3$ gauss and fluxes $F_{UV}\sim10^{6}$
erg s$^{-1}$. We thus conclude that outflows from all hot Jupiters with
moderate surface fields are magnetically controlled. The inclusion of magnetic
fields highly suppresses outflow from the night-side of the planet. Only the
magnetic field lines near the pole are open and allow outflow to occur. The
fraction of open field lines depends sensitively on the strength (and geometry)
of the background magnetic field from the star, along with the UV heating rate.
The net effect of the magnetic field is to suppress the mass loss rate by
(approximately) an order of magnitude. Finally, some open field lines do not
allow the flow to pass smoothly through the sonic point; flow along these
streamlines does not reach steady-state, resulting in time-variable mass-loss.
