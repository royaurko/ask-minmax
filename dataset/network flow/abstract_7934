We derive pointwise curvature estimates for graphical mean curvature flows in
higher codimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such
estimates without assuming smallness of first derivatives of the defining map.
An immediate application is a convergence theorem of the mean curvature flow of
the graph of an area decreasing map between flat Riemann surfaces.
