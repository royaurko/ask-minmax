The performance of Fiber-Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) depends upon
several workload parameters; for example; the arrival pattern, frame size, and
configuration parameters, such as the number of stations on the ring, extent of
the ring, and number of stations that are waiting to transmit. In addition, the
performance is affected by a parameter called the Target Token Rotation Time
(TTRT), which can be controlled by the network manager. We considered the
effect of TTRT on various performance metrics for different ring configurations
and concluded that a TTRT value of 8 ms provides a good performance over a wide
range of configurations and workloads.
