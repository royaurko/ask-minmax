By using a simplified two-lane cellular automata model for traffic flow, we
simulate an evacuation of an emergency vehicle (EV) in highways. We introduce
the pull over strategy to facilitate the evacuation of the EV in highways. We
demonstrate numerically that this pulling over of cars promotes a faster moving
of the EV in traffic flow and minimize the EV's impact on the overall traffic.
