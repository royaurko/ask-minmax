We consider the proportional fair rate allocation in an 802.11 WLAN that
supports multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) transmission by one or more stations. We
characterise, for the first time, the proportional fair allocation of MU-MIMO
spatial streams and station transmission opportunities. While a number of
features carry over from the case without MU-MIMO, in general neither flows nor
stations need to be allocated equal airtime when MU-MIMO is available.
