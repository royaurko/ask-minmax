We obtain a large, new class of N=1 supersymmetric holographic flow
backgrounds with U(1)^3 symmetry. These solutions correspond to flows toward
the Coulomb branch of the non-trivial N=1 supersymmetric fixed point. The
massless (complex) chiral fields are allowed to develop vevs that are
independent of their two phase angles, and this corresponds to allowing the
brane to spread with arbitrary, U(1)^2 invariant, radial distributions in each
of these directions. Our solutions are "almost Calabi-Yau:" The metric is
hermitian with respect to an integrable complex structure, but is not Kahler.
The "modulus squared" of the holomorphic (3,0)-form is the volume form, and the
complete solution is characterized by a function that must satisfy a single
partial differential equation that is closely related to the Calabi-Yau
condition. The deformation from a standard Calabi-Yau background is driven by a
non-trivial, non-normalizable 3-form flux dual to a fermion mass that reduces
the supersymmetry to N=1. This flux also induces dielectric polarization of the
D3-branes into D5-branes.
