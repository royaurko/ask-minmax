Two-kaon and two-pion correlation functions for an expanding thermalized
source are compared. In the Yano-Koonin-Podgoretskii parametrization of the
correlation function, the HBT radius parameters are shown to obey M_\bot-
scaling in the absence of collective transverse flow. This scaling is broken by
transverse flow. An accurate comparison of pion and kaon correlations can thus
resolve issue whether the observed M_\bot-dependence of the transverse radius
parameter is due to transverse collective flow or other transverse gradients.
Effects from resonance decays are shortly discussed.
