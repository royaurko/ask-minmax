We set up a signal-driven scheme of the chaotic neural network with the
coupling constants corresponding to certain information, and investigate the
stochastic resonance-like effects under its deterministic dynamics, comparing
with the conventional case of Hopfield network with stochastic noise. It is
shown that the chaotic neural network can enhance weak subthreshold signals and
have higher coherence abilities between stimulus and response than those
attained by the conventional stochastic model.
