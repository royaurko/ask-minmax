We study all the possibilities of producing rotating flow in an
incompressible fluid by electric and magnetic fields. We start with a general
theoretical basis and look for different configurations and set-ups which
electric/magnetic field and an electric current affect the vorticity of fluid
resulting in rotation on liquid flow. We assume steady-state conditions and
time-independent electric and magnetic fields as the external body torque.
Regarding the theoretical basis, we propose three experimental set-ups in which
by applying fields on a fluid, rotational vortices are produced: (a) a uniform
electric field and a uniform electric current, (b) a uniform electric current
and a non-uniform magnetic field, and (c) a non-uniform electric current and a
uniform magnetic field. The first case has been reported in detail named
"Liquid Film Motor". The two other cases are experimentally investigated here
for a cubic an cylindrical cells. The rotational velocity patterns are obtained
by PIV technique, and the results are discussed and justified by a preliminary
estimation based on the torque exerted by magnetic fields on electric currents.
From the log-log plot of angular velocity versus current, the non-linearity
factors of the rotational flow for cylindrical and rectangular geometries are
obtained.
