We consider utility maximization in networks where the sources do not employ
flow control and may consequently overload the network. In the absence of flow
control at the sources, some packets will inevitably have to be dropped when
the network is in overload. To that end, we first develop a distributed,
threshold-based packet dropping policy that maximizes the weighted sum
throughput. Next, we consider utility maximization and develop a receiver-based
flow control scheme that, when combined with threshold-based packet dropping,
achieves the optimal utility. The flow control scheme creates virtual queues at
the receivers as a push-back mechanism to optimize the amount of data delivered
to the destinations via back-pressure routing. A novel feature of our scheme is
that a utility function can be assigned to a collection of flows, generalizing
the traditional approach of optimizing per-flow utilities. Our control policies
use finite-buffer queues and are independent of arrival statistics. Their
near-optimal performance is proved and further supported by simulation results.
