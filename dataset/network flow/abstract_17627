We investigate Liouville theorems and dimension estimates for the space of
exponentially growing holomorphic functions on complete K\"{a}hler manifolds.
While our work is motivated by the study of gradient Ricci solitons in the
theory of Ricci flow, the most general results we prove here do not require any
knowledge of curvature.
