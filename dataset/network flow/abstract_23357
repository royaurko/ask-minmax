Context. Surface differential rotation and other global surface flows on
magnetically active stars are among the observable manifestations of the
stellar dynamo working underneath. Therefore, such observations are important
for stellar dynamo theory and useful constraints for solar dynamo studies as
well.
  Aims. The active K1-giant component of the long-period RS CVn-type binary
system sigma Gem and its global surface flow pattern is revisited.
  Methods. We refine the differential rotation law from recovering the spot
migration pattern. We apply a detailed cross-correlation technique to a unique
set of 34 time-series Doppler images recovered using data from 1996/97. By
increasing the number of the available cross-correlation function maps from the
formerly used 4 to 17 we expect a more robust determination of the differential
surface rotation law. In addition, we present a new time-series Doppler imaging
study of sigma Gem using our advanced surface reconstruction code iMap for a
dataset collected in 2006/07.
  Results. Results from the reprocessed cross-correlation study confirm that
the star performs antisolar-type differential rotation with a surface shear
alpha of -0.04 +/- 0.01, i.e., almost a factor of two stronger compared to the
previously claimed value. We also confirm the evidence of a global poleward
spot migration with an average velocity of 0.21 +/- 0.03 km/s, in accordance
with theoretical predictions. From the new observations we obtain three
subsequent Doppler images. The time evolution of these images confirms the
antisolar-type differential rotation of the same amount.
