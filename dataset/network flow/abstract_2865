In recent years, Streets and Tian introduced a series of curvature flows to
study non-K\"{a}hler geometry. In this paper, we study how to construct second
order curvature flows in a uniform way, under some natural assumptions which
holds in Streets and Tian's works. As a result, by classifying the lower order
tensors, we classify the second order curvature flows in almost Hermitian,
almost K\"{a}hler and Hermitian geometries in certain sense.
