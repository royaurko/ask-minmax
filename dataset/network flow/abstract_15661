Deep learning refers to the shining branch of machine learning that is based
on learning levels of representations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is
one kind of deep neural network. It can study concurrently. In this article, we
gave a detailed analysis of the process of CNN algorithm both the forward
process and back propagation. Then we applied the particular convolutional
neural network to implement the typical face recognition problem by java. Then,
a parallel strategy was proposed in section4. In addition, by measuring the
actual time of forward and backward computing, we analysed the maximal speed up
and parallel efficiency theoretically.
