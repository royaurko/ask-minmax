The Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) has obtained full funding for
the design, construction and implementation of a prototype telescope and
instrumentation package for the first network node. We describe the layout of
such a node and its instrumentation and expected performance for
radial-velocity measurements. The instrumentation consists of a 1m telescope,
equipped with two cameras for photometry of microlensing events with the
lucky-imaging technique and a high-resolution spectrograph equipped with an
iodine cell for obtaining high-precision radial velocities of solar-like stars,
in order to do asteroseismology. The telescope will be located in a dome of ~
4.5 m diameter, with two lucky-imaging cameras at one of the Nasmyth foci and
the spectrograph and instrument control computers at a Coud{\'e} focus, located
in an adjacent container. Currently the prototype telescope and instrumentation
are undergoing detailed design. Installation at the first site (Tenerife) is
expected during mid-late 2010, followed by extensive testing during 2011.
