Various primary user (PU) radios have been allocated into fixed frequency
bands in the whole spectrum. A cognitive radio network (CRN) should be able to
perform the wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) to detect temporarily unoccupied
frequency bands. We summarize four occupancy features for the frequency bands.
1. The occupancy is sparse; 2. The frequency band allocation information is
fixed and common; 3. There are three categories for the frequency band usages;
4. The occupied frequency bands are common in the CRN. For the first time, we
consider all features as the prior knowledge in the compressed sensing based
cooperative WSS (CWSS) algorithm design for a centralized CRN. We propose a
modified orthogonal matching pursuit (Mod-OMP) algorithm and a modified
simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (Mod-SOMP) algorithm for the CWSS. We
compare the CWSS performance of Mod-OMP/Mod-SOMP with the original OMP/SOMP and
show the performance improvements.
