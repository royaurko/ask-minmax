We prove the existence of generalized solution for incompressible and viscous
non-Newtonian two-phase fluid flow for spatial dimension 2 and 3. The phase
boundary moves along with the fluid flow plus its mean curvature while exerting
surface tension force to the fluid. An approximation scheme combining the
Galerkin method and the phase field method is adopted.
