In recent years, vulnerable hosts and maliciously registered domains have
been frequently involved in mobile attacks. In this paper, we explore the
feasibility of detecting malicious domains visited on a cellular network based
solely on lexical characteristics of the domain names. In addition to using
traditional quantitative features of domain names, we also use a word
segmentation algorithm to segment the domain names into individual words to
greatly expand the size of the feature set. Experiments on a sample of
real-world data from a large cellular network show that using word segmentation
improves our ability to detect malicious domains relative to approaches without
segmentation, as measured by misclassification rates and areas under the ROC
curve. Furthermore, the results are interpretable, allowing one to discover
(with little supervision or tuning required) which words are used most often to
attract users to malicious domains. Such a lightweight approach could be
performed in near-real time when a device attempts to visit a domain. This
approach can complement (rather than substitute) other more expensive and
time-consuming approaches to similar problems that use richer feature sets.
