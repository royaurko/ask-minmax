An ensemble approach for force networks in static granular packings is
developed. The framework is based on the separation of packing and force
scales, together with an a-priori flat measure in the force phase space under
the constraints that the contact forces are repulsive and balance on every
particle. In this paper we will give a general formulation of this force
network ensemble, and derive the general expression for the force distribution
$P(f)$. For small regular packings these probability densities are obtained in
closed form, while for larger packings we present a systematic numerical
analysis. Since technically the problem can be written as a non-invertible
matrix problem (where the matrix is determined by the contact geometry), we
study what happens if we perturb the packing matrix or replace it by a random
matrix. The resulting $P(f)$'s differ significantly from those of normal
packings, which touches upon the deep question of how network statistics is
related to the underlying network structure. Overall, the ensemble formulation
opens up a new perspective on force networks that is analytically accessible,
and which may find applications beyond granular matter.
