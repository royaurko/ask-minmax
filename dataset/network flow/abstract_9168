A complete set of filters $F_n$ for the optimal-depth $n$-input sorting
network problem is such that if there exists an $n$-input sorting network of
depth $d$ then there exists one of the form $C \oplus C'$ for some $C \in F_n$.
Previous work on the topic presents a method for finding complete set of
filters $R_{n, 1}$ and $R_{n, 2}$ that consists only of networks of depths one
and two respectively, whose outputs are minimal and representative up to
permutation and reflection. Our main contribution is a practical approach for
finding a complete set of filters $R_{n, 3}$ containing only networks of depth
three whose outputs are minimal and representative up to permutation and
reflection. In previous work, we have developed a highly efficient algorithm
for finding extremal sets ( i.e. outputs of comparator networks; itemsets; ) up
to permutation. In this paper we present a modification to this algorithm that
identifies the representative itemsets up to permutation and reflection. Hence,
the presented practical approach is the successful combination of known theory
and practice that we apply to the domain of sorting networks. For $n < 17$, we
empirically compute the complete set of filters $R_{n, 2}$, $R_{n, 3}$, $R_{n,
2} \upharpoonright w $ and $R_{n, 3}^w$ of the representative minimal up to
permutation and reflection $n$-input networks, where all but $R_{n, 2}$ are
novel to this work.
