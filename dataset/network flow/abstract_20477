Steady flows that optimize heat transport are obtained for two-dimensional
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with no-slip horizontal walls for a variety of
Prandtl numbers $Pr$ and Rayleigh number up to $Ra\sim 10^9$. Power law
scalings of $Nu\sim Ra^{\gamma}$ are observed with $\gamma\approx 0.31$, where
the Nusselt number $Nu$ is a non-dimensional measure of the vertical heat
transport. Any dependence of the scaling exponent on $Pr$ is found to be
extremely weak. On the other hand, the presence of two local maxima of $Nu$
with different horizontal wavenumbers at the same $Ra$ leads to the emergence
of two different flow structures as candidates for optimizing the heat
transport. For $Pr \lesssim 7$, optimal transport is achieved at the smaller
maximal wavenumber. In these fluids, the optimal structure is a plume of warm
rising fluid which spawns left/right horizontal arms near the top of the
channel, leading to downdrafts adjacent to the central updraft. For $Pr > 7$ at
high-enough Ra, the optimal structure is a single updraft absent significant
horizontal structure, and characterized by the larger maximal wavenumber.
