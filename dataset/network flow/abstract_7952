There is little doubt that hydrodynamic flow has been observed in heavy ion
collisions at the LHC and RHIC, mainly based on results on azimuthal
anisotropies, but also on particle spectra of identified particles, perfectly
compatible with hydrodynamic expansions. Surprisingly, in p-Pb collisions one
observes a very similar behavior. So do we see flow even in p-Pb? We will try
to answer this question.
