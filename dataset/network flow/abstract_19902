In this Letter we suggest a simple and physically transparent analytical
model of the pressure driven turbulent wall-bounded flows at high but finite
Reynolds numbers Re. The model gives accurate qualitative description of the
profiles of the mean-velocity and Reynolds-stresses (second order correlations
of velocity fluctuations) throughout the entire channel or pipe in the wide
range of Re, using only three Re-independent parameters. The model sheds light
on the long-standing controversy between supporters of the century-old log-law
theory of von-K\`arm\`an and Prandtl and proposers of a newer theory promoting
power laws to describe the intermediate region of the mean velocity profile.
