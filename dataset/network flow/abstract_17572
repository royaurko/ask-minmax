We first consider immersions on compact manifolds with uniform $L^p$-bounds
on the second fundamental form and uniformly bounded volume. We show
compactness in arbitrary dimension and codimension, generalizing a classical
result of J. Langer. In the second part, this result is used to deduce a
localized version, being more convenient for many applications, such as
convergence proofs for geometric flows.
