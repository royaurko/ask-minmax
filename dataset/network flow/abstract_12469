Replicating or caching popular content in memories distributed across the
network is a technique to reduce peak network loads. Conventionally, the main
performance gain of this caching was thought to result from making part of the
requested data available closer to end users. Instead, we recently showed that
a much more significant gain can be achieved by using caches to create
coded-multicasting opportunities, even for users with different demands,
through coding across data streams. These coded-multicasting opportunities are
enabled by careful content overlap at the various caches in the network,
created by a central coordinating server.
  In many scenarios, such a central coordinating server may not be available,
raising the question if this multicasting gain can still be achieved in a more
decentralized setting. In this paper, we propose an efficient caching scheme,
in which the content placement is performed in a decentralized manner. In other
words, no coordination is required for the content placement. Despite this lack
of coordination, the proposed scheme is nevertheless able to create
coded-multicasting opportunities and achieves a rate close to the optimal
centralized scheme.
