Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) contain numerous sensor nodes having limited
power resource, which report sensed data to the Base Station (BS) that requires
high energy usage. Many routing protocols have been proposed in this regard
achieving energy efficiency in heterogeneous scenarios. However, every protocol
is not suitable for heterogeneous WSNs. Efficiency of protocol degrades while
changing the heterogeneity parameters. In this paper, we first test Distributed
Energy- Efficient Clustering (DEEC), Developed DEEC (DDEEC), Enhanced DEEC
(EDEEC) and Threshold DEEC (TDEEC) under several different scenarios containing
high level heterogeneity to low level heterogeneity. We observe thoroughly
regarding the performance based on stability period, network life time and
throughput. EDEEC and TDEEC perform better in all heterogeneous scenarios
containing variable heterogeneity in terms of life time, however TDEEC is best
of all for the stability period of the network. However, the performance of
DEEC and DDEEC is highly effected by changing the heterogeneity parameters of
the network.
