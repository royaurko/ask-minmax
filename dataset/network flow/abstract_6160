The thermonuclear runaway that culminates in the explosion of a Chandrasekhar
mass white dwarf as a Type Ia supernova begins centuries before the star
actually explodes. Here, using a 3D anelastic code, we examine numerically the
convective flow during the last minute of that runaway, a time that is crucial
in determining just where and how often the supernova ignites. We find that the
overall convective flow is dipolar, with the higher temperature fluctuations in
an outbound flow preferentially on one side of the star. Taken at face value,
this suggests an asymmetric ignition that may well persist in the geometry of
the final explosion. However, we also find that even a moderate amount of
rotation tends to fracture this dipole flow, making ignition over a broader
region more likely. Though our calculations lack the resolution to study the
flow at astrophysically relevant Rayleigh numbers, we also speculate that the
observed dipolar flow will become less organized as the viscosity becomes very
small. Motion within the dipole flow shows evidence of turbulence, suggesting
that only geometrically large fluctuations (~1 km) will persist to ignite the
runaway. We also examine the probability density function for the temperature
fluctuations, finding evidence for a Gaussian, rather than exponential
distribution, which suggests that ignition sparks may be strongly spatially
clustered.
