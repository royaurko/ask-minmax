The asymptotics of sizes of clusters for the Arratia flow is considered, the
Arratia flow being a system of coalescing Wiener processes starting from the
real axis and independent before they meet. A cluster at time t is defined as a
set of particles that have glued together not later than at t. The results
obtained are remarked to hold for any Arratia flow with a Lipschitz drift.
