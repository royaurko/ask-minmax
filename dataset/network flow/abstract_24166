Broadband communications consists of the technologies and equipment required
to deliver packet-based digital voice, video, and data services to end users.
Broadband affords end users high-speed, always-on access to the Internet while
affording service providers the ability to offer value-added services to
increase revenues. Due to the growth of the Internet, there has been tremendous
buildout of high-speed, inter-city communications links that connect population
centers and Internet service providers (ISPs) points of presence (PoPs) around
the world. This build out of the backbone infrastructure or core network has
occurred primarily via optical transport technology. Broadband access
technologies are being deployed to address the bandwidth bottleneck for the
"last mile," the connection of homes and small businesses to this
infrastructure. One important aspect of broadband access to the home is that it
allows people to telecommute effectively by providing a similar environment as
when they are physically present in their office: simultaneous telephone and
computer access, high-speed Internet and intranet access for e-mail, file
sharing, and access to corporate servers.
