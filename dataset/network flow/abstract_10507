In low power wireless sensor networks, MAC protocols usually employ periodic
sleep/wake schedule to reduce idle listening time. Even though this mechanism
is simple and efficient, it results in high end-to-end latency and low
throughput. On the other hand, the previously proposed CSMA/CA-based MAC
protocols have tried to reduce inter-node interference at the cost of increased
latency and lower network capacity. In this paper we propose IAMAC, a CSMA/CA
sleep/wake MAC protocol that minimizes inter-node interference, while also
reduces per-hop delay through cross-layer interactions with the network layer.
Furthermore, we show that IAMAC can be integrated into the SP architecture to
perform its inter-layer interactions. Through simulation, we have extensively
evaluated the performance of IAMAC in terms of different performance metrics.
Simulation results confirm that IAMAC reduces energy consumption per node and
leads to higher network lifetime compared to S-MAC and Adaptive S-MAC, while it
also provides lower latency than S-MAC. Throughout our evaluations we have
considered IAMAC in conjunction with two error recovery methods, i.e., ARQ and
Seda. It is shown that using Seda as the error recovery mechanism of IAMAC
results in higher throughput and lifetime compared to ARQ.
