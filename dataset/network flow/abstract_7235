When data traffic in a wireless network is bursty, small amounts of data
sporadically become available for transmission, at times that are unknown at
the receivers, and an extra amount of energy must be spent at the transmitters
to overcome this lack of synchronization between the network nodes. In
practice, pre-defined header sequences are used with the purpose of
synchronizing the different network nodes. However, in networks where relays
must be used for communication, the overhead required for synchronizing the
entire network may be very significant.
  In this work, we study the fundamental limits of energy-efficient
communication in an asynchronous diamond network with two relays. We formalize
the notion of relay synchronization by saying that a relay is synchronized if
the conditional entropy of the arrival time of the source message given the
received signals at the relay is small. We show that the minimum energy-per-bit
for bursty traffic in diamond networks is achieved with a coding scheme where
each relay is either synchronized or not used at all. A consequence of this
result is the derivation of a lower bound to the minimum energy-per-bit for
bursty communication in diamond networks. This bound allows us to show that
schemes that perform the tasks of synchronization and communication separately
(i.e., with synchronization signals preceding the communication block) can
achieve the minimum energy-per-bit to within a constant fraction that ranges
from 2 in the synchronous case to 1 in the highly asynchronous regime.
