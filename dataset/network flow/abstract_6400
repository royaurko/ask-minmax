We study the cost of improving the goodput, or the useful data rate, to user
in a wireless network. We measure the cost in terms of number of base stations,
which is highly correlated to the energy cost as well as capital and
operational costs of a network provider.We show that increasing the available
bandwidth, or throughput, may not necessarily lead to increase in goodput,
particularly in lossy wireless networks in which TCP does not perform well. As
a result, much of the resources dedicated to the user may not translate to high
goodput, resulting in an inefficient use of the network resources. We show that
using protocols such as TCP/NC, which are more resilient to erasures and
failures in the network, may lead to a goodput commensurate the throughput
dedicated to each user. By increasing goodput, users' transactions are
completed faster; thus, the resources dedicated to these users can be released
to serve other requests or transactions. Consequently, we show that translating
efficiently throughput to goodput may bring forth better connection to users
while reducing the cost for the network providers.
