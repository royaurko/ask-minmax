We propose a theoretical framework to study the cooperative behavior of
dynamically coupled oscillators (DCOs) that possess dynamical interactions.
Then, to understand synchronization phenomena in networks of interneurons which
possess inhibitory interactions, we propose a DCO model with dynamics of
interactions that tend to cause 180-degree phase lags. Employing an approach
developed here, we demonstrate that although our model displays synchronization
at high frequencies, it does not exhibit synchronization at low frequencies
because this dynamical interaction does not cause a phase lag sufficiently
large to cancel the effect of the inhibition. We interpret the disappearance of
synchronization in our model with decreasing frequency as describing the
breakdown of synchronization in the interneuron network of the CA1 area below
the critical frequency of 20 Hz.
