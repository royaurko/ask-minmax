The Goldberg-Sachs theorem is an exact result on shear-free null geodesics in
a vacuum spacetime. It is compared and contrasted with an exact result for
pressure-free matter: shear-free flows cannot both expand and rotate. In both
cases, the shear-free condition restricts the way distant matter can influence
the local gravitational field. This leads to intriguing discontinuities in the
relation of the General Relativity solutions to Newtonian solutions in the
timelike case, and of the full theory to the linearised theory in the null
case.
  It is a pleasure to dedicate this paper to Josh Goldberg.
