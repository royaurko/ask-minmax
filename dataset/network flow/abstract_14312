The light-front QCD is studied using the method of flow equations. Solving
the light-front gluon gap equation, the effective gluon mass is generated
dynamically. The effective interaction between static quark and antiquark,
generated through elimination of the quark-gluon minimal coupling by flow
equations, has the Coulomb, $1/q^2$, and confining, $1/q^4$, singular behavior.
Elimination of the quark-gluon coupling at small gluon momenta is governed by
the cutoff dependent, dynamical gluon mass, which makes this elimination
possible and provides such an enhancement at $q\sim 0$. The cutoff, which
regulates small light-front $x$ divergences, sets up a scale for the dynamical
gluon mass and the string tension in the $q\bar{q}$-potential. The mechanism of
confimenemet in the light-front frame is suggested, based on the singular
nature of the light-front gauge along the light-front $x$-axis.
