We consider the problem of providing service guarantees in a high-speed
packet switch. As basic requirements, the switch should be scalable to high
speeds per port, a large number of ports and a large number of traffic flows
with independent guarantees. Existing scalable solutions are based on Virtual
Output Queuing, which is computationally complex when required to provide
service guarantees for a large number of flows.
  We present a novel architecture for packet switching that provides support
for such service guarantees. A cost-effective fabric with small external
speedup is combined with a feedback mechanism that enables the fabric to be
virtually lossless, thus avoiding packet drops indiscriminate of flows. Through
analysis and simulation, we show that this architecture provides accurate
support for service guarantees, has low computational complexity and is
scalable to very high port speeds.
