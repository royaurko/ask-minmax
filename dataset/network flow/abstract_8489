We introduce an efficient method for fully characterizing multimode
linear-optical networks. Our approach requires only a standard laser source and
intensity measurements to directly and uniquely determine all moduli and
non-trivial phases of the matrix describing a network. We experimentally
demonstrate the characterization of a $6{\times}6$ fiber-optic network and
independently verify the results via nonclassical two-photon interference.
