We study a simplified stochastic model for the vascularization of a growing
tumor, incorporating the formation of new blood vessels at the tumor periphery
as well as their regression in the tumor center. The resulting morphology of
the tumor vasculature differs drastically from the original one. We demonstrate
that the probabilistic vessel collapse has to be correlated with the blood
shear force in order to yield percolating network structures. The resulting
tumor vasculature displays fractal properties. Fractal dimension, microvascular
density (MVD), blood flow and shear force has been computed for a wide range of
parameters.
