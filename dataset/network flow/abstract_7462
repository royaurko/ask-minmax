Using stationary solutions of the linearized two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, we describe the ``ship wave'' pattern occurring in the supersonic
flow of a Bose-Einstein condensate past an obstacle. It is shown that these
``ship waves'' are generated outside the Mach cone. The developed analytical
theory is confirmed by numerical simulations of the flow past body problem in
the frame of the full non-stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
