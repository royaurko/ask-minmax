Information processing by random feed-forward networks consisting of units
with sigmoidal input-output response is studied by focusing on the dependence
of its outputs on the number of parallel paths M. It is found that the system
leads to a combination of on/off outputs when $M \lesssim 7$, while for $M
\gtrsim 7$, chaotic dynamics arises, resulting in a continuous distribution of
outputs. This universality of the critical number $M \sim 7$ is explained by
combinatorial explosion, i.e., dominance of factorial over exponential
increase. Relevance of the result to the psychological magic number $7 \pm 2$
is briefly discussed.
