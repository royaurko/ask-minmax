Communication networks consume huge, and rapidly growing, amount of energy.
However, a lot of the energy consumption is wasted due to the lack of global
link power coordination in these complex systems. This paper proposes several
link power coordination schemes to achieve energy-efficient routing by
progressively putting some links into energy saving mode and hence aggregating
traffic during periods of low traffic load. We show that the achievable energy
savings not only depend on the link power coordination schemes, but also on the
network topologies. In the random network, there is no scheme that can
significantly outperform others. In the scale-free network, when the largest
betweenness first (LBF) scheme is used, phase transition of the networks'
transmission capacities during the traffic cooling down phase is observed.
Motivated by this, a hybrid link power coordination scheme is proposed to
significantly reduce the energy consumption in the scale-free network. In a
real Internet Service Provider (ISP)'s router-level Internet topology, however,
the smallest betweenness first (SBF) scheme significantly outperforms other
schemes.
