We present a study on the nonlinear dynamics of small long-wave disturbances
to the laminar state in non-rotating axisymmetric Poiseuille pipe flows. At
high Reynolds numbers, the associated Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to
a set of coupled Korteweg-de Vries-type (KdV) equations that support inviscid
and smooth travelling waves numerically computed using the Petviashvili method.
In physical space they correspond to localized toroidal vortices concentrated
near the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or that wrap around the pipe axis
(centre vortexons), in agreement with the analytical soliton solutions derived
by Fedele (2012). The KdV dynamics of a perturbation is also investigated by
means of an high accurate Fourier-based numerical scheme. We observe that an
initial vortical patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating patches of
vorticity near the wall. These can undergo further splitting leading to a
proliferation of centre vortexons that eventually decay due to viscous effects.
The splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal vorticity from
the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with the inverse cascade of cross-stream
vorticity identified in channel flows by Eyink (2008). The inviscid vortexon
most likely is unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances and may be a precursor
to puffs and slug flow formation.
