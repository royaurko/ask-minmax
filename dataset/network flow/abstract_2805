Directed and elliptic flow of inclusive photons near mid-rapidity in $158 $A
GeV Pb+Pb collisions has been studied. The data have been obtained with the
photon spectrometer LEDA of the WA98 experiment at the CERN SPS.
  The flow strength has been measured for various centralities as a function of
$p_T$ and rapidity over $0.18 < p_T < 1.5 \mathrm{GeV}/c$ and $2.3 < y < 2.9$.
The angular anisotropy has been studied relative to an event plane obtained in
the target fragmentation region that shows the elliptic flow to be in-plane.
The elliptic flow has also been studied using two-particle correlations and
shown to give similar results. A small directed flow component is observed.
Both the directed and elliptic flow strengths increase with $p_T$. The photon
flow results are used to estimate the corresponding neutral pion flow.
