A new framework for evaluating hydrodynamic models of relativistic heavy ion
collisions has been developed. This framework, a Comprehesive Heavy Ion Model
Evaluation and Reporting Algorithm (CHIMERA) has been implemented by augmenting
UVH 2+1D viscous hydrodynamic model with eccentricity fluctuations,
pre-equilibrium flow, and the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamic
(UrQMD) hadronic cascade. A range of initial temperatures and shear viscosity
to entropy ratios were evaluated for four initial profiles, $N_{part}$ and
$N_{coll}$ scaling with and without pre-equilibrium flow. The model results
were compared to pion spectra, elliptic flow, and femtoscopic radii from 200
GeV Au+Au collisions for the 0--20% centrality range.Two sets of initial
density profiles, $N_{part}$ scaling with pre-equilibrium flow and $N_{coll}$
scaling without were shown to provide a consistent description of all three
measurements.
