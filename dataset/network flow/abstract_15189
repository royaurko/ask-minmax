We propose an analysis of the codified Law of France as a structured system.
Fifty two legal codes are selected on the basis of explicit legal criteria and
considered as vertices with their mutual quotations forming the edges in a
network which properties are analyzed relying on graph theory. We find that a
group of 10 codes are simultaneously the most citing and the most cited by
other codes, and are also strongly connected together so forming a "rich club"
sub-graph. Three other code communities are also found that somewhat partition
the legal field is distinct thematic sub-domains. The legal interpretation of
this partition is opening new untraditional lines of research. We also
conjecture that many legal systems are forming such new kind of networks that
share some properties in common with small worlds but are far denser. We
propose to call "concentrated world".
