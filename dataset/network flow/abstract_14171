We develop two different solar dynamo models to verify the hypothesis that a
deep meridional flow can restrict the apperance of sunspots below 45 degrees,
proposed by Nandy & Choudhuri (2002). In the first one, a single polytropic
approximation for the density profile was taken, for both radiative and
convective zones. In the second one, two polytropes were used to distinguish
between both zones Pinzon & Calvo-Mozo (2001). The magnetic buoyancy mechanism
proposed by Dikpati & Charbonneau (1999) was chosen in both models. We,
actually, have obtained that a deep meridional flow pushes the maxima of
toroidal magnetic field toward the solar equator, but in contrast to Nandy &
Choudhuri (2002) a second zone of maximal fields remains at the poles. The
second model, although closely resembling the solar standard model of Bahcall,
Pinsonneault & Wasserbug (1995); Bahcall, Pinsonneault & Basu (2001), gives
solar cyles three times longer than observed.
