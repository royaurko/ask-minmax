The possibilities of unlike particle correlations for a study of space--time
characteristics of particle production are demonstrated. The correlation data
from heavy ion collisions is discussed, particularly - in terms of the
transport RQMD and hydrodynamic models. An attention is paid to the relative
space-time asymmetries in the production of different particle species,
measured as a ratio of the correlation functions corresponding to different
directional selections of the relative momentum vector. Being sensitive to the
relative time delays and to the intensity of collective flows, these
asymmetries can become a promising tool in a study of the deconfinement
transition and the formation of quark-gluon plasma.
