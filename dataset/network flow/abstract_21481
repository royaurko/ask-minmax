The settling dynamics of spherical and elliptical particles in a viscous
Newtonian fluid are investigated numerically using a finite difference
technique. The terminal velocity for spherical particles is calculated for
different system sizes and the extrapolated value for an infinite system size
is compared to the Oseen approximation. Special attention is given to the
settling and tumbling motion of elliptical particles where their terminal
velocity is compared with the one of the surface equivalent spherical particle.
