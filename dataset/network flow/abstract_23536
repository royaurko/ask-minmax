Cholesteric elastomers possess a macroscopic ``phase chirality'' as the
director n rotates in a helical fashion along an optical axis $z$ and can be
described by a chiral order parameter. This parameter can be tuned by changing
the helix pitch p and/or the elastic properties of the network. The
cholesterics also possess a local nematic order, changing with temperature or
during solvent swelling. In this paper, by measuring the power of optical
rotation, we discover how these two parameters vary as functions of temperature
or solvent adsorbed by the network. The main result is a finding of pronounced
stereo-selectivity of cholesteric elastomers, demonstrating itself in the
retention of the ``correct'' chirality component of a racemic solvent. It has
been possible to quantify the amount of such stereo-separation, as the basic
dynamics of the effect.
