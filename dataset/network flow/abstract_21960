We derive a physiologically structured multiscale model for biofilm
development. The model has components on two spatial scales, which induce
different time scales into the problem. The macroscopic behavior of the system
is modeled using growth-induced flow in a domain with a moving boundary.
Cell-level processes are incorporated into the model using a so-called
physiologically structured variable to represent cell senescence, which in turn
affects cell division and mortality. We present computational results for our
models which shed light on modeling the combined role senescence and the
biofilm state play in the defense strategy of bacteria.
