It is shown that the Euler hydrodynamics for vortical flows of an ideal fluid
coincides with the equations of motion of a charged {\it compressible} fluid
moving due to a self-consistent electromagnetic field. Transition to the
Lagrangian description in a new hydrodynamics is equivalent for the original
Euler equations to the mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian description - the vortex line
representation (VLR). Due to compressibility of a "new" fluid the collapse of
vortex lines can happen as the result of breaking (or overturning) of vortex
lines. It is found that the Navier-Stokes equation in the vortex line
representation can be reduced to the equation of the diffusive type for the
Cauchy invariant with the diffusion tensor given by the metric of the VLR.
