Let (M,g) be an oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension at least 3 and X a
vector field on M. We show that the Monge-Amp\`ere differential system (M.A.S.)
for X-pseudosoliton hypersurfaces on (M,g) is equivalent to the minimal
hypersurface M.A.S. on (M,g') for some Riemannian metric g', if and only if X
is the gradient of a function u, in which case g'=exp(-2u)g. Counterexamples to
this equivalence for surfaces are also given.
