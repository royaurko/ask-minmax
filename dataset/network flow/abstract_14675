We study the energy flow of dissipative dynamics on infinite lattices,
allowing the total energy to be infinite and considering formally gradient
dynamics. We show that in spatial dimensions 1,2, the flow is for almost all
times arbitrarily close to the set of equilibria, and in dimensions 3 or more,
the size of the set with non-equilibrium dynamics for a positive density of
times is two dimensions less than the space dimension. The theory applies to
first and second order dynamics of elastic chains in a periodic or polynomial
potential, chains with interactions beyond the nearest neighbour, deterministic
dynamics of spin glasses, discrete complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and
others. We in particular apply the theory to show existence of coarsening
dynamics for a class of generalized Frenkel-Kontorova models in bistable
potential.
