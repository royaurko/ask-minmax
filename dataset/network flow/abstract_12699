In this paper we introduce a notion of viscosity solutions for Eikonal
equations defined on topological networks. Existence of a solution for the
Dirichlet problem is obtained via representation formulas involving a distance
function associated to the Hamiltonian. A comparison theorem based on Ishii's
classical argument yields the uniqueness of the solution.
