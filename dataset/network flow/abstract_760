In this paper we study a model for traffic flow on networks based on a
hyperbolic system of conservation laws with discontinuous flux. Each equation
describes the density evolution of vehicles having a common path along the
network. In this formulation the junctions apparently disappear since each path
is considered as a single uninterrupted road. We consider a Godunov-based
approximation scheme for the system which is very easy to implement. Besides
basic properties like the conservation of cars and positive bounded solutions,
the scheme exhibits nice properties, being able to select automatically a
reasonable solution at junctions without requiring external procedures (e.g.,
maximization of the flux via a linear programming method). Moreover, the scheme
can be interpreted as a discretization of the traffic models with buffer,
although any buffer is introduced here. Finally, we show how the scheme can be
recast in the framework of the classical theory of traffic flow on networks,
where a conservation law has to be solved on each arc of the network. This is
achieved by solving the Riemann problem for a modified equation, and showing
that its solution corresponds to the one computed by the numerical scheme.
