We propose and analyze a stochastic model which explains, analytically, the
cutoff behavior of real scale-free networks previously modeled computationally
by Amaral et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97, 11149 (2000)] and others.
We present a mathematical model that can explain several existing computational
scale-free network generation models. This yields a theoretical basis to
understand cutoff behavior in complex networks, previously treated only with
simulations using distinct models. Therefore, ours is an integrative approach
that unifies the existing literature on cutoff behavior in scale-free networks.
Furthermore, our mathematical model allows us to reach conclusions not hitherto
possible with computational models: the ability to predict the equilibrium
point of active vertices and to relate the growth of networks with the
probability of aging. We also discuss how our model introduces a useful way to
classify scale free behavior of complex networks.
