Now a days Vehicular Ad hoc Network is an emerging technology. Mobility
management is one of the most challenging research issues for Vehicular Ad hoc
Network to support variety of intelligent transportation system applications.
Vehicular Ad hoc Networks are getting importance for inter-vehicle
communication, because they allow the communication among vehicles without any
infrastructure, configuration effort, and without the high costs of cellular
networks. Besides local data exchange, vehicular applications may be used to
accessing Internet services. The access is provided by Internet gateways
located on the site of roadside. However, the Internet integration requires a
respective mobility support of the vehicular ad hoc network. In this paper we
will study about the network mobility approach in vehicular ad hoc network; the
model will describe the movement of vehicles from one network to other network.
The proposed handover scheme reduces the handover latency, packet loss
signaling overhead.
