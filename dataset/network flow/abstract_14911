We propose a network of oscillators to retrieve given patterns in which the
oscillators keep a fixed phase relationship with one another. In this
description, the phase and the amplitude of the oscillators can be regarded as
the timing and the strength of the neuronal spikes, respectively. Using the
amplitudes for encoding, we enable the network to realize not only oscillatory
states but also non-firing states. In addition, it is shown that under suitable
conditions the system has a Lyapunov function ensuring a stable retrieval
process. Finally, the associative memory capability of the network is
demonstrated numerically.
