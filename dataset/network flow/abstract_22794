Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold without boundary. Let D be a
compact subdomain of M with smooth boundary. We examine the heat content
asymptotics for the heat flow from D into M where both the initial temperature
and the specific heat are permitted to have controlled singularities on the
boundary of D. The operator driving the heat process is assumed to be an
operator of Laplace type
