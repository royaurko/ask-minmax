Tree-structured recursive neural networks (TreeRNNs) for sentence meaning
have been successful for many applications, but it remains an open question
whether the fixed-length representations that they learn can support tasks as
demanding as logical deduction. We pursue this question by evaluating whether
two such models---plain TreeRNNs and tree-structured neural tensor networks
(TreeRNTNs)---can correctly learn to identify logical relationships such as
entailment and contradiction using these representations. In our first set of
experiments, we generate artificial data from a logical grammar and use it to
evaluate the models' ability to learn to handle basic relational reasoning,
recursive structures, and quantification. We then evaluate the models on the
more natural SICK challenge data. Both models perform competitively on the SICK
data and generalize well in all three experiments on simulated data, suggesting
that they can learn suitable representations for logical inference in natural
language.
