We study the effect of resonance decays on intensity interferometry for heavy
ion collisions. Collective expansion of the source leads to a dependence of the
two-particle correlation function on the pair momentum K. This opens the
possibility to reconstruct the dynamics of the source from the K-dependence of
the measured HBT radii. Here we address the question to what extent resonance
decays can fake such a flow signal. Within a simple parametrization for the
emission function we present a comprehensive analysis of the interplay of flow
and resonance decays on the one- and two-particle spectra. We discuss in detail
the non-Gaussian features of the correlation function introduced by long-lived
resonances and the resulting problems in extracting meaningful HBT radii. We
propose to define them in terms of the second order q-moments of the correlator
C(q, K). We show that this yields a more reliable characterisation of the
correlator in terms of its width and the correlation strength `lambda' than
other commonly used fit procedures. The normalized fourth-order q-moments
(kurtosis) provide a quantitative measure for the non-Gaussian features of the
correlator. At least for the class of models studied here, the kurtosis helps
separating effects from expansion flow and resonance decays, and provides the
cleanest signal to distinguish between scenarios with and without transverse
flow.
