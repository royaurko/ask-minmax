We prove weak-strong uniqueness in the class of admissible measure-valued
solutions for the isentropic Euler equations in any space dimension and for the
Savage-Hutter model of granular flows in one and two space dimensions. For the
latter system, we also show the complete dissipation of momentum in finite
time, thus rigorously justifying an assumption that has been made in the
engineering and numerical literature.
