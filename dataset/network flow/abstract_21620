Inspiraling compact binaries are expected to be the strongest sources of
gravitational waves for VIRGO, LIGO and other laser interferometers. We present
the first computations of quasi-equilibrium sequences of compact binaries
containing two strange quark stars (which are currently considered as a
possible alternative to neutron stars). We study a precoalescing stage in the
conformal flatness approximation of general relativity using a multidomain
spectral method. A hydrodynamical treatment is performed under the assumption
that the flow is irrotational.
