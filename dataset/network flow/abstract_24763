Recent trend of railway train development can be characterized in several
aspects : high speed, infortainment, intelligence in driving, and so on. In
particular, trend of high speed in driving is prominent and competition for
high speed amongst several techno-savvy countries is becoming severe. To
achieve high speed, engines or motors are distributed over multiple vehicles of
train to provide increased motive power, while a single engine or motor has
been mostly used for conventional trains. Increased speed and more complicated
powertrain system naturally incur much higher chance of massive accidents. From
this perspective, importance of proactive safety control before accident takes
place cannot be over-emphasized. To implement proactive safety control requires
situation-aware integration and transmission of safety information obtained
from IoT sensors. Types of critical IoT sensors depend on situational
conditions. Thus, integration and transmission of safety information should be
performed with IoT sensors providing the safety information proper for faced
situation. This brief paper is to devise a methodology how to operate IoT
sensor network enabling proactive safety control for railway vehicles and to
propose a queue management based medium access control scheme.
