Calorimetry has been a traditional tool for obtaining invaluable
thermodynamic information of matter, the free energy. We describe recent
efforts to go beyond this traditional calorimetry: After introducing dynamic
heat capacity, we present the various experimental methods to measure it.
Applications and future prospects are also given.
