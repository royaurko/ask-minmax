We study monotonic quantities in the context of combined geometric flows. In
particular, focusing on Ricci solitons as the ambient space, we consider
solutions of the heat type equation integrated over embedded submanifolds
evolving by mean curvature flow and we study their monotonicity properties.
This is part of an ongoing project with Magni and Mantegazzawhich will treat
the case of non-solitonic backgrounds $\cite{a_14}$.
