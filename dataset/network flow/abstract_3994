Given an RNA sequence a, consider the network G = (V;E), where the set V of
nodes consists of all secondary structures of a, and whose edge set E consists
of all edges connecting two secondary structures whose base pair distance is 1.
De?ne the network connectivity, or expected network degree, as the average
number of edges incident to vertices of G. Using algebraic combinatorial
methods, we prove that the asymptotic connectivity of length n homopolymer
sequences is 0:473418 ? n. This raises the question of what other network
properties are characteristic of the network of RNA secondary structures.
