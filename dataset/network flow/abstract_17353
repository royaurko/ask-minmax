Basic notions of continuous media mechanics are introduced for spaces with
affine connections and metrics. The physical interpretation of the notion of
relative velocity is discussed. The notions of deformation velocity tensor,
shear velocity, rotation (vortex) velocity, and expansion velocity are
introduced. Different types of flows are considered.
