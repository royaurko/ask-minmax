The formalism of Kundu et al. [J. Stat. Mech. (2011) P03007], for computing
the large deviations of heat flow in harmonic systems, is applied to the case
of single Brownian particle in a harmonic trap and coupled to two heat baths at
different temperatures. The large-t form of the moment generating function
<exp[-sQ]> ~ g(s) exp[t m(s)], of the total heat flow Q from one of the baths
to the particle in a given time interval t, is studied and exact explicit
expressions are obtained for both m(s) and g(s). For a special case of the
single particle problem that corresponds to the work done by an external
stochastic force on a harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal bath, the
large-t form of the moment generating function is analyzed to obtain the exact
large deviation function as well as the complete asymptotic forms of the
probability density function of the work.
