This paper is a short summary of the main results in the thesis [1]. Based on
the P2P paradigm we construct a stochastic model for a live media streaming
content delivery network. Starting from the behavior of the out degree process
of each node we analyze the evolution of the resulting random graph. For the
out degree process we provide an iterative formula for the distribution
probabilities and calculate an explicit expression for the transient
distribution. Moreover we discuss the steady state distribution and the problem
of local disconnections.
