This paper presents a high speed implementation of an optical flow algorithm
which computes planar velocity fields in an experimental flow. Real-time
computation of the flow velocity field allows the experimentalist to have
instantaneous access to quantitative features of the flow. This can be very
useful in many situations: fast evaluation of the performances and
characteristics of a new setup, design optimization, easier and faster
parametric studies, etc. It can also be a valuable measurement tool for
closed-loop flow control experiments where fast estimation of the state of the
flow is needed. The algorithm is implemented on a Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU). The accuracy of the computation is shown. Computation speed and
scalability are highlighted along with guidelines for further improvements. The
system architecture is flexible, scalable and can be adapted on the fly in
order to process higher resolutions or achieve higher precision. The set-up is
applied on a Backward-Facing Step (BFS) flow in a hydrodynamic channel. For
validation purposes, classical Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used to
compare with instantaneous optical flow measurements. Important flow
characteristics, such as the dynamics of the recirculation bubble, are well
recovered in real time. Accuracy of real-time optical flow measurements is
comparable to off-line PIV computations.
