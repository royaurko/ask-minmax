This work presents an approach to the Navier-Stokes equations that is phrased
in unbiased Eulerian coordinates, yet describes objects that have Lagrangian
significance: particle paths, their dispersion and diffusion. The commutator
between Lagrangian and Eulerian derivatives plays an important role in the
Navier-Stokes equations: it contributes a singular perturbation to the Euler
equations, in addition to the Laplacian. Bounds for the Lagrangian
displacements, their first and second derivatives are obtained without
assumptions. Some of these rigorous bounds can be interpreted in terms of the
heuristic Richardson law of pair dispersion in turbulent flows.
