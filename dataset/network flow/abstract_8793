We analyze the possible concentration behavior of heat flows related to the
Moser-Trudinger energy and derive quantization results completely analogous to
the quantization results for solutions of the corresponding elliptic equation.
As an application of our results we obtain the existence of critical points of
the Moser-Trudinger energy in a supercritical regime.
