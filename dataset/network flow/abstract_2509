The OSI model, developed by ISO in 1984, attempts to summarize complicated
network cases on layers. Moreover, network troubles are expressed by taking the
model into account. However, there has been no standardization for network
troubles up to now. Network troubles have only been expressed by the name of
the related layer. In this paper, it is pointed out that possible troubles on
the related layer vary and possible troubles on each layer are categorized for
functional network administration and they are standardized in an eligible way.
The proposed model for network trouble shooting was developed considering the
OSI model.
