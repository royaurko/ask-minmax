We consider here probabilistic models of transportation flows. The main goal
of this introduction is rather not to present various techniques for problem
solving but to present some intuition to invent adequate and natural models
having visual simplicity and simple (but rigorous) formulation, the main
objects being cars not abstract flows. The papers consists of three parts.
First part considers mainly linear flows on short time scale - dynamics of the
flow due to changing driver behavior. Second part studies linear flow on longer
time scales - individual car trajectory from entry to exit from the road. Part
three considers collective car movement in complex transport networks.
