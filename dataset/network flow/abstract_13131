We consider a predator-prey model of planktonic population dynamics, of
excitable character, living in an open and chaotic fluid flow, i.e., a state of
fluid motion in which fluid trajectories are unbounded but a chaotic region
exists that is restricted to a localized area. Despite that excitability is a
transient phenomenon and that fluid trajectories are continuously leaving the
system, there is a regime of parameters where the excitation remains
permanently in the system, given rise to a persistent plankton bloom. This
regime is reached when the time scales associated to fluid stirring become
slower than the ones associated to biological growth.
