We show, both numerically and analytically, that the consequences of 'wiring
up' a competitive population depend quite dramatically on the interplay between
the local connectivity and the global resources. With modest global resources,
adding small amounts of local connectivity yields an increasingly heterogeneous
population. With substantial global resources, high-performing yet reasonably
homogenous collective states emerge instead.
