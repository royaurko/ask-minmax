In this paper, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the MIMO relay
networks. We start with a general Y channel, where each user has $M_i$ antennas
and aims to exchange messages with the other two users via a relay equipped
with $N$ antennas. Then, we extend our work to a general 4-user MIMO relay
network. Unlike most previous work which focused on the total DoF of the
network, our aim here is to characterize the achievable DoF region as well. We
develop an outer bound on the DoF region based on the notion of one sided
genie. Then, we define a new achievable region using the Signal Space Alignment
(SSA) and the Detour Schemes. Our achievable scheme achieves the upper bound
for certain conditions relating $M_i$'s and $N$.
