Type II (ancient) solutions to the Ricci flow on surfaces are not yet
classified. It is conjectured that the Rosenau solution and the cigar are the
only solutions, modulo scaling. In this paper, we mainly study the backward
limit and the circumference at spatial infinity of Type II ancient solutions on
noncompact surfaces.
