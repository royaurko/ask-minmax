Disease spread in most biological populations requires the proximity of
agents. In populations where the individuals have spatial mobility, the contact
graph is generated by the "collision dynamics" of the agents, and thus the
evolution of epidemics couples directly to the spatial dynamics of the
population. We first briefly review the properties and the methodology of an
agent-based simulation (EPISIMS) to model disease spread in realistic urban
dynamic contact networks. Using the data generated by this simulation, we
introduce the notion of dynamic proximity networks which takes into account the
relevant time scales for disease spread: contact duration, infectivity period
and rate of contact creation. This approach promises to be a good candidate for
a unified treatment of epidemic types that are driven by agent collision
dynamics. In particular, using a simple model, we show that it can can account
for the observed qualitative differences between the degree distributions of
contact graphs of diseases with short infectivity period (such as
air-transmitted diseases) or long infectivity periods (such as HIV).
