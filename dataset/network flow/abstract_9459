Consider a Gaussian relay network where a number of sources communicate to a
destination with the help of several layers of relays. Recent work has shown
that a compress-and-forward based strategy at the relays can achieve the
capacity of this network within an additive gap. In this strategy, the relays
quantize their observations at the noise level and map it to a random Gaussian
codebook. The resultant capacity gap is independent of the SNR's of the
channels in the network but linear in the total number of nodes.
  In this paper, we show that if the relays quantize their signals at a
resolution decreasing with the number of nodes in the network, the additive gap
to capacity can be made logarithmic in the number of nodes for a class of
layered, time-varying wireless relay networks. This suggests that the
rule-of-thumb to quantize the received signals at the noise level used for
compress-and-forward in the current literature can be highly suboptimal.
