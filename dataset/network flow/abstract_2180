We consider the static properties of periodic structures in weak random
disorder. We apply a functional renormalization group approach (FRG) and a
Gaussian variational method (GVM) to study their displacement correlations. We
focus in particular on the effects of temperature and we compute explicitly the
crossover length scales separating different regimes in the displacement
correlation function. To do so using the FRG we introduce a functional form
that approximate very accurately the flow of the disorder correlator at all
scales. We compare the FRG and GVM results and find excellent agreement. We
show that the FRG predicts in addition the existence of a third length scale
associated with the screening of the disorder by thermal fluctuations and
discuss a protocol to observe it.
