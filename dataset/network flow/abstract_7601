The strength of transverse flow is examined as a function of transverse
momentum $p_t$ using a simple, transversely moving thermal model and a more
realistic, relativistic transport model (ART). It is shown that the $p_t$
dependence reveals useful information about the collective flow that is
complementary to that obtained from the standard in-plane transverse momentum
analysis. Interesting features of using the $p_t$ dependence to study the
equation of state of the superdense hadronic matter formed in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions are demonstrated.
