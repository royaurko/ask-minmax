we study the statistical properties of inhomogenous Poisson networks. we
perform a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of Poisson networks
and show that the topological properties of random cellular structures, can be
derived from these models of random networks. we study both two and three
dimensional networks with non uniform density and show that with a class of
symmetric distribution $P(\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, ..., \lambda_{N})$ Lewis
and Aboav-Weaire laws are obeyed in these networks.
