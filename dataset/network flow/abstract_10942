The potential for associative recall of diluted neuronal networks is
investigated with respect to several biologically relevant configurations, more
specifically the position of the cells along the input space and the spatial
distribution of their connections. First we put the asymmetric Hopfield model
onto a scale-free Barabasi-Albert network. Then, a geometrical diluted
architecture, which maps from L-bit input patterns into $N$-neurons networks,
with R=N/L<1 (we adopt R=0.1, 0.2 and 0.3), is considered. The distribution of
the connections between cells along the one-dimensional input space follows a
normal distribution centered at each cell, in the sense that cells that are
closer to each other have increased probability to interconnect. The models
also explicitly consider the placement of the neuronal cells along the input
space in such a way that denser regions of that space tend to become denser,
therefore implementing a special case of the Barabasi-Albert connecting scheme.
The obtained results indicate that, for the case of the considered stimuli and
noise, the network performance increases with the spatial uniformity of cell
distribution.
