Emission line Doppler tomography is a powerful tool that resolves the
accretion flow in binaries on micro-arcsecond scales using time-resolved
spectroscopy. I present an extension to Doppler tomography that relaxes one of
its fundamental axioms and permits the mapping of time-dependent emission
sources. Significant variability on the orbital period is a common
characteristic of the emission sources that are observed in the accretion flows
of cataclysmic variables and X-ray binaries. Modulation Doppler tomography maps
sources varying harmonically as a function of the orbital period through the
simultaneous reconstruction of three Doppler tomograms. One image describes the
average flux distribution like in standard tomography, while the two additional
images describe the variable component in terms of its sine and cosine
amplitudes. I describe the implementation of such an extension in the form of
the maximum entropy based fitting code MODMAP. Test reconstructions of
synthetic data illustrate that the technique is robust and well constrained.
Artifact free reconstructions of complex emission distributions can be achieved
under a wide range of signal to noise levels. An application of the technique
is illustrated by mapping the orbital modulations of the asymmetric accretion
disc emission in the dwarf nova IP Pegasi.
