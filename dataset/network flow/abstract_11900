The problem of placement of mesh router nodes in Wireless Mesh Networks is
known to be a NP hard problem. In this paper, the problem is addressed under a
constraint of network model tied to rural regions where we usually observe low
density and sparse population. We consider the area to cover as decomposed into
a set of elementary areas which can be required or optional in terms of
coverage and where a node can be placed or not. We propose an effective
algorithm to ensure the coverage. This algorithm is based on metropolis
approach. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on an instance network. A close
to 100 percent coverage with an optimal number of routers showed the efficiency
of our approach for the mesh router node placement problem
