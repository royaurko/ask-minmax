We introduce a minimal network model which generates a modular structure in a
self-organized way. To this end, we modify the Barabasi-Albert model into the
one evolving under the principle of division and independence as well as growth
and preferential attachment (PA). A newly added vertex chooses one of the
modules composed of existing vertices, and attaches edges to vertices belonging
to that module following the PA rule. When the module size reaches a proper
size, the module is divided into two, and a new module is created. The karate
club network studied by Zachary is a prototypical example. We find that the
model can reproduce successfully the behavior of the hierarchical clustering
coefficient of a vertex with degree k, C(k), in good agreement with empirical
measurements of real world networks.
