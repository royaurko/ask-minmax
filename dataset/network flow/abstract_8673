We consider proportional fair rate allocation in a heterogeneous network with
a mix of LTE and 802.11 cells which supports multipath and multihomed operation
(simultaneous connection of a user device to multiple LTE BSs and 802.11 APs).
We show that the utility fair optimisation problem is non-convex but that a
global optimum can be found by solving a sequence of convex optimisations in a
distributed fashion. The result is a principled approach to offload from LTE to
802.11 and for exploiting LTE/802.11 path diversity to meet user traffic
demands.
