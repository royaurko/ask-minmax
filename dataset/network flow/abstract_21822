We consider two types of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in 2D
bounded domains: the heat-flow equation and the Schroedinger equation. The
system of ordinary differential equations is obtained that describes the
evolution of the vortices. It is shown that there exist the stationary points
for the both types of the equations. The motion of the particles is studied and
the examples of the trajectories are presented in the cases when the particles
move like electric charges and hydrodynamic vortices.
