Linking two network flows that have the same source is essential in intrusion
detection or in tracing anonymous connections. To improve the performance of
this process, the flow can be modified (fingerprinted) to make it more
distinguishable. However, an adversary located in the middle can modify the
flow to impair the correlation by delaying the packets or introducing dummy
traffic.
  We introduce a game-theoretic framework for this problem, that is used to
derive the Nash Equilibrium. As obtaining the optimal adversary delays
distribution is intractable, some approximations are done. We study the
concrete example where these delays follow a truncated Gaussian distribution.
We also compare the optimal strategies with other fingerprinting schemes. The
results are useful for understanding the limits of flow correlation based on
packet timings under an active attacker.
