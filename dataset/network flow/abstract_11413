Amplitude death is a dynamical phenomenon in which a network of oscillators
settles to a stable state as a result of coupling. Here, we study amplitude
death in a generalized model of delay-coupled delay oscillators. We derive
analytical results for degree homogeneous networks that show that amplitude
death is governed by certain eigenvalues of the network's adjacency matrix. In
particular these results demonstrate that in delay-coupled delay oscillators
amplitude death can occur for arbitrarily large coupling strength k. In this
limit we find a region of amplitude death, which occurs already at small
coupling delays that scale with 1/k. We show numerically that these results
remain valid in random networks with heterogeneous degree distribution.
