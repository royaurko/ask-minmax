We construct cross sections for the geodesic flow on the orbifolds
$\Gamma\backslash H$ which are tailor-made for the requirements of transfer
operator approaches to Maass cusp forms and Selberg zeta functions. Here, $H$
denotes the hyperbolic plane and $\Gamma$ is a nonuniform geometrically finite
Fuchsian group (not necessarily a lattice, not necessarily arithmetic) which
satisfies an additional condition of geometric nature. The construction of the
cross sections is uniform, geometric, explicit and algorithmic.
