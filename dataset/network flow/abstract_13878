Using high-resolution ring analysis (HRRA) we deduce subsurface flows within
magnetic active regions and within quiet sun. With this procedure we are
capable of measuring flows with a horizontal spatial resolution of 2 degrees in
heliographic angle (or roughly 20 Mm). From the resulting flow fields we deduce
mean inflow rates into active regions, mean circulation speeds around active
regions, and probability density functions (PDFs) of properties of the flow
field. These analyses indicate that active regions have a zonal velocity that
exceeds that of quiet sun at the same latitude by 20 m/s, yet active regions
advect poleward at the same rate as quiet sun. We also find that almost all
active regions possess a mean inflow (20-30 m/s) and a cyclonic circulation (~5
m/s) at their peripheries, whereas their cores, where the sunspots are located,
are zones of strong anticyclonic outflow (~50 m/s). From the PDFs, we find that
active regions modify the structure of convection with a scale greater than
that of supergranulation. Instead of possessing an asymmetry between inflows
and outflows (with a larger percentage of the surface occupied by outflows), as
is seen in quiet sun, active regions possess symmetric distributions.
