We consider a deformable body immersed in an incompressible liquid that is
randomly stirred. Sticking to physical situations in which the body departs
only slightly from its spherical shape, we calculate the diffusion constant of
the body. We give explicitly the dependence of the diffusion constant on the
velocity correlations in the liquid and on the size of the body. We emphasize
the particular case in which the random velocity field follows from thermal
agitation.
