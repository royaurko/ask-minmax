A complete and detailed knowledge of the structure of the gaseous component
in protoplanetary discs is essential to the study of dust evolution during the
early phases of pre-planetesimal formation. The aim of this paper is to
determine if three-dimensional accretion discs simulated by the Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method can reproduce the observational data now
available and the expected turbulent nature of protoplanetary discs. The
investigation is carried out by setting up a suite of diagnostic tools
specifically designed to characterise both the global flow and the fluctuations
of the gaseous disc. The main result concerns the role of the artificial
viscosity implementation in the SPH method: in addition to the already known
ability of SPH artificial viscosity to mimic a physical-like viscosity under
specific conditions, we show how the same artificial viscosity prescription
behaves like an implicit turbulence model. In fact, we identify a threshold for
the parameters in the standard artificial viscosity above which SPH disc models
present a cascade in the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations, turbulent
diffusion and a mass accretion rate of the same order of magnitude as measured
in observations. Furthermore, the turbulence properties observed locally in SPH
disc models are accompanied by meridional circulation in the global flow of the
gas, proving that the two mechanisms can coexist.
