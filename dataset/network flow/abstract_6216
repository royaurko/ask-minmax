We study the diameter, or the mean distance between sites, in a scale-free
network, having N sites and degree distribution p(k) ~ k^-a, i.e. the
probability of having k links outgoing from a site. In contrast to the diameter
of regular random networks or small world networks which is known to be d ~
lnN, we show, using analytical arguments, that scale free networks with 2<a<3
have a much smaller diameter, behaving as d ~ lnlnN. For a=3, our analysis
yields d ~ lnN/lnlnN, as obtained by Bollobas and Riordan, while for a>3, d ~
lnN. We also show that, for any a>2, one can construct a deterministic scale
free network with d ~ lnlnN, and this construction yields the lowest possible
diameter.
