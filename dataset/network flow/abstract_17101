In this article, we present a distributed framework for collecting and
analyzing environmental and location data recorded by human users (carriers)
with the use of portable sensors. We demonstrate the data mining analysis
potential among the recorded environmental and location variables, as well as
the potential for classification analysis of human activities. We recognize
that the success of such an experimental framework relies on the adoption rate
by its candidate user network; thus, we have built our experimental prototype
on top of hardware equipment already embedded within the potential users'
everyday routine - i.e. hardware sensors installed on modern mobile phones.
Finally, we present preliminary analysis results on our collected data sample,
as well as potential further work directions and proposed use case scenarios.
