This short paper introduces a new way by which to design production system
rules. An indirect encoding scheme is presented which views such rules as
protein complexes produced by the temporal behaviour of an artificial genetic
regulatory network. This initial study begins by using a simple Boolean
regulatory network to produce traditional ternary-encoded rules before moving
to a fuzzy variant to produce real-valued rules. Competitive performance is
shown with related genetic regulatory networks and rule-based systems on
benchmark problems.
