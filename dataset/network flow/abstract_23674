Email is an increasingly important and ubiquitous means of communication,
both facilitating contact between private individuals and enabling rises in the
productivity of organizations. However the relentless rise of automatic
uncontributorized emails, a.k.a. spam is eroding away much of the attractiveness of
email communication. Most of the attention dedicated to date to spam detection
has focused on the content of the emails or on the addresses or domains
associated with spam senders. Although methods based on these - easily
changeable - identifiers work reasonably well they miss on the fundamental
nature of spam as an opportunistic relationship, very different from the normal
mutual relations between senders and recipients of legitimate email. Here we
present a comprehensive graph theoretical analysis of email traffic that
captures these properties quantitatively. We identify several simple metrics
that serve both to distinguish between spam and legitimate email and to provide
a statistical basis for models of spam traffic.
