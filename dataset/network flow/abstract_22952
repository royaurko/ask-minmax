Some early-type galaxies show OVI emission, a tracer of gas at 10^5.5 K, and
a predicted product of gas cooling from the X-ray emitting temperatures. We
studied the spatial extent and velocity structure of this cooling gas by
obtaining spectra of the OVI doublet in NGC 4636 and NGC 5846 with the Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. For NGC 4636, the central LWRS pointing
shows that the OVI lines are double-peaked and symmetrical about the systemic
velocity of the galaxy, with a separation of 210 km/s. A LWRS observation 30"
from the center failed to show additional OVI emission. For NGC 5846, three
spectra were obtained with 4" x 20" apertures (MDRS) at the center and 4" to
the east and west of the center. The OVI line flux seen in the previous LWRS is
contained in the sum of the smaller apertures, with most of the flux in a
single non-central MDRS aperture, suggesting a size for the emission < 0.5 kpc;
the emission consists of a blue and red peak. For both galaxies, the OVI
velocity structure is similar to that of the optical [NII] emission and is
consistent with rotation. The compactness and velocity structure of the OVI
emission rules out cooling flow models with broadly distributed mass drop-out
but is consistent with cooling flow models where the cooling occurs primarily
in the central region. The 1E4 K gas may be the end state of the OVI gas.
