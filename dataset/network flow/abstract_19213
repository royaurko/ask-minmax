In this paper we investigate the exploitation of redundancy when routing
actuation data to a discrete-time LTI system connected to the controller via a
wireless network affected by packet drops. We assume that actuation packets can
be delivered from the controller to the actuator via multiple paths, each
associated with a delay and a packet loss probability. We show that the joint
design of controller gain and routing redundancy exploitation can tremendously
improve the control performance. To achieve this goal we set up and solve a LQR
problem for a class of systems that extends discrete-time Markov Jump Linear
Systems, in that both continuous and discrete control signals can be actuated.
