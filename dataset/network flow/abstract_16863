Among the novel metrics used to study the relative importance of nodes in
complex networks, k-core decomposition has found a number of applications in
areas as diverse as sociology, proteinomics, graph visualization, and
distributed system analysis and design. This paper proposes new distributed
algorithms for the computation of the k-core decomposition of a network, with
the purpose of (i) enabling the run-time computation of k-cores in "live"
distributed systems and (ii) allowing the decomposition, over a set of
connected machines, of very large graphs, that cannot be hosted in a single
machine. Lower bounds on the algorithms complexity are given, and an exhaustive
experimental analysis on real-world graphs is provided.
