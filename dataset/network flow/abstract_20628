We investigate the oscillatory properties of the quiet solar chromosphere in
relation to the underlying photosphere, with particular regard to the effects
of the magnetic topology. We perform a Fourier analysis on a sequence of
line-of-sight velocities measured simultaneously in a photospheric (Fe I 709.0
nm) and a chromospheric line (Ca II 854.2 nm). The velocities were obtained
from full spectroscopic data acquired at high spatial resolution with the
Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS). The field of view
encompasses a full supergranular cell, allowing us to discriminate between
areas with different magnetic characteristics. We show that waves with
frequencies above the acoustic cut-off propagate from the photosphere to upper
layers only in restricted areas of the quiet Sun. A large fraction of the quiet
chromosphere is in fact occupied by ``magnetic shadows'', surrounding network
regions, that we identify as originating from fibril-like structures observed
in the core intensity of the Ca II line. We show that a large fraction of the
chromospheric acoustic power at frequencies below the acoustic cut-off,
residing in the proximity of the magnetic network elements, directly propagates
from the underlying photosphere. This supports recent results arguing that
network magnetic elements can channel low-frequency photospheric oscillations
into the chromosphere, thus providing a way to input mechanical energy in the
upper layers.
