We calculate the s- and d-wave superconductor order parameter in the vicinity
of a tilt grain boundary. We do this self-consistently within the Bogoliubov de
Gennes equations, using a realistic microscopic model of the grain boundary. We
present the first self-consistent calculations of supercurrent flows in such
boundaries, obtaining the current-phase characteristics of grain boundaries in
both s-wave and d-wave superconductors.
