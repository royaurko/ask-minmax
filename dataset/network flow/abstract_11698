In this paper, we quantitatively (mathematically) reason the energy savings
achieved by the Leveling and Sectoring protocol. Due to the energy constraints
on the sensor nodes (in terms of supply of energy) energy awareness has become
crucial in networking protocol stack. The understanding of routing protocols
along with energy awareness in a network would help in energy opti-mization
with efficient routing .We provide analytical modelling of the energy wastage
in the absence of Leveling and Sectoring protocol by considering the network in
the form of binary tree, nested tree and Q-ary tree. The simulation results
reflect the energy wastage in the absence of Levelling and Sectoring based
hybrid protocol.
