More than a decade ago, a surprising coexistence of synchronous and
asynchronous behavior called the chimera state was discovered in networks of
nonlocally coupled identical phase oscillators. In later years, chimeras were
found to occur in a variety of theoretical and experimental studies of chemical
and optical systems, as well as models of neuron dynamics. In this work, we
study two coupled populations of pendulum-like elements represented by phase
oscillators with a second derivative term multiplied by a mass parameter $m$
and treat the first order derivative terms as dissipation with parameter
$\epsilon>0$. We first present numerical evidence showing that chimeras do
exist in this system for small mass values $0<m<<1$. We then proceed to explain
these states by reducing the coherent population to a single damped pendulum
equation driven parametrically by oscillating averaged quantities related to
the incoherent population.
