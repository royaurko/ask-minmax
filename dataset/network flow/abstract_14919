We present results from a detailed numerical study of the small-scale and
loop production properties of cosmic string networks, based on the largest and
highest resolution string simulations to date. We investigate the non-trivial
fractal properties of cosmic strings, in particular, the fractal dimension and
renormalised string mass per unit length, and we also study velocity
correlations. We demonstrate important differences between string networks in
flat (Minkowski) spacetime and the two very similar expanding cases. For high
resolution matter era network simulations, we provide strong evidence that
small-scale structure has converged to `scaling' on all dynamical lengthscales,
without the need for other radiative damping mechanisms. We also discuss
preliminary evidence that the dominant loop production size is also approaching
scaling.
