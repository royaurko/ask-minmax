The spread of ideas across a social network can be studied using complex
contagion models, in which agents are activated by contact with multiple
activated neighbors. The investigation of complex contagions can provide
crucial insights into social influence and behavior-adoption cascades on
networks. In this paper, we introduce a model of a multi-stage complex
contagion on networks. Agents at different stages --- which could, for example,
represent differing levels of support for a social movement or differing levels
of commitment to a certain product or idea --- exert different amounts of
influence on their neighbors. We demonstrate that the presence of even one
additional stage introduces novel dynamical behavior, including interplay
between multiple cascades, that cannot occur in single-stage contagion models.
We find that cascades --- and hence collective action --- can be driven not
only by high-stage influencers but also by low-stage influencers.
