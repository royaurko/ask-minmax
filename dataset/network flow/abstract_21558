We use FLUENT to calculate the wind profile over barchans and transverse
dunes. The form of the streamlines of flow separation at the lee side of the
dunes is determined for a symmetric barchan dune in three dimensions, and for
the height profile of a measured transverse dune field in the Len\c{c}\'ois
Maranhenses.
