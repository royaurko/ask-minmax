Energy cost of cellular networks is ever-increasing to match the surge of
wireless data traffic, and the saving of this cost is important to reduce the
operational expenditure (OPEX) of wireless operators in future. The recent
advancements of renewable energy integration and two-way energy flow in smart
grid provide potential new solutions to save the cost. However, they also
impose challenges, especially on how to use the stochastically and spatially
distributed renewable energy harvested at cellular base stations (BSs) to
reliably supply time- and space-varying wireless traffic over cellular
networks. To overcome these challenges, in this article we present three
approaches, namely, {\emph{energy cooperation, communication cooperation, and
joint energy and communication cooperation}}, in which different BSs
bidirectionally trade or share energy via the aggregator in smart grid, and/or
share wireless resources and shift loads with each other to reduce the total
energy cost.
