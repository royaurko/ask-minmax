Capillarity always favors drop fusion. Nevertheless sessile drops from
different but completely miscible liquids often do not fuse instantaneously
upon contact. Rather, intermediate non-coalescence is observed. Two separate
drop bodies, connected by a thin liquid neck move over the substrate. Supported
by new experimental data a thin film hydrodynamic analysis of this state is
presented. Presumably advective and diffusive volume fluxes in the neck region
establish a localized and temporarily stable surface tension gradient. This
induces a local surface (Marangoni) flow that stabilizes a traveling wave i.e.,
the observed moving twin drop configuration. The theoretical predictions are in
excellent agreement with the experimental findings.
