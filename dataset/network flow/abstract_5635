Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a major and very interesting technology,
which consists of small battery powered sensor nodes with limited power
resources. The sensor nodes are inaccessible to the user once they are
deployed. Replacing the battery is not possible every time. Hence in order to
improve the lifetime of the network, energy efficiency of the net- work needs
to be maximized by decreasing the energy consumption of all the sensor nodes
and balancing energy consumption of every node. Several protocols have been
proposed earlier to improve the network lifetime using optimization algorithms.
Firefly is a metaheuristic approach. In this paper, Energy efficient clustering
for wireless sensor networks using Firefly and Jumper Firefly algorithms are
simulated. A new cost function has been defined to minimize the intra- cluster
distance to optimize the energy consumption of the network. The performance is
compared with the existing protocol LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering
Hierarchy).
