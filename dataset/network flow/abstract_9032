Performance bounds for opportunistic networks have been derived in a number
of recent papers for several key quantities, such as the expected delivery time
of a unicast message, or the flooding time (a measure of how fast information
spreads). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing results
is derived under a mobility model which is able to reproduce the power
law+exponential tail dichotomy of the pairwise node inter-contact time
distribution which has been observed in traces of several real opportunistic
networks.
  The contributions of this paper are two-fold: first, we present a simple
pairwise contact model -- called the Home-MEG model -- for opportunistic
networks based on the observation made in previous work that pairs of nodes in
the network tend to meet in very few, selected locations (home locations); this
contact model is shown to be able to faithfully reproduce the power
law+exponential tail dichotomy of inter-contact time. Second, we use the
Home-MEG model to analyze flooding time in opportunistic networks, presenting
asymptotic bounds on flooding time that assume different initial conditions for
the existence of opportunistic links.
  Finally, our bounds provide some analytical evidences that the speed of
information spreading in opportunistic networks can be much faster than that
predicted by simple geometric mobility models.
