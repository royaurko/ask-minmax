We present XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer observations of X-ray
clusters and groups of galaxies. We demonstrate the failure of the standard
cooling-flow model to describe the soft X-ray spectrum of clusters of galaxies.
We also emphasize several new developments in the study of the soft X-ray
spectrum of cooling flows. Although there is some uncertainty in the expected
mass deposition rate for any individual cluster, we show that high resolution
RGS spectra robustly demonstrate that the expected line emission from the
isobaric cooling-flow model is absent below 1/3 of the background temperature
rather than below a fixed temperature in all clusters. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the best-resolved cluster spectra are inconsistent with the
predicted shape of the differential luminosity distribution and the measured
distribution is tilted to higher temperatures. These observations create
several fine-tuning challenges for current theoretical explanations for the
soft X-ray cooling-flow problem. Comparisons between these observations and
other X-ray measurements are discussed.
