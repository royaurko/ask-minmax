Wireless Sensor Networks is important to nodes energy consumption for long
activity of sensor nodes because nodes that compose sensor network are small
size, and battery capacity is limited. For energy consumption decrease of
sensor nodes, sensor networks routing technique is divided by flat routing and
hierarchical routing technique. Specially, hierarchical routing technique is
energy efficient routing protocol to pare down energy consumption of whole
sensor nodes and to scatter energy consumption of sensor nodes by forming
cluster and communicating with cluster head. but though hierarchical routing
technique based on clustering is advantage more than flat routing technique,
this is not used for reason that is not realistic. The reason that is not
realistic is because hierarchical routing technique does not consider data
transmission radius of sensor node in actually. so this paper propose realistic
routing technique base on clustering.
