We propose a model for the growth of weighted networks that couples the
establishment of new edges and vertices and the weights' dynamical evolution.
The model is based on a simple weight-driven dynamics and generates networks
exhibiting the statistical properties observed in several real-world systems.
In particular, the model yields a non-trivial time evolution of vertices'
properties and scale-free behavior for the weight, strength and degree
distributions.
