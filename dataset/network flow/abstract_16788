We use tetrahedral microwave networks consisting of coaxial cables and
attenuators connected by T-joints to make an experimental study of Wigner's
reaction K matrix for irregular graphs in the presence of absorption. From
measurements of the scattering matrix S for each realization of the microwave
network we obtain distributions of the imaginary and real parts of K. Our
experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions.
