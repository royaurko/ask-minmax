Mathematical model for hit phenomena presented by A Ishii et al in 2012 has
been extended to analyze and predict a lot of hit subject using social network
system. The equation for each individual consumers is assumed and the equation
of social response to each hit subject is derived as stochastic process of
statistical physics. The advertisement effect is included as external force and
the communication effects are included as two-body and three-body interaction.
The applications of this model are demonstrated for analyzing population of
weekly TV drama. Including both the realtime view data and the playback view
data, we found that the indirect communication correlate strongly to the TV
viewing rate data for recent Japanese 20 TV drama.
