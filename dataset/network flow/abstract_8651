This paper presents a study of two characteristic distributed stochastic
approximation algorithms based on broadcast gossip on communication networks
represented by digraphs. Weak convergence of these algorithms is proved based
on the formulation of a limit ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is a
function of communication rates and network parameters. Using these results, a
general methodology is proposed for network design aimed at achieving the
desired asymptotic properties of the estimates at consensus. Convergence rate
of the algorithm is analyzed and further improved using an attached stochastic
differential equation. Some simulation results give an illustration of the
theoretical concepts.
