Compton scattering in the bulk accretion flow of the accretion column in
magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) can significantly shift photon energies
in the X-ray emission lines resulting from accretion shocks. In particular,
Compton recoil can potentially broaden the 6.7 and 6.97 keV Fe K$\alpha$
emission lines produced in the post-shock region, and contaminate the
fluorescent 6.4 keV neutral Fe K$\alpha$ line reflected off the white dwarf
surface. We present nonlinear Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating these
effects, and we discuss the interpretation of observed Fe K$\alpha$ linewidths
in mCVs in light of these new results. The implications for other accreting
compact objects are also discussed.
