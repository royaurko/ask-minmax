Clustering procedure for the case where instead of a fixed metric one applies
a family of metrics is considered. In this case instead of a classification
tree one obtains a classification network (a directed acyclic graph with non
directed cycles).
  Relation to Bruhat-Tits buildings is discussed. Dimension of a general
cluster system is considered.
