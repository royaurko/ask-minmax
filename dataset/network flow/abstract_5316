Modern tsunami deposits are employed to estimate the overland flow
characteristics of tsunamis. With the help of the overland-flow
characteristics, the characteristics of the causative tsunami wave can be
estimated. The understanding of tsunami deposits has tremendously improved over
the last decades. There are three prominent inversion models: Moore advection
model, Soulsby's model and TsuSedMod model. TSUFLIND incorporates all three
models and adds new modules to better simulate tsunami deposit formation and
calculate flow condition. TSUFLIND takes grain-size distribution, thickness,
water depth and topography information as inputs. TSUFLIND computes sediment
concentration, grain-size distribution of sediment source and initial flow
condition to match the sediment thickness and grain size distribution from
field observation. Furthermore, TSUFLIND estimates the flow speed, Froude
number and representative wave amplitude. The model is tested by using field
data collected at Ranganathapuram, India after the 2004 India Ocean tsunami.
TSUFLIND reproduces the field measurement grain-size distribution with less
than 5% error. Tsunami speed in this test case is about 4.7 m/s at 150 meters
inland and decreases to 3.3 m/s 350 meters inland from the shoreline. The
estimated wave amplitude of the largest wave for this test case is about 5 to 7
meters.
