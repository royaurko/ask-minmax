We introduce the notions of arithmetic colorings and arithmetic flows over a
graph with labelled edges, which generalize the notions of colorings and flows
over a graph.
  We show that the corresponding arithmetic chromatic polynomial and arithmetic
flow polynomial are given by suitable specializations of the associated
arithmetic Tutte polynomial, generalizing classical results of Tutte.
