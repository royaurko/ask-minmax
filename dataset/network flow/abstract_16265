We evaluate the horseshoe drag exerted on a low-mass planet embedded in a
gaseous disk, assuming the disk's flow in the coorbital region to be adiabatic.
We restrict this analysis to the case of a planet on a circular orbit, and we
assume a steady flow in the corotating frame. We also assume that the
corotational flow upstream of the U-turns is unperturbed, so that we discard
saturation effects. In addition to the classical expression for the horseshoe
drag in barotropic disks, which features the vortensity gradient across
corotation, we find an additional term which scales with the entropy gradient,
and whose amplitude depends on the perturbed pressure at the stagnation point
of the horseshoe separatrices. This additional torque is exerted by evanescent
waves launched at the horseshoe separatrices, as a consequence of an asymmetry
of the horseshoe region. It has a steep dependence on the potential's softening
length, suggesting that the effect can be extremely strong in the three
dimensional case. We describe the main properties of the coorbital region (the
production of vortensity during the U-turns, the appearance of vorticity sheets
at the downstream separatrices, and the pressure response), and we give torque
expressions suitable to this regime of migration. Side results include a weak,
negative feed back on migration, due to the dependence of the location of the
stagnation point on the migration rate, and a mild enhancement of the
vortensity related torque at large entropy gradient.
