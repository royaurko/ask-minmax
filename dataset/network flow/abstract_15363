Back-propagation algorithm is one of the most widely used and popular
techniques to optimize the feed forward neural network training. Nature
inspired meta-heuristic algorithms also provide derivative-free solution to
optimize complex problem. Artificial bee colony algorithm is a nature inspired
meta-heuristic algorithm, mimicking the foraging or food source searching
behaviour of bees in a bee colony and this algorithm is implemented in several
applications for an improved optimized outcome. The proposed method in this
paper includes an improved artificial bee colony algorithm based
back-propagation neural network training method for fast and improved
convergence rate of the hybrid neural network learning method. The result is
analysed with the genetic algorithm based back-propagation method, and it is
another hybridized procedure of its kind. Analysis is performed over standard
data sets, reflecting the light of efficiency of proposed method in terms of
convergence speed and rate.
