We study the long time behavior (homogenization) of a diffusion in random
medium with time and space dependent coefficients. The diffusion coefficient
may degenerate. In Stochastic Process. Appl. (2007) (to appear), an invariance
principle is proved for the critical rescaling of the diffusion. Here, we
generalize this approach to diffusions whose space-time scaling differs from
the critical one.
