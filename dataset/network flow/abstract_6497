The global dynamics of gene regulatory networks are known to show robustness
to perturbations in the form of intrinsic and extrinsic noise, as well as
mutations of individual genes. One molecular mechanism underlying this
robustness has been identified as the action of so-called microRNAs that
operate via feedforward loops. We present results of a computational study,
using the modeling framework of stochastic Boolean networks, which explores the
role that such network motifs play in stabilizing global dynamics. The paper
introduces a new measure for the stability of stochastic networks. The results
show that certain types of feedforward loops do indeed buffer the network
against stochastic effects.
