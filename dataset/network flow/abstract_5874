This work analyses the practice of sister city pairing. We investigate
structural properties of the resulting city and country networks and present
rankings of the most central nodes in these networks. We identify different
country clusters and find that the practice of sister city pairing is not
influenced by geographical proximity but results in highly assortative
networks.
