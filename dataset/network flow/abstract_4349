The study of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) requires efficient and
accurate simulation tools. As the mobility of vehicles and driver behavior can
be affected by network messages, these tools must include a vehicle mobility
model integrated with a quality network simulator. We present the first
implementation of a well-known vehicle mobility model to ns-3, the next
generation of the popular ns-2 networking simulator. Vehicle mobility and
network communication are integrated through events. User-created event
handlers can send network messages or alter vehicle mobility each time a
network message is received and each time vehicle mobility is updated by the
model. To aid in creating simulations, we have implemented a straight highway
model that manages vehicle mobility, while allowing for various user
customizations. We show that the results of our implementation of the mobility
model matches that of the model's contributor and provide an example of using our
implementation in ns-3.
