The degree distribution is an important characteristic of complex networks.
In many data analysis applications, the networks should be represented as
fixed-length feature vectors and therefore the feature extraction from the
degree distribution is a necessary step. Moreover, many applications need a
similarity function for comparison of complex networks based on their degree
distributions. Such a similarity measure has many applications including
classification and clustering of network instances, evaluation of network
sampling methods, anomaly detection, and study of epidemic dynamics. The
existing methods are unable to effectively capture the similarity of degree
distributions, particularly when the corresponding networks have different
sizes. Based on our observations about the structure of the degree
distributions in networks over time, we propose a feature extraction and a
similarity function for the degree distributions in complex networks. We
propose to calculate the feature values based on the mean and standard
deviation of the node degrees in order to decrease the effect of the network
size on the extracted features. The proposed method is evaluated using
different artificial and real network datasets, and it outperforms the state of
the art methods with respect to the accuracy of the distance function and the
effectiveness of the extracted features.
