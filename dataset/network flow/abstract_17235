By combining the Grassmann algebra with multi-scale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (MERA), we introduce a new unbiased and effective
numerical method for simulating 2D strongly correlated electronic systems. The
new GMERA method inherits all the advantages of MERA, which constructs the
variational wave function based on complicated tensor network. Besides it can
deal with fermionic properties of the system due to Grassmann algebra through
local tensor contractions. This general method can treat different tensor
network structures in a universal way. We show several benchmark calculations
of the GMERA method, including the free fermion model, tight binding model, as
well as the t-J model with hole doping.
