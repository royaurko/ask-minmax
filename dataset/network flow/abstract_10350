The spin splitting of collective flows in intermediate-energy heavy-ion
collisions as a result of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction has been
investigated based on a spin- and isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehing-Uhlenbeck
transport model. We found that the spin splittings of the directed flow and
elliptic flow are largest in peripheral heavy-ion collisions at beam energies
of about 100-200 MeV/nucleon, and the effect is considerable even in smaller
systems and appreciable for nucleons with high transverse momenta. Our study is
useful for understanding the spin dynamics in heavy-ion collision and the
nature of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction.
