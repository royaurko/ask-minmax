Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks based on Poisson point
processes are increasingly being developed with a focus on studying various
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) values. We show that the SINR
values experienced by a typical user with respect to different base stations of
a Poissonian cellular network are related to a specific instance of the
so-called two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process. This process has many
interesting properties as well as applications in various fields. We give
examples of several results proved for this process that are of immediate or
potential interest in the development of analytic tools for cellular networks.
Some of them simplify or are akin to certain results that are recently being
developed in wireless networks literature. By doing this we hope to motivate
further research and use of Poisson-Dirichlet processes in this new setting.
