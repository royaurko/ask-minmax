This paper makes the first attempt to show how information exchange rules
represented by a network having multiple layers (multiplex information
networks) can be designed for enabling spatially evolving multiagent
formations. Toward this goal, we consider the invariant formation problem and
introduce a distributed control architecture that allows capable agents to
spatially alter the resulting formation's density and orientation without
requiring global information exchange ability.
