Network control refers to a very large and diverse set of problems including
controllability of linear time-invariant dynamical systems evolving over time
that have inputs and outputs. The network control problem in this setting is to
select the appropriate input to steer the network into a desired output state.
Examples of the output state include the throughput of a communications
network, transcription factor concentration in a gene regulatory network,
customer purchases in a marketing context subject to social influences and the
amount of flux flowing through a biochemical network.
  We focus on control of linear dynamical systems under the notion of
structural controllability which is intimately connected to finding maximum
matchings. Hence, a natural objective is studying scalable and fast algorithms
for this task. We first show the convergence of matching algorithms for
different random networks and then analyze a popular, fast and practical
heuristic due to Karp and Sipser. We establish the optimality of both the
Karp-Sipser Algorithm as well as a simplification of it, and provide results
concerning the asymptotic size of maximum matchings for an extensive class of
random networks.
