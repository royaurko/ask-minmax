We study the evolution of opinions (or beliefs) over a social network modeled
as a signed graph. The sign attached to an edge in this graph characterizes
whether the corresponding individuals or end nodes are friends (positive links)
or enemies (negative links). Pairs of nodes are randomly selected to interact
over time, and when two nodes interact, each of them updates its opinion based
on the opinion of the other node and the sign of the corresponding link. This
model generalizes DeGroot model to account for negative links: when two enemies
interact, their opinions go in opposite directions. We provide conditions for
convergence and divergence in expectation, in mean-square, and in almost sure
sense, and exhibit phase transition phenomena for these notions of convergence
depending on the parameters of the opinion update model and on the structure of
the underlying graph. We establish a {\it no-survivor} theorem, stating that
the difference in opinions of any two nodes diverges whenever opinions in the
network diverge as a whole. We also prove a {\it live-or-die} lemma, indicating
that almost surely, the opinions either converge to an agreement or diverge.
Finally, we extend our analysis to cases where opinions have hard lower and
upper limits. In these cases, we study when and how opinions may become
asymptotically clustered to the belief boundaries, and highlight the crucial
influence of (strong or weak) structural balance of the underlying network on
this clustering phenomenon.
