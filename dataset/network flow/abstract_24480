In various wireless systems, such as sensor RFID networks and body area
networks with implantable devices, the transmitted signals are simultaneously
used both for information transmission and for energy transfer. In order to
satisfy the conflicting requirements on information and energy transfer, this
paper proposes the use of constrained run-length limited (RLL) codes in lieu of
conventional unconstrained (i.e., random-like) capacity-achieving codes. The
receiver's energy utilization requirements are modeled stochastically, and
constraints are imposed on the probabilities of battery underflow and overflow
at the receiver. It is demonstrated that the codewords' structure afforded by
the use of constrained codes enables the transmission strategy to be better
adjusted to the receiver's energy utilization pattern, as compared to classical
unstructured codes. As a result, constrained codes allow a wider range of
trade-offs between the rate of information transmission and the performance of
energy transfer to be achieved.
