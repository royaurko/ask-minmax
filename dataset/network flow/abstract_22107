The F.A.S.T. model for microscopic simulation of pedestrians was formulated
with the idea of parallelizability and small computation times in general in
mind, but so far it was never demonstrated, if it can in fact be implemented
efficiently for execution on a multi-core or multi-CPU system. In this
contribution results are given on computation times for the F.A.S.T. model on
an eight-core PC.
