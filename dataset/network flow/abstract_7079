In this Letter, the 2-dimensional dense flow of polygonal particles on an
incline with a flat frictional inferior boundary is analyzed by means of
contact dynamics discrete element simulations, in order to develop boundary
conditions for continuum models of dense granular flows. We show the evidence
that the global slip phenomenon deviates significantly from simple sliding: a
finite slip velocity is generally found for shear forces lower than the sliding
threshold for particle-wall contacts. We determined simple scaling laws for the
dependence of the slip velocity on shear rate, normal and shear stresses, and
material parameters.The importance of a correct determination of the slip at
the base of the incline, which is crucial for the calculation of flow rates, is
discussed in relation to natural flows.
