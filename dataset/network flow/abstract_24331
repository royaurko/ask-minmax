This paper introduces collaborating robots which provide the possibility of
enhanced task performance, high reliability and decreased. Collaborating-bots
are a collection of mobile robots able to self-assemble and to self-organize in
order to solve problems that cannot be solved by a single robot. These robots
combine the power of swarm intelligence with the flexibility of
self-reconfiguration as aggregate Collaborating-bots can dynamically change
their structure to match environmental variations. Collaborating robots are
more than just networks of independent agents, they are potentially
reconfigurable networks of communicating agents capable of coordinated sensing
and interaction with the environment. Robots are going to be an important part
of the future. Collaborating robots are limited in individual capability, but
robots deployed in large numbers can represent a strong force similar to a
colony of ants or swarm of bees. We present a mechanism for collaborating
robots based on swarm intelligence such as Ant colony optimization and Particle
swarm Optimization
