The blowdown of high pressure gas in a pressure vessel produces rapid
adiabatic cooling of the gas remaining in the vessel. The gas near the wall is
warmed by conduction from the wall, producing radial temperature and density
gradients that affect the flow, the mass efflux rate and the thermodynamic
states of both the outflowing and the contained gas. The resulting
buoyancy-driven flow circulates gas through the vessel and reduces, but does
not eliminate, these gradients. The purpose of this note is to estimate when
blowdown cooling is rapid enough that the gas in the pressure vessel is neither
isothermal nor isopycnic, though it remains isobaric. I define a dimensionless
number, the buoyancy circulation number BC, that parametrizes these effects.
