The tame flows are ``nice'' flows on ``nice'' spaces. The nice (tame) sets
are the pfaffian sets introduced by Khovanski, and a flow $\Phi:
\mathbb{R}\times X\to X$ on pfaffian set $X$ is tame if the graph of $\Phi$ is
a pfaffian subset of $\mathbb{R}\times X\times X$. Any compact tame set admits
plenty tame flows. We prove that the flow determined by the gradient of a
generic real analytic function with respect to a generic real analytic metric
is tame. The typical tame gradient flow satisfies the Morse-Smale condition,
and we prove that in the tame context the Morse-Smale condition is equivalent
to the fact that the stratification by unstable manifolds is Verdier and
Whitney regular. We explain how to compute the Conley indices of isolated
stationary points of tame flows in terms of their unstable varieties, and then
use this technology to produce a Morse theory on posets generalizing R.
Forman's discrete Morse theory. Finally, we use the Harvey-Lawson finite volume
flow technique to produce a homotopy between the DeRham complex of a smooth
manifold and the simplicial chain complex associated to a triangulation.
