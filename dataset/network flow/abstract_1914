In the landscape of application ecosystems, today's cloud users wish to
personalize not only their browsers with various extensions or their
smartphones with various applications, but also the various extensions and
applications themselves. The resulting personalization significantly raises the
attractiveness for typical Web 2.0 users, but gives rise to various security
risks and privacy concerns, such as unforeseen access to certain critical
components, undesired information flow of personal information to untrusted
applications, or emerging attack surfaces that were not possible before a
personalization has taken place.
  In this paper, we propose a novel extensibility mechanism which is used for
implementing personalization of existing cloud applications towards (possibly
untrusted) components in a secure and privacy-friendly manner. Our model
provides a clean component abstraction, thereby in particular ruling out
undesired component accesses and ensuring that no undesired information flow
takes place between application components -- either trusted from the base
application or untrusted from various extensions. We then instantiate our model
in the SAFE web application framework (WWW 2012), resulting in a novel
methodology that is inspired by traditional access control and specifically
designed for the newly emerging needs of extensibility in application
ecosystems. We illustrate the convenient usage of our techniques by showing how
to securely extend an existing social network application.
