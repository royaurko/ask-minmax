Zonal flows are well known to arise spontaneously out of turbulence. We show
that for statistically averaged equations of the stochastically forced
generalized Hasegawa-Mima model, steady-state zonal flows and inhomogeneous
turbulence fit into the framework of pattern formation. There are many
implications. First, the wavelength of the zonal flows is not unique. Indeed,
in an idealized, infinite system, any wavelength within a certain continuous
band corresponds to a solution. Second, of these wavelengths, only those within
a smaller subband are linearly stable. Unstable wavelengths must evolve to
reach a stable wavelength; this process manifests as merging jets.
