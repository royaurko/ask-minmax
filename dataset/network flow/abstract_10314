In ion-exchange membrane processes, ions and water flow under the influence
of gradients in hydrostatic pressure, ion chemical potential, and electrical
potential (voltage), leading to solvent flow, ionic fluxes and ionic current.
At the outer surfaces of the membranes, electrical double layers (EDLs) are
formed (Donnan layers). When a current flows through the membrane, we argue
that besides the positive Joule heating in the bulk of the membrane and in the
electrolyte outside the membrane, there is also negative Joule heating in one
of the EDLs. We define Joule heating as the inner product of the two vectors
current and field strength. Also when fluid flows through a charged membrane,
at one side of the membrane there is pressure-related cooling, due to the
osmotic and hydrostatic pressure differences across the EDLs.
