This research work denotes a novel evaluation of LOADng the routing protocol
for Wireless Sensor Network. The LOADng protocol implementation is a part of
ITU-T G.9903 recommendation based on the framework of the LLN On-demand Ad hoc
Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng) proposed by IETF
specified by the IETF Internet-Draft draft-clausen-lln-loadng-11 and currently
still in its design phase. LOADng is a reactive on demand distance vector
routing protocol derived from AODV the Ad hoc On-demand distance vector
protocol proposed by IETF. This work was motivated by the need for a novel
protocol implementation for smart metering applications providing better
performance and less complexity than RPL the Routing Protocol for Low power and
lossy networks and adapted to (LLNs) requirements and constraints. Our
implementation was successfully integrated into the communication layer of
Contiki OS the Wireless Sensor Network operating system and evaluated through
extensive simulations for AMI Mesh Networks.
