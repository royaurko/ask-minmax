This paper investigates coverage control for visual sensor networks based on
gradient descent techniques on matrix manifolds. We consider the scenario that
networked vision sensors with controllable orientations are distributed over
3-D space to monitor 2-D environment. Then, the decision variable must be
constrained on the Lie group SO(3). The contribution of this paper is two
folds. The first one is technical, namely we formulate the coverage problem as
an optimization problem on SO(3) without introducing local parameterization
like Eular angles and directly apply the gradient descent algorithm on the
manifold. The second technological contribution is to present not only the
coverage control scheme but also the density estimation process including image
processing and curve fitting while exemplifying its effectiveness through
simulation of moving objects monitoring.
