We consider the problem of unveiling the implicit network structure of user
interactions in a social network, based only on high-frequency timestamps. Our
inference is based on the minimization of the least-squares loss associated
with a multivariate Hawkes model, penalized by $\ell_1$ and trace norms. We
provide a first theoretical analysis of the generalization error for this
problem, that includes sparsity and low-rank inducing priors. This result
involves a new data-driven concentration inequality for matrix martingales in
continuous time with observable variance, which is a result of independent
interest. A consequence of our analysis is the construction of sharply tuned
$\ell_1$ and trace-norm penalizations, that leads to a data-driven scaling of
the variability of information available for each users. Numerical experiments
illustrate the strong improvements achieved by the use of such data-driven
penalizations.
