To investigate the penumbral plasma flow on a small scale, spectropolari-
metric data of sunspots recorded by HINODE was used. Maps of Doppler velocities
were created by evaluating the bisector in the line-wing, thereby visualizing
the flow pattern in the low photosphere where the Evershed effect is most
pronounced. In penumbrae close to the disk center, the vertical component of
the Evershed flow dominates. The latter consists of a series of elongated
up-flow patterns extending radially through the entire center-side penumbra at
a constant azimuth. Along this structure, strong up-flows appear in
concentrated patches separated by weaker up-flows or even down-flows. The
strong up-flows appear at the bright heads and the umbral side of the dark-core
of the filament, while the down-flows are rather located at the penumbral side
of the filament. Projection effects lead to an overall red-shift of the limb-
side penumbra, but the described pattern of up- and down-flows is still
ascertainable.
