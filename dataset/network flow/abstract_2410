$q$-breathers are exact time-periodic solutions of extended nonlinear systems
continued from the normal modes of the corresponding linearized system. They
are localized in the space of normal modes. The existence of these solutions in
a weakly anharmonic atomic chain explained essential features of the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) paradox. We study $q$-breathers in one- two- and
three-dimensional discrete nonlinear Sch\"{o}dinger (DNLS) lattices --
theoretical playgrounds for light propagation in nonlinear optical waveguide
networks, and the dynamics of cold atoms in optical lattices. We prove the
existence of these solutions for weak nonlinearity. We find that the
localization of $q$-breathers is controlled by a single parameter which depends
on the norm density, nonlinearity strength and seed wave vector. At a critical
value of that parameter $q$-breathers delocalize via resonances, signaling a
breakdown of the normal mode picture and a transition into strong mode-mode
interaction regime. In particular this breakdown takes place at one of the
edges of the normal mode spectrum, and in a singular way also in the center of
that spectrum. A stability analysis of $q$-breathers supplements these
findings. For three-dimensional lattices, we find $q$-breather vortices, which
violate time reversal symmetry and generate a vortex ring flow of energy in
normal mode space.
