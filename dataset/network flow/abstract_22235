In this note we study the relation between F(R) and scalar tensor
Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We find that due to the broken diffeomorphism
invariance corresponding scalar tensor theory has more complicated form than in
case of the full diffeomorphism invariant F(R) theory of gravity. We also show
that in the low energy limit this theory flows to the relativistic scalar
tensor theory of gravity.
