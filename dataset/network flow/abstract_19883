Based on the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model
plus the Skyrme force parameters, initialization effect is studied in heavy-ion
collision at intermediate energies. We find that there are moderate
initialization effects in the observables of free neutron to proton ratio
(n/p), pion-/pion + ratio, as well as neutron to proton differential flow
(F^x_n-p). Effects of initialization are larger for charged pion-/pion ratios
than n/p ratios. And the effects of initialization are more evident in nuclear
reactions at lower incident beam energies. We do not see large effects of
initialization for light reaction systems or large asymmetric (neutron-richer)
reaction systems. We also see relatively large effects of initialization on the
neutron to proton differential flow at relatively lower incident beam energies
or with large impact parameters. These results may be useful for the delicate
studies of Equation of Sate (EoS) of asymmetric nuclear matter.
