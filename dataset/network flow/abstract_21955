In the paper [Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 2006, vol. 30, pp. 851-858]the
contributors treat the boundary layer flow of a micropolar fluid along a horizontal
flat plate with blowing or suction. The fluid viscosity and thermal
conductivity are assumed functions of temperature. The boundary layer equations
are transformed into ordinary ones and subsequently are solved using the
Chebyshev finite difference method. However, there are some deficiencies and
errors in this paper.
