We consider exact magnetic flows on closed orientable surfaces. We show that
for almost every energy $\kappa$ below Ma\~n\'e's critical value of the
universal covering there are always at least three distinct closed magnetic
geodesics with energy $\kappa$. If in addition the energy level is assumed to
be non-degenerate we prove existence of infinitely many closed magnetic
geodesics.
