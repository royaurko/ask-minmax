The transport of angular momentum in the outward direction is the fundamental
requirement for accretion to proceed in an accretion disc. This objective can
be achieved if the accretion flow is turbulent. Instabilities are one of the
sources for the turbulence. We study a differentially rotating compressive flow
in the presence of non vanishing radial and azimuthal magnetic field and
demonstrate the occurrence of a high growth rate instability. This instability
operates in a region where magnetic energy density exceeds the rotational
energy density.
