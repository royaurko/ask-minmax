We present results of a numerical study of the differential equation
governing the stationary states of the two-dimensional planetary atmosphere and
magnetized plasma (within the Charney Hasegawa Mima model). The most strinking
result is that the equation appears to be able to reproduce the main features
of the flow structure of a typhoon.
