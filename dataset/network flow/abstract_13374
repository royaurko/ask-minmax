The fluid dynamics video presented here outlines recent advances in the
simulation of multiphase cellular blood flow through the direct numerical
simulations of deformable red blood cells (RBCs) demonstrated through several
numerical experiments. Videos show RBC deformations in variety of numerical
simulations, relative viscosity of a suspension of RBCs in shear, and the
cell-depleted wall layer for blood Hagen--Poiseuille flow.
