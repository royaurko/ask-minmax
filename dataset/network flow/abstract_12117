In many physical applications solitons propagate on supports whose
topological properties may induce new and interesting effects. In this paper,
we investigate the propagation of solitons on chains with a topological
inhomogeneity generated by the insertion of a finite discrete network on the
chain. For networks connected by a link to a single site of the chain, we
derive a general criterion yielding the momenta for perfect reflection and
transmission of traveling solitons and we discuss solitonic motion on chains
with topological inhomogeneities.
