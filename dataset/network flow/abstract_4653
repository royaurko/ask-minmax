The renormalization group flow in a general renormalizable gauge theory with
a simple gauge group in 3+1 dimensions is analyzed. The flow of the ratios of
the Yukawa couplings and the gauge coupling is described in terms of a bounded
potential, which makes it possible to draw a number of non-trivial conclusions
concerning the asymptotic structure of the theory. A classification of possible
flow patterns is given.
