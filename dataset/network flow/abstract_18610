The direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) cellular downlink
is modeled by a constrained random spatial model involving a fixed number of
base stations placed over a finite area with a minimum separation. The analysis
is driven by a new closed-form expression for the conditional outage
probability at each mobile, where the conditioning is with respect to the
network realization. The analysis features a flexible channel model, accounting
for path loss, Nakagami fading, and shadowing. By generating many random
networks and applying a given resource allocation policy, the distribution of
the rates provided to each user is obtained. In addition to determining the
average rate, the analysis can determine the transmission capacity of the
network and can characterize fairness in terms of the fraction of users that
achieve a specified rate. The analysis is used to compare a rate-control policy
against a power-control policy and investigate the influence of the minimum
base-station separation.
