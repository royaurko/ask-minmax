We establish the averaging property for a queuing process with one server,
M(t)/GI/1. It is a new relation between the output flow rate and the input flow
rate, crucial in the study of the Poisson Hypothesis. Its implications include
the statement that the output flow always possesses more regularity than the
input flow.
