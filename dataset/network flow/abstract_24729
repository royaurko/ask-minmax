There are many situations where vehicles may compete with each other to
maximize their respective utilities.We consider a narrow alley where two
groups, eastbound and westbound, of autonomous vehicles are heading toward each
of their destination to minimize their travel distance. However, if the two
groups approach the road simultaneously, it will be blocked. The main goal of
this paper is to investigate how wireless communications among the vehicles can
lead the solution near to Pareto optimum. In addition, we implemented such a
vehicular test-bed, composed of networked robots that have an infrared sensor,
a DC motor, and a wireless communication module: ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4).
