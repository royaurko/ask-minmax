Cellular manufacturing (CM) is an approach that includes both flexibility of
job shops and high production rate of flow lines. Although CM provides many
benefits in reducing throughput times, setup times, work-in-process inventories
but the design of CM is complex and NP complete problem. The cell formation
problem based on operation sequence (ordinal data) is rarely reported in the
literature. The objective of the present paper is to propose a visual
clustering approach for machine-part cell formation using Self Organizing Map
(SOM) algorithm an unsupervised neural network to achieve better group
technology efficiency measure of cell formation as well as measure of SOM
quality. The work also has established the criteria of choosing an optimum SOM
map size based on results of quantization error, topography error, and average
distortion measure during SOM training which have generated the best clustering
and preservation of topology. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm, we tested the several benchmark problems available in the
literature. The results show that the proposed approach not only generates the
best and accurate solution as any of the results reported, so far, in
literature but also, in some instances the results produced are even better
than the previously reported results. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach is also statistically verified.
