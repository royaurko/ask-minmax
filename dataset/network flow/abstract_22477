We prove short-time existence for the Einstein-Euler-Entropy system for
non-isentropic fluids with data in uniformly local Sobolev spaces. The cases of
compact as well as non-compact Cauchy surfaces are covered. The method employed
uses a Lagrangian description of the fluid flow which is based on techniques
developed by Friedrich, hence providing a completely different proof of earlier
results of Choquet-Bruhat and Lichnerowicz. This new proof is specially suited
for applications to self-gravitating fluid bodies.
