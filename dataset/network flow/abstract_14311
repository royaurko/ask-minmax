We present a formalism that improves the applicability of perturbative QCD in
the current region of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. The formalism
is based on all-order resummation of large logarithms arising in the
perturbative treatment of hadron multiplicities and energy flows in this
region. It is shown that the current region of semi-inclusive DIS is similar to
the region of small transverse momenta in vector boson production at hadron
colliders. We use this resummation formalism to describe transverse energy
flows and charged particle multiplicity measured at the electron-proton
collider HERA. We find good agreement between our theoretical results and
experimental data for the transverse energy flows.
