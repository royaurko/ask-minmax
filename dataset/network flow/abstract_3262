Toeplitz CAR flows are a class of E_0-semigroups including the first type III
example constructed by R. T. Powers. We show that the Toeplitz CAR flows
contain uncountably many mutually non cocycle conjugate E_0-semigroups of type
III. We also generalize the type III criterion for Toeplitz CAR flows employed
by Powers (and later refined by W. Arveson), and show that Toeplitz CAR flows
are always either of type I or type III.
