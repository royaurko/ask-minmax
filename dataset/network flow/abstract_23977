In this paper, we propose a stochastic model for a file-sharing peer-to-peer
network which resembles the popular BitTorrent system: large files are split
into chunks and a peer can download or swap from another peer only one chunk at
a time. We prove that the fluid limits of a scaled Markov model of this system
are of the coagulation form, special cases of which are well-known
epidemiological (SIR) models. In addition, Lyapunov stability and settling-time
results are explored. We derive conditions under which the BitTorrent
incentives under consideration result in shorter mean file-acquisition times
for peers compared to client-server (single chunk) systems. Finally, a
diffusion approximation is given and some open questions are discussed.
