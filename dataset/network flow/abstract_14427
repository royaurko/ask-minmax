Starting with a reminder of what is strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma
(sQGP), we proceed to recent advances in jet quenching and heavy quark
diffusion, with a brief summary of various results based on AdS/CFT
correspondence. The conical flow is a hydrodynamical phenomenon created by
energy and entropy deposited by high energy jets propagating in matter, similar
in nature to well known sonic boom from the supersonic planes. After a brief
review, we discuss excitations of two hydro modes -- sound and ``diffuson'' --
which can be excited in this way. We also study expanding matter case, with a
variable sped of sound, and use adiabatic invariants to show that the parameter
$v/T$ ($v$ velocity in the wave, $T$ temperature) is increasing, up to a factor
3, during expansion. At the end we discuss recent results of the Princeton
group which derived conical flow from AdS/CFT.
