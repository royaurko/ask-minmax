We study the temporal evolution of a black-hole laser configuration
displaying a pair of black and white hole horizons in a flowing atomic
condensate. This configuration is initially prepared starting from a
homogeneous flow via a suitable space-dependent change of the interaction
constant. The evolution is numerically followed to long times: depending on the
parameters, the system typically either converges to the lowest energy solution
by evaporating away the horizons or displays a continuous and periodic coherent
emission of solitons. Movies of the temporal evolution of the spatial density
profile in the most significant cases are attached as Supplemental Material. By
making a physical comparison with optical laser devices, we identify the latter
regime of continuous emission of solitons as the proper black-hole laser
effect.
