To provide the Cytoscape users the possibility of integrating ITM Probe into
their workflows, we developed CytoITMprobe, a new Cytoscape plugin.
CytoITMprobe maintains all the desirable features of ITM Probe and adds
additional flexibility not achievable through its web service version. It
provides access to ITM Probe either through a web server or locally. The input,
consisting of a Cytoscape network, together with the desired origins and/or
destinations of information and a dissipation coefficient, is specified through
a query form. The results are shown as a subnetwork of significant nodes and
several summary tables. Users can control the composition and appearance of the
subnetwork and interchange their ITM Probe results with other software tools
through tab-delimited files.
  The main strength of CytoITMprobe is its flexibility. It allows the user to
specify as input any Cytoscape network, rather than being restricted to the
pre-compiled protein-protein interaction networks available through the ITM
Probe web service. Users may supply their own edge weights and
directionalities. Consequently, as opposed to ITM Probe web service,
CytoITMprobe can be applied to many other domains of network-based research
beyond protein-networks. It also enables seamless integration of ITM Probe
results with other Cytoscape plugins having complementary functionality for
data analysis.
