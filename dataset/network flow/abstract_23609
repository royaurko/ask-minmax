Sensor networks in which energy is a limited resource so that energy
consumption must be minimized for the intended application are considered. In
this context, an energy-efficient method for the joint estimation of an unknown
analog source under a given distortion constraint is proposed. The approach is
purely analog, in which each sensor simply amplifies and forwards the
noise-corrupted analog bservation to the fusion center for joint estimation.
The total transmission power across all the sensor nodes is minimized while
satisfying a distortion requirement on the joint estimate. The energy
efficiency of this analog approach is compared with previously proposed digital
approaches with and without coding. It is shown in our simulation that the
analog approach is more energy-efficient than the digital system without
coding, and in some cases outperforms the digital system with optimal coding.
