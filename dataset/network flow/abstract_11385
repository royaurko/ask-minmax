Link failures in wide area networks are common. To recover from such
failures, a number of methods such as SONET rings, protection cycles, and
source rerouting have been investigated. Two important considerations in such
approaches are the recovery time and the needed spare capacity to complete the
recovery. Usually, these techniques attempt to achieve a recovery time less
than 50 ms. In this paper we introduce an approach that provides link failure
recovery in a hitless manner, or without any appreciable delay. This is
achieved by means of a method called diversity coding. We present an algorithm
for the design of an overlay network to achieve recovery from single link
failures in arbitrary networks via diversity coding. This algorithm is designed
to minimize spare capacity for recovery. We compare the recovery time and spare
capacity performance of this algorithm against conventional techniques in terms
of recovery time, spare capacity, and a joint metric called Quality of Recovery
(QoR). QoR incorporates both the spare capacity percentages and worst case
recovery times. Based on these results, we conclude that the proposed technique
provides much shorter recovery times while achieving similar extra capacity, or
better QoR performance overall.
