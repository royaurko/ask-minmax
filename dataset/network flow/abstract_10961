We study Strauss's model of a network with clustering and present an analytic
mean-field solution which is exact in the limit of large network size. Previous
computer simulations have revealed a degenerate region in the model's parameter
space in which triangles of adjacent edges clump together to form
unrealistically dense subgraphs, and perturbation calculations have been found
to break down in this region at all orders. Our analytic solution shows that
this region corresponds to a classic symmetry-broken phase and that the onset
of the degeneracy corresponds to a first-order phase transition in the density
of the network.
