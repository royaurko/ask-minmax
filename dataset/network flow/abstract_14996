In this paper we introduce a new model of data packet transport, based on a
stochastic approach with the aim of characterizing the load distribution on
complex networks. Moreover we analyze the load standard deviation as an index
of uniformity of the distribution of packets within the network, to
characterize the effects of the network topology. We measure such index on the
model proposed by Watts and Strogatz as the redirection probability is
increased. We find that the uniformity of the load spread is maximized in the
intermediate region, at which the small world effect is observed and both
global and local efficiency are high. Moreover we analyze the relationship
between load centrality and degree centrality as an approximate measure of the
load at the edges. Analogous results are obtained for the load variance
computed at the edges as well as at the vertices.
