We develop an online gradient algorithm for optimizing the performance of
product-form networks through online adjustment of control parameters. The use
of standard algorithms for finding optimal parameter settings is hampered by
the prohibitive computational burden of calculating the gradient in terms of
the stationary probabilities. The proposed approach instead relies on measuring
empirical frequencies of the various states through simulation or online
operation so as to obtain estimates for the gradient. Besides the reduction in
computational effort, a further benefit of the online operation lies in the
natural adaptation to slow variations in ambient parameters as commonly
occurring in dynamic environments. On the downside, the measurements result in
inherently noisy and biased estimates. We exploit mixing time results in order
to overcome the impact of the bias and establish sufficient conditions for
convergence to a globally optimal solution.
