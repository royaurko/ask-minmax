We obtain first order equations that determine a supersymmetric kink solution
in five-dimensional N=8 gauged supergravity. The kink interpolates between an
exterior anti-de Sitter region with maximal supersymmetry and an interior
anti-de Sitter region with one quarter of the maximal supersymmetry. One eighth
of supersymmetry is preserved by the kink as a whole. We interpret it as
describing the renormalization group flow in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory broken
to an N=1 theory by the addition of a mass term for one of the three adjoint
chiral superfields. A detailed correspondence is obtained between fields of
bulk supergravity in the interior anti-de Sitter region and composite operators
of the infrared field theory. We also point out that the truncation used to
find the reduced symmetry critical point can be extended to obtain a new N=4
gauged supergravity theory holographically dual to a sector of N=2 gauge
theories based on quiver diagrams.
  We consider more general kink geometries and construct a c-function that is
positive and monotonic if a weak energy condition holds in the bulk gravity
theory. For even-dimensional boundaries, the c-function coincides with the
trace anomaly coefficients of the holographically related field theory in
limits where conformal invariance is recovered.
