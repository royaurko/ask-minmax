The positive definite symmetric polymer conformation tensor possesses a
unique symmetric square root that satisfies a closed evolution equation in the
Oldroyd-B and FENE-P models of viscoelastic fluid flow. When expressed in terms
of the velocity field and the symmetric square root of the conformation tensor,
these models' equations of motion formally constitute an evolution in a Hilbert
space with a total energy functional that defines a norm. Moreover, this
formulation is easily implemented in direct numerical simulations resulting in
significant practical advantages in terms of both accuracy and stability.
