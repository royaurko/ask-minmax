Significant progress has been made in the development of an international
network of gravitational wave detectors, such as TAMA300, LIGO, VIRGO, and
GEO600. For these detectors, one of the most promising sources of gravitational
waves are core collapse supernovae especially in our Galaxy. Recent simulations
of core collapse supernovae, rigorously carried out by various groups, show
that the features of the waveforms are determined by the rotational profiles of
the core, such as the rotation rate and the degree of the differential rotation
prior to core-collapse. Specifically, it has been predicted that the sign of
the second largest peak in the gravitational wave strain signal is negative if
the core rotates cylindrically with strong differential rotation. The sign of
the second peak could be a nice indicator that provides us with information
about the angular momentum distribution of the core, unseen without
gravitational wave signals. Here we present a data analysis procedure aiming at
the detection of the second peak using a coherent network analysis and estimate
the detection efficiency when a supernova is at the sky location of the
Galactic center. The simulations showed we were able to determine the sign of
the second peak under an idealized condition of a network of gravitational wave
detectors if a supernova occurs at the Galactic center.
