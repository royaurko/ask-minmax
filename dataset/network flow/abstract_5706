The power of any kind of network approach lies in the ability to simplify a
complex system so that one can better understand its function as a whole.
Sometimes it is beneficial, however, to include more information than in a
simple graph of only nodes and links. Adding information about times of
interactions can make predictions and mechanistic understanding more accurate.
The drawback, however, is that there are not so many methods available, partly
because temporal networks is a relatively young field, partly because it more
difficult to develop such methods compared to for static networks. In this
colloquium, we review the methods to analyze and model temporal networks and
processes taking place on them, focusing mainly on the last three years. This
includes the spreading of infectious disease, opinions, rumors, in social
networks; information packets in computer networks; various types of signaling
in biology, and more. We also discuss future directions.
