Formation of a layered structure is studied in a globally coupled map of
chaotic units with a plastic coupling strength that changes depending on the
states of units globally and an external input. In the parameter region
characterized by weakly chaotic and desynchronized dynamics, units
spontaneously form a hierarchical structure due to the influence of the input,
with regards to the coupling strength. This hierarchical structure is not fixed
in time, and is successively reorganized. It is found that the distribution of
lifetimes of the structure obeys a power law. The possible relevance of the
present result to information processing in the brain is briefly discussed.
