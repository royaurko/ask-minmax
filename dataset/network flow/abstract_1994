We investigate the effect of interstitial liquid on the physical properties
of granular media by measuring the angle of repose as a function of the liquid
content. The resultant adhesive forces lead to three distinct regimes in the
observed behavior as the liquid content is increased: a granular regime in
which the grains move individually, a correlated regime in which the grains
move in correlated clusters, and a plastic regime in which the grains flow
coherently. We discuss these regimes in terms of two proposed theories
describing the effects of liquid on the physical properties of granular media.
