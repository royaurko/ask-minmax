In this paper, three new dynamic multicast routing algorithms based on the
greedy tree technique are proposed; Source Optimised Tree, Topology Based Tree
and Minimum Diameter Tree. A simulation analysis is presented showing various
performance aspects of the algorithms, in which a comparison is made with the
greedy and core based tree techniques. The effects of the tree source location
on dynamic membership change are also examined. The simulations demonstrate
that the Source Optimised Tree algorithm achieves a significant improvement in
terms of delay and link usage when compared to the Core Based Tree, and greedy
algorithm.
