We give an simple criterion for ODE equivalence in identical edge homogeneous
coupled cell networks. This allows us to give a simple proof of Theorem 10.3 of
Aquiar and Dias "Minimal Coupled Cell Networks", which characterizes minimal
identical edge homogeneous coupled cell networks. Using our criterion we give a
formula for counting homogeneous coupled cell networks up to ODE equivalence.
Our criterion is purely graph theoretic and makes no explicit use of linear
algebra.
