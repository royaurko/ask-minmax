We present predictions for the pseudorapidity dependence of the azimuthal
anisotropy parameters v_1 and v_2 of baryons and inclusive charged hadrons in
Pb+Pb collisions at a LHC energy of sqrt(s) = 5.5 TeV applying a microscopic
transport model, namely the quark gluon string model (QGSM) which has been
recently extended for parton rearrangement and fusion processes. Pb+Pb
collisions with impact parameters b = 2.3 fm and b = 8 fm have been simulated
in order to investigate additionally the difference between central and
semiperipheral configurations. In contrast to v_1(eta) at RHIC, the directed
flow of charged hadrons shows a small normal flow alignment. The elliptic flow
v_2(eta) turns out to be rather similar in shape for RHIC and LHC conditions,
the magnitude however increases about 10-20 % at the LHC, leading to the
conclusion that the hydrodynamical limit will be reached.
