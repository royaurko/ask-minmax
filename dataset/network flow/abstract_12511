Large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks promise high energy
efficiency, i.e., much less power is required to achieve the same capacity
compared to the conventional MIMO networks if perfect channel state information
(CSI) is available at the transmitter. However, in such networks, huge overhead
is required to obtain full CSI especially for Frequency-Division Duplex (FDD)
systems. To reduce overhead, we propose a downlink antenna selection scheme,
which selects S antennas from M>S transmit antennas based on the large scale
fading to serve K\leq S users in large distributed MIMO networks employing
regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. In particular, we study the joint
optimization of antenna selection, regularization factor, and power allocation
to maximize the average weighted sum-rate. This is a mixed combinatorial and
non-convex problem whose objective and constraints have no closed-form
expressions. We apply random matrix theory to derive asymptotically accurate
expressions for the objective and constraints. As such, the joint optimization
problem is decomposed into subproblems, each of which is solved by an efficient
algorithm. In addition, we derive structural solutions for some special cases
and show that the capacity of very large distributed MIMO networks scales as
O\left(K\textrm{log}M\right) when M\rightarrow\infty with K,S fixed.
Simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gain
over various baselines.
