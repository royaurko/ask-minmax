A simple model is proposed to simulate the evolution of interpersonal
relationships in a class. The small social network is simply assumed as an
undirected and weighted graph, in which students are represented by vertices,
and the extent of favor or disfavor between two of them are denoted by the
weight of corresponding edge. Various weight distributions have been found by
choosing different initial configurations. Analysis and experimental results
reveal that the effect of first impressions has a crucial influence on the
final weight distribution. The system also exhibits a phase transition in the
final hostility (negative weights) proportion depending on the initial amity
(positive weights) proportion.
