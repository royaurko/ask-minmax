We present a fresh and general yet simple approach towards information
retrieval in general and diagnostics in particular by applying the theory of
complex networks on multidimensional images. We demonstrate a successful use of
our method with the time series generated from high content thermal imaging
videos of patients suffering from aqueous deficient dry eye (ADDE) disease. The
approach is scalable to a device where fluctuation derived network parameters
serve as diagnostic markers. Remarkably, network analysis of thermal imaging
time series of contact lens users and patients upon whom Laser-Assisted in situ
Keratomileusis (Lasik) surgery has been conducted, exhibits pronounced
similarities with results obtained from ADDE patients. We also propose a
general framework for transformation of multidimensional images to networks for
futuristic biometry.
