This contribution is relative to the opening lectures of the ISSAOS 2001
summer school and it has the aim to provide the reader with some concepts and
techniques concerning chaotic dynamics and transport processes in fluids. Our
intention is twofold: to give a self-consistent introduction to chaos and
diffusion, and to offer a guide for the reading of the rest of this volume.
