Using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with the complex relaxation
time and the Maxwell equation, we systematically examine transverse motion of
vortex dynamics in the presence of pinning disorders. Consequently, in a
plastic flow phase in which moving and pinned vortices coexist, we find that
the Hall voltage generally changes its sign. The origin of the sign change is
ascribed to a fact that moving vortices are strongly drifted by circular
current of pinned vortices and the enforced transverse moving direction becomes
opposite to that by transport current. This suggests that the Hall sign change
is a behavior common in all disordered type-II superconductors.
