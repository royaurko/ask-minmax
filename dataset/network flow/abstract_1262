This paper introduces a protocol that distributively constructs a
collision-free schedule for multi-hop packet radio networks in the presence of
hidden terminals. As a preliminary step, each wireless station computes the
schedule length after gathering information about the number of flows in its
neighbourhood. Then, a combination of deterministic and random backoffs are
used to reach a collision-free schedule. A deterministic backoff is used after
successful transmissions and a random backoff is used otherwise. It is
explained that the short acknowledgement control packets can easily result in
channel time fragmentation and, to avoid this, the use of link layer delayed
acknowledgements is advocated and implemented. The performance results show
that a collision-free protocol easily outperforms a collision-prone protocol
such as Aloha. The time that is required for the network to converge to a
collision-free schedule is assessed by means of simulation.
