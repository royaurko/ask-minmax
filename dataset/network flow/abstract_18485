This paper has been withdrawn by the contributors. Mobility profile building
became extensively examined area in Location based services (LBS) through
extraction of significant locations. Mobility traces are recorded under three
reference positioning systems that are Satellite based i.e. GPS, Network based
i.e. GSM and Local positioning i.e. WLAN, RFID, IrDA. Satellite based and local
positioning due to of high power consumption, additional resource installation,
low accuracy and space limitation are less encouraging. So network based
positioning i.e. GSM is only viable solution for mobility tracing through Cell
global identity (CGI). CGI presents the Cell-ids to extract the significant
locations from mobility history. However CGI faces cell oscillation problem,
where user is assigned multiple Cell-Ids even at a stationary state for load
balancing and GSM cells overlapping. In this paper we proposed two
semi-supervised methodology for cell oscillation resolution i.e. semantic
tagging and overlapped area clustering, the proposed methodologies are equally
useful for the identification of significant places too.
