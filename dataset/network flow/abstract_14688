The topological and dynamical features of small scales are studied in the
context of decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulent flows using direct numerical
simulations. Joint probability density functions (PDFs) of the invariants of
gradient quantities related to the velocity and the magnetic fields demonstrate
that structures and dynamics at the time of maximum dissipation depend on the
large scale initial conditions. This is evident in particular from the fact
that each flow has a different shape for the joint PDF of the invariants of the
velocity gradient in contrast to the universal teardrop shape of hydrodynamic
turbulence. The general picture that emerges from the analysis of the
invariants is that regions of high vorticity are correlated with regions of
high strain rate $\bm S$ also in contrast to hydrodynamic turbulent flows.
Magnetic strain dominated regions are also well correlated with region of high
current density $\bm j$. Viscous dissipation ($\propto \bm S^2$) as well as
Ohmic dissipation ($\propto \bm j^2$) reside in regions where strain and
rotation are locally almost in balance. The structures related to the velocity
gradient possess different characteristics than those associated with the
magnetic field gradient with the latter being locally more quasi-two
dimensional.
