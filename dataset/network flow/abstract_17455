Selected results from the STAR collaboration are presented. We focus on
recent results on jet-like correlations, nuclear modification factors of
identified hadrons, elliptic flow of multi-strange baryons $\Xi$ and $\Omega$,
and resonance yields. First measurements of open charm production at RHIC are
presented.
