Contrary to the structural aspect of conventional social network analysis, a
new method in behavioral analysis is proposed. We define behavioral measures

with the networks of Wikipedia editing. Behavioral social network analysis
provides an explanation of human behavior that may be further extended to the
explanation of culture through social phenomena.
