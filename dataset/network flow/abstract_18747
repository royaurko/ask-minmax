Service) over GSM network. Usually SMS contents are text based and limited to
140 bytes. It supports national and international roaming, but also supported
by other telecommunication such as TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA
(Code Division Multiple Access) as well. It can sent/ receive simultaneously
with other services. Such features make it favorable for this methodology. For
this an application is developed using J2ME platform which is supported by all
mobile phones in the world. This algorithm's test is conducted on N95 having
Symbian Operating System (OS).
