This paper studies the performance of partial-Rake (PRake) receivers in
impulse-radio ultrawideband wireless networks when an energy-efficient power
control scheme is adopted. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the
multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By making use of
noncooperative game-theoretic models and large-system analysis tools, explicit
expressions are derived in terms of network parameters to measure the effects
of self-interference and multiple-access interference at a receiving access
point. Performance of the PRake receivers is thus compared in terms of achieved
utilities and loss to that of the all-Rake receiver. Simulation results are
provided to validate the analysis.
