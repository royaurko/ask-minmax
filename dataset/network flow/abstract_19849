Experiments were performed to study the effects of surface wettability on
flow boiling of water at atmospheric pressure. The test channel is a single
rectangular channel 0.5 mm high, 5 mm wide and 180 mm long. The mass flux was
set at 100 kg/m2 s and the base heat flux varied from 30 to 80 kW/m2. Water
enters the test channel under subcooled conditions. The samples are silicone
oxide (SiOx), titanium (Ti), diamond-like carbon (DLC) and carbon-doped silicon
oxide (SiOC) surfaces with static contact angles of 26{\deg}, 49{\deg},
63{\deg} and 103{\deg}, respectively. The results show significant impacts of
surface wettability on heat transfer coefficient.
