Solid-On-Solid (SOS) computer simulations are employed to investigate the
sublimation of surfaces. We distinguish three sublimation regimes:
layer-by-layer sublimation, free step flow and hindered step flow. The
sublimation regime is selected by the morphology i.e. the terrace width. To
each regime corresponds another effective energy. We propose a systematic way
to derive microscopic parameters from effective energies and apply this
microscopical analysis to the layer-by-layer and the free step flow regime. We
adopt analytical calculations from Pimpinelli and Villain and apply them to our
model. Key-Words: Computer simulations; Models of surface kinetics; Evaporation
