The problem of maximum rate achievable with analog network coding for a
unicast communication over a layered relay network with directed links is
considered. A relay node performing analog network coding scales and forwards
the signals received at its input. Recently this problem has been considered
under certain assumptions on per node scaling factor and received SNR.
Previously, we established a result that allows us to characterize the optimal
performance of analog network coding in network scenarios beyond those that can
be analyzed using the approaches based on such assumptions.
  The key contribution of this work is a scheme to greedily compute a lower
bound to the optimal rate achievable with analog network coding in the general
layered networks. This scheme allows for exact computation of the optimal
achievable rates in a wider class of layered networks than those that can be
addressed using existing approaches. For the specific case of Gaussian N-relay
diamond network, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme provides the
first exact characterization of the optimal rate achievable with analog network
coding. Further, for general layered networks, our scheme allows us to compute
optimal rates within a constant gap from the cut-set upper bound asymptotically
in the source power.
