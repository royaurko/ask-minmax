Bayesian networks (BNs) are widely used graphical models usable to draw
statistical inference about network structures. We present here Graph_sampler a
fast free C language software for structural inference on BNs. Graph_sampler
uses a fully Bayesian approach in which the marginal likelihood of the data
(the data prior predictive distribution) and prior information about the
network structure are considered. Inference on continuously valued BNs is
treated as a Gaussian regression problem where the regressands are children
nodes and the regressors their parents. Normal-gamma or Zellner likelihoods can
then be used. For the discrete case a Dirichlet-multinomial model is available.
A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with fast jump kernel is used to sample graphs
from their joint posterior distribution. The source C code distributed is very
compact, fast, uses low memory and disk storage. We also reviewed the key
features and working environment of other available software. As an
illustration we compared the performance of our code to that of Structmcmc, a R
package, using simulated data sets for graphs of 5 to 120 nodes. Our results
show that Graph_sampler is time efficient in identifying the underlying network
and is time efficient. Several problems that arise when using Zellner priors
are discussed. The relative weights of prior and likelihood are also discussed.
