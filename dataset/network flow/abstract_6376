Position-based routing protocols take advantage of location information to
perform a stateless and efficient routing. To enable position-based routing, a
node must be able to discover the location of the messages' destination node.
This task is typically accomplished by a location service. Recently, several
location service protocols have been developed for ad hoc networks. In this
paper we propose a novel location service called PHLS: Predictive Hierarchical
Location Service. In PHLS, the entire network is partitioned into a hierarchy
of smaller and smaller regions. For each node, one node in each-level region of
the hierarchy is chosen as its local location server. When the network
initializes or when a node attaches the network, nodes contact their local
location server with their current location information (ie. position and
velocity). Then, they only need to update their location server when they move
away from their current region. Finally, nodes query their location servers and
get the exact or predicted location of destination nodes.
