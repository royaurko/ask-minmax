D 49, 4214 (1994)] to the formulation of useful many-body theories of electron
correlation are considered. In addition to presenting a production-level
implementation of the SRG based on a single-reference formalism, a novel
integral version of the SRG is reported, in which the flow of the Hamiltonian
is driven by a source operator. It is shown that this driven SRG (DSRG)
produces a Hamiltonian flow that is analogous to that of the SRG. Compared to
the SRG, which requires propagating a set of ordinary differential equations,
the DSRG is computationally advantageous since it consists of a set of
polynomial equations. The equilibrium distances, harmonic vibrational
frequencies, and vibrational anharmonicities of a series of diatomic molecules
computed with the SRG and DSRG approximated with one- and two-body normal
ordered operators are in good agreement with benchmark values from coupled
cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)]. Particularly
surprising results are found when the SRG and DSRG methods are applied to C$_2$
and F$_2$. In the former case both methods fail to converge, while in the
latter case an unbound potential energy curve is obtained. A modified
commutator approximation is shown to correct these problems in the case of the
DSRG method.
