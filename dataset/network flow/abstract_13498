A parallel implementation of the Balancing Domain Decomposition by
Constraints (BDDC) method is described. It is based on formulation of BDDC with
global matrices without explicit coarse problem. The implementation is based on
the MUMPS parallel solver for computing the approximate inverse used for
preconditioning. It is successfully applied to several problems of Stokes flow
discretized by Taylor-Hood finite elements and BDDC is shown to be a promising
method also for this class of problems.
