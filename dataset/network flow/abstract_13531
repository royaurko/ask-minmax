We prove pinching estimates for solutions of the linearized Ricci flow system
on a closed manifold of dimension $n\geq 4$ with positive scalar curvature and
vanishing Weyl tensor. If the vanishing Weyl tensor condition is removed, we
only give a rough pinching estimate controlled by some blow-up function. These
results generalize the 3-dimensional case due to G. Anderson and B. Chow (Calc.
Var., 23 (2005), 1-12).
