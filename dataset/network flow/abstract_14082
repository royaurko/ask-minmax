We report on a scale determination with gradient-flow techniques on the
$N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration. The ensembles
include four lattice spacings, ranging from approximately 0.15 to 0.06 fm, and
both physical and unphysical values of the quark masses. The scales
$\sqrt{t_0}/a$ and $w_0/a$ and their tree-level improvements, $\sqrt{t_{0,{\rm
imp}}}$ and $w_{0,{\rm imp}}$, are computed on each ensemble using Symanzik
flow and the cloverleaf definition of the energy density $E$. Using a
combination of continuum chiral perturbation theory and a Taylor-series ansatz
for the lattice-spacing and strong-coupling dependence, the results are
simultaneously extrapolated to the continuum and interpolated to physical quark
masses. We determine the scales $\sqrt{t_0} = 0.1416({}_{-5}^{+8})$ fm and $w_0
= 0.1717({}_{-11}^{+12})$ fm, where the errors are sums, in quadrature, of
statistical and all systematic errors. The precision of $w_0$ and $\sqrt{t_0}$
is comparable to or more precise than the best previous estimates,
respectively. We also find the continuum mass-dependence of $w_0$ that will be
useful for estimating the scales of other ensembles. We also estimate the
integrated autocorrelation length of $\langle E(t) \rangle$. For long flow
times, the autocorrelation length of $\langle E \rangle$ appears to be
comparable to or smaller than that of the topological charge.
