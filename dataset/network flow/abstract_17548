In this article, we extend the theory of multiplicative chaos for positive
definite functions in Rd of the form f(x) = 2 ln+ T|x|+ g(x) where g is a
continuous and bounded function. The construction is simpler and more general
than the one defined by Kahane in 1985. As main application, we give a rigorous
mathematical meaning to the Kolmogorov-Obukhov model of energy dissipation in a
turbulent flow.
