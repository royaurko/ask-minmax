Numerical simulation of rotating convection in plane layers with free slip
boundaries show that the convective flows can be classified according to a
quantity constructed from the Reynolds, Prandtl and Ekman numbers. Three
different flow regimes appear: Laminar flow close to the onset of convection,
turbulent flow in which the heat flow approaches the heat flow of non-rotating
convection, and an intermediate regime in which the heat flow scales according
to a power law independent of thermal diffusivity and kinematic viscosity.
