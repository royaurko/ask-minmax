Equilibrium statistics of finite Hamiltonian systems is fundamentally
described by the microcanonical ensemble (ME). Canonical, or grand-canonical
partition functions are deduced from this by Laplace transform. Only in the
thermodynamic limit are they equivalent to ME for homogeneous systems.
Therefore ME is the only ensemble for non-extensive/inhomogeneous systems like
nuclei or stars where the $\lim_{N\to \infty,\rho=N/V=const}$ does not exist.
Conventional canonical thermo-statistic is inapplicable for non-extensive
systems. This has far reaching fundamental and quite counter-intuitive
consequences for thermo-statistics in general: Phase transitions of first order
are signaled by convexities of $S(E,N,Z,...)$ \cite{gross174}. Here the heat
capacity is {\em negative}. In these cases heat can flow from cold to hot! The
original task of thermodynamics, the description of boiling water in heat
engines can now be treated. Consequences of this basic peculiarity for nuclear
statistics as well for the fundamental understanding of Statistical Mechanics
in general are discussed. Experiments on hot nuclei show all these novel
phenomena in a rich variety. The close similarity to inhomogeneous astro
physical systems will be pointed out. \keyword{Microcanonical statistics, first
