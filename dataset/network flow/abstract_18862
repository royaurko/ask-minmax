IEEE 802.15.4 is regarded as one of the most suitable communication protocols
for cyber-physical applications of wireless sensor and actuator networks. This
is because this protocol is able to achieve low-power and low-cost transmission
in wireless personal area networks. But most cyber-physical systems (CPSs)
require a degree of real-time and reliability from the underlying communication
protocol. Some of them are stricter than the others. However, IEEE 802.15.4
protocol cannot provide reliability and real-time transmission for
time-critical and delay-sensitive data in cyber-physical applications. To solve
this problem, we propose a new MAC protocol, i.e. the Ada-MAC protocol, which
is based on IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled mode. It can support cyber-physical
applications such as health monitoring, which require stringent real- time and
reliability guarantees. We implement the proposed protocol on the OMNET++
platform and conduct a performance evaluation of the proposed protocol with
comparison against the traditional IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. The results are
presented and analyzed.
