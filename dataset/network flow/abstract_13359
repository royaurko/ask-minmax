We present the first time-resolved measurements of the oscillatory velocity
field induced by swimming unicellular microorganisms. Confinement of the green
alga C. reinhardtii in stabilized thin liquid films allows simultaneous
tracking of cells and tracer particles. The measured velocity field reveals
complex time-dependent flow structures, and scales inversely with distance. The
instantaneous mechanical power generated by the cells is measured from the
velocity fields and peaks at 15 fW. The dissipation per cycle is more than four
times what steady swimming would require.
