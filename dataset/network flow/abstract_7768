Large deviation rates are obtained for suspension flows over symbolic
dynamical systems with a countable alphabet. The method is that of the first
contributor and follows that of L.-S. Young. A corollary of the main results is a
large deviation bound for the Teichm\"uller flow on the moduli space of abelian
differentials, which extends earlier work of J. Athreya.
