Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) plays an important role in knowing insight of
cellular life cycle. It gives information about at which different
environmental conditions genes of particular interest get over expressed or
under expressed. Modelling of GRN is nothing but finding interactive
relationships between genes. Interaction can be positive or negative. For
inference of GRN, time series data provided by Microarray technology is used.
Key factors to be considered while constructing GRN are scalability,
robustness, reliability and maximum detection of true positive interactions
between genes. This paper gives detailed technical review of existing methods
applied for building of GRN along with scope for future work.
