Most elliptical galaxies contain central black holes (BHs), and most also
contain significant amounts of hot gas capable of accreting on to the central
BH due to cooling times short compared to the Hubble time. Why therefore do we
not see AGNs at the center of most elliptical galaxies rather than in only (at
most) a few per cent of them? We propose here the simple idea that feedback
from accretion events heats the ambient gas retarding subsequent infall. In
this context, we present a class of 1D hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences
for the gas flows in elliptical galaxies with a massive central BH. The
resulting evolution is characterized by strong oscillations, in which very fast
and energetic bursts of the BH are followed by longer periods in which the
X-ray galaxy emission comes from the coronal gas. We also allow for departures
from spherical symmetry by examining scenarios in which the central engine is
either an ADAF or a more conventional accretion disk that is optically thick
except for a polar region. In all cases the duty cycle (fraction of the time
that the system will be seen as an AGN) is quite small and in the range 10^{-4}
- 10^{-3}. Thus, for any reasonable value of the efficiency, the presence of a
massive BH at the center of a galaxy seems to be incompatible with the presence
of a long-lived cooling flow.
