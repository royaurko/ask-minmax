We extend the concept of optical flow to a dynamic non-Euclidean setting.
Optical flow is traditionally computed from a sequence of flat images. It is
the purpose of this paper to introduce variational motion estimation for images
that are defined on an evolving surface. Volumetric microscopy images depicting
a live zebrafish embryo serve as both biological motivation and test data.
