This study considers an orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access
(OFDMA)-based multi-user two-way relay network where multiple mobile stations
(MSs) communicate with a common base station (BS) via multiple relay stations
(RSs). We study the joint optimization problem of subcarrier-pairing based
relay-power allocation, relay selection, and subcarrier assignment. The problem
is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. By using the dual method,
we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem in an asymptotically
optimal manner. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve
system performance significantly over the conventional methods.
