It has been discovered recently that many social, biological and ecological
systems have the so-called small-world and scale-free features, which has
provoked new research interest in the studies of various complex networks. Yet,
most network models studied thus far are binary, with the linking strengths
being either 0 or 1, while which are best described by weighted-linking
networks, in which the vertices interact with each other with varying
strengths. Here we found that the distribution of connection strengths of
scientific collaboration networks decays also in a power-law form and we
conjecture that all weighted-linking networks of this type follow the same
distribution.
