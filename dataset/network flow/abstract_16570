We study the spectra and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of scale-free
networks when bi-directional interaction is allowed, so that the adjacency
matrix is real and symmetric. The spectral density shows an exponential decay
around the center, followed by power-law long tails at both spectrum edges. The
largest eigenvalue \lambda_1 depends on system size N as \lambda_1 \sim N^{1/4}
for large N, and the corresponding eigenfunction is strongly localized at the
hub, the vertex with largest degree. The component of the normalized
eigenfunction at the hub is of order unity. We also find that the mass gap
scales as N^{-0.68}.
