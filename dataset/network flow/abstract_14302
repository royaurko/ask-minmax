The nonlinear rheological response of soft glassy materials is addressed
experimentally by focusing on concentrated emulsions where interdroplet
attraction is tuned through varying the surfactant content. Velocity profiles
are recorded using ultrasonic velocimetry simultaneously to global rheological
data in the Couette geometry. Our data show that non-adhesive and adhesive
emulsions have radically different flow behaviors in the vicinity of yielding:
while the flow remains homogeneous in the non-adhesive emulsion and the
Herschel-Bulkley model for a yield stress fluid describes the data very
accurately, the adhesive system displays shear localization and does not follow
a simple constitutive equation, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in
yielding transitions are not universal.
