We have proposed two new dynamic networks where two node are swapped each
other, and showed that the both networks behave as a small world like in the
average path length but can not make any effective discussions on the
clustering coefficient because of the topological invariant properties of the
networks. In this article we introduce a new index, "hamming coefficient" or
"multiplicity", that can act well for these dynamic networks. The hamming
coefficient or multiplicity is shown essentially to behave as the clustering
coefficient in the small world network proposed by Watts and
Strogatz\cite{Watt1}. By evaluating the new index, we uncover another
properties of the two networks.
