We consider the closed orbit structure of generic gradient flows of Morse
closed 1-forms. The torsion of a chain homotopy equivalence between the Novikov
complex and the completed simplicial chain complex of the universal cover
detects the eta function of the flow. We extend this result to arbitrary Morse
closed 1-forms. The case of rational forms was considered by A. Pajitnov.
