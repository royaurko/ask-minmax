We consider regular open curves in R^n with fixed boundary points and moving
according to the L^{2}-gradient flow for a generalisation of the Helfrich
functional. Natural boundary conditions are imposed along the evolution. More
precisely, at the boundary the curvature vector is equal to the normal
projection of a fixed given vector. A long-time existence result together with
subconvergence to critical points is proven.
