We study high-density traffic of information packets on sparse modular
networks with scale-free subgraphs. With different statistical measures we
distinguish between the free flow and congested regime and point out the role
of modules in the jamming transition. We further consider correlations between
traffic signals collected at each node in the network. The correlation matrix
between pairs of signals reflects the network modularity in the eigenvalue
spectrum and the structure of eigenvectors. The internal structure of the
modules has an important role in the diffusion dynamics, leading to enhanced
correlations between the modular hubs, which can not be filtered out by
standard methods. Implications for the analysis of real networks with unknown
modular structure are discussed.
