We propose a phenomenological model for the multi-lamellar vesicles (onions)
formation induced by shear flow. In a nonionic surfactant (C$_{12}$E$_4$)
system, onion phases under a fixed shear flow within a certain range show the
order-disorder transition accompanied with a size jump by changing temperature.
Our model can simulate ordered and disordered onion phases with different onion
sizes. We show numerical results of the onion formation simulated by the model
and also discuss what factors in this system are critical to cause the
transition between these two different onion phases.
