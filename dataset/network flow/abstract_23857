We study spatiotemporal correlations and temporal diversities of
handset-based service usages by analyzing a dataset that includes detailed
information about locations and service usages of 124 users over 16 months. By
constructing the spatiotemporal trajectories of the users we detect several
meaningful places or contexts for each one of them and show how the context
affects the service usage patterns. We find that temporal patterns of service
usages are bound to the typical weekly cycles of humans, yet they show maximal
activities at different times. We first discuss their temporal correlations and
then investigate the time-ordering behavior of communication services like
calls being followed by the non-communication services like applications. We
also find that the behavioral overlap network based on the clustering of
temporal patterns is comparable to the communication network of users. Our
approach provides a useful framework for handset-based data analysis and helps
us to understand the complexities of information and communications technology
enabled human behavior.
