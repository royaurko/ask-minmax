To examine thermoelectric (TE) properties of a semiconductor nanowire (NW)
network, we propose a theoretical approach mapping the TE network on a two-port
network. In contrast to conventional single-port (i.e., resistor) network
model, our model allows for a large scale calculations showing convergence of
TE figure of merit, $ZT$, with increasing number of junctions. Using this
model, the numerical simulations are performed for the Bi$_2$Te$_3$ branched
nanowire (BNW) and Cayley tree NW (CTNW) network. We demonstrate that the
phonon scattering at the network junctions plays dominant role in enhancing the
network $ZT$. Specifically, random BNW and CTNW demonstrate ZT enhancement
factor of $20\%-150\%$. The simulations results suggest formation of
preferential TE pathways in CTNW which effectively behave as BNW. To provide
connection with experiment, we show how the model parameters can be related to
the observables available in TE measurements.
