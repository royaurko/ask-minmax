Recent years have witnessed significant interest in convex relaxations of the
power flows, several papers showing that the second-order cone relaxation is
tight for tree networks under various conditions on loads or voltages. This
paper shows that AC-feasibility, i.e., to find whether some generator dispatch
can satisfy a given demand, is NP-Hard for tree networks.
