Cytoskeletal networks of biopolymers are cross-linked by a variety of
proteins. Experiments have shown that dynamic cross-linking with physiological
linker proteins leads to complex stress relaxation and enables network flow at
long times. We present a model for the mechanical properties of transient
networks. By a combination of simulations and analytical techniques we show
that a single microscopic timescale for cross-linker unbinding leads to a broad
spectrum of macroscopic relaxation times, resulting in a weak power-law
dependence of the shear modulus on frequency. By performing rheological
experiments, we demonstrate that our model quantitatively describes the
frequency behavior of actin network cross-linked with $\alpha$-Actinin-$4$ over
four decades in frequency.
