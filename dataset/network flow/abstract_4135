Euler-Lagrange variational principle is used to obtain analytical and
numerical flow relations in cylindrical tubes. The method is based on
minimizing the total stress in the flow duct using the fluid constitutive
relation between stress and rate of strain. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid
models; which include power law, Bingham, Herschel-Bulkley, Carreau and Cross;
are used for demonstration.
