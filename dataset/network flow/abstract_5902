The adjacency and Laplacian matrices of complex networks with two species of
nodes are studied and the spectral density is evaluated by using the replica
method in statistical physics. The network nodes are classified into two
species (A and B) and the connections are made only between the nodes of
different species. A static model of such bipartite networks with power law
degree distributions is introduced by applying Goh, Kahng and Kim's method to
construct scale free networks. As a result, the spectral density is shown to
obey a power law in the limit of large mean degree.
