Deformation due to embedded fluidic networks is currently studied in the
context of soft-actuators and soft-robotics. Expanding on this concept, beams
can be designed so that the pressure in the channel-network is created directly
from external forces acting on the beam, and thus can be viewed as passive
solid-liquid composite structure. We obtain a continuous function relating the
network geometry to the deformation. This enables design of networks creating
arbitrary steady and time varying deformation-fields as well as to eliminate
deformation created by external forces.
