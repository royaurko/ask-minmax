We investigate theoretically and numerically the effect of polymer additives
on two-dimensional turbulence by means of a viscoelastic model. We provide
compelling evidence that at vanishingly small concentrations, such that the
polymers are passively transported, the probability distribution of polymer
elongation has a power law tail: its slope is related to the statistics of
finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the flow, in quantitative agreement with
theoretical predictions. We show that at finite concentrations and sufficiently
large elasticity the polymers react on the flow with manifold consequences:
velocity fluctuations are drastically depleted, as observed in soap film
experiments; the velocity statistics becomes strongly intermittent; the
distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents shifts to lower values,
signalling the reduction of Lagrangian chaos.
