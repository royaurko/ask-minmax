We fit the parameters of a differential equations model describing the
production of gap gene proteins Hunchback and Knirps along the antero-posterior
axis of the embryo of \emph{Drosophila}. As initial data for the differential
equations model, we take the antero-posterior distribution of the proteins
Bicoid, Hunchback and Tailless at the beginning of cleavage cycle 14. We
calibrate and validate the model with experimental data using single- and
multi-objective evolutionary optimization techniques. In the multi-objective
optimization technique, we compute the associated Pareto fronts. We analyze the
cross regulation mechanism between the gap-genes protein pair Hunchback-Knirps
and we show that the posterior distribution of Hunchback follow the
experimental data if Hunchback is negatively regulated by the Huckebein
protein. This approach enables to predict the posterior localization on the
embryo of the protein Huckebein, and we validate with the experimental data the
genetic regulatory network responsible for the antero-posterior distribution of
the gap gene protein Hunchback. We discuss the importance of Pareto
multi-objective optimization techniques in the calibration and validation of
biological models.
