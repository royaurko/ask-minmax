Energy dissipation rate is an important parameter for nearly every experiment
on turbulent flow. Mathematically precise relationships between energy
dissipation rate and other measurable statistics for the case of anisotropic
turbulence are useful to experimentalists. Such relationships are obtained for
which the measurable statistics are the 3rd-order and 2nd-order velocity
structure functions as well as the acceleration-velocity structure function.
The relationships are derived using the Navier-Stokes equation without
approximation. Approximate versions are obtained on the basis of local
stationarity and local homogeneity. The latter are valid for arbitrary Reynolds
numbers for the case of stationary, homogeneous turbulence. Precise use of the
mathematics requires care noted in the Discussion section.
