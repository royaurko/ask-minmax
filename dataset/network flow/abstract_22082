We report the results of WBVR photometry of the massive close x-ray binary
V1341 Cyg=Cyg X-2 in 1986-1992. In the "off" state the amplitudes of the
periodic component of light variations lie in the $0^{m}.265 - 0^{m}.278$ and
$0^{m}.290 - 0^{m}.320$ intervals for the B- and W-bands, respectively, and is
determined by the ellipsoidal shape of the optical component, which is
distorted by the gravitational influence of its x-ray companion. Some of the
active states of the system (long outbursts) may be due to the instability of
the accretion disk (AD) and, possibly, to the nonstationarity of the gaseous
flows and other accretion formations. The close binary system (CBS) contains a
low-luminosity AD.
