We classify flows on AFD factors with faithful Connes-Takesaki modules. This
is a generalization of classification of trace-scaling flows on the AFD
$\mathrm{II}_\infty$ factor, which is equivalent to the uniqueness of the AFD
$\mathrm{III}_1$ factor. In order to do this, we show that a flow on an AFD
factor with faithful Connes-Takesaki module has the Rohlin property, which
gives a partial answer to a characterization problem of the Rohlin property
posed by Masuda-Tomatsu. It is also possible to think of this result as an
$\mathbf{R}$-version of Izumi's result about compact group actions on type III
factors with faithful Connes-Takesaki modules.
