Social data mining is an interesting phe-nomenon which colligates different
sources of social data to extract information. This information can be used in
relationship prediction, decision making, pat-tern recognition, social mapping,
responsibility distri-bution and many other applications. This paper presents a
systematical data mining architecture to mine intellectual knowledge from
social data. In this research, we use social networking site facebook as
primary data source. We collect different attributes such as about me,
comments, wall post and age from facebook as raw data and use advanced data
mining approaches to excavate intellectual knowledge. We also analyze our mined
knowledge with comparison for possible usages like as human behavior
prediction, pattern recognition, job responsibility distribution, decision
making and product promoting.
