We have taken advantage of the native surface roughness and the iron content
of AISI 316 stainless steel to direct grow multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
random networks by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at low-temperature ($<
1000^{\circ}$C), without the addition of any external catalysts or
time-consuming pre-treatments. In this way, super-hydrophobic MWCNT films on
stainless steel sheets were obtained, exhibiting high contact angle values
($154^{\circ}$) and high adhesion force (high contact angle hysteresis).
Furthermore, the investigation of MWCNT films at scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) reveals a two-fold hierarchical morphology of the MWCNT random networks
made of hydrophilic carbonaceous nanostructures on the tip of hydrophobic
MWCNTs. Owing to the Salvinia effect, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic composite
surface of the MWCNT films supplies a stationary super-hydrophobic coating for
conductive stainless steel. This biomimetical inspired surface not only may
prevent corrosion and fouling but also could provide low-friction and
drag-reduction.
