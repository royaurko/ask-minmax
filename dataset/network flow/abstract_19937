By solving radiative transfer equations, we examine three-dimensional
radiative properties of a magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow model confronting
with the observed spectrum of Sgr A*, in the vicinity of supermassive black
hole at the Galactic centre. As a result, we find that the core of radio
emission is larger than the size of the event horizon shadow and its peak
location is shifted from the gravitational centre. We also find that the
self-absorbed synchrotron emissions by the superposition of thermal electrons
within a few tens of the Schwartzschild radius can account for low-frequency
spectra below the critical frequency $\nu_{c}\approx 10^{12}$ Hz. Above the
critical frequency, the synchrotron self-Compton emission by thermal electrons
can account for variable emissions in recent near-infrared observations. In
contrast to the previous study by Ohsuga et al. (2005), we found that the X-ray
spectra by Bremsstrahlung emission of thermal electrons for the different mass
accretion rates can be consistent with both the flaring state and the quiescent
state of Sgr A* observed by {\it Chandra}.
