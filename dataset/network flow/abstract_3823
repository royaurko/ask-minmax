We analyze the synchronization transition for a pair of coupled identical
Kauffman networks in the chaotic phase. The annealed model for Kauffman
networks shows that synchronization appears through a transcritical
bifurcation, and provides an approximate description for the whole dynamics of
the coupled networks. We show that these analytical predictions are in good
agreement with numerical results for sufficiently large networks, and study
finite-size effects in detail. Preliminary analytical and numerical results for
partially disordered networks are also presented.
