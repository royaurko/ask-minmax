Although a simple argument implies that the distribution of dark matter in
galactic halos is characterized by discrete flows and caustics, their presence
is often ignored in discussions of galactic dynamics and of dark matter
detection strategies. Discrete flows and caustics can in fact be irrelevant if
the number of flows is very large. We estimate the number of dark matter flows
as a function of galactocentric distance and consider the various ways in which
that number can be increased, in particular by the presence of structure on
small scales (dark matter clumps) and the scattering of the flows by
inhomogeneities in the matter distribution. We find that, when all complicating
factors are taken into account, discrete flows and caustics in galactic halos
remain a robust prediction of cold dark matter cosmology with extensive
implications for observation and experiment.
