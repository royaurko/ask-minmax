We perform laboratory experiments to elucidate the role of historical
information in games involving human coordination. Our approach follows prior
work studying human network coordination using the task of graph coloring. We
first motivate this research by showing empirical evidence that the resolution
of coloring conflicts is dependent upon the recent local history of that
conflict. We also conduct two tailored experiments to manipulate the game
history that can be used by humans in order to determine (i) whether humans use
historical information, and (ii) whether they use it effectively. In the first
variant, during the course of each coloring task, the network positions of the
subjects were periodically swapped while maintaining the global coloring state
of the network. In the second variant, participants completed a series of
2-coloring tasks, some of which were restarts from checkpoints of previous
tasks. Thus, the participants restarted the coloring task from a point in the
middle of a previous task without knowledge of the history that led to that
point. We report on the game dynamics and average completion times for the
diverse graph topologies used in the swap and restart experiments.
