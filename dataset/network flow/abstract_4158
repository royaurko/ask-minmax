We prove a spectral flow formula for one-parameter families of Hamiltonian
systems under homoclinic boundary conditions, which relates the spectral flow
to the relative Maslov index of a pair of curves of Lagrangians induced by the
stable and unstable subspaces, respectively. Finally, we deduce sufficient
conditions for bifurcation of homoclinic trajectories of one-parameter families
of nonautonomous Hamiltonian vector fields.
