The generic feature of traffic in a network of flowing electronic data
packets is a phase transition from a stationary free-flow phase to a
continuously growing congested non-stationary phase. In the most simple network
of directed oriented square lattice we have been able to observe all crucial
features of such flow systems having non-trivial critical behavior near the
critical point of transition. The network here is in the shape of a square
lattice and data packets are randomly posted with a rate $\rho$ at one side of
the lattice. Each packet executes a directed diffusive motion towards the
opposite boundary where it is delivered. Packets accumulated at a particular
node form a queue and a maximum of $m$ such packets randomly jump out of this
node at every time step to its neighbors on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis.
The phase transition occurs at $\rho_c=m$. The distribution of travel times
through the system is found to have a log-normal behavior and the
power-spectrum of the load time-series shows $1/f$ like noise similar to the
scenario of Internet traffic.
