We report simultaneous measurements of the permeability and effective
porosity of oil-reservoir rock cores using one-dimensional NMR imaging of the
penetrating flow of laser-polarized xenon gas. The permeability result agrees
well with industry standard techniques, whereas effective porosity is not
easily determined by other methods. This novel NMR technique may have
applications to the characterization of fluid flow in a wide variety of porous
and granular media.
