Object-oriented database systems proved very valuable at handling and
administrating complex objects. In the following guidelines for embedding
neural networks into such systems are presented. It is our goal to treat
networks as normal data in the database system. From the logical point of view,
a neural network is a complex data value and can be stored as a normal data
object. It is generally accepted that rule-based reasoning will play an
important role in future database applications. The knowledge base consists of
facts and rules, which are both stored and handled by the underlying database
system. Neural networks can be seen as representation of intensional knowledge
of intelligent database systems. So they are part of a rule based knowledge
pool and can be used like conventional rules. The user has a unified view about
his knowledge base regardless of the origin of the unique rules.
