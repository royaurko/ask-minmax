We have studied the front propagation in a one dimensional case of combustion
by solving numerically an advection-reaction-diffusion equation. The physical
model is simplified so that no coupling phenomena are considered and the
reacting fluid is a binary mixture of gases. The compressible flow field is
given analytically. We analyse the differences between popular models used in
fundamental studies of compressible combustion and biological problems. Then,
we investigate the effects of compressibility on the front interface dynamics
for different reaction types and we characterise the conditions for which the
reaction stops before its completion.
