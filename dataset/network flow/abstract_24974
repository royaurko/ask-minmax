Many real-world systems such as transportation systems and manufacturing systems can be regarded as flow networks whose arcs have independent, finite and multi-valued random capacities. Such a flow network is indeed a multistate system with multistate components and so its reliability for level ( d,c ), i.e., the probability that d units of flow can be transmitted from the source node to the sink node such that the total transmission cost is less than or equal to c , can be computed in terms of minimal path vectors to level ( d,c ) (named ( d,c )-MPs here). The main objective of this paper is to present a simple algorithm to generate all ( d,c )-MPs of such a system for each level ( d,c ) in terms of minimal pathsets. Two examples are given to illustrate how all ( d,c )-MPs are generated by our algorithm and then the reliability of one example is computed. PDF
