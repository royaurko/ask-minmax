The aim of this paper is to address the question: Can an artificial neural
network (ANN) model be used as a possible characterization of the power of the
human mind? We will discuss what might be the relationship between such a model
and its natural counterpart. A possible characterization of the different power
capabilities of the mind is suggested in terms of the information contained (in
its computational complexity) or achievable by it. Such characterization takes
advantage of recent results based on natural neural networks (NNN) and the
computational power of arbitrary artificial neural networks (ANN). The possible
acceptance of neural networks as the model of the human mind's operation makes
the aforementioned quite relevant.
