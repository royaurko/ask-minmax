Polymer entanglements lead to complicated topological constraints and
interactions between neighbouring chains in a dense solution or melt.
Entanglements can be treated in a mean field approach, within the famous
reptation model, since they effectively confine each individual chain in a
tube-like geometry. In polymer networks, due to crosslinks preventing the
reptation constraint release, entanglements acquire a different topological
meaning and have a much stronger effect on the resulting mechanical response.
We apply the classical ideas of reptation dynamics to calculate the effective
rubber-elastic free energy of an entangled rubbery network. We then compare the
results with other theoretical approaches and establish a particularly close
mapping with the hoop-model, with equally good description of experimental
data. The present consistent reptation theory allows further development of
dynamic theory of stress relaxation.
