The use of IP filtering to improve system security is well established, and
although limited in what it can achieve has proved to be efficient and
effective.
  In the design of a security policy there is always a trade-off between
usability and security. Restricting access means that legitimate use of the
network is prevented; allowing access means illegitimate use may be allowed.
Static access list make finding a balance particularly stark -- we pay the
price of decreased security 100% of the time even if the benefit of increased
usability is only gained 1% of the time.
  Dynamic access lists would allow the rules to change for short periods of
time, and to allow local changes by non-experts. The network administrator can
set basic security guide-lines which allow certain basic services only. All
other services are restricted, but users are able to request temporary
exceptions in order to allow additional access to the network. These exceptions
are granted depending on the privileges of the user.
  This paper covers the following topics: (1) basic introduction to TCP/IP
filtering; (2) semantics for dynamic access lists and; (3) a proposed protocol
for allowing dynamic access; and (4) a method for representing access lists so
that dynamic update and look-up can be done efficiently performed.
