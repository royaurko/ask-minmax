We investigate the stochastic resonance phenomena in the field-driven Ising
model on small-world networks. The response of the magnetization to an
oscillating magnetic field is examined by means of Monte Carlo dynamic
simulations, with the rewiring probability varied. At any finite value of the
rewiring probability, the system is found to undergo a dynamic phase transition
at a finite temperature, giving rise to double resonance peaks. While the peak
in the ferromagnetic phase grows with the rewiring probability, that in the
paramagnetic phase tends to reduce, indicating opposite effects of the
long-range interactions on the resonance in the two phases.
