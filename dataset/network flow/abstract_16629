A fluctuation theorem is proved for the macroscopic currents of a system in a
nonequilibrium steady state, by using Schnakenberg network theory. The theorem
can be applied, in particular, in reaction systems where the affinities or
thermodynamic forces are defined globally in terms of the cycles of the graph
associated with the stochastic process describing the time evolution.
