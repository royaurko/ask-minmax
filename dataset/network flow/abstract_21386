We propose that repeated photoexcitation/ionization of high Z atoms of highly
relativistic flows by star light in dense stellar regions followed by emission
of decay/recombination photons, which are beamed and boosted to gamma ray
energies in the observer frame, produce gamma ray bursts (GRBs). We show that
this overlooked mechanism, which is able to convert efficiently baryonic
kinetic energy release in merger or accretion induced collapse of neutron stars
into cosmological GRBs, reproduces remarkably well all the main observed
properties of GRBs.
