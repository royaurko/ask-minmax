A stretched-exponential bound is obtained for the decay of correlations of
the Rauzy-Veech-Zorich induction map on the space of interval exchange
transformations. A Corollary is the Central Limit Theorem for the Teichmueller
flow on the moduli space of abelian differentials.
  The proof involves an approximation of the induction map by a Markov chain
satisfying the Doeblin condition, the method of Sinai and Bunimovich--Sinai.
The main estimate is Lemma 4. As a corollary of such "loss of memory"
estimates, integrability of a small power of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle is
obtained, thus yielding a variant of J.Athreya's exponential bound on the
probability of returns of the Teichmueller flow into compact sets.
