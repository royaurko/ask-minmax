We derive an effective boundary condition for granular flow taking into
account the effect of the heterogeneity of the force network on sliding
friction dynamics. This yields an intermediate boundary condition which lies in
the limit between no-slip and Coulomb friction; two simple functions relating
wall stress, velocity, and velocity variance are found from numerical
simulations. Moreover, we show that this effective boundary condition
corresponds to Navier slip condition when GDR MiDi's model is assumed to be
valid, and that the slip length depends on the length scale that characterises
the system, \emph{viz} the particle diameter.
