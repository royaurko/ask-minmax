The article investigates the properties of the occupational mobility network
(OMN) in 12 EU countries. Using REFLEX database we construct for each country
an empirical OMN that reflects the job movements of the university graduates,
during the first five years after graduation (1999 - 2005). The nodes are
represented by the occupations coded at 3 digits according to ISCO-88 and the
links are weighted with the number of graduates switching from one occupation
to another. We construct the networks as weighted and directed. This
comparative study allows us to see what are the common patterns in the OMN over
different EU labor markets.
