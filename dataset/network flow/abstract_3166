We construct and analyze climate networks based on daily satellite
measurements of temperatures and geopotential heights. We show that these
networks are stable during time and are similar over different altitudes. Each
link in our network is stable with typical 15% variability. The entire
hierarchy of links is about 80% consistent during time. We show that about half
of this stability is due to the spatial 2D embedding of the network, and half
is due to physical coupling mechanisms. The network stability of equatorial
regions is found to be lower compared to the stability of a typical network in
non-equatorial regions.
