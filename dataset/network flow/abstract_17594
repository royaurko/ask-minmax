The present paper deals with non Newtonian viscoelastic flows of Oldroyd-B
tye in thin domains. Such geometries arise for example in the context of
lubrication. More precisely, we justify rigorously the asymptotic model
obtained heuristically by proving the mathematical convergence of the
Navier-Stokes/Oldroyd-B sytem towards the asymptotic model.
