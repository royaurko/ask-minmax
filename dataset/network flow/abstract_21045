A new formalism to investigate RKKY interaction in aperiodic materials is
presented.
 Particularly useful in the tight-binding scheme, it is used in this paper to
probe the role of local environment and long range quasiperiodic potential on
this mesoscopic coupling. Interesting features are revealed and discussed
within the context of anomalous localization and transport
