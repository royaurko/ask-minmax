We examine the charge transport through disordered arrays of metallic dots
using numerical simulations. We find power law scaling in the current-voltage
curves for arrays containing no voids, while for void-filled arrays charge
bottlenecks form and a single scaling is absent, in agreement with recent
experiments. In the void-free case we also show that the scaling exponent
depends on the effective dimensionality of the system. For increasing applied
drives we find a transition from 2D disordered filamentary flow near threshold
to a 1D smectic flow which can be identified experimentally using
characteristics in the transport curves and conduction noise.
