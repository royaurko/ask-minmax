We have examined polar magnetic fields for the last three solar cycles,
{$\it{viz.}$}, cycles 21, 22 and 23 using NSO Kitt Peak synoptic magnetograms.
In addition, we have used SoHO/MDI magnetograms to derive the polar fields
during cycle 23. Both Kitt Peak and MDI data at high latitudes
(78${^{\circ}}$--90${^{\circ}}$) in both solar hemispheres show a significant
drop in the absolute value of polar fields from the late declining phase of the
solar cycle 22 to the maximum of the solar cycle 23. We find that long term
changes in the absolute value of the polar field, in cycle 23, is well
correlated with changes in meridional flow speeds that have been reported
recently. We discuss the implication of this in influencing the extremely
prolonged minimum experienced at the start of the current cycle 24 and in
forecasting the behaviour of future solar cycles.
