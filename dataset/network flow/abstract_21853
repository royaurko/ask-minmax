Measurements of identified particles from Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on nuclear
modification, baryon-to-meson ratios, and elliptic flow at intermediate
transverse momentum ($1.5 < p_T < 5$ GeV/c). Possible connections between (1)
these measurements, (2) the running coupling for static quark anti-quark pairs
at finite temperature, and (3) the creation of a deconfined quark-gluon phase
are presented. Modifications to hadronization in Au+Au collisions are proposed
as a likely signature for the creation of deconfined colored matter.
