We propose a new method to immunize populations or computer networks against
epidemics which is more efficient than any method considered before. The
novelty of our method resides in the way of determining the immunization
targets. First we identify those individuals or computers that contribute the
least to the disease spreading measured through their contribution to the size
of the largest connected cluster in the social or a computer network. The
immunization process follows the list of identified individuals or computers in
inverse order, immunizing first those which are most relevant for the epidemic
spreading. We have applied our immunization strategy to several model networks
and two real networks, the Internet and the collaboration network of high
energy physicists. We find that our new immunization strategy is in the case of
model networks up to 14%, and for real networks up to 33% more efficient than
immunizing dynamically the most connected nodes in a network. Our strategy is
also numerically efficient and can therefore be applied to large systems.
