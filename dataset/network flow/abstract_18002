Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with asymmetric learning windows is
commonly found in the brain and useful for a variety of spike-based
computations such as input filtering and associative memory. A natural
consequence of STDP is establishment of causality in the sense that a neuron
learns to fire with a lag after specific presynaptic neurons have fired. The
effect of STDP on synchrony is elusive because spike synchrony implies unitary
spike events of different neurons rather than a causal delayed relationship
between neurons. We explore how synchrony can be facilitated by STDP in
oscillator networks with a pacemaker. We show that STDP with asymmetric
learning windows leads to self-organization of feedforward networks starting
from the pacemaker. As a result, STDP drastically facilitates frequency
synchrony. Even though differences in spike times are lessened as a result of
synaptic plasticity, the finite time lag remains so that perfect spike
synchrony is not realized. In contrast to traditional mechanisms of large-scale
synchrony based on mutual interaction of coupled neurons, the route to
synchrony discovered here is enslavement of downstream neurons by upstream
ones. Facilitation of such feedforward synchrony does not occur for STDP with
symmetric learning windows.
