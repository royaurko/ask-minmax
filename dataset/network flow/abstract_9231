We introduce a simple cellular-network model to explain the capacity of the
plants as memory devices. Following earlier observations (Bose \cite{Bose} and
others), we regard the plant as a network in which each of the elements (plant
cells) are connected via negative (inhibitory) interactions. To investigate the
performance of the network, we construct a model following that of Hopfield,
whose energy function possesses both Hebbian spin glass and anti-ferromagnetic
terms. With the assistance of the replica method, we find that the memory state
of the network decreases enormously due to the effect of the anti-ferromagnetic
order induced by the inhibitory connections. We conclude that the ability of
the plant as a memory device is rather weak.
