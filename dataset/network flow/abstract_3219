The study of flow can provide information on the initial state dynamics and
the degree of equilibration attained in heavy ion collisions. This contribution
presents results for both elliptic and directed flow as determined from data
recorded by the PHOBOS experiment in Au+Au runs at RHIC at sqrt(sNN) = 19.6,
130 and 200 GeV. The PHOBOS detector provides a unique coverage in
pseudorapidity for measuring flow at RHIC. The systematic dependence of flow on
pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, centrality and energy is discussed.
