In this paper, we develop the themes presented at the 2003 Joint Complexity
Conference at the London School of Economics and subsequently published in The
Intelligencer (2004) and O Tempo Das Redes (2008). Following the data analysis
of the 9/11 high-jacker network developed by Valdis Krebs from open sources, we
apply social network theory to examine salient arguments regarding terrorism as
seen from the standpoint of complex adaptive systems theory. In particular, we
explore the concepts of group cohesion, adhesion and alternative network
mappings derived from node removal.
