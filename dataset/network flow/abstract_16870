We analyze the stability of synchronized state for coupled nearly identical
dynamical systems on networks by deriving an approximate Master Stability
Function (MSF). Using this MSF we treat the problem of designing a network
having the best synchronizability properties. We find that the edges which
connect nodes with a larger relative parameter mismatch are preferred and the
nodes having values at one extreme of the parameter mismatch are preferred as
hubs.
