We consider dipole oscillations of a trapped dilute Bose-Einstein condensate
in the presence of a scattering potential consisting either in a localized
defect or in an extended disordered potential. In both cases the breaking of
superfluidity and the damping of the oscillations are shown to be related to
the appearance of a nonlinear dissipative flow. At supersonic velocities the
flow becomes asymptotically dissipationless.
