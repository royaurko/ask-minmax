In this article, we present our improved algorithm for error localization
from counterexamples, LocFaults, flow-driven and constraint-based. This
algorithm analyzes the paths of CFG (Control Flow Graph) of the erroneous
program to calculate the subsets of suspicious instructions to correct the
program. Indeed, we generate a system of constraints for paths of control flow
graph for which at most k conditional statements can be wrong. Then we compute
the MCSs (Minimal Correction Set) of bounded size on each of these paths.
Removal of one of these sets of constraints gives maximal satisfiable subset,
in other words, a maximal satisfiable subset satisfying the postcondition. To
calculate the MCSs, we extend the generic algorithm proposed by Liffiton and
Sakallah in order to deal programs with numerical instructions more
effectively. We are interested to present the incremental aspect of this new
algorithm that is not yet presented.
