In this paper, we consider two classes of free boundary value problems of a
viscous two-phase liquid-gas model relevant to the flow in wells and pipelines
with mass-dependent viscosity coefficient. The liquid is treated as an
incompressible fluid whereas the gas is assumed to be polytropic. We obtain the
asymptotic behavior and decay rates of the mass functions $n(x,t)$,\$m(x,t)$
when the initial masses are assumed to be connected to vacuum both
discontinuously and continuously, which improves the corresponding result about
Navier-Stokes equations in \cite{Zhu}.
