A model for energy, pressure and flow velocity distributions at the beginning
of relativistic heavy ion collisions is presented, which can be used as initial
condition for hydrodynamical calculations. The results show that QGP forms a
tilted disk, such that the direction of the largest pressure gradient stays in
the reaction plane, but deviates from both the beam and the usual transverse
flow directions. Such initial condition may lead to the creation of "antiflow"
or "third flow component".
