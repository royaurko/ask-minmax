Optical flow is a powerful tool for the study and analysis of motion in a
sequence of images. In this article we study a Horn-Schunck type
spatio-temporal regularization functional for image sequences that have a
non-Euclidean, time varying image domain. To that end we construct a Riemannian
metric that describes the deformation and structure of this evolving surface.
The resulting functional can be seen as natural geometric generalization of
previous work by Weickert and Schn\"orr (2001) and Lef\`evre and Baillet (2008)
for static image domains. In this work we show the existence and wellposedness
of the corresponding optical flow problem and derive necessary and sufficient
optimality conditions. We demonstrate the functionality of our approach in a
series of experiments using both synthetic and real data.
