We study random walks on supercritical percolation clusters on wedges in
$\Z^3$, and show that the infinite percolation cluster is (a.s.) transient
whenever the wedge is transient. This solves a question raised by O. Haggstrom
and E. Mossel. We also show that for convex gauge functions satisfying a mild
regularity condition, the existence of a finite energy flow on $Z^2$ is
equivalent to the (a.s.) existence of a finite energy flow on the supercritical
percolation cluster. This solves a question of C. Hoffman.
