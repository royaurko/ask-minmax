We have recently introduced an efficient method for the detection and
identification of modules in complex networks, based on the de-synchronization
properties (dynamical clustering) of phase oscillators. In this paper we apply
the dynamical clustering tecnique to the identification of communities of
marine organisms living in the Chesapeake Bay food web. We show that our
algorithm is able to perform a very reliable classification of the real
communities existing in this ecosystem by using different kinds of dynamical
oscillators. We compare also our results with those of other methods for the
detection of community structures in complex networks.
