In this paper we propose a new method for the evaluation of network
steganography algorithms based on the new concept of "the moving observer". We
considered three levels of undetectability named: "good", "bad", and "ugly". To
illustrate this method we chose Wi-Fi steganography as a solid family of
information hiding protocols. We present the state of the art in this area
covering well-known hiding techniques for 802.11 networks. "The moving
observer" approach could help not only in the evaluation of steganographic
algorithms, but also might be a starting point for a new detection system of
network steganography. The concept of a new detection system, called MoveSteg,
is explained in detail.
