Can one send a wave to bring an object from a distance? The general idea is
inspired by the recent success in moving micro particles using light and the
development of a tractor beam concept. For fluid surfaces, however, the only
known paradigm is the Stokes drift model, where linear planar waves push
particles in the direction of the wave propagation. Here we show how to fetch a
macroscopic floater from a large distance by sending a surface wave towards it.
We develop a new method of remote manipulation of floaters by forming inward
and outward surface jets, stationary vortices, and other complex surface flows
using nonlinear waves generated by a vertically oscillating plunger. The flows
can be engineered by changing the geometry and the power of a wave maker, and
the flow dissipation. The new method is robust and works both for long gravity
and for short capillary waves. We use a novel method of visualising 3D particle
trajectories on the surface. This letter introduces a new conceptual framework
for understanding wave-driven flows. The results form the basis for remote
manipulation of objects on the fluid surfaces and will help better
understanding motion of floaters on the ocean surface and the generation of
wave-driven jets.
