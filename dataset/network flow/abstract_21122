The Anderson--Hubbard Hamiltonian at half--filling is investigated within
dynamical mean--field theory at zero temperature. The local density of states
is calculated by taking the geometric and arithmetic mean, respectively. The
non--magnetic ground state phase diagrams obtained within the different
averaging schemes are compared.
