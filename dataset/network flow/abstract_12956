Using scanning Kerr microscopy, we directly acquire two-dimensional images of
spin-polarized electrons flowing laterally in bulk epilayers of n:GaAs. Optical
injection provides a local dc source of polarized electrons, whose subsequent
drift and/or diffusion is controlled with electric, magnetic, and - in
particular - strain fields. Spin precession induced by controlled uniaxial
stress along the <110> axes demonstrates the direct k-linear spin-orbit
coupling of electron spin to the shear (off-diagonal) components of the strain
tensor.
