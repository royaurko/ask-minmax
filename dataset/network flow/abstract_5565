An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) detects malicious and selfish nodes in a
network. Ad hoc networks are often secured by using either intrusion detection
or by secure routing. Designing efficient IDS for wireless ad-hoc networks that
would not affect the performance of the network significantly is indeed a
challenging task. Arguably, the most common thing in a review paper in the
domain of wireless networks is to compare the performances of different
solutions using simulation results. However, variance in multiple configuration
aspects including that due to different underlying routing protocols, makes the
task of simulation based comparative evaluation of IDS solutions somewhat
unrealistic. In stead, the contributors have followed an analytic approach to
identify the gaps in the existing IDS solutions for MANETs and wireless mesh
networks. The paper aims to ease the job of a new researcher by exposing him to
the state of the art research issues on IDS. Nearly 80% of the works cited in
this paper are published with in last 3 to 4 years.
