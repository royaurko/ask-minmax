We propose a novel distributed expectation maximization (EM) method for
non-cooperative RF device localization using a wireless sensor network. We
consider the scenario where few or no sensors receive line-of-sight signals
from the target. In the case of non-line-of-sight signals, the signal path
consists of a single reflection between the transmitter and receiver. Each
sensor is able to measure the time difference of arrival of the target's signal
with respect to a reference sensor, as well as the angle of arrival of the
target's signal. We derive a distributed EM algorithm where each node makes use
of its local information to compute summary statistics, and then shares these
statistics with its neighbors to improve its estimate of the target
localization. Since all the measurements need not be centralized at a single
location, the spectrum usage can be significantly reduced. The distributed
algorithm also allows for increased robustness of the sensor network in the
case of node failures. We show that our distributed algorithm converges, and
simulation results suggest that our method achieves an accuracy close to the
centralized EM algorithm. We apply the distributed EM algorithm to a set of
experimental measurements with a network of four nodes, which confirm that the
algorithm is able to localize a RF target in a realistic non-line-of-sight
scenario.
