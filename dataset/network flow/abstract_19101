In this paper, we propose a nonlinear transport model for an aviation
network. The takeoff rate from an airport is characterized by the degree of
ground congestion. Due to the effect of "surface congestion," the performance
of an airport deteriorates because of inefficient configurations of waiting
aircraft on the ground. Using a simple transport model, we performed
simulations on a U. S. airport network and found a global jamming transition
induced by local surface congestion. From a physical perspective, the mechanism
of the transition is studied analytically and the resulting aircraft
distribution is discussed considering system dynamics. This study shows that
the knowledge of the relationship between a takeoff rate and a congestion level
on the ground is vital for efficient air traffic operations.
