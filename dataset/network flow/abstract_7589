A study of differential elliptic event anisotropies (v_2) of charged
particles and high-pt pions in 158 AGeV/c Pb+Au collisions is presented.
Results from correlations with respect to the event plane and from two-particle
azimuthal correlations are compared. The latter give systematically higher v_2
values at pt>1.2GeV/c providing possibly an evidence of a non-flow semihard
component.
