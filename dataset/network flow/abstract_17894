Computer System Administration and Network Administration are few such areas
where Practical Extraction Reporting Language (Perl) has robust utilization
these days apart from Bioinformatics. The key role of a System/Network
Administrator is to monitor log files. Log file are updated every day. To scan
the summary of large log files and to quickly determine if there is anything
wrong with the server or network we develop a Firewall Log Status Reporter
(SRr). SRr helps to generate the reports based on the parameters of interest.
SRr provides the facility to admin to generate the individual firewall report
or all reports in one go. By scrutinizing the results of the reports admin can
trace how many times a particular request has been made from which source to
which destination and can track the errors easily. Perl scripts can be seen as
the UNIX script replacement in future arena and SRr is one development with the
same hope that we can believe in. SRr is a generalized and customizable utility
completely written in Perl and may be used for text mining and data mining
application in Bioinformatics research and development too.
