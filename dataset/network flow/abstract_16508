We study the production of cosmological axions in the standard scenario in
which a global string network forms at the Peccei-Quinn phase transition. We
make detailed calculations of the axions produced by string loops (a previously
overlooked source), comparing these with estimates of other contributions from
long strings and domain walls. We dilineate key uncertainities in the string
network evolution, the chief of which is the magnitude of the radiative
backreaction. We conclude that axions produces by the these topological
contributions provide the significant cosmological constraint on the symmetry
breaking scale $\fa$ and the mass $\ma$
