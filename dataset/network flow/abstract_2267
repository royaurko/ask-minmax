This paper elucidates the connection between stationary symmetric
alpha-stable processes with 0<alpha<2 and nonsingular flows on measure spaces
by describing a new and unique decomposition of stationary stable processes
into those corresponding to positive flows and those corresponding to null
flows. We show that a necessary and sufficient for a stationary stable process
to be ergodic is that its positive component vanishes.
