A local monotonicity formula for the Yang-Mills-Higgs flow on $G$-bundles
over $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($n>4$) is proved. It is shown that the monotone quantity
co\"incides on certain self-similar solutions with that appearing in existing
non-local monotonicity formul\ae\ for the Yang-Mills and Yang-Mills-Higgs
flows.
