The arc reversal/node reduction approach to probabilistic inference is
extended to include the case of instantiated evidence by an operation called
"evidence reversal." This not only provides a technique for computing posterior
joint distributions on general belief networks, but also provides insight into
the methods of Pearl [1986b] and Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [1988]. Although
it is well understood that the latter two algorithms are closely related, in
fact all three algorithms are identical whenever the belief network is a
forest.
