A model based on the aspect of the distribution of the length of conduction
paths accessible for electric charge flow reproduces the universal power-law
dispersive ac conductivity observed in polymer networks and, generally, in
disordered matter. Power exponents larger than unity observed in some cases are
physically acceptable within this model. A saturation high frequency region is
also predicted, in agreement with experimental results. There does not exist a
universal fractional power law (and is useless searching for a unique common
critical exponent), but a qualitative universal behavior of the ac conductivity
in disordered media.
