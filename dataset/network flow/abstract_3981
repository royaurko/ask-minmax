Properties of networks are often characterized in terms of features such as
node degree distributions, average path lengths, diameters, or clustering
coefficients. Here, we study shortest path length distributions. On the one
hand, average as well as maximum distances can be determined therefrom; on the
other hand, they are closely related to the dynamics of network spreading
processes. Because of the combinatorial nature of networks, we apply maximum
entropy arguments to derive a general, physically plausible model. In
particular, we establish the generalized Gamma distribution as a continuous
characterization of shortest path length histograms of networks or arbitrary
topology. Experimental evaluations corroborate our theoretical results.
