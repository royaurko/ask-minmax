Consider a continuous flow of automorphisms of a G-principal bundle which is
chain transitive on its compact Hausdorff base. Here G is a connected
noncompact semi-simple Lie group with finite center. The finest Morse
decomposition of the induced flows on the associated flag bundles were obtained
in previous articles. Here we describe the stable sets of these Morse
components and, under an additional assumption, their Conley indices.
