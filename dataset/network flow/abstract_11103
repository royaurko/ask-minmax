In the postgenome era many efforts have been dedicated to systematically
elucidate the complex web of interacting genes and proteins. These efforts
include experimental and computational methods. Microarray technology offers an
opportunity for monitoring gene expression level at the genome scale. By
recourse to information theory, this study proposes a mathematical approach to
reconstruct gene regulatory networks at coarse-grain level from high throughput
gene expression data. The method provides the {\it a posteriori} probability
that a given gene regulates positively, negatively or does not regulate each
one of the network genes. This approach also allows the introduction of prior
knowledge and the quantification of the information gain from experimental data
used in the inference procedure. This information gain can be used to chose
genes to be perturbed in subsequent experiments in order to refine the
knowledge about the architecture of an underlying gene regulatory network. The
performance of the proposed approach has been studied by {\it in numero}
experiments. Our results suggest that the approach is suitable for focusing on
size-limited problems, such as, recovering a small subnetwork of interest by
performing perturbation over selected genes.
