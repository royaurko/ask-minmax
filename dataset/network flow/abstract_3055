One major open problem in network coding is to characterize the capacity
region of a general multi-source multi-demand network. There are some existing
computational tools for bounding the capacity of general networks, but their
computational complexity grows very quickly with the size of the network. This
motivates us to propose a new hierarchical approach which finds upper and lower
bounding networks of smaller size for a given network. This approach
sequentially replaces components of the network with simpler structures, i.e.,
with fewer links or nodes, so that the resulting network is more amenable to
computational analysis and its capacity provides an upper or lower bound on the
capacity of the original network. The accuracy of the resulting bounds can be
bounded as a function of the link capacities. Surprisingly, we are able to
simplify some families of network structures without any loss in accuracy.
