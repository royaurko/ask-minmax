We introduce a new set of flow parameters to describe the time dependence of
the equation of state and the speed of sound in single field cosmological
models. A scale invariant power spectrum is produced if these flow parameters
satisfy specific dynamical equations. We analyze the flow of these parameters
and find four types of fixed points that encompass all known single field
models. Moreover, near each fixed point we uncover new models where the scale
invariance of the power spectrum relies on having simultaneously time varying
speed of sound and equation of state. We describe several distinctive new
models and discuss constraints from strong coupling and superluminality.
