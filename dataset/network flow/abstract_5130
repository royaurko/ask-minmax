Complex networks considering both positive and negative links have gained
considerable attention during the past several years. Community detection is
one of the main challenges for complex network analysis. Most of the existing
algorithms for community detection in a signed network aim at providing a
hard-partition of the network where any node should belong to a community or
not. However, they cannot detect overlapping communities where a node is
allowed to belong to multiple communities. The overlapping communities widely
exist in many real world networks. In this paper, we propose a signed
probabilistic mixture (SPM) model for overlapping community detection in signed
networks. Compared with the existing models, the advantages of our methodology
are (i) providing soft-partition solutions for signed networks; (ii) providing
soft-memberships of nodes. Experiments on a number of signed networks show that
our SPM model: (i) can identify assortative structures or disassortative
structures as the same as other state-of-the-art models; (ii) can detect
overlapping communities; (iii) outperform other state-of-the-art models at
shedding light on the community detection in synthetic signed networks.
