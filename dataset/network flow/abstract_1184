This paper continues the study of equilibria for flows over time in the fluid
queueing model recently considered by Koch and Skutella [10]. We provide a
constructive proof for the existence and uniqueness of equilibria in the case
of a single origin-destination with piecewise constant inflow rates, through a
detailed analysis of the static flows obtained as derivatives of a dynamic
equilibrium. We also give a nonconstructive existence proof of equilibria when
the inflow rates belong to $L^p$ including the extension to multiple
origin-destinations.
