We attempt to de-mistify Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by considering
special cases which are related to other statistical methods common in
Astronomy and other fields. In particular we show how ANNs generalise Bayesian
methods, multi-parameter fitting, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Wiener
filtering and regularisation methods. Examples of morphological classification
of galaxies illustrate how non-linear ANNs improve on linear techniques.
