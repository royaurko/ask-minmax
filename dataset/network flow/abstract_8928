We use entropy theory as a new tool for studying Lorenz-like classes of flows
in any dimension. More precisely, we show that every Lorenz-like class is
entropy expansive, and has positive entropy which varies continuously with
vector fields. We deduce that every such class contains a transverse homoclinic
orbit and, generically, is an attractor.
