Effects of a bottleneck in a linear trafficway is investigated using a simple
cellular automaton model. Introducing a blockage site which transmit cars at
some transmission probability into the rule-184 cellular automaton, we observe
three different phases with increasing car concentration: Besides the free
phase and the jam phase, which exist already in the pure rule-184 model, the
mixed phase of these two appears at intermediate concentration with
well-defined phase boundaries. This mixed phase, where cars pile up behind the
blockage to form a jam region, is characterized by a constant flow. In the
thermodynamic limit, we obtain the exact expressions for several characteristic
quantities in terms of the car density and the transmission rate. These
quantities depend strongly on the system size at the phase boundaries; We
analyse these finite size effects based on the finite-size scaling.
