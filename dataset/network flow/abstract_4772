The previous study regarding the stabilization of a magnetized constant
temperature plasma by shear flow with vorticity is extended to a plasma of
non-constant temperature, where in the presence of heat source or sinks the
thermomagnetic Nernst effect becomes important. Of special interest is what
this effect has on the stabilization of a linear z-pinch discharge for which
exact solutions are given. Solutions which are unstable for subsonic shear flow
become stable if the flow is supersonic.
