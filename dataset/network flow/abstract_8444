In this paper, we study the impact of network latency on the time required to
download a file distributed using BitTorrent. This study is essential to
understand if testbeds can be used for experimental evaluation of BitTorrent.
We observe that the network latency has a marginal impact on the time required
to download a file; hence, BitTorrent experiments can performed on testbeds.
