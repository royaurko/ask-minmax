The Lyapunov exponents for Anderson localization are studied in a one
dimensional disordered system. A random Gaussian potential with the power law
decay $\sim 1/|x|^q$ of the correlation function is considered. The exponential
growth of the moments of the eigenfunctions and their derivative is obtained.
Positive Lyapunov exponents, which determine the asymptotic growth rate are
found.
