We present the most energetic BALQSO outflow measured to date, with a kinetic
luminosity of at least 10^46 ergs/s, which is 5% of the bolometric luminosity
of this high Eddington ratio quasar. The associated mass flow rate is 400 solar
masses per year. Such kinetic luminosity and mass flow rate should provide
strong AGN feedback effects. The outflow is located at about 300 pc from the
quasar and has a velocity of roughly 8000 km/s. Our distance and energetic
measurements are based in large part on the identification and measurement of
SIV and SIV* BALs. The use of this high ionization species allows us to
generalize the result to the majority of high ionization BALQSOs that are
identified by their CIV absorption. We also report the energetics of two other
outflows seen in another object using the same technique. The distances of all
3 outflows from the central source (100-2000pc) suggest that we observe BAL
troughs much farther away from the central source than the assumed acceleration
region of these outflows (0.01-0.1pc).
