This paper provides synchronization conditions for networks of nonlinear
systems. The components of the network (referred to as "compartments'' in this
paper) are made up of an identical interconnection of subsystems, each
represented as an operator in an extended L2 space and referred to as a
"species''. The compartments are, in turn, coupled through a diffusion-like
term among the respective species. The synchronization conditions are provided
by combining the input-output properties of the subsystems with information
about the structure of network. The paper also explores results for state-space
models, as well as biochemical applications. The work is motivated by cellular
networks where signaling occurs both internally, through interactions of
species, and externally, through intercellular signaling. The theory is
illustrated providing synchronization conditions for networks of Goodwin
oscillators.
