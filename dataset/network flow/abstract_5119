Many networks including social networks, computer networks, and biological
networks are found to divide naturally into communities of densely connected
individuals. Finding community structure is one of fundamental problems in
network science. Since Newman's suggestion of using \emph{modularity} as a
measure to qualify the goodness of community structures, many efficient methods
to maximize modularity have been proposed but without a guarantee of
optimality. In this paper, we propose two polynomial-time algorithms to the
modularity maximization problem with theoretical performance guarantees. The
first algorithm comes with a \emph{priori guarantee} that the modularity of
found community structure is within a constant factor of the optimal modularity
when the network has the power-law degree distribution. Despite being mainly of
theoretical interest, to our best knowledge, this is the first approximation
algorithm for finding community structure in networks. In our second algorithm,
we propose a \emph{sparse metric}, a substantially faster linear programming
method for maximizing modularity and apply a rounding technique based on this
sparse metric with a \emph{posteriori approximation guarantee}. Our experiments
show that the rounding algorithm returns the optimal solutions in most cases
and are very scalable, that is, it can run on a network of a few thousand nodes
whereas the LP solution in the literature only ran on a network of at most 235
nodes.
