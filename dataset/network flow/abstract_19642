In this paper, we show that the family of moduli spaces of $\balpha'$-stable
$(\bt, \blambda)$-parabolic $\phi$-connections of rank 2 over $\BP^1$ with
4-regular singular points and the fixed determinant bundle of degree -1 is
isomorphic to the family of Okamoto--Painlev\'e pairs introduced by Okamoto
\cite{O1} and \cite{STT02}. We also discuss about the generalization of our
theory to the case where the rank of the connections and genus of the base
curve are arbitrary. Defining isomonodromic flows on the family of moduli space
of stable parabolic connections via the Riemann-Hilbert correspondences, we
will show that a property of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondences implies the
Painlev\'e property of isomonodromic flows.
