New data with a minimum bias trigger for 158 GeV/nucleon Pb + Pb have been
analyzed. Directed and elliptic flow as a function of rapidity of the particles
and centrality of the collision are presented. The centrality dependence of the
ratio of elliptic flow to the initial space elliptic anisotropy is compared to
models.
