Recent research has demonstrated the importance of boundary effects on the
overall connection probability of wireless networks, but has largely focused on
convex domains. We consider two generic scenarios of practical importance to
wireless communications, in which one or more nodes are located outside the
convex space where the remaining nodes reside. Consequently, conventional
approaches with the underlying assumption that only line-of-sight (LOS) or
direct connections between nodes are possible, fail to provide the correct
analysis for the connectivity. We present an analytical framework that
explicitly considers the effects of reflections from the system boundaries on
the full connection probability. This study provides a different strategy to
ray tracing tools for predicting the wireless propagation environment. A simple
two-dimensional geometry is first considered, followed by a more practical
three-dimensional system. We investigate the effects of different system
parameters on the connectivity of the network though analysis corroborated by
numerical simulations, and highlight the potential of our approach for more
general non-convex geometries.t system parameters on the connectivity of the
