In this paper, we present a software compilation approach for
microprocessor/FPGA platforms that partitions a software binary onto custom
hardware implemented in the FPGA. Our approach imposes less restrictions on
software tool flow than previous compiler approaches, allowing software
designers to use any software language and compiler. Our approach uses a
back-end partitioning tool that utilizes decompilation techniques to recover
important high-level information, resulting in performance comparable to
high-level compiler-based approaches.
