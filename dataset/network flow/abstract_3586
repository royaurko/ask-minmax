In this paper, we propose a new model that allows us to investigate this
competitive aspect of real networks in quantitative terms. Through theoretical
analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the competitive network have
the universality for a weighted network. The relation between parameters in the
weighted network and the competitiveness in the competitive network is
obtained. So we can use the expression of the degree distribution of the
competitive model to calculate that and the strength of the weighted network
directly. The analytical solution reveals that the degree distribution of the
weighted network is correlated with the increment and initial value of edge
weights, which is verified by numerical simulations. Moreover, the evolving
pattern of a clustering coefficient along with network parameters such as the
size of a network, an updating coefficient, an initial weight and the
competitiveness are obtained by further simulations. Specially, it is necessary
to point out that the initial weight plays equally significant role as updating
coefficient in influencing the topological characteristics of the network.
