In these proceedings, we present STAR measurements of directed flow, $v_{1}$,
for pions, protons and antiprotons between $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ GeV and 200
GeV. A striking observation is that the $v_1$ slope for net protons as a
function of rapidity, $F = dv_1/dy$, which is an estimate of the directed flow
contribution from baryon number transported to the midrapidity region, changes
sign twice within the lower part of this energy range. We also present the
measured beam energy dependence of triangular flow $v_{3}$, and the $n=1$ to
$n=5$ flow harmonics for charged particles at 200 GeV.
