The vast majority of travel takes place within cities. Recently, new data has
become available which allows for the discovery of urban mobility patterns
which differ from established results about long distance travel. Specifically,
the latest evidence increasingly points to exponential trip length
distributions, contrary to the scaling laws observed on larger scales. In this
paper, in order to explore the origin of the exponential law, we propose a new
model which can predict individual flows in urban areas better. Based on the
model, we explain the exponential law of intra-urban mobility as a result of
the exponential decrease in average population density in urban areas. Indeed,
both empirical and analytical results indicate that the trip length and the
population density share the same exponential decaying rate.
