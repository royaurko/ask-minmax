We investigate the model of the disc/corona accretion flow around the black
hole. The model, parameterized by the total (i.e. disk plus corona) accretion
rate, $\dot m$, mass of the black hole, $M$ and the viscosity parameter,
$\alpha$, uniquely determines the fraction of energy released in the corona as
a function of radius and, in particular, the transition radius to the
single-phase ADAF flow. Self-consistent solutions with the mass exchange
between phases display radial dependence of the parameters. This model
reproduces all characteristic luminosity states of accretion black hole without
any additional ad hoc assumptions. In particular. the mechanism of the disk
evaporation leads to a new, almost horizontal branch on the accretion flow's
stability curve (i.e. the dependence of accretion rate on surface density) at
the critical accretion rate.
