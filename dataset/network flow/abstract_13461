We study the collision probability $p$ of particles advected by open flows
displaying chaotic advection. We show that $p$ scales with the particle size
$\delta$ as a power law whose coefficient is determined by the fractal
dimensions of the invariant sets defined by the advection dynamics. We also
argue that this same scaling also holds for the reaction rate of active
particles in the low-density regime. These analytical results are compared to
numerical simulations, and we find very good agreement with the theoretical
predictions.
