A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of planar Couette flow is presented for
the minimal channel in which turbulence structures can be sustained. Evolution
over a single breakdown and regeneration cycle is compared to computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Qualitative similar structures are observed
and turbulent statistics show excellent quantitative agreement. The molecular
scale law of the wall is presented in which stick-slip molecular wall-fluid
interactions replace the no-slip conditions. The impact of grid resolution is
explored and the observed structures are seen to be dependant on averaging time
and length scales. The kinetic energy spectra show a range of scales are
present in the molecular system and that spectral content is dependent on the
grid resolution employed. The subgrid velocity of the molecules is compared to
spatial averaged velocity using joint probability density functions. Molecular
trajectories, diffusions and Lagrangian statistics are presented. The
importance of sub-grid scales, relevance of the Kolmogorov lengthscale and
implications of molecular turbulence are discussed.
