A classical model for water-gas flows in porous media is considered. The
degenerate coupled system of equations obtained by mass conservation is usually
approximated by finite volume schemes in the oil reservoir simulations. The
convergence properties of these schemes are only known for incompressible
fluids. This chapter deals with construction and convergence analysis of a
finite volume scheme for compressible and immiscible flow in porous media. In
comparison with incompressible fluid, compressible fluids requires more
powerful techniques. We present a new result of convergence in a two or three
dimensional porous medium and under the only modification that the density of
gas depends on global pressure.
