The energy consumption in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN) is much
greater than that in traditional wireless sensor networks. Thus, it is a huge
challenge to remain the perpetual operation for WMSN. In this paper, we propose
a new heterogeneous energy supply model for WMSN through the coexistence of
renewable energy and electricity grid. We address to cross-layer optimization
for the multiple multicast with distributed source coding and intra-session
network coding in heterogeneous powered wireless multimedia sensor networks
(HPWMSN) with correlated sources. The aim is to achieve the optimal reconstruct
distortion at sinks and the minimal cost of purchasing electricity from
electricity grid. Based on the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty with perturbation
technique and dual decomposition technique, we propose a fully distributed
dynamic cross-layer algorithm, including multicast routing, source rate
control, network coding, session scheduling and energy management, only
requiring knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The explicit trade-off
between the optimization objective and queue backlog is theoretically proven.
Finally, the simulation results verify the theoretic claims.
