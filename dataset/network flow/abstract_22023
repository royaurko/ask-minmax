Comment on Effects of transverse magnetic field on mixed convection in wall
plume of power-law fluids, by Rama Subba Reddy Gorla, Jin Kook Lee, Shoichiro
Nakamura and Ioan Pop [International Journal of Engineering Science, 31 (1993)
1035-1045]. In the above paper the contributors treat the boundary layer mixed
convection flow of a power-law fluid along a vertical adiabatic surface in a
transverse magnetic field with a steady thermal source at the leading edge. The
governing non-similar equations are solved by means of a novel finite
difference scheme. However, there are two fundamental errors in this paper and
the presented results do not have any practical value.
