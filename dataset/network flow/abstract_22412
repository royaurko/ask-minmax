We present several results concerning the semiclassical limit of the time
dependent Schr\"odinger equation with potentials whose regularity doesn't
guarantee the uniqueness of the underlying classical flow. Different topologies
for the limit are considered and the situation where two bicharateristics can
be obtained out of the same initial point is emphasized.
