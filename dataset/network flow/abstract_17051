In a multirate WLAN with a single access point (AP) and several stations
(STAs), we obtain analytical expressions for TCP-controlled long file transfer
throughputs allowing nonzero propagation delays between the file server and
STAs. We extend our earlier work in [3] to obtain AP and STA throughputs in a
multirate WLAN, and use these in a closed BCMP queueing network model to obtain
TCP throughputs. Simulation show that our approach is able to predict observed
throughputs with a high degree of accuracy.
