We study the diffusion of helium and other heavy elements in the solar
interior by solving exactly the set of flow equations developed by Burgers for
a multi-component fluid, including the residual heat-flow terms. No
approximation is made concerning the relative concentrations and no restriction
is placed on the number of elements considered. We give improved diffusion
velocities for hydrogen, helium, oxygen and iron, in the analytic form derived
previously by Bahcall and Loeb. These expressions for the diffusion velocities
are simple to program in stellar evolution codes and are expected to be
accurate to $\sim 15\%$. Our complete treatment of element diffusion can be
directly incorporated in a standard stellar evolution code by means of an
exportable subroutine, but, for convenience, we also give simple analytical
fits to our numerical results.
