This paper presents a study on gossip protocols employed to spread data in
unstructured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlays. We consider two classic
protocols (fixed probability and probabilistic broadcast) and compare them with
two new degree dependent gossip protocols that change the probability of
dissemination based on the degree of peers. We identify principal metrics,
provide a theoretical model and perform the assessment evaluation using
parallel and distributed simulation. A main point of this study is that our
large-scale simulations consider implementation technical details, such as the
use of caching and Time To Live (TTL) in message dissemination, that are
usually neglected in simulation, due to the additional overhead they cause.
Outcomes confirm that these technical strategies have an important influence on
the performance of gossip schemes. Moreover, gossip schemes are quite effective
to spread information in P2P overlay networks, whatever their topology.
