Soliton transport in tube-like networks is studied by solving the nonlinear
Schroedinger equation (NLSE) on finite thickness ("fat") graphs. The dependence
of the solution and of the reflection at vertices on the graph thickness and on
the angle between its bonds is studied and related to a special case considered
in our previous work, in the limit when the thickness of the graph goes to
zero. It is found that both the wave function and reflection coefficient
reproduce the regime of reflectionless vertex transmission studied in our
previous work.
