Direct numerical simulations of turbulent heat transfer in fully-developed
channel flows have been performed in a range of friction Reynolds number
between 60 and 180, based on the friction velocity and the channel half width
$\delta$, with emphasis on a puff-like structure, large-scale spatial
intermittency. For the Reynolds numbers lower than 80 with a large
computational domain of 51.2 x 2 x 22.5, the turbulent puff was observed and
its significant influences on the momentum and heat transports were found. The
spatial structure of the equilibrium puff, or the localized turbulence, was
examined with taking account of two different thermal boundary conditions: the
uniform heat-flux heating and the constant temperature difference between the
walls. It was revealed that there existed a localized strong turbulent region
in the form of an oblique band, along which a spanwise secondary flow was
induced. In consequence, at the present lowest Reynolds number as low as 60,
the flow remained turbulent and the larger Nusselt numbers than those without
puff was obtained by the presence of puff.
