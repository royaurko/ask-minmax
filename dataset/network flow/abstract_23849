A computationally intensive large job, granulized to concurrent pieces and
operating in a dynamic environment should reduce the total processing time.
However, distributing jobs across a networked environment is a tedious and
difficult task. Job distribution in a Local Area Network based on Triangular
Dynamic Architecture (TDA) is a mechanism that establishes a dynamic
environment for job distribution, load balancing and distributed processing
with minimum interaction from the user. This paper introduces TDA and discusses
its architecture and shows the benefits gained by utilizing such architecture
in a distributed computing environment.
