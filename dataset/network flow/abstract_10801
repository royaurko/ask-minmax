Galactic fountains and radial gas flows are very important ingredients in
modeling the chemical evolution of galactic disks. Our aim here is to study the
effects of galactic fountains and radial gas flows in the chemical evolution of
the disk of M31. We adopt a ballistic method to study the effects of galactic
fountains on the chemical enrichment of the M31 disk. We find that the landing
coordinate for the fountains in M31 is no more than 1 kpc from the starting
point, thus producing negligible effect on the chemical evolution of the disk.
We find that the delay time in the enrichment process due to fountains is no
longer than 100 Myr and this timescale also produces negligible effects on the
results. Then, we compute the chemical evolution of the M31 disk with radial
gas flows produced by the infall of extragalactic material and fountains. We
find that a moderate inside-out formation of the disk coupled with radial flows
of variable speed can very well reproduce the observed gradient. We discuss
also the effects of other parameters such a threshold in the gas density for
star formation and an efficiency of star formation varying with the galactic
radius. We conclude that the most important physical processes in creating disk
gradients are the inside-out formation and the radial gas flows. More data on
abundance gradients both locally and at high redshift are necessary to confirm
this conclusion.
