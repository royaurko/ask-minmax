We study a stochastic model for the coevolution of a process of opinion
formation in a population of agents and the network which underlies their
interaction. Interaction links can break when agents fail to reach an opinion
agreement. The structure of the network and the distribution of opinions over
the population evolve towards a state where the population is divided into
disconnected communities whose agents share the same opinion. The statistical
properties of this final state vary considerably as the model parameters are
changed. Community sizes and their internal connectivity are the quantities
used to characterize such variations.
