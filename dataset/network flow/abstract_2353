Network virtualization allows cloud infrastructure providers to accommodate
multiple virtual networks on a single physical network. However, mapping
multiple virtual network resources to physical network components, called
virtual network embedding (VNE), is known to be non-deterministic
polynomial-time hard (NP-hard). Effective virtual network embedding increases
the revenue by increasing the number of accepted virtual networks. In this
paper, we propose virtual network embedding algorithm, which improves virtual
network embedding by coarsening virtual networks. Heavy Clique matching
technique is used to coarsen virtual networks. Then, the coarsened virtual
networks are enhanced by using a refined Kernighan-Lin algorithm. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with existing
algorithms using extensive simulations, which show that the proposed algorithm
improves virtual network embedding by increasing the acceptance ratio and the
revenue.
