We present preliminary results of an HST/NICMOS program to image merger
remnants in the J, H and K bands. The nuclear brightness profiles for most
sample galaxies are similar to those typical for elliptical galaxies, but some
(including the well-studied NGC 3921 and 7252) have an unusually high
luminosity density at small radii. This is consistent with the prediction of
N-body simulations that gas flows to the center during a merger and forms new
stars.
