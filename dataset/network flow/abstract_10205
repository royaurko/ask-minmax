We investigate the problem of structures formation in accretion disc zone,
resulting from the tidally interaction in close binary star system. We aim to
examine the area where the incoming flow meets the matter around secondary star
and the resulting effects throughout the accretion disc. The research is based
on employment of the fluid dynamics equations in conjunction with numerical
simulations leading to the design of graphical models of accretion processes.
For the simulation we propose box-framed sharing schemes. (i) The tidal
transfer of matter through the inner Lagrangian point in close binary stars
disturbs the flow in disc's zones and outer disc area. Calculations on the
perturbed parameters of density and velocity reveal formation of a thickened
zone in the contact area of interacted flows. It appears to be stable for a
number of periods and is unaffected by rotation and dissipation processes. (ii)
The results also show development of undulations, which grow to vortical
patterns in the accretion disc's zone. It is confirmed that under the influence
of tidal wave the conditions of reconfiguring of accretion flow structure are
generated.
