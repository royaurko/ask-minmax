The N=1 superconformal circle theory consisting of a free boson and a free
fermion is considered. At any radius the theory has standard Dirichlet and
Neumann branes, but for rational radii there are additional superconformal
boundary conditions that are labelled by elements in a quotient of SU(2). We
analyse how these branes behave under the radius-changing bulk perturbation. As
in the bosonic case, the bulk perturbation induces in general a boundary RG
flow whose end-point is a superposition of Dirichlet or Neumann branes.
