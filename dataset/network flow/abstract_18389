We design the weights in consensus algorithms with spatially correlated
random topologies. These arise with: 1) networks with spatially correlated
random link failures and 2) networks with randomized averaging protocols. We
show that the weight optimization problem is convex for both symmetric and
asymmetric random graphs. With symmetric random networks, we choose the
consensus mean squared error (MSE) convergence rate as optimization criterion
and explicitly express this rate as a function of the link formation
probabilities, the link formation spatial correlations, and the consensus
weights. We prove that the MSE convergence rate is a convex, nonsmooth function
of the weights, enabling global optimization of the weights for arbitrary link
formation probabilities and link correlation structures. We extend our results
to the case of asymmetric random links. We adopt as optimization criterion the
mean squared deviation (MSdev) of the nodes states from the current average
state. We prove that MSdev is a convex function of the weights. Simulations
show that significant performance gain is achieved with our weight design
method when compared with methods available in the literature.
