A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is collection of intercommunicating mobile
hosts forming a spontaneous network without using established network
infrastructure. Unlike the cellular or infrastructure networks who have a wired
backbone connecting the base-station, the MANETs have neither fixed routers nor
fixed locations. Their performance largely depend upon the routing mechanism &
nature of mobility. Earlier research hints that the Destination Sequenced
Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol is one of the most efficient and
popular protocols, as far as general parameters have been concerned.[1,6] We
have experimentally evaluated, the performance metrics for network load, packet
delivery fraction and end-to-end delay with DSDV Protocol using NS2
Simulator.This paper presents, the performance of DSDV protocol for four
different mobility models namely: Random Waypoint, Reference Point Group
Mobility, Gauss Markov & Manhattan Mobility Model having varying network load &
speed. The experimental results suggest that DSDV protocol with RPGM mobility
model has optimized results for varying network load and speed.
