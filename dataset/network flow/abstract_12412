Previous work on cooperative communications has concentrated primarily on the
diversity benefits of such techniques. This paper, instead, considers the
multiplexing benefits of cooperative communications. First, a new
interpretation on the fundamental tradeoff between the transmission rate and
outage probability in multi-antenna relay networks is given. It follows that
multiplexing gains can be obtained at any finite SNR, in full-duplex
multi-antenna relay networks. Thus relaying can offer not only stronger link
reliability, but also higher spectral efficiency.
  Specifically, the decode-and-forward protocol is applied and networks that
have one source, one destination, and multiple relays are considered. A receive
power gain at the relays, which captures the network large scale fading
characteristics, is also considered. It is shown that this power gain can
significantly affect the system diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for any finite
SNR value. Several relaying protocols are proposed and are shown to offer
nearly the same outage probability as if the transmit antennas at the source
and the relay(s) were co-located, given certain SNR and receive power gains at
the relays. Thus a higher multiplexing gain than that of the direct link can be
obtained if the destination has more antennas than the source.
  Much of the analysis in the paper is valid for arbitrary channel fading
statistics. These results point to a view of relay networks as a means for
providing higher spectral efficiency, rather than only link reliability.
