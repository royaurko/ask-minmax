Compared with the fourth generation (4G) cellular systems, the fifth
generation wireless communication systems (5G) are anticipated to provide
spectral and energy efficiency growth by a factor of at least 10, and the area
throughput growth by a factor of at least 25. To achieve these goals, a
heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN) is presented in this article
as the advanced wireless access network paradigm, where cloud computing is used
to fulfill the centralized large-scale cooperative processing for suppressing
co-channel interferences. The state-of-the-art research achievements in aspects
of system architecture and key technologies for H-CRANs are surveyed.
Particularly, Node C as a new communication entity is defined to converge the
existing ancestral base stations and act as the base band unit (BBU) pool to
manage all accessed remote radio heads (RRHs), and the software-defined H-CRAN
system architecture is presented to be compatible with software-defined
networks (SDN). The principles, performance gains and open issues of key
technologies including adaptive large-scale cooperative spatial signal
processing, cooperative radio resource management, network function
virtualization, and self-organization are summarized. The major challenges in
terms of fronthaul constrained resource allocation optimization and energy
harvesting that may affect the promotion of H-CRANs are discussed as well.
