In this paper, we employ Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) with image and
data processing techniques to implement a general purpose automated leaf
recognition algorithm. 12 leaf features are extracted and orthogonalized into 5
principal variables which consist the input vector of the PNN. The PNN is
trained by 1800 leaves to classify 32 kinds of plants with an accuracy greater
than 90%. Compared with other approaches, our algorithm is an accurate
artificial intelligence approach which is fast in execution and easy in
implementation.
