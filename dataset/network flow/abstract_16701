We discuss the cosmological evolution of cosmic strings with time-dependent
tension. We show that, in the case that the tension changes as a power of time,
the cosmic string network obeys the scaling solution: the characteristic scale
of the string network grows with the time. But due to the time dependence of
the tension, the ratio of the energy density of infinite strings to that of the
background universe is {\it not} necessarily constant.
