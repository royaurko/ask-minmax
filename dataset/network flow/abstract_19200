Named Data networking ensure data integrity so that every important data has
to be signed by its owner in order to send it safely inside the network.
Similarly, in NDN we have to assure that none could open the data except
contributorized users. Since only the endpoints have the right to sign the data or
check its validity during the verification process, we have considered that the
data could be requested from various types of devices used by different people,
these devices could be anything like a smartphone, PC, sensor node with a
different CPU descriptions, parameters, and memory sizes, however their ability
to check the high traffic of a data during the key generation and verification
period is definitely a hard task and it could exhaust the systems with low
computational resources. RSA and ECDSA as digital signature algorithms have
proven their efficiency against cyber attacks, they are characterized by their
speed to encrypt and decrypt data, in addition to their competence at checking
the data integrity. The main purpose of our research was to find the optimal
algorithm that avoids the systems overhead and offers the best time during the
signature scheme
