Suspended colloidal particles interacting chemically with a solute are able
to self-propel by autophoretic motion when they are asymmetrically patterned
(Janus colloids). Here we demonstrate that the chemical anisotropy is not a
necessary condition to achieve locomotion. The non linear interplay between
surface osmotic flows and solute advection can produce spontaneous, and
self-sustained motion of isotropic particles. We solve, for a spherical
particle, the classical nonlinear autophoretic theoretical framework at
arbitrary P\'eclet number. For a given set of material parameters, there exists
a critical particle size, or equivalently a critical Peclet number, above which
spontaneous autophoretic motion occurs. The flow induced by the particle
further displays a hierarchy of instabilities associated with quantized
critical Peclet numbers. Using numerical solutions of the full (unsteady)
diffusiophoretic problem we confirm our analytical predictions and show that,
above the instability threshold, the isotropic particles reach a steady
swimming state with broken front-back symmetry in the concentration field and
the hydrodynamic signature of a "pusher" swimmer. This instability to
propulsion could be relevant to the high-throughput production of
self-propelled particles.
