The diffusion process through an ideal polymer network is studied by applying
the effective medium theory (EMT) to a lattice-gas model. Polymers are modeled
by random walks on the lattice bonds, across which molecules can hop with a
certain probability. The steady state current of the system is calculated using
the EMT and the results are compared to the simulations.
