In this correspondence, we consider a half-duplex large relay network, which
consists of one source-destination pair and $N$ relay nodes, each of which is
connected with a subset of the other relays via signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR)-limited out-of-band conferencing links. The asymptotic achievable rates
of two basic relaying schemes with the "$p$-portion" conferencing strategy are
studied: For the decode-and-forward (DF) scheme, we prove that the DF rate
scales as $\mathcal{O} (\log (N))$; for the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme, we
prove that it asymptotically achieves the capacity upper bound in some
interesting scenarios as $N$ goes to infinity.
