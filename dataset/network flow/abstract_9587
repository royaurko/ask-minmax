Smartphones have been shipped with multiple wireless network interfaces in
order to meet their diverse communication and networking demands. However, as
smartphones increasingly rely on wireless network connections to realize more
functions, the demand of energy has been significantly increased, which has
become the limit for people to explore smartphones' real power. In this paper,
we first review typical smartphone computing systems, energy consumption of
smartphone, and state-of-the-art techniques of energy saving for smartphones.
Then we propose a location-assisted Wi-Fi discovery scheme, which discovers the
nearest Wi-Fi network access points (APs) by using the user's location
information. This allows the user to switch to the Wi-Fi interface in an
intelligent manner when he/she arrives at the nearest Wi-Fi network AP. Thus we
can meet the user's bandwidth needs and provide the best connectivity.
Additionally, it avoids the long periods in idle state and greatly reduces the
number of unnecessary Wi-Fi scans on the mobile device. Our experiments and
simulations demonstrate that our scheme effectively saves energy for
smartphones integrated with Wi-Fi and cellular interfaces.
