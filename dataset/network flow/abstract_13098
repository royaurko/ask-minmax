Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers are a class of stochastic algorithms for
Monte Carlo integral estimation w.r.t. probability distributions, which combine
elements of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and importance sampling/resampling
schemes. We develop a stability analysis by functional inequalities for a
nonlinear flow of probability measures describing the limit behavior of the
algorithms as the number of particles tends to infinity. Stability results are
derived both under global and local assumptions on the generator of the
underlying Metropolis dynamics. This allows us to prove that the combined
methods sometimes have good asymptotic stability properties in multimodal
setups where traditional MCMC methods mix extremely slowly. For example, this
holds for the mean field Ising model at all temperatures.
