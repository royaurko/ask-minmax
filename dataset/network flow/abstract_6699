Prediction of protein secondary structure from the amino acid sequence is a
classical bioinformatics problem. Common methods use feed forward neural
networks or SVMs combined with a sliding window, as these models does not
naturally handle sequential data. Recurrent neural networks are an
generalization of the feed forward neural network that naturally handle
sequential data. We use a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long
short term memory cells for prediction of secondary structure and evaluate
using the CB513 dataset. On the secondary structure 8-class problem we report
better performance (0.674) than state of the art (0.664). Our model includes
feed forward networks between the long short term memory cells, a path that can
be further explored.
