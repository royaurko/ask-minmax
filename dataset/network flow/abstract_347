The analysis of complex networks has so far revolved mainly around the role
of nodes and communities of nodes. However, the dynamics of interconnected
systems is commonly focalised on edge processes, and a dual edge-centric
perspective can often prove more natural. Here we present graph-theoretical
measures to quantify edge-to-edge relations inspired by the notion of flow
redistribution induced by edge failures. Our measures, which are related to the
pseudo-inverse of the Laplacian of the network, are global and reveal the
dynamical interplay between the edges of a network, including potentially
non-local interactions. Our framework also allows us to define the embeddedness
of an edge, a measure of how strongly an edge features in the weighted cuts of
the network. We showcase the general applicability of our edge-centric
framework through analyses of the Iberian Power grid, traffic flow in road
networks, and the C. elegans neuronal network.
