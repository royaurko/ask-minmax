Type-I proton superconducting cores of neutron stars break up in a magnetic
field into alternating domains of superconducting and normal fluids. We examine
two channels of superfluid-normal fluid friction where (i) rotational vortices
are decoupled from the non-superconducting domains and the interaction is due
to the strong force between protons and neutrons; (ii) the non-superconducting
domains are dynamically coupled to the vortices and the vortex motion generates
transverse electric fields within them, causing electronic current flow and
Ohmic dissipation. The obtained dissipation coefficients are consistent with
the Eulerian precession.
