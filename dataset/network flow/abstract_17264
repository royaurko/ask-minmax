In this work, we propose a probabilistic value-passing CCS (Calculus of
Communicating System) approach to model and analyze a typical network security
scenario with one attacker and one defender. By minimizing this model with
respect to probabilistic bisimulation and abstracting it through
graph-theoretic methods, two algorithms based on backward induction are
designed to compute Nash Equilibrium strategy and Social Optimal strategy
respectively. For each algorithm, the correctness is proved and an
implementation is realized. Finally, this approach is illustrated by a detailed
case study.
