We extend the well known bottleneck paths problem in two directions for
directed unweighted (unit edge cost) graphs with positive real edge capacities.
Firstly we narrow the problem domain and compute the bottleneck of the entire
network in $O(n^{\omega}\log{n})$ time, where $O(n^{\omega})$ is the time taken
to multiply two $n$-by-$n$ matrices over ring. Secondly we enlarge the domain
and compute the shortest paths for all possible flow amounts. We present a
combinatorial algorithm to solve the Single Source Shortest Paths for All Flows
(SSSP-AF) problem in $O(mn)$ worst case time, followed by an algorithm to solve
the All Pairs Shortest Paths for All Flows (APSP-AF) problem in
$O(\sqrt{d}n^{(\omega+9)/4})$ time, where $d$ is the number of distinct edge
capacities. We also discuss real life applications for these new problems.
