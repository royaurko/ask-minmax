We propose the measurement of the elliptic flow of hadron resonances at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider as a tool to probe the amount of hadronic final
state interactions for resonances at intermediate and large transverse momenta.
This can be achieved by looking at systematic deviations of the measured flow
coefficient $v_2$ from the scaling law given by the quark recombination
formalism. Our method can be generalized to explore the structure of exotic
particles, such as the recently found pentaquark $\Theta^+ (1540)$.
