Rapid fluctuation with a frequency dependence of $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha
\simeq 1 - 2$) is characteristic of radiation from black-hole objects. Its
origin remains poorly understood. We examine the three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation data, finding that a magnetized
accretion disk exhibits both $1/f^\alpha$ fluctuation (with $\alpha \simeq 2$)
and a fractal magnetic structure (with the fractal dimension of $D \sim 1.9$).
The fractal field configuration leads reconnection events with a variety of
released energy and of duration, thereby producing $1/f^\alpha$ fluctuations.
