The complexity of round robin method of intraprocedural data flow analysis is
measured in number of iterations over the control flow graph. Existing
complexity bounds realistically explain the complexity of only Bit-vector
frameworks which are separable. In this paper we define the complexity bounds
for non-separable frameworks by quantifying the interdependences among the data
flow information of program entities using an Entity Dependence Graph.
