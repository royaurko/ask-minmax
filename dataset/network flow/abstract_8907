It is shown using numerical simulations that flow patterns around an obstacle
potential moving in a superfluid exhibit hysteresis. In a certain velocity
region, there is a bistability between stationary laminar flow and periodic
vortex shedding. The bistability exists in two and three dimensional systems.
