One of the most applied learning in virtual spaces is using E-Learning

subject is the most positive feedback from E-Learning systems. In this paper,
we introduce a new methodology of E-Learning systems entitle "Network Learning"
with review of another aspects of E-Learning systems. Also, we present benefits

Network Learning can be programmable for every education system and it is
