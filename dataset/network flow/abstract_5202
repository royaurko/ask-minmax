Adequate knowledge of the nature of river flow process is crucial for proper
planning and management of our water resources and environment. This study
attempts to detect the salient characteristics of flow dynamics of the Karoon
River in Iran. Daily discharge series observed over a period of six years
(1999-2004) is analyzed to examine the chaotic and scaling characteristics of
the flow dynamics. The presence of chaos is investigated through the
correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponent methods, while the Hurst exponent
and R\'enyi dimension analyses are performed to explore the scaling
characteristics. The low correlation dimension ($2.60 \pm 0.07$) and the
positive largest Lyapunov exponent ($0.014 \pm 0.001$) suggest the presence of
low-dimensional chaos; they also imply that the flow dynamics are dominantly
governed by three variables and can be reliably predicted up to 48 days (i.e.
prediction horizon). Results from the Hurst exponent and R\'enyi dimension
analyses reveal the multifractal character of the flow dynamics, with
persistent and anti-persistent behaviors observed at different time scales.
