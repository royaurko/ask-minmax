We study the short-time asymptotical behavior of stochastic flows on
\mathbb{R} in the \sup-norm. The results are stated in terms of a Gaussian
process associated with the covariation of the flow. In case the Gaussian
process has a continuous version the two processes can be coupled in such a way
that the difference is uniformly $o(\ln\ln t^{-1})$. In case it has no
continuous version, an $O(\ln\ln t^{-1})$ estimate is obtained under mild
regularity assumptions. The main tools are Gaussian measure concentration and a
martingale version of the Slepian comparison principle.
