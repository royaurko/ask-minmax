After showing how to prove the integrated c-theorem within the functional RG
framework based on the effective average action, we derive an exact RG flow
equation for Zamolodchikov's c-function in two dimensions by relating it to the
flow of the effective average action. In order to obtain a non-trivial flow for
the c-function, we will need to understand the general form of the effective
average action away from criticality, where nonlocal invariants, with beta
functions as coefficients, must be included in the ansatz to be consistent. We
then apply our construction to several examples: exact results, local potential
approximation and loop expansion. In each case we construct the relative
approximate c-function and find it to be consistent with Zamolodchikov's
c-theorem. Finally, we present a relation between the c-function and the
(matter induced) beta function of Newton's constant, allowing us to use heat
kernel techniques to compute the RG running of the c-function.
