The purpose of this note is to analyze the long term stability of the
Navier-Stokes equations supplemented with the Coriolis force and the
stress-free boundary condition. It is shown that, if the flow domain is
axisymmetric, spurious stability behaviors can occur depending whether the
Coriolis force is active or not.
