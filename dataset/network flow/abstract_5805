This paper deals with a new model for clonal network dynamics. We describe in
detail this model and derive special equations governing immune system dynamics
based on the general gradient type principles that can be inherent to a wide
class of real living objects. A special clonal network is modeled by two
symmetric projector matrix variables simultaneously taking into account both
asymmetry of the interaction to each other and adaptation states that can be
realized owing to possible idiotypic clonal suppresions. We perform computer
simulations of the model dynamics for some simple cases of relatively low
dimension, paying special attention to the dynamics of amounts of activated
receptor strings within clonal network.
