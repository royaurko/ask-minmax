Synchrony is one of the most common dynamical states emerging on networks.
The speed of convergence towards synchrony provides a fundamental collective
time scale for synchronizing systems. Here we study the asymptotic
synchronization times for directed networks with topologies ranging from
completely ordered, grid-like, to completely disordered, random, including
intermediate, partially disordered topologies. We extend the approach of Master
Stability Functions to quantify synchronization times. We find that the
synchronization times strongly and systematically depend on the network
topology. In particular, at fixed in-degree, stronger topological randomness
induces faster synchronization, whereas at fixed path length, synchronization
is slowest for intermediate randomness in the small-world regime. Randomly
rewiring real-world neural, social and transport networks confirms this
picture.
