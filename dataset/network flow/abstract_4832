A fundamental tool in the analysis of Ricci flow is a compactness result of
Hamilton in the spirit of the work of Cheeger, Gromov and others. Roughly
speaking it allows one to take a sequence of Ricci flows with uniformly bounded
curvature and uniformly controlled injectivity radius, and extract a
subsequence that converges to a complete limiting Ricci flow. A widely quoted
extension of this result allows the curvature to be bounded uniformly only in a
local sense. However, in this note we give a counterexample.
