We study the velocity dispersion profiles of the nuclei of NGC 1326, 2685,
5273 and 5838 in the CO first overtone band. There is evidence for a black hole
(BH) in NGC 1326 and 5838. Gas is seen flowing out of the nuclear region of NGC
5273. We put upper limits on the nuclear BHs responsible for its activity and
that of NGC 2685.
