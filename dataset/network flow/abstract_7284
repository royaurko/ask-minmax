In this paper, we present counter-intuitive examples for the multiclass
queueing network system. In the system, each station may serve more than one
job class with differentiated service priority, and each job may require
service sequentially by more than one service station. In our examples, the
network performance is improved even when more workloads are admitted for
service.
