Due to strong interactions between superfluid particles, many particles are
not in the condensate near absolute zero. In nonequilibrium situations produced
under external stirring, they contribute to the flow via their induced average
macroscopic motion. We present a modification of the Bose condensate model that
considers this induced internal motion. Specifically, we show that the velocity
field of the internal motion acts as a gauge field with which the condensate
interacts, thereby coupling the applied vorticity to the superflow. The
resulting Ginzburg-Landau-like model predicts the flow phenomena observed near
absolute zero, in particular, transition to turbulence.
