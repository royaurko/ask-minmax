The aim of this study is to present a reliable combination of the
differential transformation method (DTM) and Pad\'e approximants to make, for
the first time, a semi-analytic analysis of the problem of free convection
boundary-layer flow over a vertical plate as produced by a body force about a
flat plate in the direction of the generating body force. Boundary conditions
in an unbounded domain, i.e. boundary condition at infinity, pose a problem in
general for the numerical solution methods. Without using Pad\'e approximation,
the semi-analytical solution obtained by the DTM cannot satisfy infinity
boundary conditions. The obtained results are in good agreement with those
provided previously by the iterative numerical method. As a result, without
taking or estimating missing boundary conditions, the DTM-Pad\'e method
provides a simple, non-iterative and effective way for determining the
solutions of nonlinear free convection boundary layer problems possessing the
boundary conditions at infinity.
