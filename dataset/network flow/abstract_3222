Within the framework of a relativistic transport model (ART) for heavy-ion
collisions at AGS energies, we study the transverse flow of pions with respect
to that of nucleons using two complementary approaches. It is found that in
central collisions pions develop a weak flow as a result of the flow of baryon
resonances from which they are produced. On the other hand, they have a weak
antiflow in peripheral collisions due to the shadowing of spectators.
Furthermore, it is shown that both pion flow and antiflow are dominated by
those with large transverse momenta.
