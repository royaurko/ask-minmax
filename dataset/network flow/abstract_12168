We propose a new platform for implementing secure wireless ad hoc networks.
Our proposal is based on a modular architecture, with the software stack
constructed directly on the Ethernet layer. Within our platform we use a new
security protocol that we designed to ensure mutual authentication between
nodes and a secure key exchange. The correctness of the proposed security
protocol is ensured by Guttman's authentication tests.
