We present a novel model to simulate real social networks of complex
interactions, based in a granular system of colliding particles (agents). The
network is build by keeping track of the collisions and evolves in time with
correlations which emerge due to the mobility of the agents. Therefore,
statistical features are a consequence only of local collisions among its
individual agents. Agent dynamics is realized by an event-driven algorithm of
collisions where energy is gained as opposed to granular systems which have
dissipation. The model reproduces empirical data from networks of sexual
interactions, not previously obtained with other approaches.
