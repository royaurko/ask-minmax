We consider a wireless network where each flow (instead of each link) runs
its own CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) algorithm. Specifically, each flow
attempts to access the radio channel after some random time and transmits a
packet if the channel is sensed idle. We prove that, unlike the standard CSMA
algorithm, this simple distributed access scheme is optimal in the sense that
the network is stable for all traffic intensities in the capacity region of the
network.
