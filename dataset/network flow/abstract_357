Braess \cite{1} has been studied about a traffic flow on a diamond type
network and found that introducing new edges to the networks always does not
achieve the efficiency. Some researchers studied the Braess' paradox in similar
type networks by introducing various types of cost functions. But whether such
paradox occurs or not is not scarcely studied in complex networks except for
Dorogovtsev-Mendes network\cite{2}. In this article, we study the paradox on
Ladder type networks, as the first step to the research about Braess' paradox
on Watts and Strogatz type small world network\cite{Watt1}\cite{Watt2}. %We
theoretically and numerically studied Braess' paradox on Ladder networks. For
the purpose, we construct $4 \times 3$ models as extensions of the original
Braess' models. We analyze theoretically and numerically studied the models on
Ladder networks. Last we give a phase diagram for (a) model, where the cost
functions of bypasses are constant =0 or flow, base on two parameters $r$ and
$p$ by numerical simulations. Simulation experiments also show some conditions
that paradox can not occur. These facts give some sugestions for designing
effective transportation networks.
