We study the $C^{*}$-algebra $\mathcal{A}_{n,\theta}$ generated by the Anzai
flow on the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$. It is proved that this
algebra is a simple quotient of the group $C^{*}$-algebra of a lattice subgroup
$\mathfrak{D}_n$ of a $(n+2)$-dimensional connected simply connected nilpotent
Lie group $F_n$ whose corresponding Lie algebra is the generic filiform Lie
algebra $\mathfrak{f}_{n}$. Other simple infinite dimensional quotients of
$C^{*}(\mathfrak{D}_n)$ are also characterized and represented as matrix
algebras over simple affine Furstenberg transformation group $C^*$-algebras of
the lower dimensional tori. The $K$-groups of the $\mathcal{A}_{n,\theta}$ and
other simple quotients of $C^{*}(\mathfrak{D}_n)$ are studied, the
Pimsner-Voiculescu 6-term exact sequence being a useful tool. The rank of the
$K$-groups of $\mathcal{A}_{n,\theta}$ is studied as explicitly as possible,
and is proved to be the same as for more general transformation group
$C^*$-algebras of $\mathbb{T}^n$ including the Furstenberg transformation group
\text{$C^*$-algebras} $A_{F_{f,\theta}}$. An error (about these $K$-groups) in
the literature is addressed.
