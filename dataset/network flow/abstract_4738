This paper introduces the notions of vector field and flow on a general
differentiable stack. Our main theorem states that the flow of a vector field
on a compact proper differentiable stack exists and is unique up to a uniquely
determined 2-cell. This extends the usual result on the existence and
uniqueness of flows on a manifold as well as the contributor's existing results for
orbifolds. It sets the scene for a discussion of Morse Theory on a general
proper stack and also paves the way for the categorification of other key
aspects of differential geometry such as the tangent bundle and the Lie algebra
of vector fields.
