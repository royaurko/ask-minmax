Preserving security and confidentiality in wireless sensor networks (WSN) are
crucial. Wireless sensor networks in comparison with wired networks are more
substantially vulnerable to attacks and intrusions. In WSN, a third person can
eavesdrop to the information or link to the network. So, preventing these
intrusions by detecting them has become one of the most demanding challenges.
This paper, proposes an improved watchdog technique as an effective technique
for detecting malicious nodes based on a power aware hierarchical model. This
technique overcomes the common problems in the original Watchdog mechanism. The
main purpose to present this model is reducing the power consumption as a key
factor for increasing the network's lifetime. For this reason, we simulated our
model with Tiny-OS simulator and then, compared our results with non
hierarchical model to ensure the improvement. The results indicate that, our
proposed model is better in performance than the original models and it has
increased the lifetime of the wireless sensor nodes by around 2611.492 seconds
for a network with 100 sensors.
