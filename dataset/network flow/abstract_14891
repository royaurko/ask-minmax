Using the recently established classification of 6D SCFTs we present evidence
for the existence of families of weak C-functions, that is, quantities which
decrease in a flow from the UV to the IR. Introducing a background R-symmetry
field strength R and a non-trivial tangent bundle T on the 6D spacetime, we
consider C-functions given by the linear combinations C = m1 alpha + m2 beta +
m3 gamma, where alpha, beta and gamma are the anomaly polynomial coefficients
for the formal characteristic classes c2(R)^2, c2(R)p1(T) and p1(T)^2. By
performing a detailed sweep over many theories, we determine the shape of the
unbounded monotonic region in "m-space" compatible with both Higgs branch flows
and tensor branch flows. We also verify that --as expected-- the Euler density
conformal anomaly falls in the admissible region.
