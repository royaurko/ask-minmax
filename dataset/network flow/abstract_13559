We introduce thermometers to define the local temperature of an electronic
system driven out-of-equilibrium by local ac fields. We discuss the behavior of
the local temperature along the sample, showing that it exhibits spatial
fluctuations following an oscillatory pattern. We show explicitly that the
local temperature is the correct indicator for heat flow.
