The importance of studying properties of networks is manifest in diverse
fields ranging from biology, engineering, physics, chemistry, neuroscience, and
medicine. The functionality of networks with regard to performance, throughput,
reliability and robustness is strongly linked to the underlying geometric and
topological properties of the network and this is the focus of this paper,
especially as applied to certain biological networks. The fundamental
mathematical abstraction of a network as a weighted graph brings to bear the
tools of graph theory--a highly developed subject of mathematical research. But
more importantly, recently proposed geometric notions of curvature on very
general metric measure spaces allow us to utilize a whole new set of tools and
ideas that help quantify functionality and robustness of graphs. In particular,
robustness is closely connected to network entropy which, in turn, is very
closely related to curvature. We will see that there are a number of
alternative notions of discrete curvature that are compatible with the
classical Riemannian definition, each having its own advantages and
disadvantages, and are relevant to networks of interest. We will concentrate on
the role of curvature for certain key cancer networks in order to
quantitatively indicate their apparent functional robustness relative to their
normal counterparts.
