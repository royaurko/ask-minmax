Combining cognitive radio technology with user cooperation could be
advantageous to both primary and secondary transmissions. In this paper, we
propose a first relaying scheme for cognitive radio networks (called "Adaptive
relaying scheme 1"), where one relay node can assist the primary or the
secondary transmission with the objective of improving the outage probability
of the secondary transmission with respect to a primary outage probability
threshold. Upper bound expressions of the secondary outage probability using
the proposed scheme are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical and
simulation results show that the secondary outage probability using the
proposed scheme is lower than that of other relaying schemes. Then, we extend
the proposed scheme to the case where the relay node has the ability to decode
both the primary and secondary signals and also can assist simultaneously both
transmissions. Simulations show the performance improvement that can be
obtained due to this extension in terms of secondary outage probability.
