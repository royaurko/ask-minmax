AdS-hydrodynamics has proven to be a useful tool for obtaining transport
coefficients observed in the collective flow of strongly coupled fluids like
quark gluon plasma (QGP). Particularly, the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy
density ${\eta/ s}$ obtained from elliptic flow measurements can be matched
with the computation done in the dual gravity theory. The experimentally
observed temperature dependence of ${\eta/ s}$ requires the study of scalar
matter coupled AdS gravity including higher derivative curvature corrections.
We obtain the backreaction to the metric for such a matter coupled AdS gravity
in $D$-dimensional spacetime due to the higher derivative curvature
corrections. Then, we present the backreaction corrections to shear-viscosity
$\eta$ and entropy density $s$.
