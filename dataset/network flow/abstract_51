In this paper we study minimum cut and maximum flow problems on planar
graphs, both in static and in dynamic settings. First, we present an algorithm
that given an undirected planar graph computes the minimum cut between any two
given vertices in O(n log log n) time. Second, we show how to achieve the same
O(n log log n) bound for the problem of computing maximum flows in undirected
planar graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms for
those two problems that break the O(n log n) barrier, which has been standing
for more than 25 years. Third, we present a fully dynamic algorithm that is
able to maintain information about minimum cuts and maximum flows in a plane
graph (i.e., a planar graph with a fixed embedding): our algorithm is able to
insert edges, delete edges and answer min-cut and max-flow queries between any
pair of vertices in O(n^(2/3) log^3 n) time per operation. This result is based
on a new dynamic shortest path algorithm for planar graphs which may be of
independent interest. We remark that this is the first known non-trivial
algorithm for min-cut and max-flow problems in a dynamic setting.
