Research on extracting science from binary-black-hole (BBH) simulations has
often adopted a "scattering matrix" perspective: given the binary's initial
parameters, what are the final hole's parameters and the emitted gravitational
waveform? In contrast, we are using BBH simulations to explore the nonlinear
dynamics of curved spacetime. Focusing on the head-on plunge, merger, and
ringdown of a BBH with transverse, antiparallel spins, we explore numerically
the momentum flow between the holes and the surrounding spacetime. We use the
Landau-Lifshitz field-theory-in-flat-spacetime formulation of general
relativity to define and compute the density of field energy and field momentum
outside horizons and the energy and momentum contained within horizons, and we
define the effective velocity of each apparent and event horizon as the ratio
of its enclosed momentum to its enclosed mass-energy. We find surprisingly good
agreement between the horizons' effective and coordinate velocities. To
investigate the gauge dependence of our results, we compare pseudospectral and
moving-puncture evolutions of physically similar initial data; although
spectral and puncture simulations use different gauge conditions, we find
remarkably good agreement for our results in these two cases. We also compare
our simulations with the post-Newtonian trajectories and near-field
energy-momentum. [Abstract abbreviated; full abstract also mentions additional
