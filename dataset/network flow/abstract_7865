Glassy polymers show strain hardening: at constant extensional load, their
flow first accelerates, then arrests. Recent experiments have found this to be
accompanied by a striking and unexplained dip in the segmental relaxation time.
Here we explain such behavior by combining a minimal model of flow-induced
liquefaction of a glass, with a description of the stress carried by strained
polymers, creating a non-factorable interplay between aging and strain-induced
rejuvenation. Under constant load, liquefaction of segmental motion permits
strong flow that creates polymer-borne stress. This slows the deformation
enough for the segmental modes to re-vitrify, causing strain hardening.
