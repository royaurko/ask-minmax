We study spectra of directed networks with inhibitory and excitatory
couplings. We investigate in particular eigenvector localization properties of
various model networks for different value of correlation among their entries.
Spectra of random networks, with completely uncorrelated entries show a
circular distribution with delocalized eigenvectors, where as networks with
correlated entries have localized eigenvectors. In order to understand the
origin of localization we track the spectra as a function of connection
probability and directionality. As connections are made directed, eigenstates
start occurring in complex conjugate pairs and the eigenvalue distribution
combined with the localization measure shows a rich pattern. Moreover, for a
very well distinguished community structure, the whole spectrum is localized
except few eigenstates at boundary of the circular distribution. As the network
deviates from the community structure there is a sudden change in the
localization property for a very small value of deformation from the perfect
community structure. We search for this effect for the whole range of
correlation strengths and for different community configurations. Furthermore,
we investigate spectral properties of a metabolic network of zebrafish, and
compare them with those of the model networks.
