Security is a key feature in Wireless Sensor Networks but they are prone to
many kinds of attacks and one of them is Black Hole Attack. In a black hole
attack all the packets are consecutively dropped which leads to the decrease in
the efficiency of the network and unnecessary wastage of battery life. In this
paper, we propose an exponential trust based mechanism to detect the malicious
node. In the proposed method a Streak counter is deployed to store the
consecutive number of packets dropped and a trust factor is maintained for each
node. The trust factor drops exponentially with each consecutive packet dropped
which helps in detecting the malicious node. The proposed method show a drastic
decrease in the number of packets dropped before the node being detected as a
malicious node.
