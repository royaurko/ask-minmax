Using the vortex filament model and the Gross Pitaevskii nonlinear
Schroedinger equation, we show that bundles of quantised vortex lines in helium
II are structurally robust and can reconnect with each other maintaining their
identity. We discuss vortex stretching in superfluid turbulence and show that,
during the bundle reconnection process, Kelvin waves of large amplitude are
generated, in agreement with the finding that helicity is produced by nearly
singular vortex interactions in classical Euler flows.
