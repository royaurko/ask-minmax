We analyze experimentally chemical waves propagation in the disordered flow
field of a porous medium. The reaction fronts travel at a constant velocity
which drastically depends on the mean flow direction and rate. The fronts may
propagate either downstream and upstream but, surprisingly, they remain static
over a range of flow rate values. Resulting from the competition between the
chemical reaction and the disordered flow field, these frozen fronts display a
particular sawtooth shape. The frozen regime is likely to be associated with
front pinning in low velocity zones, the number of which varies with the ratio
of the mean flow and the chemical front velocities.
