We study the direct enstrophy cascade in a two-dimensional flow generated in
an electromagnetically driven thin layer of fluid. Due to the presence of
bottom friction, the energy spectrum deviates from the classical Kraichnan
prediction $k^{-3}$. We find that the correction to the spectral slope depends
on the thickness on the layer, in agreement with a theoretical prediction based
on the analogy with passive scalar statistics.
