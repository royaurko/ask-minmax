We present experimental data on directed flow in semi-central Au+Au
collisions at incident energies from 90 to 400 A MeV. For the first time for
this energy domain, the data are presented in a transverse momentum
differential way. We study the first order Fourier coefficient v1 for different
particle species and establish a gradual change of its patterns as a function
of incident energy and for different regions in rapidity.
