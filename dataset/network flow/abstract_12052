We investigate the impact of bistability in the emergence of synchronization
in networks of chaotic maps with delayed coupling. The existence of a single
finite attractor of the uncoupled map is found to be responsible for the
emergence of synchronization. No synchronization is observed when the local
dynamics has two competing chaotic attractors whose orbits are dense on the
same interval. This result is robust for regular networks with variable ranges
of interaction and for more complex topologies.
