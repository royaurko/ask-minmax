The use of mobile sensors is of great relevance for a number of strategic
applications devoted to monitoring critical areas where sensors can not be
deployed manually. In these networks, each sensor adapts its position on the
basis of a local evaluation of the coverage efficiency, thus permitting an
autonomous deployment.
  Several algorithms have been proposed to deploy mobile sensors over the area
of interest. The applicability of these approaches largely depends on a proper
formalization of rigorous rules to coordinate sensor movements, solve local
conflicts and manage possible failures of communications and devices.
  In this paper we introduce P&P, a communication protocol that permits a
correct and efficient coordination of sensor movements in agreement with the
PUSH&PULL algorithm. We deeply investigate and solve the problems that may
occur when coordinating asynchronous local decisions in the presence of an
unreliable transmission medium and possibly faulty devices such as in the
typical working scenario of mobile sensor networks.
  Simulation results show the performance of our protocol under a range of
operative settings, including conflict situations, irregularly shaped target
areas, and node failures.
