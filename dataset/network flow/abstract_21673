Nonperturbative effects in event shape distributions can be characterized by
shape functions derived in the eikonal approximation or, equivalently, from
soft-collinear effective theory. The use of energy flow operators and the boost
invariance of the Wilson lines of soft gluons in the shape functions leads to a
proof of universality for power corrections to the mean values of event shapes,
without invoking the single gluon approximation.
