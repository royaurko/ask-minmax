The Ward-Takahashi (WT) identities for incompressible flow implied by
Galilean invariance are derived for the randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation
(NSE), in which both the mean and fluctuating velocity components are
explicitly present. The consequences of Galilean invariance for the vertex
renormalization are drawn from this identity.
