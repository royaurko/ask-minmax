We study the phase synchronization of Kuramoto's oscillators in small parts
of networks known as motifs. We first report on the system dynamics for the
case of a scale-free network and show the existence of a non-trivial critical
point. We compute the probability that network motifs synchronize, and find
that the fitness for synchronization correlates well with motif's
interconnectedness and structural complexity. Possible implications for present
debates about network evolution in biological and other systems are discussed.
