We calculate the triangular flow parameter $v_3$ of thermal photons for
0--40\% central collisions of Pb nuclei at LHC using an event-by-event
hydrodynamic model with fluctuating initial conditions. Thermal photon $v_3$
with respect to the the participant plane angle is found to be positive and
significant compared to the elliptic flow parameter $v_2$ of thermal photons.
In addition, photon $v_3$ as a function of $p_T$ shows similar qualitative
nature to photon $v_2$ in the region $1< p_T <6$ GeV/$c$. We argue that while
$v_3$ originates from $\epsilon_3$ deformations of the initial state density
distribution, fast buildup of radial flow due to fluctuations is the main
driving mechanism for the observed large value.
