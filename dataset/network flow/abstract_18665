The fundamental aim of clustering algorithms is to partition data points. We
consider tasks where the discovered partition is allowed to vary with some
covariate such as space or time. One approach would be to use
fragmentation-coagulation processes, but these, being Markov processes, are
restricted to linear or tree structured covariate spaces. We define a
partition-valued process on an arbitrary covariate space using Gaussian
processes. We use the process to construct a multitask clustering model which
partitions datapoints in a similar way across multiple data sources, and a time
series model of network data which allows cluster assignments to vary over
time. We describe sampling algorithms for inference and apply our method to
defining cancer subtypes based on different types of cellular characteristics,
finding regulatory modules from gene expression data from multiple human
populations, and discovering time varying community structure in a social
network.
