We present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of nonaxisymmetric gas
flow past a gravitating compact object in two dimensions. Calculations were
performed with uniform flow as well as with transverse velocity and density
gradients. We find that the flow is highly nonsteady, exhibiting the
``flip-flop'' behavior seen in previous studies in which accretion disks form
with alternating directions of rotation. We investigate the periodicity of the
flip-flop behavior, and study the effects of spatial resolution on the results.
We find that the flip-flop motion creates accretion torques which, in some
cases, may be large enough to explain the erratic spin behavior observed in
some massive X-ray pulsars.
