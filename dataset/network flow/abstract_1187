For a general class of flows on polytopes, which include many examples from
Evolutionary Game Theory, we describe a method to encapsulate the asymptotic
dynamics of the flow along the heteroclinic network formed by the polytope's
edges. Using this technique we give sufficient conditions for the existence of
normally hyperbolic stable and unstable manifolds associated to heteroclinic
cycles along the polytope's edges. These results are illustrated in a
polymatrix replicator model.
