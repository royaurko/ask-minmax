This paper discusses the challenges of the Internet of Things programming.
Sensing and data gathering from the various sources are often the key elements
of applications for Smart Cities. So, the effective programming models for them
are very important. In this article, we discuss system software models and
solutions, rather than network related aspects. In our paper, we present the
web-based domain-specific language for Internet of Things applications. Our
goal is to present the modern models for data processing in Internet of Things
and Smart Cities applications. In our view, the use of this kind of tools
should seriously reduce the time to develop new applications.
