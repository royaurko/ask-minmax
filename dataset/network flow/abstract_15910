A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a group of mobile nodes that can be set up
randomly and formed without the need of any existing network infrastructure or
centralized administration. In this network the mobile devices are dependent on
battery power, it is important to minimize their energy consumption. Also
storage capacity and power are severely limited. In situations such as
emergency rescue, military actions, and scientific field missions, energy
conservation plays an even more important role which is critical to the success
of the tasks performed by the network. Therefore, energy conservation should be
considered carefully when designing or evaluating ad hoc routing protocols. In
this paper we concentrated on the energy consumption issues of existing routing
protocols in MANET under various mobility models and whose connections
communicate in a particular traffic model (CBR, Exponential, and Pareto). This
paper describes a performance comparison of the AODV, DSR and DSDV routing
protocols in term of energy consumed due to packet type (routing/MAC) during
transmission and reception of control packets. The mobility models used in this
work are Random Waypoint, Manhattan Grid and Reference Point Group. Simulations
have been carried out using NS-2 and its associated tools for animation and
analysis of results.
