The dynamics of decisions in complex networks is studied within a Markov
process framework using numerical simulations combined with mathematical
insight into the process mechanisms. A mathematical discrete-time model is
derived based on a set of basic assumptions on the convincing mechanisms
associated to two opinions. The model is analyzed with respect to multiplicity
of critical points, illustrating in this way the main behavior to be expected
in the network. Particular interest is focussed on the effect of social network
and exogenous mass media-based influences on the decision behavior. A set of
numerical simulation results is provided illustrating how these mechanisms
impact the final decision results. The analysis reveals (i) the presence of
fixed-point multiplicity (with a maximum of four different fixed points),
multistability, and sensitivity with respect to process parameters, and (ii)
that mass media have a strong impact on the decision behavior.
