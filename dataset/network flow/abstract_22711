We give a self-contained and elementary proof for boundedness, existence, and
uniqueness of solutions to dynamic programming principles (DPP) for biased
tug-of-war games with running costs. The domain we work in is very general, and
as a special case contains metric spaces. Technically, we introduce game-trees
and show that a discretized flow converges uniformly, from which we obtain not
only the existence, but also the uniqueness. Our arguments are entirely
deterministic, and also do not rely on (semi-)continuity in any way; in
particular, we do not need to mollify the DPP at the boundary for
well-posedness.
