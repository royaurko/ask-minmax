The overall performance of a distributed system is highly dependent on the
communication efficiency of the system. Although network resources (links,
bandwidth) are becoming increasingly more available, the communication
performance of data transfers involving large volumes of data does not
necessarily improve at the same rate. This is due to the inefficient usage of
the available network resources. A solution to this problem consists of data
transfer scheduling techniques, which manage and allocate the network resources
in an efficient manner. In this paper we present several online and offline
data transfer optimization techniques, in the context of a centrally controlled
distributed system.
