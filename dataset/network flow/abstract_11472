In this work, we propose and study optimal proactive resource allocation and
demand shaping for data networks. Motivated by the recent findings on the
predictability of human behavior patterns in data networks, and the emergence
of highly capable handheld devices, our design aims to smooth out the network
traffic over time and minimize the data delivery costs.
  Our framework utilizes proactive data services as well as smart content
recommendation schemes for shaping the demand. Proactive data services take
place during the off-peak hours based on a statistical prediction of a demand
profile for each user, whereas smart content recommendation assigns modified
valuations to data items so as to render the users' demand less uncertain.
Hence, our recommendation scheme aims to boost the performance of proactive
services within the allowed flexibility of user requirements. We conduct
theoretical performance analysis that quantifies the leveraged cost reduction
through the proposed framework. We show that the cost reduction scales at the
same rate as the cost function scales with the number of users. Further, we
prove that \emph{demand shaping} through smart recommendation strictly reduces
the incurred cost even below that of proactive downloads without
recommendation.
