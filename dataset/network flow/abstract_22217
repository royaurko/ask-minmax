Metamaterials have been already used to model various exotic "optical
spaces". Here we demonstrate that mapping of monochromatic extraordinary light
distribution in a hyperbolic metamaterial along some spatial direction may
model the "flow of time". This idea is illustrated in experiments performed
with plasmonic hyperbolic metamaterials. Appearance of the "statistical arrow
of time" is examined in an experimental scenario which emulates a Big Bang-like
event.
