We use the Metropolis algorithm to study the stability of superfluid flow in
a model system, namely the two-dimensional planar XY model. Flow properties are
examined by studying the behaviour of the system in meta-stable ``twisted''
states. We demonstrate the stability of superfluidity in this model and we
discuss the Meissner effect and velocity quantization. We also study the
critical velocity and dissipation by vortex creation and rotational flow and
their dependence on the geometry of the system. An expression for the average
superfluid velocity as a function of time, ${\bar v}_s(t)$, is obtained and
compared with experimental results.
