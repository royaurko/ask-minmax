All-Optical Network (AON) is a network where the user-network interface is
optical and the data does undergo optical to electrical conversion within the
network. AONs are attractive because they promise very high rates, flexible
switching and broad application support. There are two technologies for AON:
Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) and Optical Time Division Multiplexed
(OTDM). OTDM transmission systems are becoming increasingly important as one of
the key technologies satisfying the growing demand for large capacity optical
networks. Although OTDM has several advantages in terms of operation system,
such as natural accommodation of higher bit rate payloads, it introduces many
security vulnerabilities, which do not exist in traditional networks. One of
the serious problems with OTDM is the fact that optical crosstalk is additive,
and thus the aggregate effect of crosstalk over a whole all-optical network
(AON) may be more nefarious than a single point of crosstalk. This is because
crosstalk can spread rapidly through the network, causing additional awkward
failures and triggering multiple undesirable alarms. This results in the
continuous monitoring and identification of the impairments becoming
challenging in the event of transmission failures. In this paper we propose a
novel approach for detecting and localizing crosstalk in OTDM transmission
systems that can participate in some tasks for fault management in optical
network.
