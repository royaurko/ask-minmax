Given any finite and closed chemical reaction system, it is possible to
efficiently determine whether or not it contains a `self-sustaining and
collectively autocatalytic' subset of reactions, and to find such subsets when
they exist. However, for systems that are potentially open-ended (for example,
when no prescribed upper bound is placed on the complexity or size/length of
molecules types), the theory developed for the finite case breaks down. We
investigate a number of subtleties that arise in such systems that are absent
in the finite setting, and present several new results.
