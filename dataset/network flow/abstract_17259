In this work, we aim to evaluate different Distributed Lock Management
service designs with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). In specific, we
implement and evaluate the centralized and the RDMA-enabled lock manager
designs for fast network settings. Experimental results confirms a couple of
hypotheses. First, in the traditional centralized lock manager design, CPU is
the bottleneck and bypassing CPU on client-to-server communication using RDMA
results in better lock service perofrmance. Second, different lock manager
designs with RDMA in consideration result in even better performance; we need
to re-design lock management system for RDMA and fast networks.
