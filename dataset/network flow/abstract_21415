We review observational tests for the homogeneity of the Universe on large
scales. Redshift and peculiar velocity surveys, radio sources, the X-Ray
Background, the Lyman-alpha forest and the Cosmic Microwave Background are used
to set constraints on inhomogeneous models and in particular on fractal-like
models.
 Assuming the Cosmological Principle and the FRW metric, we estimate
cosmological parameters by joint analysis of peculiar velocities, the CMB,
cluster abundance, IRAS and Supernovae.
 Under certain assumptions the best fit density parameter is Omega_m = 1 -
lambda = 0.3-0.5.
