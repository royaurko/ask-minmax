The ideas of optimization of learning algorithms in Artificial Neural
Networks are reviewed emphasizing generic properties and the online
implementations are interpreted from a biological perspective. A simple model
of the relevant subsidiary variables needed to improve learning in artificial
feedforward networks and the `time ordering' of the appearance of the
respective information processing systems is proposed. We discuss the
possibility that these results might be relevant in other contexts, not being
restricted to the simple models from which they stem. The analysis of a few
examples, which range from the lowest cellular scale to the macroscopic level,
suggests that similar ideas could be applied to biological systems.
