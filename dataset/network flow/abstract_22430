Quenching of gluonic jets and heavy quark production in Au+Au collisions at
RHIC can be understood within the pQCD based 3+1 dimensional parton transport
model BAMPS including pQCD bremsstrahlung $2 \leftrightarrow 3$ processes.
Furthermore, the development of conical structures induced by gluonic jets is
investigated in a static box for the regimes of small and large dissipation.
