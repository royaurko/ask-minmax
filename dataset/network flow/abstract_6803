We describe 2D gasdynamical models of jets that carry mass as well as energy
to the hot gas in galaxy clusters. These flows have many attractive attributes
for solving the galaxy cluster cooling flow problem: Why the hot gas
temperature and density profiles resemble cooling flows but show no spectral
evidence of cooling to low temperatures. Using an approximate model for the
cluster A1795, we show that mass-carrying jets can reduce the overall cooling
rate to or below the low values implied by X-ray spectra. Biconical
subrelativistic jets, described with several ad hoc parameters, are assumed to
be activated when gas flows toward or cools near a central supermassive black
hole. As the jets proceed out from the center they entrain more and more
ambient gas. The jets lose internal pressure by expansion and are compressed by
the ambient cluster gas, becoming rather difficult to observe. For a wide
variety of initial jet parameters and several feedback scenarios the global
cooling can be suppressed for many Gyrs while maintaining cluster temperature
profiles similar to those observed. The intermittancy of the feedback generates
multiple generations of X-ray cavities similar to those observed in the Perseus
Cluster and elsewhere.
