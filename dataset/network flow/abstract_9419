It is widely accepted that the complex dynamics characteristic of recurrent
neural circuits contributes in a fundamental manner to brain function. Progress
has been slow in understanding and exploiting the computational power of
recurrent dynamics for two main reasons: nonlinear recurrent networks often
exhibit chaotic behavior and most known learning rules do not work in robust
fashion in recurrent networks. Here we address both these problems by
demonstrating how random recurrent networks (RRN) that initially exhibit
chaotic dynamics can be tuned through a supervised learning rule to generate
locally stable neural patterns of activity that are both complex and robust to
noise. The outcome is a novel neural network regime that exhibits both
transiently stable and chaotic trajectories. We further show that the recurrent
learning rule dramatically increases the ability of RRNs to generate complex
spatiotemporal motor patterns, and accounts for recent experimental data
showing a decrease in neural variability in response to stimulus onset.
