In wireless networks with random node distribution, the underlying point
process model and the channel fading process are usually considered separately.
A unified framework is introduced that permits the geometric characterization
of fading by incorporating the fading process into the point process model.
Concretely, assuming nodes are distributed in a stationary Poisson point
process in $\R^d$, the properties of the point processes that describe the path
loss with fading are analyzed. The main applications are connectivity and
broadcasting.
