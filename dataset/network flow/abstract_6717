Over the years, computer vision researchers have spent an immense amount of
effort on designing image features for visual object recognition tasks. We
propose to leverage this valuable experience to guide the task of training deep
neural networks. Specifically, we propose a new unsupervised pretraining method
for deep neural networks. Our idea is to pretrain the network through the task
of replicating classic hand-designed features. By learning to replicate these
features, the deep network integrates previous research knowledge and learns to
model visual objects in a way similar to the hand-designed features. In the
succeeding finetuning step, it further learns object-specific representations
from labeled data and this boosts its classification power. We demonstrate the
application of our method on the pedestrian detection task. We pretrain two
deep convolutional neural networks where one replicates the histogram of
oriented gradients feature, and the other replicates the region covariance
feature. After finetuning, we achieve substantially better performance than
those networks pretrained using existing methods.
