Epidemic dynamics in a stochastic network of interacting epidemic centers is
considered. The epidemic and migration processes are modelled by Markov's
chains. Explicit formulas for probability distribution of the migration process
are derived. Dependence of outbreak parameters on initial parameters,
population, coupling parameters is examined analytically and numerically. The
mean field approximation for a general migration process is derived. An
approximate method allowing computation of statistical moments for networks
with highly populated centres is proposed and tested numerically.
