We extend the volume of fluid method for the computation of two-phase flow to
a higher order accurate method in two dimensions. The interface reconstruction
by the PLIC method is thereby replaced by a periodic interface reconstruction.
The advection step is reformulated and extended to higher order in order to
account for the present interface representation. This periodic interface
reconstruction describes the interface in terms of higher order periodic
B-splines. Numerical tests verify that the theoretical order of convergence is
indeed exhibited by the present method.
