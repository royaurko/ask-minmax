An energy efficient routing protocol is the major attentiveness for
researcher in field of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In this paper, we
present some energy efficient hierarchal routing protocols, prosper from
conventional Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) routing protocol.
Fundamental objective of our consideration is to analyze, how these ex- tended
routing protocols work in order to optimize lifetime of network nodes and how
quality of routing protocols is improved for WSNs. Furthermore, this paper also
emphasizes on some issues experienced by LEACH and also explains how these
issues are tackled by other enhanced routing protocols from classi- cal LEACH.
We analytically compare the features and performance issues of each hierarchal
routing protocol. We also simulate selected clustering routing protocols for
our study in order to elaborate the enhancement achieved by ameliorate routing
protocols.
