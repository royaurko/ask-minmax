We study growing networks in which each link carries a certain weight
(randomly assigned at birth and fixed thereafter). The weight of a node is
defined as the sum of the weights of the links attached to the node, and the
network grows via the simplest weight-driven rule: A newly-added node is
connected to an already existing node with the probability which is
proportional to the weight of that node. We show that the node weight
distribution n(w) has a universal, that is independent on the link weight
distribution, tail: n(w) ~ w^-3 as w->oo. Results are particularly neat for the
exponential link weight distribution when n(w) is algebraic over the entire
weight range.
