The vortex dynamics of a d+is-wave superconductor is studied numerically by
simulating the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. The critical fields,
the free flux flow, and the flux flow in the presence of twin-boundaries are
discussed. The relaxation rate of the order parameter turns out to play an
important role in the flux flow. We also address briefly the intrinsic Hall
effect in d- and d+is-wave superconductors.
