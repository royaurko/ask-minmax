In the context of growing networks, we introduce a simple dynamical model
that unifies the generic features of real networks: scale-free distribution of
degree and the small world effect. While the average shortest path length
increases logartihmically as in random networks, the clustering coefficient
assumes a large value independent of system size. We derive expressions for the
clustering coefficient in two limiting cases: random (C ~ (ln N)^2 / N) and
highly clustered (C = 5/6) scale-free networks.
