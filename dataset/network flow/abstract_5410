Inspired by studies on airline networks we propose a general model for
weighted networks in which topological growth and weight dynamics are both
determined by cost adversarial mechanism. Since transportation networks are
designed and operated with objectives to reduce cost, the theory of cost in
micro-economics plays a critical role in the evolution. We assume vertices and
edges are given cost functions according to economics of scale and diseconomics
of scale (congestion effect). With different cost functions the model produces
broad distribution of networks. The model reproduces key properties of real
airline networks: truncated degree distributions, nonlinear strength degree
correlations, hierarchy structures, and particulary the disassortative and
assortative behavior observed in different airline networks. The result
suggests that the interplay between economics of scale and diseconomics of
scale is a key ingredient in order to understand the underlying driving factor
of the real-world weighted networks.
