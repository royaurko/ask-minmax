In-depth understanding of the retarded oxidation phenomenon observed during
the oxidation of silicon nanostructures is proposed. The wet thermal oxidation
of various silicon nanostructures such as nanobeams, concave/convex nanorings
and nanowires exhibits an extremely different and complex behavior. Such
effects have been investigated by the modeling of the mechanical stress
generated during the oxidation process explaining the retarded regime. The
model describes the oxidation kinetics of silicon nanowires down to a few
nanometers while predicting reasonable and physical stress levels at the
Si/SiO$_{2}$ interface by correctly taking into account the relaxation effects
in silicon oxide through plastic flow.
