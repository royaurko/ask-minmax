Analysis of a dataset including a network of LED patents and their metadata
is carried out using several methods in order to answer questions about the
domain. We are interested in finding the relationship between the metadata and
the network structure; for example, are central patents in the network produced
by larger or smaller companies? We begin by exploring the structure of the
network without any metadata, applying known techniques in citation analysis
and a simple clustering scheme. These techinques are then combined with
metadata analysis to draw preliminary conclusions about the dataset.
