We study a network of 500 coupled modified van der Pol oscillators. The value
of a parameter associated with each oscillator is drawn from a normal
distribution, giving a heterogeneous network. For strong enough coupling the
oscillators all have the same period, and we consider periodic forcing of the
network when it is in this state. By exploiting the correlations that quickly
develop between the state of an oscillator and the value of its parameter we
obtain an approximate low-dimensional description of the system in terms of the
first few coefficients in a polynomial chaos expansion. Standard bifurcation
analysis can then be performed on this low-dimensional system, and the results
obtained from this predict very well the behaviour of the high-dimensional
system for any set of realisations of the random parameter. Situations in which
the method begins to fails are also discussed.
