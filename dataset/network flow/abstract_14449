This article is the complement to [quant-ph/0611284], which proves that flows
(as introduced by [quant-ph/0506062]) can be found efficiently for patterns in
the one-way measurement model which have non-empty input and output subsystems
of the same size. This article presents a complete algorithm for finding flows,
and a proof of its' correctness, without assuming any knowledge of
graph-theoretic algorithms on the part of the reader. This article is a revised
version of [quant-ph/0603072v2], where the results of [quant-ph/0611284] also
first appeared.
