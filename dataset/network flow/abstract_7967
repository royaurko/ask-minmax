We investigate the bounds between normal or anomalous effective diffusion for
inertial particles transported by parallel flows. The infrared behavior of the
fluid kinetic-energy spectrum, i.e. the possible presence of long-range
spatio-temporal correlations, is modeled as a power law by means of two
parameters, and the problem is studied as a function of these latter. Our
results, obtained in the limit of weak relative inertia, extend well-known
results for tracers and apply to particles of any mass density, subject to
gravity and Brownian diffusion. We consider both steady and time-dependent
flows, and cases of both vanishing and finite particle sedimentation.
