Magnetism in 2D networks of the acetylene-bridged transition metal porphyrins
(P-TM) and oxo-TM-porphyrins (P-TMO) is studied with the density functional
theory (DFT) and the self-interaction corrected pseudopotential scheme (pSIC).
Addition of oxygen lowers magnetism of P-TMO with respect to the corresponding
P-TM for most of the first-half 3d-row TMs. In contrast, binding O with the
second-half 3d-row TMs or Sc increases the magnetic moments. Ferrimagnetism is
found for the porphyrin networks with the TMs from V to Co and also for these
cases with oxygen. This is a long-range effect, extended even to the acetylene
bridges.
