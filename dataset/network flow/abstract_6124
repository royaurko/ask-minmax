Vulnerability is a weakness, shortcoming or flaw in the system or network
infrastructure which can be used by an attacker to harm the system, disrupt its
normal operation and use it for his financial, competitive or other motives or
just for cyber escapades. In this paper, we re-examined the various types of
attacks on industrial control systems as well as on social networking users. We
have listed which all vulnerabilities were exploited for executing these
attacks and their effects on these systems and social networks. The focus will
be mainly on the vulnerabilities that are used in OSNs as the convertors which
convert the social network into antisocial network and these networks can be
further used for the network attacks on the users associated with the victim
user whereby creating a consecutive chain of attacks on increasing number of
social networking users. Another type of attack, Stuxnet Attack which was
originally designed to attack Iran's nuclear facilities is also discussed here
which harms the system it controls by changing the code in that target system.
The Stuxnet worm is a very treacherous and hazardous means of attack and is the
first of its kind as it allows the attacker to manipulate real time equipment.
