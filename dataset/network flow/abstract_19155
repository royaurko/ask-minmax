Energy efficiency solutions are more vital for Green Mesh Network (GMN)
campuses. Today students are benefited using these e-learning methodologies.
Renewable energies such as solar, wind, hydro has tremendous applications on
energy efficient wireless networks for sustaining the ever growing traffic
demands. One of the major issues in designing a GMN is minimizing the number of
deployed mesh routers and gateways and satisfying the sustainable QOS based
energy constraints. During low traffic periods the mesh routers are switched to
power save or sleep mode. In this paper we have mathematically formulated a
single objective function with multi constraints to optimize the energy. The
objective is to place minimum number of Mesh routers and gateways in a set of
candidate location. The mesh nodes are powered using the solar energy to meet
the traffic demands. Two global optimisation algorithms are compared in this
paper to optimize the energy sustainability, to guarantee seamless
connectivity.
