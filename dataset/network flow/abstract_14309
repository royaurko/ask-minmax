We have shown that recent experimental data on radial flow, both from AGS and
SPS energies, are in agreement with the Equation of State (EOS) including the
QCD phase transition. New hydro-kinetic model (HKM) is developed, which
incorporates hydrodynamical treatment of expansion and proper kinetics of the
freeze-out. We show that the freeze-out surfaces for different secondaries and
different collisions are very different, and they are not at all isotherms (as
was assumed in most previous hydro works). Comparison of HKM results with
cascade-based event generator RQMD is also made in some details: we found that
both EOS and flow are in rather good agreement, while the space-time picture is
still somewhat different.
