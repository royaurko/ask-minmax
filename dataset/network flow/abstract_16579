We examined in this work the effect of the inter-grains distributions as well
as the scaling of the complex impedance in order to analyze its frequency
dependance for composite metal-insulator films. The dependance of the
characteristic frequencies on the inter-grain distribution is shown for large
sample sizes. The impedance spectra become statistically stable above sizes of
the order 200x200.
