We present the first evolved solutions to a computational task within the
Neuronal Organism Evolution model (Norgev) of artificial neural network
development. These networks display a remarkable robustness to external noise
sources, and can regrow to functionality when severely damaged. In this
framework, we evolved a doubling of network functionality (double-NAND
circuit). The network structure of these evolved solutions does not follow the
logic of human coding, and instead more resembles the decentralized dendritic
connection pattern of more biological networks such as the 'C. elegans' brain.
