Time-series data from multiple gravitational wave (GW) detectors can be
linearly combined to form a null-stream, in which all GW information will be
cancelled out. This null-stream can be used to distinguish between actual GW
triggers and spurious noise transients in a search for GW bursts using a
network of detectors. The biggest source of error in the null-stream analysis
comes from the fact that the detector data are not perfectly calibrated. In
this paper, we present an implementation of the null-stream veto in the
simplest network of two co-located detectors. The detectors are assumed to have
calibration uncertainties and correlated noise components. We estimate the
effect of calibration uncertainties in the null-stream veto analysis and
propose a new formulation to overcome this. This new formulation is
demonstrated by doing software injections in Gaussian noise.
