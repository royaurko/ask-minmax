We study high-energy neutrino and cosmic-ray (CR) emission from the cores of
low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). In LLAGN, the thermalization of
particles is expected to be incomplete in radiatively inefficient accretion
flows (RIAFs), allowing the existence of non-thermal particles. In this work,
assuming stochastic particle acceleration due to turbulence in RIAFs, we solve
the Fokker-Planck equation and calculate spectra of escaping neutrinos and CRs.
The RIAF in LLAGN can emit CR protons with $\gtrsim10$ PeV energies and TeV-PeV
neutrinos generated via $pp$ and/or $p\gamma$ reactions. We find that, if
$\sim1$\% of the accretion luminosity is carried away by non-thermal ions, the
diffuse neutrino intensity from the cores of LLAGN may be as high as
$E_\nu^2\Phi_\nu\sim3\times{10}^{-8} {\rm GeV} {\rm cm}^{-2} {\rm s}^{-1}{\rm
sr}^{-1}$, which can be compatible with the observed IceCube data. This result
does not contradict either of the diffuse gamma-ray background observed by {\it
Fermi} or observed diffuse cosmic-ray flux. Our model suggests that, although
very-high-energy gamma rays may not escape, radio-quiet AGN with RIAFs can emit
GeV gamma-rays, which could be used for testing the model. We also calculate
the neutron luminosity from RIAFs of LLAGN, and discuss a strong constraint on
the model of jet mass loading mediated by neutrons from the diffuse neutrino
observation.
