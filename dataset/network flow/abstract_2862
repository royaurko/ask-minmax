In previous work, Angenent, Isenberg, and Knopf created type-II Ricci flow
neckpinch singularities. In this paper we construct solutions to Ricci flow
whose initial data is the singular metric resulting from these singularities.
We show in particular that the curvature decreases at the same rate at which it
blew up. This is the first example of Ricci flow starting from a type-II
singularity.
