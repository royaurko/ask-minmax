We show that the analog of Hamilton's Ricci flow in the combinatorial setting
produces solutions which converge exponentially fast to Thurston's circle
packing on surfaces. As a consequence, a new proof of Thurston's existence of
circle packing theorem is obtained. As another consequence, Ricci flow suggests
a new algorithm to find circle packings.
