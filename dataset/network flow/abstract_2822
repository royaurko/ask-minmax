In this paper, the contributor has considered the hyperbolic Kahler-Ricci flow
introduced by Kong and Liu [11], that is, the hyperbolic version of the famous
Kahler-Ricci flow. The contributor has explained the derivation of the equation and
calculated the evolutions of various quantities associated to the equation
including the curvatures. Particularly on Calabi-Yau manifolds, the equation
can be simplified to a scalar hyperbolic Monge-Ampere equation which is just
the hyperbolic version of the corresponding one in Kahler-Ricci flow.
