In a social network, agents are intelligent and have the capability to make
decisions to maximize their utilities. They can either make wise decisions by
taking advantages of other agents' experiences through learning, or make
decisions earlier to avoid competitions from huge crowds. Both these two
effects, social learning and negative network externality, play important roles
in the decision process of an agent. While there are existing works on either
social learning or negative network externality, a general study on considering
both these two contradictory effects is still limited. We find that the Chinese
restaurant process, a popular random process, provides a well-defined structure
to model the decision process of an agent under these two effects. By
introducing the strategic behavior into the non-strategic Chinese restaurant
process, in Part I of this two-part paper, we propose a new game, called
Chinese Restaurant Game, to formulate the social learning problem with negative
network externality. Through analyzing the proposed Chinese restaurant game, we
derive the optimal strategy of each agent and provide a recursive method to
achieve the optimal strategy. How social learning and negative network
externality influence each other under various settings is also studied through
simulations.
