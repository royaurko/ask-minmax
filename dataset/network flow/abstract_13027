We consider winding conserving four point functions in the SL(2,R) WZW model
for states in arbitrary spectral flow sectors. We compute the leading order
contribution to the expansion of the amplitudes in powers of the cross ratio of
the four points on the worldsheet, both in the m- and x-basis, with at least
one state in the spectral flow image of the highest weight discrete
representation. We also perform certain consistency check on the winding
conserving three point functions.
