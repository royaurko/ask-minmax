We study physical-layer security in wireless ad hoc networks and investigate
two types of multi-antenna transmission schemes for providing secrecy
enhancements. To establish secure transmission against malicious eavesdroppers,
we consider the generation of artificial noise with either sectoring or
beamforming. For both approaches, we provide a statistical characterization and
tradeoff analysis of the outage performance of the legitimate communication and
the eavesdropping links. We then investigate the networkwide secrecy throughput
performance of both schemes in terms of the secrecy transmission capacity, and
study the optimal power allocation between the information signal and the
artificial noise. Our analysis indicates that, under transmit power
optimization, the beamforming scheme outperforms the sectoring scheme, except
for the case where the number of transmit antennas are sufficiently large. Our
study also reveals some interesting differences between the optimal power
allocation for the sectoring and beamforming schemes.
