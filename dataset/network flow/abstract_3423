The flow instability and further transition to turbulence in a toroidal pipe
(torus) with curvature (tube-to-coiling diameter) 0.049 is investigated
experimentally. The flow inside the toroidal pipe is driven by a steel sphere
fitted to the inner pipe diameter. The sphere is moved with constant azimuthal
velocity from outside the torus by a moving magnet. The experiment is designed
to investigate curved pipe flow by optical measurement techniques. Using
stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, laser Doppler velocimetry and pressure
drop measurements, the flow is measured for Reynolds numbers ranging from 1000
to 15000. Time- and space-resolved velocity fields are obtained and analysed.
The steady axisymmetric basic flow is strongly influenced by centrifugal
effects. On an increase of the Reynolds number we find a sequence of
bifurcations. For Re=4075 a supercritical bifurcation to an oscillatory flow is
found in which waves travel in the streamwise direction with a phase velocity
slightly faster than the mean flow. The oscillatory flow is superseded by a
presumably quasi-periodic flow at a further increase of the Reynolds number
before turbulence sets in. The results are found to be compatible, in general,
with earlier experimental and numerical investigations on transition to
turbulence in helical and curved pipes. However, important aspects of the
bifurcation scenario differ considerably.
