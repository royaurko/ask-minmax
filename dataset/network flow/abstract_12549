Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network control paradigm
focused on logical centralization and programmability. At the same time,
distributed routing protocols, most notably OSPF and IS-IS, are still prevalent
in IP networks, as they provide shortest path routing, fast topological
convergence after network failures, and, perhaps most importantly, the
confidence based on decades of reliable operation. Therefore, a hybrid SDN/OSPF
operation remains a desirable proposition. In this paper, we propose a new
method of hybrid SDN/OSPF operation. Our method is different from other hybrid
approaches, as it uses SDN nodes to partition an OSPF domain into sub-domains
thereby achieving the traffic engineering capabilities comparable to full SDN
operation. We place SDN-enabled routers as sub-domain border nodes, while the
operation of the OSPF protocol continues unaffected. In this way, the SDN
controller can tune routing protocol updates for traffic engineering purposes
before they are flooded into sub-domains. While local routing inside
sub-domains remains stable at all times, inter-sub-domain routes can be
optimized by determining the routes in each traversed sub-domain. As the
majority of traffic in non-trivial topologies has to traverse multiple
sub-domains, our simulation results confirm that a few SDN nodes allow traffic
engineering up to a degree that renders full SDN deployment unnecessary.
