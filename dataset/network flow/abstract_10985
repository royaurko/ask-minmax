The spectral statistics of complex networks are numerically studied.
  The features of the Anderson metal-insulator transition are found to be
similar for a wide range of different networks. A metal-insulator transition as
a function of the disorder can be observed for different classes of complex
networks for which the average connectivity is small. The critical index of the
transition corresponds to the mean field expectation. When the connectivity is
higher, the amount of disorder needed to reach a certain degree of localization
is proportional to the average connectivity, though a precise transition cannot
be identified. The absence of a clear transition at high connectivity is
probably due to the very compact structure of the highly connected networks,
resulting in a small diameter even for a large number of sites.
