Let $M$ be a closed orientable Riemannian surface. Consider an
SO(3)-connection $A$ and a Higgs field $\Phi:M\to so(3)$. The pair $(A,\Phi)$
naturally induces a cocycle over the geodesic flow of $M$. We classify (up to
gauge transformations) cohomologically trivial pairs $(A,\Phi)$ with finite
Fourier series in terms of a suitable B\"acklund transformation. In particular,
if $M$ is negatively curved we obtain a full classification of
SO(3)-transparent pairs.
