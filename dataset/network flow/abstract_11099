Network alignment generalizes and unifies several approaches for forming a
matching or alignment between the vertices of two graphs. We study a
mathematical programming framework for network alignment problem and a sparse
variation of it where only a small number of matches between the vertices of
the two graphs are possible. We propose a new message passing algorithm that
allows us to compute, very efficiently, approximate solutions to the sparse
network alignment problems with graph sizes as large as hundreds of thousands
of vertices. We also provide extensive simulations comparing our algorithms
with two of the best solvers for network alignment problems on two synthetic
matching problems, two bioinformatics problems, and three large ontology
alignment problems including a multilingual problem with a known labeled
alignment.
