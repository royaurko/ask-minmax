The clustering coefficient quantifies how well connected are the neighbors of
a vertex in a graph. In real networks it decreases with the vertex degree,
which has been taken as a signature of the network hierarchical structure. Here
we show that this signature of hierarchical structure is a consequence of
degree correlation biases in the clustering coefficient definition. We
introduce a new definition in which the degree correlation biases are filtered
out, and provide evidence that in real networks the clustering coefficient is
constant or decays logarithmically with vertex degree.
