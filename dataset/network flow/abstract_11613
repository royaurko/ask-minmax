The modern and innovative medical applications based on wireless network are
being developed in the commercial sectors as well as in research. The emerging
wireless networks are rapidly becoming a fundamental part of medical solutions
due to increasing accessibility for healthcare professionals/patients reducing
healthcare costs. Discovering the routes among hosts that are energy efficient
without compromise on smooth communication is desirable. This work investigates
energy efficiency of some selected proactive and reactive routing protocols in
wireless network for healthcare environments. After simulation and analysis we
found that DSR is best energy efficient routing protocol among DSR, DSDV and
AODV, because DSR has maximum remaining energy.
