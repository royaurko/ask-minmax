In this paper, a distributed turbo-like coding scheme for wireless networks
with relays is proposed. We consider a scenario where multiple sources
communicate with a single destination with the help of a relay. The proposed
scheme can be regarded as of the decode-and-forward type. The relay decodes the
information from the sources and it properly combines and re-encodes them to
generate some extra redundancy, which is transmitted to the destination. The
amount of redundancy generated by the relay can simply be adjusted according to
requirements in terms of performance, throughput and/or power. At the
destination, decoding of the information of all sources is performed jointly
exploiting the redundancy provided by the relay in an iterative fashion. The
overall communication network can be viewed as a serially concatenated code.
The proposed distributed scheme achieves significant performance gains with
respect to the non-cooperation system, even for a very large number of users.
Furthermore, it presents a high flexibility in terms of code rate, block length
and number of users.
