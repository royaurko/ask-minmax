We study steady-state spherically symmetric accretion of a galileon field
onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test fluid approximation. The galileon
is assumed to undergo a stage of cosmological evolution, thus setting a
non-trivial boundary condition at spatial infinity. The critical flow is found
for some parameters of the theory. There is a range of parameters when the
critical flow exists, but the solution is unstable. It is also shown that for a
certain range of parameters the critical flow solution does not exist.
Depending on the model the sound horizon of the flow can be either outside or
inside of the Schwarzschild horizon. The latter property may make it
problematic to embed the galileon theory in the standard black hole
thermodynamics.
