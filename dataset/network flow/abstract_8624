We study the two particle annihilation reaction $A+B\rightarrow \emptyset$ on
interconnected scale free networks, using different interconnecting strategies.
We explore how the mixing of particles and the process evolution are influenced
by the number of interconnecting links, by their functional properties, and by
the interconnectivity strategies in use. We show that the reaction rates on
this system are faster than what was observed in other topologies, due to the
better particle mixing which suppresses the segregation effect, inline with
previous studies performed on single scale free networks.
