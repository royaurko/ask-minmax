The principles underlying protein folding remains one of Nature's puzzles
with important practical consequences for Life. An approach that has gathered
momentum since the late 1990's, looks at protein hetero-polymers and their
folding process through the lens of complex network analysis. Consequently,
there is now a body of empirical studies describing topological characteristics
of protein macro-molecules through their contact networks and linking these
topological characteristics to protein folding. The present paper is primarily
a review of this rich area. But it delves deeper into certain aspects by
emphasizing short-range and long-range links, and suggests unconventional
places where "power-laws" may be lurking within protein contact networks.
Further, it considers the dynamical view of protein contact networks. This
closer scrutiny of protein contact networks raises new questions for further
research, and identifies new regularities which may be useful to parameterize a
network approach to protein folding. Preliminary experiments with such a model
confirm that the regularities we identified cannot be easily reproduced through
random effects. Indeed, the grand challenge of protein folding is to elucidate
the process(es) which not only generates the specific and diverse linkage
patterns of protein contact networks, but also reproduces the dynamic behavior
of proteins as they fold. Keywords: network analysis, protein contact networks,
