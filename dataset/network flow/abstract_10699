We propose a new method to measure the possible large-scale bulk flows in the
Universe from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the upcoming
missions, MAP and Planck. This can be done by studying the statistical
properties of the CMB temperature field at many X-ray cluster positions. At
each cluster position, the CMB temperature fluctuation will be a combination of
the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) kinematic and thermal components, the cosmological
fluctuations and the instrument noise term. When averaged over many such
clusters the last three will integrate down, whereas the first one will be
dominated by a possible bulk flow component. In particular, we propose to use
all-sky X-ray cluster catalogs that should (or could) be available soon from
X-ray satellites, and then to evaluate the dipole component of the CMB field at
the cluster positions. We show that for the MAP and Planck mission parameters
the dominant contributions to the dipole will be from the terms due to the SZ
kinematic effect produced by the bulk flow (the signal we seek) and the
instrument noise (the noise in our signal). Computing then the expected
signal-to-noise ratio for such measurement, we get that at the 95 % confidence
level the bulk flows on scales >100h^{-1} Mpc can be probed down to the
amplitude of $< 200$ km/sec with the MAP data and down to only 30 km/sec with
the Planck mission.
