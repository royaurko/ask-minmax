We study the temperature flow of conductivities in a gated GaAs
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) containing self-assembled InAs dots and
compare the results with recent theoretical predictions. By changing the gate
voltage, we are able to tune the 2DEG density and thus vary disorder and
spin-splitting. Data for both the spin-resolved and spin-degenerate phase
transitions are presented, the former collapsing to the latter with decreasing
gate voltage and/or decreasing spin-splitting. The experimental results support
a recent theory, based on modular symmetry, which predicts how the critical
Hall conductivity varies with spin-splitting.
