Using magnetic field and plasma data acquired during "Phobos-2" mission in
regions which have not been explored before, we study the solar wind
interaction with Phobos. The draping magnetic field of the solar wind around
Phobos appears at distances of 200-300 km from the Phobos day-side due to a
density and magnetic field pile up in front of the Phobos obstacle. The nature
of the interaction and the magnetic field signatures observed are consistent
with the ratio of the proton skin depth to the actual size of the Phobos
obstacle to the solar wind. Phobos deflects the flow of the solar wind and the
subsolar stand-off distance of the deflection is about 16-17 Phobos radii.
Source with equivalent magnetic moment M'=10^{15} A m^2 in Phobos leads to the
development of such an obstacle to solar wind flow around Phobos. These data
give a lesson for the study of the interaction of the small, magnetized object
with solar wind.
