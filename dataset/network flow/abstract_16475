We study spherical and nonspherical linear acoustic perturbations of the
Michel flow, which describes the steady radial accretion of a perfect fluid
into a nonrotating black hole. The dynamics of such perturbations are governed
by a scalar wave equation on an effective curved background geometry determined
by the acoustic metric, which is constructed from the spacetime metric and the
particle density and four-velocity of the fluid. For the problem under
consideration in this article the acoustic metric has the same qualitative
features as an asymptotically flat, static and spherically symmetric black
hole, and thus it represents a natural astrophysical analogue black hole.
  As for the case of a scalar field propagating on a Schwarzschild background,
we show that acoustic perturbations of the Michel flow exhibit quasi-normal
oscillations. Based on a new numerical method for determining the solutions of
the radial mode equation, we compute the associated frequencies and analyze
their dependency on the radii of the event and sonic horizons and the angular
momentum number. Our results for the fundamental frequencies are compared to
those obtained from an independent numerical Cauchy evolution, finding good
agreement between the two approaches. When the radius of the sonic horizon is
large compared to the event horizon radius, we find that the quasi-normal
frequencies scale approximately like the surface gravity associated with the
sonic horizon.
