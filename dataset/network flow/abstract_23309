Cyg X-3 is a high mass X-ray binary consisting of a Wolf-Rayet star and a
compact object in a very short orbital period of 4.8h. The only confirmed
microquasar with high energy gamma-ray emission, Cyg X-3 provides a unique
opportunity to study the relationship between the accretion power and the power
in high energy emission. Because of a compact orbit and a slow Wolf-Rayet wind,
the flow structure around the compact object is thought to be strongly affected
by the orbital motion, details of which can be obtained only by numerical
simulations. In this paper, we report on the results from 3D hydrodynamic
simulations of the wind accretion in Cyg X-3. For simplicity we adopt an
anti-gravity-like force that emulates the radiative acceleration consistent
with the beta-velocity wind. Due to the rapid orbital motion, the flow around
the compact object has large density gradients. As a result, the accretion rate
onto the compact object is significantly lower than that of the
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate. We also calculate the model X-ray light curve.
Although it roughly agrees with the observed light curve, more detailed
modeling is needed for detailed comparison.
