A model is proposed of a collapsing quasi-spherical radiating star with
matter content as shear-free isotropic fluid undergoing radial heat-flow with
outgoing radiation. To describe the radiation of the system, we have considered
both plane symmetric and spherical Vaidya solutions. Physical conditions and
thermodynamical relations are studied using local conservation of momentum and
surface red-shift. We have found that for existence of radiation on the
boundary, pressure on the boundary is not necessary.
