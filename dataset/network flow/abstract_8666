In this paper we study the differences in historical worldview between
Western and Eastern cultures, represented through the English, Chinese,
Japanese, and German Wikipedia. In particular, we analyze the historical
networks of the World's leaders since the beginning of written history,
comparing them in the four different Wikipedias.
