We study an Ising model in a network with disorder induced by the presence of
both attractive and repulsive links. This system is subjected to a subthreshold
signal, and the goal is to see how the response is enhanced for a given
fraction of repulsive links. This can model a network of spin-like neurons with
excitatory and inhibitory couplings. By means of numerical simulations and
analytical calculations we find that there is an optimal probability, such that
the coherent response is maximal.
