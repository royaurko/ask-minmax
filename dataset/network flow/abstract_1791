We consider the problem of resource allocation in a wireless cellular
network, in which nodes have both open and private information to be
transmitted to the base station over block fading uplink channels. We develop a
cross-layer solution, based on hybrid ARQ transmission with incremental
redundancy. We provide a scheme that combines power control, flow control, and
scheduling in order to maximize a global utility function, subject to the
stability of the data queues, an average power constraint, and a constraint on
the privacy outage probability. Our scheme is based on the assumption that each
node has an estimate of its uplink channel gain at each block, while only the
distribution of the cross channel gains is available. We prove that our scheme
achieves a utility, arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility given
the available channel state information.
