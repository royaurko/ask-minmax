Within the framework of a relativistic transport model (ART) for heavy-ion
collisions at AGS energies, we examine the effects of kaon dispersion relation
on the transverse flow of kaons and their transverse momentum and azimuthal
angle distributions. We find that the transverse flow is the most sensitive
observable for studying the kaon dispersion relation in dense medium.
