We continue our study of chaotic mixing and transport of passive particles in
a simple model of a meandering jet flow [Prants, et al, Chaos {\bf 16}, 033117
(2006)]. In the present paper we study and explain phenomenologically a
connection between dynamical, topological, and statistical properties of
chaotic mixing and transport in the model flow in terms of dynamical traps,
singular zones in the phase space where particles may spend arbitrary long but
finite time [Zaslavsky, Phys. D {\bf 168--169}, 292 (2002)]. The transport of
passive particles is described in terms of lengths and durations of zonal
flights which are events between two successive changes of sign of zonal
velocity. Some peculiarities of the respective probability density functions
for short flights are proven to be caused by the so-called rotational-islands
traps connected with the boundaries of resonant islands (including those of the
vortex cores) filled with the particles moving in the same frame. Whereas, the
statistics of long flights can be explained by the influence of the so-called
ballistic-islands traps filled with the particles moving from a frame to frame.
