In this paper, we study the RG flow in the non-linear sigma models obtained
from a 2d N=(0,2) supersymmetric QCD. The sigma model is parameterized by a
single Kahler modulus. We determine its exact non-perturbative beta function
using holomorphy, triality and the knowledge of the infra-red fixed point.
