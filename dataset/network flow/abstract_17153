Recently, Yeh [Yeh, WC. (2006). A simple algorithm to search for all MCs in
networks. European Journal of Operational Research, 174, 1694{1705.] has
proposed a simple algorithm to find all the Minimal Cuts in an undirected
graph. However, the algorithm does not work properly. Here, using an example, a
defect of this algorithm is illustrated, and then the corresponding result is
shown to be incorrect. Moreover, a correct version of the algorithm is
established.
