We describe a large disorder renormalization group (LDRG) method for the
Anderson model of localization in one dimension which decimates eigenstates
based on the size of their wavefunctions rather than their energy. We show that
our LDRG scheme flows to infinite disorder, and thus becomes asymptotically
exact. We use it to obtain the disorder-averaged inverse participation ratio
and density of states for the entire spectrum. A modified scheme is formulated
for higher dimensions, which is found to be less efficient, but capable of
improvement.
