We study the regularity properties of the Hamilton-Jacobi flow equation and
infimal convolution in the case where initial datum function is continuous and
lies in given Sobolev-space $W^{1,p}(\rn)$. We prove that under suitable
assumptions it holds for solutions $w(x,t)$ that $D_xw(\cdot,t)\to Du(\cdot)$
in $L^p(\rn)$. Moreover, we construct examples showing that our results are
essentially optimal.
