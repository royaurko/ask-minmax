We consider the problem of estimating functions of distributed data using a
distributed algorithm over a network. The extant literature on computing
functions in distributed networks such as wired and wireless sensor networks
and peer-to-peer networks deals with computing linear functions of the
distributed data when the alphabet size of the data values is small, O(1). We
describe a distributed randomized algorithm to estimate a class of non-linear
functions of the distributed data which is over a large alphabet. We consider
three types of networks: point-to-point networks with gossip based
communication, random planar networks in the connectivity regime and random
planar networks in the percolating regime both of which use the slotted Aloha
communication protocol. For each network type, we estimate the scaled $k$-th
frequency moments, for $k \geq 2$. Specifically, for every $k \geq 2,$ we give
a distributed randomized algorithm that computes, with probability
$(1-\delta),$ an $\epsilon$-approximation of the scaled $k$-th frequency
moment, $F_k/N^k$, using time $O(M^{1-\frac{1}{k-1}} T)$ and
$O(M^{1-\frac{1}{k-1}} \log N \log (\delta^{-1})/\epsilon^2)$ bits of
transmission per communication step. Here, $N$ is the number of nodes in the
network, $T$ is the information spreading time and $M=o(N)$ is the alphabet
size.
