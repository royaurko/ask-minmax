Continuing arguments presented [1] or announced [2][3] in "Complex Systems,"
zero-divisor (ZD) foundations for "scale-free" networks (evinced, in
particular, in the "fractality" of the Internet) are decentralized. Spandrels,
quartets of ZD-free or "hidden" box-kite-like structures (HBKs) in the 2^(N+1)-
ions, are "exploded" from (and uniquely linked to) each standard box-kite in
the 2^N-ions, N > 3. Any HBK houses, in a "cowbird's nest," exactly one copy of
the (ZD-free) octonions, the recursive basis for all ZD ensembles. Each is a
potential waystation for alien-ensemble infiltration in the large, or
metaphor-like jumps in the small. Cowbirding models what evolutionary
biologists [4], and structural mythologist Claude Levi-Strauss before them [5],
term bricolage: the opportunistic co-opting of objects designed for one purpose
to serve others unrelated to it. Such arguments entail switching focus, from
the octahedral box-kite's four triangular "sails," to its trio of square
"catamarans" and their box-kite-switching "twist products."
