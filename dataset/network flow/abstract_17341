We investigate the ballistic spin transport through a two-dimensional
mesoscopic metal/semiconductor/metal double junctions in the presence of
spin-orbit interactions. It is shown that \emph{real} longitudinal and/or
transverse spin currents can flow in the presence of the Rashba and Dresselhaus
terms.
