In this paper we develop a formalism allowing us to describe operating of a
network based on the parametrical four-wave mixing process that is well-known
in nonlinear optics. The recognition power of a network using parametric
neurons operating with q different frequencies is considered. It is shown that
the storage capacity of such a network is higher compared with the Potts-glass
models.
