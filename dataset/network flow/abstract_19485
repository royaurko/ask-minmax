We study the use of the Evans Nonequilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD) heat
flow algorithm for the computation of the heat conductivity in one-dimensional
lattices. For the well-known Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) model, it is shown that
when the heat field strength is greater than a certain critical value (which
depends on the system size) solitons can be generated in molecular dynamics
simulations starting from random initial conditions. Such solitons are stable
and travel with supersonic speeds. For smaller heat fields, no solitons are
generated in the molecular dynamics simulations; the heat conductivity obtained
via the NEMD algorithm increases monotonically with the size of the system.
