The structure and energy balance of the solar chromosphere remain poorly
known. We have used the imaging spectrometer IBIS at the Dunn Solar Telescope
to obtain fast-cadence, multi-wavelength profile sampling of Halpha and Ca II
854.2 nm over a sizable two-dimensional field of view encompassing quiet-Sun
network. We provide a first inventory of how the quiet chromosphere appears in
these two lines by comparing basic profile measurements in the form of image
displays, temporal-average displays, time slices, and pixel-by-pixel
correlations. We find that the two lines can be markedly dissimilar in their
rendering of the chromosphere, but that, nevertheless, both show evidence of
chromospheric heating, particularly in and around network: Halpha in its core
width, Ca II 854.2 in its brightness. We discuss venues for improved modeling.
