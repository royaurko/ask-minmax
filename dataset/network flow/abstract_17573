In this paper, we first use the method of Colding and Minicozzi [5] to show
that K. Smoczyk's classification theorem [16] for complete self-shrinkers in
higher codimension also holds under a weaker condition. Then as an application,
we give some rigidity results for self-shrinkers in arbitrary codimension.
