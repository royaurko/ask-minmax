Robustness of network of networks (NON) has been studied only for dependency
coupling (J.X. Gao et. al., Nature Physics, 2012) and only for connectivity
coupling (E.A. Leicht and R.M. D Souza, arxiv:0907.0894). The case of network
of n networks with both interdependent and interconnected links is more
complicated, and also more closely to real-life coupled network systems. Here
we develop a framework to study analytically and numerically the robustness of
this system. For the case of starlike network of n ER networks, we find that
the system undergoes from second order to first order phase transition as
coupling strength q increases. We find that increasing intra-connectivity links
or inter-connectivity links can increase the robustness of the system, while
the interdependency links decrease its robustness. Especially when q=1, we find
exact analytical solutions of the giant component and the first order
transition point. Understanding the robustness of network of networks with
interdependent and interconnected links is helpful to design resilient
infrastructures.
