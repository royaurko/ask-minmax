This letter investigates the problem of distributed spectrum access for
cognitive small cell networks. Compared with existing work, two inherent
features are considered: i) the transmission of a cognitive small cell base
station only interferes with its neighbors due to the low power, i.e., the
interference is local, and ii) the channel state is time-varying due to fading.
We formulate the problem as a robust graphical game, and prove that it is an
ordinal potential game which has at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium
(NE). Also, the lower throughput bound of NE solutions is analytically
obtained. To cope with the dynamic and incomplete information constraints, we
propose a distribute spectrum access algorithm to converge to some stable
results. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
game-theoretic distributed learning solution in time-varying spectrum
environment.
