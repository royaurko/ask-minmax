Distributed abstract programs are a novel class of distributed optimization
problems where (i) the number of variables is much smaller than the number of
constraints and (ii) each constraint is associated to a network node. Abstract
optimization programs are a generalization of linear programs that captures
numerous geometric optimization problems. We propose novel constraints
consensus algorithms for distributed abstract programs: as each node
iteratively identifies locally active constraints and exchanges them with its
neighbors, the network computes the active constraints determining the global
optimum. The proposed algorithms are appropriate for networks with weak
time-dependent connectivity requirements and tight memory constraints. We show
how suitable target localization and formation control problems can be tackled
via constraints consensus.
