Cold atmospheric pressure plasmas can be used for treatment of living tissues
or for inactivation of bacteria or biological macromolecules. The treatment is
usually characterized by a combined effect of UV and VUV radiation, reactive
species, and ions. This combination is usually beneficial for the effectiveness
of the treatment but it makes the study of fundamental interaction mechanisms
very difficult. Here we report on an effective separation of VUV/UV photons and
heavy reactive species in the effluent of a micro scale atmospheric pressure
plasma jet ($\mu$-APPJ). The separation is realized by an additional flow of
helium gas under well-defined flow conditions, which deflects heavy particles
in the effluent without affecting the VUV and UV photons. Both components of
the effluent, the photons and the reactive species, can be used separately or
in combination for sample treatment. The results of treatment of a model plasma
polymer film and vegetative Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli cells are
shown and discussed. A simple model of the He gas flow and reaction kinetics of
oxygen atoms in the gas phase and at the surface is used to provide a better
understanding of the processes in the plasma effluent. The new jet
modification, called X-Jet for its appearance, will simplify the investigation
of interaction mechanisms of atmospheric pressure plasmas with biological
samples.
