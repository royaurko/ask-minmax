For dense femtocells, intelligent integrated femtocell/macrocell network
architecture, a neighbor cell list with a minimum number of femtocells,
effective call admission control (CAC), and handover processes with proper
signaling are the open research issues. An appropriate traffic model for the
integrated femtocell/macrocell network is also not yet developed. In this
paper, we present the major issue of mobility management for the integrated
femtocell/macrocell network. We propose a novel algorithm to create a neighbor
cell list with a minimum, but appropriate, number of cells for handover. We
also propose detailed handover procedures and a novel traffic model for the
integrated femtocell/macrocell network. The proposed CAC effectively handles
various calls. The numerical and simulation results show the importance of the
integrated femtocell/macrocell network and the performance improvement of the
proposed schemes. Our proposed schemes for dense femtocells will be very
effective for those in research and industry to implement.
