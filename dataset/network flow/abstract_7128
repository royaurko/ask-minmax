A novel Lattice Boltzmann Method applicable to compressible fluid flows is
developed. This method is based on replacing the governing equations by a
relaxation system and the interpretation of the diagonal form of the relaxation
system as a discrete velocity Boltzmann system. As a result of this
interpretation, the local equilibrium distribution functions are simple
algebraic functions of the conserved variables and the fluxes, without the low
Mach number expansion present in the equilibrium distribution of the
traditional Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). This new Lattice Boltzmann
Relaxation Scheme (LBRS) thus overcomes the low Mach number limitation and can
successfully simulate compressible flows. While doing so, our algorithm retains
all the distinctive features of the traditional LBM. Numerical simulations
carried out for inviscid flows in one and two dimensions show that the method
can simulate the features of compressible flows like shock waves and expansion
waves.
