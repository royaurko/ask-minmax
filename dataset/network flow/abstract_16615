We measure electrical transport on networks of single wall nanotube ropes as
a function of temperature T, voltage V and pressure up to 22GPa. We observe
Luttinger liquid (LL) behavior, a conductance ~T^alpha and a dynamic
conductance ~V^alpha. With pressure conductance increases while alpha
decreases, enabling us to test the theoretical prediction for LL on the alpha
dependence of the T and V independent coefficient of the tunneling conductance,
and to obtain the high frequency cut-off of LL modes. The possible transition
to a fermi liquid at alpha -> 0 is unattainable, as nanotubes collapse to an
insulating state at high pressures.
