Recurrent networks that have transfer functions that fulfill the Lipschitz
continuity with $L=1$, may be echo state networks if certain limitations on the
recurrent connectivity are applied. Initially it has been shown that it is
sufficient if the largest singular value of the recurrent connectivity $S$ is
smaller than 1. The main achievement of this paper is a proof under which
conditions the network is still an echo state network even if $S=1$. It turns
out that in this critical case the exact shape of the transfer function plays a
decisive role whether or not the network still fulfills the echo state
condition.
