First, we prove a local spectral flow formula (Theorem 3.7) for a
differentiable curve of selfadjoint Fredholm operators. This formula enables us
to prove in a simple way a general spectral flow formula.
  Secondly, we prove a splitting formula (Theorem 4.12) for the spectral flow
of a curve of selfadjoint elliptic operators on a closed manifold, which we
decompose into two parts with commom boundary. Then the formula says that the
spectral flow is a sum of two spectral flows on each part of the separated
manifold with naturally introduced elliptic boundary conditions. In the course
of proving this formula, we investigate a property of the Maslov index for
paths of Fredholm pairs of Lagrangian subspaces
