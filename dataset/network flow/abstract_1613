In previous work, our results suggested that some cities tend to be ahead of
others in their musical preferences. We concluded that work by noting that to
properly test this claim, we would try to exploit the leader-follower
relationships that we identified to make predictions. Here we present the
results of our predictive evaluation. We find that information on the past
musical preferences in other cities allows a linear model to improve its
predictions by approx. 5% over a simple baseline. This suggests that at best,
previously found leader-follower relationships are rather weak.
