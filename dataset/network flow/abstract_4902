We obtain a compactness result for Fano manifolds and K\"ahler Ricci flows.
Comparing to the more general Riemannian versions by Anderson and Hamilton, in
this Fano case, the curvature assumption is much weaker and is preserved by the
K\"ahler Ricci flows. One assumption is the boundedness of the Ricci potential
and the other is the smallness of Perelman's entropy. As one application, we
obtain a new local regularity criteria and structure result for K\"ahler Ricci
flows. The proof is based on a H\"older estimate for the gradient of harmonic
functions, which may be of independent interest.
