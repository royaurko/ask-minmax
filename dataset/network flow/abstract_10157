In this paper, we give a new construction of the adapted complex structure on
a neighborhood of the zero section in the tangent bundle of a compact,
real-analytic Riemannian manifold. Motivated by the "complexifier" approach of
T. Thiemann as well as certain formulas of V. Guillemin and M. Stenzel, we
obtain the polarization associated to the adapted complex structure by applying
the "imaginary-time geodesic flow" to the vertical polarization. Meanwhile, at
the level of functions, we show that every holomorphic function is obtained
from a function that is constant along the fibers by "composition with the
imaginary-time geodesic flow." We give several equivalent interpretations of
this composition, including a convergent power series in the vector field
generating the geodesic flow.
