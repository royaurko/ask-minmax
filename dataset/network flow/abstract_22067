In this study the numerical performance of the fourth order compact
formulation of the steady 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations introduced
by Erturk et al. (Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids, 50, 421-436) will be
presented. The benchmark driven cavity flow problem will be solved using the
introduced compact fourth order formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations with
two different line iterative semi-implicit methods for both second and fourth
order spatial accuracy. The extra CPU work needed for increasing the spatial
accuracy from second order (O(x2)) to fourth order (O(x4)) formulation will be
presented.
