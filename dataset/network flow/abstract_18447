We present a computer-assisted approach to coarse-graining the evolutionary
dynamics of a system of nonidentical oscillators coupled through a (fixed)
network structure. The existence of a spectral gap for the coupling network
graph Laplacian suggests that the graph dynamics may quickly become
low-dimensional. Our first choice of coarse variables consists of the
components of the oscillator states -their (complex) phase angles- along the
leading eigenvectors of this Laplacian. We then use the equation-free framework
[1], circumventing the derivation of explicit coarse-grained equations, to
perform computational tasks such as coarse projective integration, coarse fixed
point and coarse limit cycle computations. In a second step, we explore an
approach to incorporating oscillator heterogeneity in the coarse-graining
process. The approach is based on the observation of fastdeveloping
correlations between oscillator state and oscillator intrinsic properties, and
establishes a connection with tools developed in the context of uncertainty
quantification.
