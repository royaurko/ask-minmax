We apply the recombination model to study $J/\psi$ production and its
elliptic flow in the region of $10<p_T<20$ GeV/$c$ at LHC energy. We show the
distribution of $J/\psi$ as function of the transverse momentum $p_T$ and the
azimuthal angle $\phi$. If the contribution from the recombination of shower
partons from two neighboring jets can not be ignored due to the high jet
density at LHC, the elliptic flow parameter $v_2$ of $J/\psi$ is predicted to
decrease with $p_T$.
