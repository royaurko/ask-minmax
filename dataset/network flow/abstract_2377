Molecular dynamics computer simulations are used to investigate a silica melt
confined between walls at equilibrium and in a steady-state Poisseuille flow.
The walls consist of point particles forming a rigid face-centered cubic
lattice and the interaction of the walls with the melt atoms is modelled such
that the wall particles have only a weak bonding to those in the melt, i.e.
much weaker than the covalent bonding of a Si-O unit. We observe a pronounced
layering of the melt near the walls. This layering, as seen in the total
density profile, has a very irregular character which can be attributed to a
preferred orientational ordering of SiO4 tetrahedra near the wall. On
intermediate length scales, the structure of the melt at the walls can be well
distinguished from that of the bulk by means of the ring size distribution.
Whereas essentially no structural changes occur in the bulk under the influence
of the shear fields considered, strong structural rearrangements in the ring
size distribution are present at the walls as far as there is a slip motion.
For the sheared system, parabolic velocity profiles are found in the bulk
region as expected from hydrodynamics and the values for the shear viscosity as
extracted from those profiles are in good agreement with those obtained in pure
bulk simulations from the appropriate Green-Kubo formula.
