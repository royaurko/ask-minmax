We describe the dynamics of a simple adaptive network. The network
architecture evolves to a number of disconnected components on which the
dynamics is characterized by the possibility of differently synchronized nodes
within the same network (polysynchronous states). These systems may have
implications for the evolutionary emergence of polysynchrony and hierarchical
networks in physical or biological systems modeled by adaptive networks.
