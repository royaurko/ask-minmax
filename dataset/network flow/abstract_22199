We present measurements of spin transport in ultracold gases of fermionic
lithium-6 in a mixture of two spin states at a Feshbach resonance. In
particular, we study the spin dipole mode, where the two spin components are
displaced from each other against a harmonic restoring force. We prepare a
highly-imbalanced, or polaronic, spin mixture with a spin dipole excitation and
observe strong, unitarity limited damping of the spin dipole mode. In gases
with small spin imbalance, below the Pauli limit for superfluidity, we observe
strongly damped spin flow despite the presence of a superfluid core.
