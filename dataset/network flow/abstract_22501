Transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution and fragmentation functions
are described as Fourier transforms of matrix elementscontaining nonlocal
combinations of quark and gluon fields. These matrix elements also contain a
gauge link operator with a process dependent path, of which the process
dependence that can be traced back to the color flow in the process. Expanding
into irreducible tensors built from the transverse momenta $p_\st$, we can
define a universal set of TMD correlators of definite rank with a well-defined
operator structure.
