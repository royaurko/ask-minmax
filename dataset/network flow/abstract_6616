We study the growth of London's street-network in its dual representation, as
the city has evolved over the last 224 years. The dual representation of a
planar graph is a content-based network, where each node is a set of edges of
the planar graph, and represents a transportation unit in the so-called
information space, i.e. the space where information is handled in order to
navigate through the city. First, we discuss a novel hybrid technique to
extract dual graphs from planar graphs, called the hierarchical intersection
continuity negotiation principle. Then we show that the growth of the network
can be analytically described by logistic laws and that the topological
properties of the network are governed by robust lognormal distributions
characterising the network's connectivity and small-world properties that are
consistent over time. Moreover, we find that the double-Pareto-like
distributions for the connectivity emerge for major roads and can be modelled
via a stochastic content-based network model using simple space filling
principles.
