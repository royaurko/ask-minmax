We investigate the impact of external periodic potentials on superdiffusive
random walks known as Levy flights and show that even strongly superdiffusive
transport is substantially affected by the external field. Unlike ordinary
random walks, Levy flights are surprisingly sensitive to the shape of the
potential while their asymptotic behavior ceases to depend on the Levy index
$\mu $. Our analysis is based on a novel generalization of the Fokker-Planck
equation suitable for systems in thermal equilibrium. Thus, the results
presented are applicable to the large class of situations in which
superdiffusion is caused by topological complexity, such as diffusion on folded
polymers and scale-free networks.
