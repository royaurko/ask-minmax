In this work we propose the use of a hirarchical extension of the
polygonality index as a means to characterize and model geographical networks:
each node is associated with the spatial position of the nodes, while the edges
of the network are defined by progressive connectivity adjacencies. Through the
analysis of such networks, while relating its topological and geometrical
properties, it is possible to obtain important indications about the
development dynamics of the networks under analysis. The potential of the
methodology is illustrated with respect to synthetic geographical networks.
