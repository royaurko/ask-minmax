We study the spectral flow of the hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator $\ham(m)$
as a function of $m$ in smooth SU(2) instanton backgrounds on the lattice. For
a single instanton background with Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\ham(m)$,
we find a level crossing in the spectral flow of $\ham(m)$, and we find the
shape of the crossing mode at the crossing point to be in good agreement with
the zero mode associated with the single instanton background. With
anti-periodic boundary conditions on $\ham(m)$, we find that the instanton
background in the singular gauge has the correct spectral flow but the one in
regular gauge does not. We also investigate the spectral flows of two instanton
and instanton-anti-instanton backgrounds.
