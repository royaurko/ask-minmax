Substantial collective flow is observed in collisions between Lead nuclei at
LHC as evidenced by the azimuthal correlations in the transverse momentum
distributions of the produced particles. Our calculations indicate that the
Global v1-flow, which at RHIC peaked at negative rapidities (named as 3rd flow
component or anti-flow), now at LHC is going to turn toward forward rapidities
(to the same side and direction as the projectile residue). Potentially this
can provide a sensitive barometer to estimate the pressure and transport
properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. Our calculations also take into account
the initial state Center of Mass rapidity fluctuations, and demonstrate that
these are crucial for v1 simulations. In order to better study the transverse
momentum flow dependence we suggest a new "symmetrized" v1S flow component; and
we also propose a new method to disentangle Global v1 flow from the
contribution generated by the random fluctuations in the initial state. This
will enhance the possibilities of studying the collective Global v1 flow both
at the STAR Beam Energy Scan program and at LHC.
