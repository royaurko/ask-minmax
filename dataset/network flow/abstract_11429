Localization is a fundamental task for sensor networks. Traditional network
construction approaches allow to obtain localized networks requiring the nodes
to be at least tri-connected (in 2D), i.e., the communication graph needs to be
globally rigid. In this paper we exploit, besides the information on the
neighbors sensed by each robot/sensor, also the information about the lack of
communication among nodes. The result is a framework where the nodes are
required to be bi-connected and the communication graph has to be rigid. This
is possible considering a novel typology of link, namely Shadow Edges, that
account for the lack of communication among nodes and allow to reduce the
uncertainty associated to the position of the nodes.
