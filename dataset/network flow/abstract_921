We study the problem of scheduling maintenance on arcs of a capacitated
network so as to maximize the total flow from a source node to a sink node over
a set of time periods. Maintenance on an arc shuts down the arc for the
duration of the period in which its maintenance is scheduled, making its
capacity zero for that period. A set of arcs is designated to have maintenance
during the planning period, which will require each to be shut down for exactly
one time period. In general this problem is known to be NP-hard. Here we
identify a number of characteristics that are relevant for the complexity of
instance classes. In particular, we discuss instances with restrictions on the
set of arcs that have maintenance to be scheduled; series parallel networks;
capacities that are balanced, in the sense that the total capacity of arcs
entering a (non-terminal) node equals the total capacity of arcs leaving the
node; and identical capacities on all arcs.
