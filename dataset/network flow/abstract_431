The deployment of mobile femtocellular networks can enhance the service
quality for the users inside the vehicles. The deployment of mobile femtocells
generates a lot of handover calls. Also, numbers of group handover scenarios
are found in mobile femtocellular network deployment. The ability to seamlessly
switch between the femtocells and the macrocell networks is a key concern for
femtocell network deployment. However, until now there is no effective and
complete handover scheme for the mobile femtocell network deployment. Also
handover between the backhaul networks is a major concern for the mobile
femtocellular network deployment. In this paper, we propose handover control
between the access networks for the individual handover cases. Call flows for
the handover between the backhaul networks of the macrocell-to-macrocell case
are proposed in this paper. We also propose the link switching for the FSO
based backhaul networks. The proposed resource allocation scheme ensures the
negligible handover call dropping probability as well as higher bandwidth
utilization.
