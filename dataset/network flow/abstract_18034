The cloud-radio access network (CRAN) is expected to be the core network
architecture for next generation mobile radio system. In this paper, we
consider the downlink of a CRAN formed of one central processor (the cloud) and
several base-station (BS), where each BS is connected to the cloud via either a
wireless or capacity-limited wireline backhaul link. The paper addresses the
joint design of the hybrid backhaul links (i.e., designing the wireline and
wireless backhaul connections from cloud to BSs) and the access links (i.e.,
determining the sparse beamforming solution from the BSs to the users). The
paper formulates the hybrid backhaul and access link design problem by
minimizing the total network power consumption. The paper solves the problem
using a two-stage heuristic algorithm. At one stage, the sparse beamforming
solution is found using a weighted mixed $\ell_1/\ell_2$ norm minimization
approach; the correlation matrix of the quantization noise of the wireline
backhaul links is computed using the classical rate-distortion theory. At the
second stage, the transmit powers of the wireless backhaul links are found by
solving a power minimization problem subject to quality-of-service constraints,
based on the principle of conservation of rate by utilizing the rates found in
the first stage. Simulation results suggest that the performance of the
proposed algorithm approaches the global optimum solution, especially at high
SINR.
