We propose a spectrum for a class of gauged non-compact G/Ad(H) WZNW models,
including spectrally flowed images of highest, lowest, and mixed extremal
weight modules. These are combined into blocks whose characters, due to the
Lorentzian signature of the target space, are divergent and treated as formal
expressions in need of regularisation. Assuming that this is possible, we show
that these extended characters transform linearly under modular
transformations, and can be used to write down modular invariant partition
functions.
