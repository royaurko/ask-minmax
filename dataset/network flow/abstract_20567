We study a singular-limit problem arising in the modelling of chemical
reactions. At finite {\epsilon} > 0, the system is described by a Fokker-Planck
convection-diffusion equation with a double-well convection potential. This
potential is scaled by 1/{\epsilon}, and in the limit {\epsilon} -> 0, the
solution concentrates onto the two wells, resulting into a limiting system that
is a pair of ordinary differential equations for the density at the two wells.
This convergence has been proved in Peletier, Savar\'e, and Veneroni, SIAM
Journal on Mathematical Analysis, 42(4):1805-1825, 2010, using the linear
structure of the equation. In this paper we re-prove the result by using solely
the Wasserstein gradient-flow structure of the system. In particular we make no
use of the linearity, nor of the fact that it is a second-order system. The
first key step in this approach is a reformulation of the equation as the
minimization of an action functional that captures the property of being a
curve of maximal slope in an integrated form. The second important step is a
rescaling of space. Using only the Wasserstein gradient-flow structure, we
prove that the sequence of rescaled solutions is pre-compact in an appropriate
topology. We then prove a Gamma-convergence result for the functional in this
topology, and we identify the limiting functional and the differential equation
that it represents. A consequence of these results is that solutions of the
{\epsilon}-problem converge to a solution of the limiting problem.
