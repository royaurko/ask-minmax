The acceleration of the expansion of the universe has been argued for by
several research groups. If the universe is accelerating and if the universe or
some part of the universe has a charge, then there may be electromagnetic
radiation produced from the acceleration of the universe since accelerating
charges produce electromagnetic radiation. This letter does a thought
experiment to ask about the possible characteristics of the radiation from an
accelerating universe. A value for the power, or rate of energy flow, of the
universe's acceleration is calculated in this letter. A value of the power of
the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the universe's acceleration is
calculated to be P = 5.99 x 10 -82 Joule/sec or 5.99 x 10 -82 Watts. This value
for the power assumes only the charge of an electron as the value for the
charge; larger charges would produce much larger rates of energy flow. The
letter then reveals what a characteristic of a charged, accelerating universe
would be.
