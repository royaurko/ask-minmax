We present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression based framework
for 2-D/3-D medical image registration, which directly estimates the
transformation parameters from image features extracted from the DRR and the
X-ray images using learned hierarchical regressors. Our framework consists of
learning and application stages. In the learning stage, CNN regressors are
trained using supervised machine learning to reveal the correlation between the
transformation parameters and the image features. In the application stage, CNN
regressors are applied on extracted image features in a hierarchical manner to
estimate the transformation parameters. Our experiment results demonstrate that
the proposed method can achieve real-time 2-D/3-D registration with very high
(i.e., sub-milliliter) accuracy.
