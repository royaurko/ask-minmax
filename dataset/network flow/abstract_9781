Two-temperature spherical accretion flows produce $\approx 100$ Mev
gamma-rays from the decay of neutral pions created in proton-proton collisions
close to the black hole; they also produce $\sim 10$ keV X-rays by
bremsstrahlung emission at large radii. The gamma-ray to X-ray luminosity ratio
is nearly independent of black hole mass and accretion rate. It does depend
sensitively on the radial density profile of the accretion flow through the
parameter a, where $n \propto r^{-a}$. For the canonical Bondi value of a =
3/2, the gamma-ray to X-ray luminosity ratio is $\approx 30$. We interpret a
recent Chandra detection coincident with the massive black hole at the Galactic
Center as being thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the accretion flow. With
this normalization, the expected gamma-ray luminosity is $\approx 10^{35}$ ergs
s$^{-1}$ if a = 3/2. This is nearly two orders of magnitude above the detection
threshold of the GLAST telescope. For $a \approx 1/2$, however, (a value
suggested by recent theoretical arguments), the expected gamma-ray luminosity
is only $\approx 10^{29}$ ergs s$^{-1}$; GLAST should therefore provide an
important probe of the true accretion rate and radial density profile of the
accretion flow onto Sgr A*.
