This paper investigates design of noncooperative games from an optimization
and control theoretic perspective. Pricing mechanisms are used as a design tool
to ensure that the Nash equilibrium of a fairly general class of noncooperative
games satisfies certain global objectives such as welfare maximization or
achieving a certain level of quality-of-service (QoS). The class of games
considered provide a theoretical basis for decentralized resource allocation
and control problems including network congestion control, wireless uplink
power control, and optical power control. The game design problem is analyzed
under different knowledge assumptions (full versus limited information) and
design objectives (QoS versus utility maximization) for separable and
non-separable utility functions. The ``price of anarchy'' is shown not to be an
inherent feature of full-information games that incorporate pricing mechanisms.
Moreover, a simple linear pricing is shown to be sufficient for design of Nash
equilibrium according to a chosen global objective for a fairly general class
of games. Stability properties of the game and pricing dynamics are studied
under the assumption of time-scale separation and in two separate time-scales.
Thus, sufficient conditions are derived, which allow the designer to place the
Nash equilibrium solution or to guide the system trajectory to a desired region
or point. The obtained results are illustrated with a number of examples.
