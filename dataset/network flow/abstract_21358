We estimate the effective area available for cosmic-ray detection with a
network of smartphones under optimistic conditions. To measure cosmic-ray air
showers with a minimally-adequate precision and a detection area similar to
existing ground-based detectors, the fraction of participating users needs to
unrealistically large. We conclude that the prospects of cosmic-ray research
using smartphones are very limited.
