The self-excitation of magnetic field by a spiral Couette flow between two
coaxial cylinders is considered. We solve numerically the fully nonlinear,
three-dimensional MHD equations for magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm (ratio of
kinematic viscosity to magnetic diffusivity) between 0.14 and 10 and kinematic
and magnetic Reynolds numbers up to about 2000. In the initial stage of
exponential field growth (kinematic dynamo regime), we find that the dynamo
switches from one distinct regime to another as the radial width \delta r_B$ of
the magnetic field distribution becomes smaller than the separation of the
field maximum from the flow boundary. The saturation of magnetic field growth
is due to a reduction in the velocity shear resulting mainly from the
azimuthally and axially averaged part of the Lorentz force, which agrees with
an asymptotic result for the limit of Pm<<1. In the parameter regime
considered, the magnetic energy decreases with kinematic Reynolds number as
Re^{-0.84}, which is approximately as predicted by the nonlinear asymptotic
theory (\sim Re^{-1}). However, when the velocity field is maintained by a
volume force (rather than by viscous stress) the dependence of magnetic energy
on the kinematic Reynolds number is much weaker.
