We analyze complex networks under random matrix theory framework.
Particularly, we show that $\Delta_3$ statistic, which gives information about
the long range correlations among eigenvalues, provides a qualitative measure
of randomness in networks. As networks deviate from the regular structure,
$\Delta_3$ follows random matrix prediction of linear behavior, in
semi-logarithmic scale with the slope of $1/\pi^2$, for the longer scale.
