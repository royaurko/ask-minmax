In "On Coding for Reliable Communication over Packet Networks" (Lun, Medard,
and Effros, Proc. 42nd Annu. Allerton Conf. Communication, Control, and
Computing, 2004), a capacity-achieving coding scheme for unicast or multicast
over lossy wireline or wireless packet networks is presented. We extend that
paper's results in two ways: First, we extend the network model to allow
packets received on a link to arrive according to any process with an average
rate, as opposed to the assumption of Poisson traffic with i.i.d. losses that
was previously made. Second, in the case of Poisson traffic with i.i.d. losses,
we derive error exponents that quantify the rate at which the probability of
error decays with coding delay.
