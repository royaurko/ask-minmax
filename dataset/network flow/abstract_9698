The implementation of full-duplex (FD) radio in wireless communications is a
potential approach for achieving higher spectral efficiency. A possible
application is its employment in the next generation of cellular networks.
However, the performance of large-scale FD multiuser networks is an area mostly
unexplored. Most of the related work focuses on the performance analysis of
small-scale networks or on loop interference cancellation schemes. In this
paper, we derive the outage probability performance of large-scale FD cellular
networks in the context of two architectures: two-node and three-node. We show
how the performance is affected with respect to the model's parameters and
provide a comparison between the two architectures.
