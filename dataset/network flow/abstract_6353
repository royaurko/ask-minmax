In this paper we examine a number of methods for probing and understanding
the large-scale structure of networks that evolve over time. We focus in
particular on citation networks, networks of references between documents such
as papers, patents, or court cases. We describe three different methods of
analysis, one based on an expectation-maximization algorithm, one based on
modularity optimization, and one based on eigenvector centrality. Using the
network of citations between opinions of the United States Supreme Court as an
example, we demonstrate how each of these methods can reveal significant
structural divisions in the network, and how, ultimately, the combination of
all three can help us develop a coherent overall picture of the network's
shape.
