Control/command processes require a transmission system with some
characteristics like high reliability, low latency and strong guarantees on
messages delivery. Concerning wire networks, field buses technologies like FIP
offer this kind of service (periodic tasks, real time constraints...).
Unfortunately, few wireless technologies can propose a communication system
which respects such constraints. Indeed, wireless transmissions must deal with
medium characteristics which make impossible the direct translation of
mechanisms used with wire networks. The purpose of this paper is to present an
original Medium Access Control (MAC) layer for a real time Low Power-Wireless
Personal Area Network (LP-WPAN). The proposed MAC-layer has been validated by
several complementary methods; in this paper, we focus on the specific
Simultaneous Guaranteed Time Slot (SGTS) part.
