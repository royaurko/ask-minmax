We consider the general problem of finding the minimum weight b-matching on
arbitrary graphs. We prove that, whenever the linear programming relaxation of
the problem has no fractional solutions, then the cavity or belief propagation
equations converge to the correct solution both for synchronous and
asynchronous updating.
