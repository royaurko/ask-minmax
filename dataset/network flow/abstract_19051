We propose a simple neural network model to deal with the domain adaptation
problem in object recognition. Our model incorporates the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) measure as a regularization in the supervised learning to
reduce the distribution mismatch between the source and target domains in the
latent space. From experiments, we demonstrate that the MMD regularization is
an effective tool to provide good domain adaptation models on both SURF
features and raw image pixels of a particular image data set. We also show that
our proposed model, preceded by the denoising auto-encoder pretraining,
achieves better performance than recent benchmark models on the same data sets.
This work represents the first study of MMD measure in the context of neural
networks.
