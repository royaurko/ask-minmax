We extend the analysis of the renormalization group flow in the
two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling using the recently
developed temperature flow formalism. We investigate the interplay of d-density
wave and Fermi surface deformation tendencies with those towards d-wave pairing
and antiferromagnetism. For a ratio of next nearest to nearest neighbor
hoppings, t'/t=-0.25, and band fillings where the Fermi surface is inside the
Umklapp surface, only the d-pairing susceptibility diverges at low
temperatures. When the Fermi surface intersects the Umklapp surface close to
the saddle points, d-wave pairing, d-density wave, antiferromagnetic and, to a
weaker extent, d-wave Fermi surface deformation susceptibilities grow together
when the interactions flow to strong coupling. We interpret these findings as
indications for a non-trivial strongly coupled phase with short-ranged
superconducting and antiferromagnetic correlations, in close analogy with the
spin liquid ground state in the well-understood two-leg Hubbard ladder.
