Much interest has been taken in understanding the global routing structure of
the Internet, both to model and protect the current structures and to modify
the structure to improve resilience. These studies rely on trace-routes and
algorithmic inference to resolve individual IP addresses into connected
routers, yielding a network of routers. Using WHOIS registries, parsing of DNS
registries, as well as simple latency-based triangulation, these routers can
often be geolocated to at least their country of origin, if not specific
regions. In this work, we use node subgraph summary statistics to present
evidence that the router-level (IPv4) network is spatially embedded, with the
similarity (or dissimilarity) of a node from it's neighbor strongly correlating
with the attributes of other routers residing in the same country or region. We
discuss these results in context of the recently proposed gravity models of the
Internet, as well as the potential application to geolocation inferrence.
