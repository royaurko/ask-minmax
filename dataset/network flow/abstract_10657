Designing high performance channel assignment schemes to harness the
potential of multi-radio multi-channel deployments in wireless mesh networks
(WMNs) is an active research domain. A pragmatic channel assignment approach
strives to maximize network capacity by restraining the endemic interference
and mitigating its adverse impact on network performance. Interference
prevalent in WMNs is multi-faceted, radio co-location interference (RCI) being
a crucial aspect that is seldom addressed in research endeavors. In this
effort, we propose a set of intelligent channel assignment algorithms, which
focus primarily on alleviating the RCI. These graph theoretic schemes are
structurally inspired by the spatio-statistical characteristics of
interference. We present the theoretical design foundations for each of the
proposed algorithms, and demonstrate their potential to significantly enhance
network capacity in comparison to some well-known existing schemes. We also
demonstrate the adverse impact of radio co- location interference on the
network, and the efficacy of the proposed schemes in successfully mitigating
it. The experimental results to validate the proposed theoretical notions were
obtained by running an exhaustive set of ns-3 simulations in IEEE 802.11g/n
environments.
