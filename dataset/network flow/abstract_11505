A mobile ad hoc network (MANET), is a self-configuring network of mobile
devices connected by wireless links. In order to achieve stable clusters, the
cluster-heads maintaining the cluster should be stable with minimum overhead of
cluster re-elections. In this paper we propose a Probability Based Adaptive
Invoked Weighted Clustering Algorithm (PAIWCA) which can enhance the stability
of the clusters by taking battery power of the nodes into considerations for
the clustering formation and electing stable cluster-heads using cluster head
probability of a node. In this simulation study a comparison was conducted to
measure the performance of our algorithm with maximal weighted independent set
(MWIS) in terms of the number of clusters formed, the connectivity of the
network, dominant set updates,throughput of the overall network and packet
delivery ratio. The result shows that our algorithm performs better than
existing one and is also tunable to different kinds of network conditions.
