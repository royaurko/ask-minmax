We develop a new method for proving that a flow has the so-called strong
convolution singularity property, i.e. the Gaussian system induced by its
(reduced) maximal spectral type has simple spectrum. We use these methods to
give examples of smooth flows on closed orientable surfaces of genus at least 2
with a weaker property: each of their maximal spectral types $\sigma$ is such
that the Gaussian system induced by $\sigma$ has simple spectrum on the
so-called 3rd chaos (i.e. $V_\sigma^{\odot 3}$ has simple spectrum).
