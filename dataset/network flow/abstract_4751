We present results on modeling solar pores and sunspots using 2D axisymmetric
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. These models are helpful for
understanding the mechanisms of magnetic field concentration in sunspots, and
the large-scale flow patterns associated with them. The simulations provide
consistent, self-maintained, although not fully realistic, models of
concentrated magnetic field near the solar surface. In this paper, we explore
under which conditions the associated flows are converging or diverging near
the surface. We find that in most cases in which a stable, pore-like
concentration of magnetic field forms, a configuration with converging over
diverging flow is established.
