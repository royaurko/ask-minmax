In this paper, we investigate the controllability of an underwater vehicle
immersed in an infinite volume of an inviscid fluid whose flow is assumed to be
irrotational. Taking as control input the flow of the fluid through a part of
the boundary of the rigid body, we obtain a finite-dimensional system similar
to Kirchhoff laws in which the control input appears through both linear terms
(with time derivative) and bilinear terms. Applying Coron's return method, we
establish some local controllability results for the position and velocities of
the underwater vehicle. Examples with six, four, or only three controls inputs
are given for a vehicule with an ellipsoidal shape.
