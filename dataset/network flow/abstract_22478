We show that periodic lattice of Abrikosov vortices in chiral $p$ wave
superconductor in general supports fermionic states with zero energy provided
the intervortex distance is smaller than the critical one. The zero modes
appear at the intersection with the Fermi level of electronic magnetic Bloch
bands formed by the overlapping vortex core states. The Bloch bands are robust
against lattice disorder induced by fluctuations of vortex positions and can
transmit the energy flow across the lattice. The hallmark of zero modes on
Bloch bands in electronic heat conductivity is discussed.
