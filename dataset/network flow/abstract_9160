Elementary flux modes (EFMs) are pathways through a metabolic reaction
network that connect external substrates to products. Using EFMs, a metabolic
network can be transformed into its macroscopic counterpart, in which the
internal metabolites have been eliminated and only external metabolites remain.
In EFMs-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA) experimentally determined external
fluxes are used to estimate the flux of each EFM. It is in general prohibitive
to enumerate all EFMs for complex networks, since the number of EFMs increases
rapidly with network complexity. In this work we present an optimization-based
method that dynamically generates a subset of EFMs and solves the EFMs-based
MFA problem simultaneously. The obtained subset contains EFMs that contribute
to the optimal solution of the EFMs-based MFA problem. The usefulness of our
method was examined in a case-study using data from a Chinese hamster ovary
cell culture and two networks of varied complexity. It was demonstrated that
the EFMs-based MFA problem could be solved at a low computational cost, even
for the more complex network. Additionally, only a fraction of the total number
of EFMs was needed to compute the optimal solution.
