UWB has a very large bandwidth in a WPAN network, which is best used for
HD-video applications. Meanwhile, MBWA is a WMAN option optimized for
wireless-IP in a fast moving vehicle. In this paper, we propose a practical
engineering scenario that harnesses simultaneously the distinctive feature of
both UWB and MBWA. However, this in-proximity operation of the technologies
will inevitably cause mutual interference to both systems. In light of this, as
a preliminary phase to coexistence, we have derived, under various
circumstances, the maximum interference power limit that needs to be respected
in order to ensure an acceptable system performance as requested by the new
IEEE 802.20 standard.
