Using a viscosity-based survival scale for geometrical perturbations formed
in the early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, we model the radial
flow velocity during freeze-out. Subsequently, we employ the Cooper-Frye
freeze-out prescription, with first-order viscous corrections to the
distribution function, to obtain the transverse momentum distribution of
particle yields and flow harmonics. For initial eccentricities, we use the
results of Monte Carlo Glauber model. We fix the blast-wave model parameters by
fitting the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) and demonstrate that this leads to a fairly good
agreement with transverse momentum distribution of elliptic and triangular flow
for various centralities. Within this viscous blast-wave model, we estimate the
shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s\simeq 0.24$ at the LHC.
