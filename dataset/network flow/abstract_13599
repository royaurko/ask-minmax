We present a model for the effect of stress on thin amorphous films that
develop atop ion-irradiated silicon, based on the mechanism of ion-induced
anisotropic plastic flow. Using only parameters directly measured or known to
high accuracy, the model exhibits remarkably good agreement with the
wavelengths of experimentally-observed patterns, and agrees qualitatively with
limited data on ripple propagation speed. The predictions of the model are
discussed in the context of other mechanisms recently theorized to explain the
wavelengths, including extensive comparison with an alternate model of stress.
