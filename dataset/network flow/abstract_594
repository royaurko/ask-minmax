We study the existence of multiple equilibrium states in a simple fluid
network using Newtonian fluids and laminar flow. We demonstrate theoretically
the presence of hysteresis and bistability, and we confirm these predictions in
an experiment using two miscible fluids of different viscosity--sucrose
solution and water. Possible applications include bloodflow, microfluidics, and
other network flows governed by similar principles.
