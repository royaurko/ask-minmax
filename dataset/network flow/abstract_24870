Fifth-generation cellular networks are expected to exhibit at least three
primary physical-layer differences relative to fourth-generation ones:
millimeter-wave propagation, antenna-array directionality, and densification of
base stations. In this paper, the effects of these differences on the
performance of single-carrier frequency-domain multiple-access uplink systems
with frequency hopping are assessed. A new analysis, which is much more
detailed than any other in the existing literature and accommodates actual
base-station topologies, captures the primary features of uplink
communications. Distance-dependent power-law, shadowing, and fading models
based on millimeter-wave measurements are introduced. The beneficial effects of
base-station densification, highly directional sectorization, and frequency
hopping are illustrated.
