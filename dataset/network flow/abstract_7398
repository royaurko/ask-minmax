The paper analyzes traffic data of the Dutch freeway A9 with respect to
certain aspects which are relevant for traffic flow modeling as well as the
calibration of model parameters and functions. Apart from the dynamic velocity
distribution, the density-dependence and the temporal evolution of various,
partly lane-specific quantities is investigated. The results are well
compatible with recent macroscopic traffic flow models which have been derived
from the dynamics of driver-vehicle units. These have also solved the
inconsistencies, which previous models have been criticized for.
