If simplicity is a key strategy for success as a network protocol OpenFlow is
not winning. At its core OpenFlow presents a simple idea, which is a network
switch data plane abstraction along with a control protocol for manipulating
that abstraction. The result of this idea has been far from simple: a new
version released each year, five active versions, com- plex feature
dependencies, unstable version negotiation, lack of state machine definition,
etc. This complexity represents roadblocks for network, software, and hardware
engineers.
  We have distilled the core abstractions present in 5 existing versions of
OpenFlow and refactored them into a simple API called tinyNBI. Our work does
not provide high-level network abstractions (address pools, VPN maps, etc.),
instead it focuses on providing a clean low level interface that supports the
development of these higher layer abstractions. The goal of tinyNBI is to allow
configuration of all existing OpenFlow abstractions without having to deal with
the unique personalities of each version of OpenFlow or their level of support
in target switches.
