Radio network deployment and coverage optimization are critical to
next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, the problem of optimally
deciding on whether to install additional small cells or to upgrade current
macrocell base stations (BSs) with massive antenna arrays is studied. This
integrated deployment problem is cast as a general integer optimization model
by using the facility location framework. The capacity limits of both the radio
access link and the backhaul link are considered. The problem is shown to be an
extension of the modular capacitated location problem (MCLP) which is known to
be NP-hard. To solve the problem, a novel deployment algorithm that uses
Lagrangian relaxation and tabu local search is proposed. The developed tabu
search is shown to have a two-level structure and to be able to search the
solution space thoroughly. Simulation results show how the proposed, optimal
approach to upgrading an existing wireless network infrastructure can make use
of a combination of both small cells and BSs with massive antennas. The results
also show that the proposed algorithm can find the optimal solution effectively
while having a computational time that is up to 30% lower than that of
conventional algorithms.
