We study the tailoring of structured random graph ensembles to real networks,
with the objective of generating precise and practical mathematical tools for
quantifying and comparing network topologies macroscopically, beyond the level
of degree statistics. Our family of ensembles can produce graphs with any
prescribed degree distribution and any degree-degree correlation function, its
control parameters can be calculated fully analytically, and as a result we can
calculate (asymptotically) formulae for entropies and complexities, and for
information-theoretic distances between networks, expressed directly and
explicitly in terms of their measured degree distribution and degree
correlations.
