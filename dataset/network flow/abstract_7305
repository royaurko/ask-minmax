We investigate the dynamics of the discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger
equation in fully connected networks. For a localized initial condition the
exact solution shows the existence of two dynamical transitions as a function
of the nonlinearity parameter, a hyperbolic and a trigonometric one. In the
latter the network behaves exactly as the corresponding linear one but with a
renormalized frequency.
