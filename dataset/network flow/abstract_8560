Recently Stochastic Kronecker Graph (SKG), a network generation model, and
vertex-centric BSP, a graph processing framework like Pregel, have attracted
much attention in the network analysis community. Unfortunately the two are not
very well-suited for each other and thus an implementation of SKG on
vertex-centric BSP must either be done serially or in an unnatural manner.
  In this paper, we present a new network generation model, which we call
Poisson Stochastic Kronecker Graph (PSKG), that generate edges according to the
Poisson distribution. The advantage of PSKG is that it is easily parallelizable
on vertex-centric BSP, requires no communication between computational nodes,
and yet retains all the desired properties of SKG.
