The transverse profile dependence of elliptic flow is studied in a parton
cascade model. We compare results from the binary scaling profile to results
from the wounded nucleon scaling profile. The impact parameter dependence of
elliptic flow is shown to depend sensitively on the transverse profile of
initial particles, however, if elliptic flow is plotted as a function of the
relative multiplicity, the nuclear profile dependence disappears. The
insensitivity was found previously in a hydrodynamical calculation. Our
calculations indicate that the insensitivity is also valid with additional
viscous corrections. In addition, the minimum bias differential elliptic flow
is demonstrated to be insensitive to the nuclear profile of the system.
