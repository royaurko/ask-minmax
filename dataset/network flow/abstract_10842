Phoretic self-propulsion is a unique example of force- and torque-free motion
on small scales. The classical framework describing the flow field around a
particle swimming by self-diffusiophoresis neglects the advection of the solute
field by the flow and assumes that the chemical interaction layer is thin
compared to the particle size. In this paper we quantify and characterize the
effect of solute advection on the phoretic swimming of a sphere. We first
rigorously derive the regime of validity of the thin-interaction layer
assumption at finite values of the P\'eclet number (Pe). Within this
assumption, we solve computationally the flow around Janus phoretic particles
and examine the impact of solute advection on propulsion and the flow created
by the particle. We demonstrate that although advection always leads to a
decrease of the swimming speed and flow stresslet at high values of the
P\'eclet number, an increase can be obtained at intermediate values of Pe. This
possible enhancement of swimming depends critically on the nature of the
chemical interactions between the solute and the surface. We then derive an
asymptotic analysis of the problem at small Pe allowing to rationalize our
computational results. Our computational and theoretical analysis is
accompanied by a parallel study of the role of reactive effects at the surface
of the particle on swimming (Damk\"ohler number).
