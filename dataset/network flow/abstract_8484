In this paper we propose game theoretic Medium Access Control (MAC)
strategies for data dissemination scenarios. In particular, we use energy-based
utility functions that inherently imply power-awareness, while we consider
network coding techniques to eliminate the necessity of exchanging
acknowledgement control packets. Simulation results show that our proposed
strategies enhance the energy efficiency of the system and reduce the
dissemination completion time compared to an optimized standard protocol.
