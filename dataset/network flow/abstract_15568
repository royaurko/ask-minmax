We introduce a distributed, cooperative framework and method for Bayesian
estimation and control in decentralized agent networks. Our framework combines
joint estimation of time-varying global and local states with
information-seeking control optimizing the behavior of the agents. It is suited
to nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems and, in particular, to location-aware
networks. For cooperative estimation, a combination of belief propagation
message passing and likelihood consensus is used. For cooperative control, the
negative posterior joint entropy of all states is maximized via a gradient
ascent. The estimation layer provides the control layer with probabilistic
information in the form of sample-based representations of probability
distributions. Simulation results demonstrate intelligent behavior of the
agents and excellent estimation performance for a simultaneous self-tracking
and target tracking problem. In a cooperative localization scenario with only
one anchor present, mobile agents can be localized after a short time with an
accuracy that is higher than the accuracy of the performed distance
measurements.
