We investigate the origin of the deviations from the classical Darcy law by
numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations in two-dimensional
disordered porous media. We apply the Forchheimer equation as a
phenomenological model to correlate the variations of the friction factor for
different porosities and flow conditions. At sufficiently high Reynolds
numbers, when inertia becomes relevant, we observe a transition from linear to
non-linear behavior which is typical of experiments. We find that such a
transition can be understood and statistically characterized in terms of the
spatial distribution of kinetic energy in the system.
