A non-parametric technique to identify weak sources within dense sensor
arrays is developed using a network approach. No knowledge about the
propagation medium is needed except that signal strengths decay to
insignificant levels within a scale that is shorter than the aperture. We then
reinterpret the spatial covariance matrix of a wave field as a matrix whose
support is a connectivity matrix of a network of vertices (sensors) connected
into communities. These communities correspond to sensor clusters associated
with individual sources. We estimate the support of the covariance matrix from
limited-time data using a robust hypothesis test combined with a physical
distance criterion. The latter ensures sufficient network sparsity to prevent
vertex communities from forming by chance. We verify the approach on simulated
data and quantify its reliability. The method is then applied to data from a
dense 5200 element geophone array that blanketed 7$\times$10 km of the city of
Long Beach (CA). The analysis exposes a helicopter traversing the array, oil
production facilities, and reveals that low-frequency events tend to occur near
roads.
