We present detailed, high spatial and spectral resolution, long-slit
observations of four central cluster galaxies (Abell 0085, 0133, 0644 and
Ophiuchus) recently obtained on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT).
Our sample consists of central cluster galaxies (CCGs) with previously-observed
H\alpha-filaments, and have existing data from the X-ray to radio wavelength
regimes available. Here, we present the detailed optical data over a broad
wavelength range to probe the spatially-resolved kinematics and stellar
populations of the stars. We use the Pegase.HR model with the ELODIE v3.1
stellar library to determine the star formation histories of the galaxies using
full spectrum fitting. We perform single stellar population (SSP) as well as
composite stellar population (CSP) fits to account for more complex star
formation histories. Monte-Carlo simulations and \chi 2-maps are used to check
the reliability of the solutions. This, combined with the other multiwavelength
data, will form a complete view of the different phases (hot and cold gas and
stars) and how they interact in the processes of star formation and feedback
detected in central galaxies in cooling flow clusters, as well as the influence
of the host cluster. We find small, young stellar components in at least three
of the four galaxies, even though two of the three host clusters have zero
spectrally-derived mass deposition rates from X-ray observations.
