We consider a situation in which two metrics are joined at a null
hypersurface. It often occurs that the union of the two metrics gives rise to a
Ricci tensor that contains a term proportional to a Dirac delta-function
supported on the hypersurface. This singularity is associated with a thin
distribution of matter on the hypersurface, and following Barrabes and Israel,
we seek to determine its stress-energy tensor in terms of the geometric
properties of the null hypersurface. While our treatment here does not deviate
strongly from their previous work, it offers a simplification of the
computational operations involved in a typical application of the formalism,
and it gives rise to a stress-energy tensor that possesses a more recognizable
phenomenology. Our reformulation of the null-shell formalism makes systematic
use of the null generators of the singular hypersurface, which define a
preferred flow to which the flow of matter can be compared. This construction
provides the stress-energy tensor with a simple characterization in terms of a
mass density, a mass current, and an isotropic pressure. Our reformulation also
involves a family of freely-moving observers that intersect the surface layer
and perform measurements on it. This construction gives operational meaning to
the stress-energy tensor by fixing the argument of the delta-function to be
proper time as measured by these observers.
