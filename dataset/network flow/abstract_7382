Jets and outflows are known to form out of advective accretion flows around
black holes. Hard photons from the centrifugal barrier directly hit the
electrons and deposit momentum on them. For optically thick flows such
deposition is not efficient, but for optically thin flows matter could be
accelerated to relativistic speed. In fact, even bound matter could be made
free through successive deposition. We discuss these possibilities.
