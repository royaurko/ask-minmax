We show that 1/f noise is produced in a 3D electron glass by charge
fluctuations due to electrons hopping between isolated sites and a percolating
network at low temperatures. The low frequency noise spectrum goes as
\omega^{-\alpha} with \alpha slightly larger than 1. This result together with
the temperature dependence of \alpha and the noise amplitude are in good
agreement with the recent experiments. These results hold true both with a
flat, noninteracting density of states and with a density of states that
includes Coulomb interactions. In the latter case, the density of states has a
Coulomb gap that fills in with increasing temperature. For a large Coulomb gap
width, this density of states gives a dc conductivity with a hopping exponent
of approximately 0.75 which has been observed in recent experiments. For a
small Coulomb gap width, the hopping exponent approximately 0.5.
