The packet is the fundamental unit of transportation in modern communication
networks such as the Internet. Physical layer scheduling decisions are made at
the level of packets, and packet-level models with exogenous arrival processes
have long been employed to study network performance, as well as design
scheduling policies that more efficiently utilize network resources. On the
other hand, a user of the network is more concerned with end-to-end bandwidth,
which is allocated through congestion control policies such as TCP.
Utility-based flow-level models have played an important role in understanding
congestion control protocols. In summary, these two classes of models have
provided separate insights for flow-level and packet-level dynamics of a
network.
