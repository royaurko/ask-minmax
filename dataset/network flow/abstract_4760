We prove that solutions of a mildly regularized Perona-Malik equation
converge, in a slow time scale, to solutions of the total variation flow. The
convergence result is global-in-time, and holds true in any space dimension.
The proof is based on the general principle that "the limit of gradient-flows
is the gradient-flow of the limit". To this end, we exploit a general result
relating the Gamma-limit of a sequence of functionals to the limit of the
corresponding maximal slope curves.
