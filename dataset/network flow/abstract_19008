We point out the existence of transition from partial to global generalized
synchronization (GS) in symmetrically coupled regular networks (array, ring,
global and star) of distinctly different time-delay systems of different orders
using the auxiliary system approach and the mutual false nearest neighbor
method. It is established that there exists a common GS manifold even in an
ensemble of structurlly nonidentical time-delay systems with different fractal
dimensions and we find that GS occurs simultaneously with phase synchronization
(PS) in these networks. We calculate the maximal transverse Lyapunov exponent
to evaluate the asymptotic stability of the complete synchronization manifold
of each of the main and the corresponding auxiliary systems, which, in turn,
ensures the stability of the GS manifold between the main systems. Further, we
also estimate the correlation coefficient and the correlation of probability of
recurrence to establish the relation between GS and PS. We also deduce an
analytical stability condition for partial and global GS using the
Krasovskii-Lyapunov theory.
