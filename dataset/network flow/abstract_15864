This paper considers a multi-user single-relay wireless network, where the
relay gets paid for helping the users forward signals, and the users pay to
receive the relay service. We study the relay power allocation and pricing
problems, and model the interaction between the users and the relay as a
two-level Stackelberg game. In this game, the relay, modeled as the service
provider and the leader of the game, sets the relay price to maximize its
revenue; while the users are modeled as customers and the followers who buy
power from the relay for higher transmission rates. We use a bargaining game to
model the negotiation among users to achieve a fair allocation of the relay
power. Based on the proposed fair relay power allocation rule, the optimal
relay power price that maximizes the relay revenue is derived analytically.
Simulation shows that the proposed power allocation scheme achieves higher
network sum-rate and relay revenue than the even power allocation. Furthermore,
compared with the sum-rate-optimal solution, simulation shows that the proposed
scheme achieves better fairness with comparable network sum-rate for a wide
range of network scenarios. The proposed pricing and power allocation solutions
are also shown to be consistent with the laws of supply and demand.
