Objective of the current work is to develop an Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) engine for information Just In Time (iJIT) system that can be used for
recognition of handwritten textual annotations of lower case Roman script.
Tesseract open source OCR engine under Apache License 2.0 is used to develop
user-specific handwriting recognition models, viz., the language sets, for the
said system, where each user is identified by a unique identification tag
associated with the digital pen. To generate the language set for any user,
Tesseract is trained with labeled handwritten data samples of isolated and
free-flow texts of Roman script, collected exclusively from that user. The
designed system is tested on five different language sets with free- flow
handwritten annotations as test samples. The system could successfully segment
and subsequently recognize 87.92%, 81.53%, 92.88%, 86.75% and 90.80%
handwritten characters in the test samples of five different users.
