We investigate some aspects of the renormalization group flow of gravity in
the presence of fermions, which have remained somewhat puzzling so far. The
first is the sign of the fermionic contribution to the running of Newton's
constant, which depends on details of the cutoff. We argue that only one of the
previously used schemes correctly implements the cutoff on eigenvalues of the
Dirac operator, and it acts in the sense of screening Newton's constant. We
also show that K\"ahler fermions give the same contribution to the running of
the cosmological and Newton constant as four Dirac spinors. We then calculate
the graviton contributions to the beta functions by imposing the cutoffs on the
irreducible spin components of the tetrad. In this way we can probe the gauge
dependence of the off-shell flow. The results resemble closely those of the
metric formalism, except for an increased scheme-- and (off shell)
gauge--dependence.
