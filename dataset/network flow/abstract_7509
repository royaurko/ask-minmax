The embedding diagrams of representations of the N=2 superconformal algebra
with central charge c=3 are given. Some non-unitary representations possess
subsingular vectors that are systematically described. The structure of the
embedding diagrams is largely defined by the spectral flow symmetry. As an
additional consistency check the action of the spectral flow on the characters
is calculated.
