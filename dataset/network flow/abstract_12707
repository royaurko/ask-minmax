This article describes the implementation of a system designed to
automatically detect the presence of pulmonary embolism in lung scans. These
images are firstly segmented, before alignment and feature extraction using
PCA. The neural network was trained using the Hybrid Monte Carlo method,
resulting in a committee of 250 neural networks and good results are obtained.
