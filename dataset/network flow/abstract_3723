Flow cytometry is a widespread single-cell measurement technology with a
multitude of clinical and research applications. Interpretation of flow
cytometry data is hard; the instrumentation is delicate and can not render
absolute measurements, hence samples can only be interpreted in relation to
each other while at the same time comparisons are confounded by inter-sample
variation. Despite this, current automated flow cytometry data analysis methods
either treat samples individually or ignore the variation by for example
pooling the data. In this article we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model
for studying latent relations between cell populations in flow cytometry
samples, thereby systematizing inter-sample variation. The model is applied to
a data set containing replicated flow cytometry measurements of samples from
healthy individuals, with informative priors capturing expert knowledge. It is
shown that the technical variation in the inferred cell population sizes is
small in comparison to the intrinsic biological variation. The large size of
flow cytometry data, where a single sample can contain measurements on hundreds
of thousands of cells, necessitates computationally efficient methods. To
address this, we have implemented a parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme
for sampling the posterior distribution.
