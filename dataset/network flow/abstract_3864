Retransmission based on packet acknowledgement (ACK/NAK) is a fundamental
error control technique employed in IEEE 802.11-2007 unicast network. However
the 802.11-2007 standard falls short of proposing a reliable MAC-level recovery
protocol for multicast frames. In this paper we propose a latency and bandwidth
efficient coding algorithm based on the principles of network coding for
retransmitting lost packets in a singlehop wireless multicast network and
demonstrate its effectiveness over previously proposed network coding based
retransmission algorithms.
