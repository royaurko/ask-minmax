We study the Kleinberg problem of navigation in Small World networks when the
underlying lattice is a fractal consisting of N>>1 nodes. Our extensive
numerical simulations confirm the prediction that most efficient navigation is
attained when the length r of long-range links is taken from the distribution
P(r)~r^{-alpha}, where alpha=d_f, the fractal dimension of the underlying
lattice. We find finite-size corrections to the exponent alpha, proportional to
1/(ln N)^2.
