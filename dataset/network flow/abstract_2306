In this paper, we first develope the concept of Lyapunov graph to weighted
Lyapunov graph (abbreviated as WLG) for nonsingular Morse-Smale flows
(abbreviated as NMS flows) on $S^3$. WLG is quite sensitive to NMS flows on
$S^3$. For instance, WLG detect the indexed links of NMS flows. Then we use WLG
and some other tools to describe nonsingular Morse-Smale flows without
heteroclinic trajectories connecting saddle orbits (abbreviated as depth $0$
NMS flows). It mainly contains the following several directions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item we use WLG to list depth $0$ NMS flows on $S^3$;
  \item with the help of WLG, comparing with Wada's algorithm, we provide a
direct description about the (indexed) link of depth $0$ NMS flows;
  \item to overcome the weakness that WLG can't decide topologically equivalent
class, we give a simplified Umanskii Theorem to decide when two depth $0$ NMS
flows on $S^3$ are topological equivalence;
  \item under these theories, we classify (up to topological equivalence) all
depth 0 NMS flows on $S^3$ with periodic orbits number no more than 4.
\end{enumerate}
