We aimed to map the jets and outflows from the Serpens South star forming
region and find an empirical relationship between the magnetic field and
outflow orientation. Near-infrared H2 v=1-0 S(1) 2.122{\mu}m -line imaging of
the \sim 30'-long filamentary shaped Serpens South star forming region was
carried out. K s broadband imaging of the same region was used for continuum
subraction. Candidate driving sources of the mapped jets/outflows are
identified from the list of known protostars and young stars in this region,
which was derived from studies using recent Spitzer and Herschel telescope
observations. 14 Molecular Hydrogen emission-line objects(MHOs) are identified
using our continuum-subtracted images. They are found to constitute ten
individual flows. Out of these, nine flows are located in the
lower-half(southern) part of the Serpens South filament, and one flow is
located at the northern tip of the filament. Four flows are driven by
well-identified Class 0 protostars, while the remaining six flows are driven by
candidate protostars mostly in the Class I stage, based on the Spitzer and
Herschel observations. The orientation of the outflows is systematically
perpendicular to the direction of the near-infrared polarization vector,
recently published in the literature. No significant correlation was observed
between the orientation of the flows and the axis of the filamentary cloud.
