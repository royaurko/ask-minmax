In order to closely simulate the real network scenario thereby verify the
effectiveness of protocol designs, it is necessary to model the traffic flows
carried over realistic networks. Extensive studies [1] showed that the actual
traffic in access and local area networks (e.g., those generated by ftp and
video streams) exhibits the property of self-similarity and long-range
dependency (LRD) [2]. In this appendix we briefly introduce the property of
self-similarity and suggest a practical approach for modeling self-similar
traces with specified traffic intensity.
