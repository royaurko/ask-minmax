We introduce a new class of optimization problems called integer Minkowski
programs. The formulation of such problems involves finitely many integer
variables and nonlinear constraints involving functionals defined on families
of discrete or polyhedral sets. We show that, under certain assumptions, it is
possible to reformulate them as integer linear programs, by making use of
integral generating sets. We then apply this technique to the network design
problem for fractional and integral flows subject to survivability constraints.
