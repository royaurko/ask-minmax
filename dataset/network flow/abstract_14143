We have solved the one-dimensional stationary two-fluid hydrodynamic
equations for post-shock flows on accreting magnetic white dwarfs simultaneous
with the fully frequency and angle-dependent radiative transfer for cyclotron
radiation and bremsstrahlung. Magnetic field strengths B = 10 to 100 MG are
considered. At given B, this theory relates the properties of the emission
region to a single physical parameter, the mass flow density (or accretion rate
per unit area). We present the normalized temperature profiles and fit formulae
for the peak electron temperature, the geometrical shock height, and the column
density of the post-shock flow. The results apply to pillbox-shaped emission
regions. With a first-order temperature correction they can also be used for
narrower columns provided they are not too tall.
