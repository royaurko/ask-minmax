In this paper, aiming at securing range query, top-k query, and skyline query
in tiered sensor networks, we propose the Secure Range Query (SRQ), Secure
Top-$k$ Query (STQ), and Secure Skyline Query (SSQ) schemes, respectively. In
particular, SRQ, by using our proposed \emph{prime aggregation} technique, has
the lowest communication overhead among prior works, while STQ and SSQ, to our
knowledge, are the first proposals in tiered sensor networks for securing
top-$k$ and skyline queries, respectively. Moreover, the relatively unexplored
issue of the security impact of sensor node compromises on multidimensional
queries is studied; two attacks incurred from the sensor node compromises,
\emph{collusion attack} and \emph{false-incrimination attack}, are investigated
in this paper. After developing a novel technique called \emph{subtree
sampling}, we also explore methods of efficiently mitigating the threat of
sensor node compromises. Performance analyses regarding the probability for
detecting incomplete query-results and communication cost of the proposed
schemes are also studied.
