In this paper we study a novel model of opinion dynamics in social networks,
which has two main features. First, agents asynchronously interact in pairs,
and these pairs are chosen according to a random process. We refer to this
communication model as "gossiping". Second, agents are not completely
open-minded, but instead take into account their initial opinions, which may be
thought of as their "prejudices". In the literature, such agents are often
called "stubborn". We show that the opinions of the agents fail to converge,
but persistently undergo ergodic oscillations, which asymptotically concentrate
around a mean distribution of opinions. This mean value is exactly the limit of
the synchronous dynamics of the expected opinions.
