We propose numerical simulations of viscoelastic fluids based on a hybrid
algorithm combining Lattice-Boltzmann models (LBM) and Finite Differences (FD)
schemes, the former used to model the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations, and
the latter used to model the polymer dynamics. The kinetics of the polymers is
introduced using constitutive equations for viscoelastic fluids with finitely
extensible non-linear elastic dumbbells with Peterlin's closure (FENE-P). The
numerical model is first benchmarked by characterizing the rheological
behaviour of dilute homogeneous solutions in various configurations, including
steady shear, elongational flows, transient shear and oscillatory flows. As an
upgrade of complexity, we study the model in presence of non-ideal
multicomponent interfaces, where immiscibility is introduced in the LBM
description using the "Shan-Chen" model. The problem of a confined viscoelastic
(Newtonian) droplet in a Newtonian (viscoelastic) matrix under simple shear is
investigated and numerical results are compared with the predictions of various
theoretical models. The proposed numerical simulations explore problems where
the capabilities of LBM were never quantified before.
