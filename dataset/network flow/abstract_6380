With the advent of large-scale cloud computing infrastructure, network
extension and migration has emerged as a major challenge in the management of
modern enterprise networks. Many enterprises are considering extending or
relocating their network components, in whole or in part, to remote, private
and public data centers, in order to attain scalability, failure resilience,
and cost savings for their network applications. In this paper, we conduct a
first rigorous study on the extension and migration of an enterprise network
while preserving its performance and security requirements, such as layer
2/layer 3 reachability, and middle-box traversal through load balancer,
intrusion detection and ACLs. We formulate this increasingly important problem,
present preliminary designs, and conduct experiments to validate the
feasibility of our designs.
