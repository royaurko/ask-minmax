We present results from an individual particle based model for the collision,
coagulation and fragmentation of heavy drops moving in a turbulent flow. Such a
model framework can help to bridge the gap between the full hydrodynamic
simulation of two phase flows, which can usually only study few particles and
mean field based approaches for coagulation and fragmentation relying heavily
on parameterization and are for example unable to fully capture particle
inertia. We study the steady state that results from a balance between
coagulation and fragmentation and the impact of particle properties and flow
properties on this steady state. We compare two different fragmentation
mechanisms, size-limiting fragmentation where particles fragment when exceeding
a maximum size and shear fragmentation, where particles break up when local
shear forces in the flow exceed the binding force of the particle. For
size-limiting fragmentation the steady state is mainly influenced by the
maximum stable particle size, while particle and flow properties only influence
the approach to the steady state. For shear fragmentation both the approach to
the steady state and the steady state itself depend on the particle and flow
parameters. There we find scaling relationships between the steady state and
the particle and flow parameters that are determined by the stability condition
for fragmentation.
