One of the main issues in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) is providing a
reliable and efficient routing in urban scenarios with regard to the high
vehicle mobility and presence of radio obstacle. In this paper, we propose a
Position-Based routing protocol using Learning Automata (PBLA). In addition,
PBLA uses the traffic information for enhancing learning. As we know, a main
characteristic of learning is increasing performance over time. We exploit this
characteristic to decreasing use of traffic information. Initially, PBLA make
effort to finding best and shortest path to mobile destination using traffic
information.
