Three dimensional unsteady flow of fluids in the Lagrangian description is
considered as an autonomous dynamical system in four dimensions. The condition
for the existence of a symplectic structure on the extended space is the frozen
field equations of the Eulerian description of motion. Integral invariants of
symplectic flow are related to conservation laws of the dynamical equation. A
scheme generating infinite families of symmetries and invariants is presented.
For the Euler equations these invariants are shown to have a geometric origin
in the description of flow as geodesic motion; they are also interpreted in
connection with the particle relabelling symmetry.
