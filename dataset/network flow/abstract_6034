Each complex network (or class of networks) presents specific topological
features which characterize its connectivity and highly influence the dynamics
of processes executed on the network. The analysis, discrimination, and
synthesis of complex networks therefore rely on the use of measurements capable
of expressing the most relevant topological features. This article presents a
survey of such measurements. It includes general considerations about complex
network characterization, a brief review of the principal models, and the
presentation of the main existing measurements. Important related issues
covered in this work comprise the representation of the evolution of complex
networks in terms of trajectories in several measurement spaces, the analysis
of the correlations between some of the most traditional measurements,
perturbation analysis, as well as the use of multivariate statistics for
feature selection and network classification. Depending on the network and the
analysis task one has in mind, a specific set of features may be chosen. It is
hoped that the present survey will help the proper application and
interpretation of measurements.
