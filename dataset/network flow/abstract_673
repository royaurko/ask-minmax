This paper presents and analyses the implementation of a novel active queue
management (AQM) named FavorQueue that aims to improve delay transfer of short
lived TCP flows over best-effort networks. The idea is to dequeue packets that
do not belong to a flow previously enqueued first. The rationale is to mitigate
the delay induced by long-lived TCP flows over the pace of short TCP data
requests and to prevent dropped packets at the beginning of a connection and
during recovery period. Although the main target of this AQM is to accelerate
short TCP traffic, we show that FavorQueue does not only improve the
performance of short TCP traffic but also improves the performance of all TCP
traffic in terms of drop ratio and latency whatever the flow size. In
particular, we demonstrate that FavorQueue reduces the loss of a retransmitted
packet, decreases the number of dropped packets recovered by RTO and improves
the latency up to 30% compared to DropTail. Finally, we show that this scheme
remains compliant with recent TCP updates such as the increase of the initial
slow-start value.
