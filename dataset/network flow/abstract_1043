We analyse a large data set of genetic markers obtained from populations of
Cymodocea nodosa, a marine plant occurring from the East Mediterranean to the
Iberian-African coasts in the Atlantic Ocean. We fully develop and test a
recently introduced methodology to infer the directionality of gene flow based
on the concept of geographical segregation. Using the Jensen-Shannon
divergence, we are able to extract a directed network of gene flow describing
the evolutionary patterns of Cymodocea nodosa. In particular we recover the
genetic segregation that the marine plant underwent during its evolution. The
results are confirmed by natural evidence and are consistent with an
independent cross analysis.
