We present a new view of Feynman diagrams for the field theory of transport
on percolation clusters. The diagrams for random resistor networks are
interpreted as being resistor networks themselves. This simplifies the field
theory considerably as we demonstrate by calculating the fractal dimension
$D_B$ of the percolation backbone to three loop order. Using renormalization
group methods we obtain $D_B = 2 + \epsilon /21 - 172\epsilon^2 /9261 + 2
\epsilon^3 (- 74639 + 22680 \zeta (3))/4084101$, where $\epsilon = 6-d$ with
$d$ being the spatial dimension and $\zeta (3) = 1.202057..$.
