The small-world phenomenon in complex networks has been identified as being
due to the presence of long-range links, i.e., links connecting nodes that
would otherwise be separated by a long node-to-node distance. We find,
surprisingly, that many scale-free networks are more sensitive to attacks on
short-range than on long-range links. This result, besides its importance
concerning network efficiency and/or security, has the striking implication
that the small-world property of scale-free networks is mainly due to
short-range links.
