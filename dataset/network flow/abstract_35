In this paper, we firstly establish an Interpolating curvature invariance
between the well known nonnegative and 2-non-negative curvature invariant along
the Ricci flow. Then a related strong maximum principle for the $(\lambda_1,
\lambda_2)$-nonnegativity is also derived along Ricci flow. Based on these,
finally we obtain a rigidity property of manifolds with
$(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$-nonnegative curvature operators.
