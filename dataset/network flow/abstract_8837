We show that the Kahler-Ricci flow on an algebraic manifold of positive
Kodaira dimension and semi-ample canonical line bundle converges to a unique
canonical metric on its canonical model. It is also shown that there exists a
canonical measure of analytic Zariski decomposition on an algebraic manifold of
positive Kodaira dimension. Such a canonical measure is unique and invariant
under birational transformations under the assumption of the finite generation
of canonical rings.
