We present a new class of integrators for stiff PDEs. These integrators are
generalizations of FLow AVeraging integratORS (FLAVORS) for stiff ODEs and SDEs
introduced in [Tao, Owhadi and Marsden 2010] with the following properties: (i)
Multiscale: they are based on flow averaging and have a computational cost
determined by mesoscopic steps in space and time instead of microscopic steps
in space and time; (ii) Versatile: the method is based on averaging the flows
of the given PDEs (which may have hidden slow and fast processes). This
bypasses the need for identifying explicitly (or numerically) the slow
variables or reduced effective PDEs; (iii) Nonintrusive: A pre-existing
numerical scheme resolving the microscopic time scale can be used as a black
box and easily turned into one of the integrators in this paper by turning the
large coefficients on over a microscopic timescale and off during a mesoscopic
timescale; (iv) Convergent over two scales: strongly over slow processes and in
the sense of measures over fast ones; (v) Structure-preserving: for stiff
Hamiltonian PDEs (possibly on manifolds), they can be made to be
multi-symplectic, symmetry-preserving (symmetries are group actions that leave
the system invariant) in all variables and variational.
