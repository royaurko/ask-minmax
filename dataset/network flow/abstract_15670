We consider the problem of growing multiplex networks with intrinsic fitness
and inter-layer coupling. The model comprises two layers; one that incorporates
fitness and another in which attachments are preferential. In the first layer,
attachment probabilities are proportional to fitness values, and in the second
layer, proportional to the sum of degrees in both layers. We provide analytical
closed-form solutions for the joint distributions of fitness and degrees. We
also derive closed-form expressions for the expected value of the degree as a
function of fitness. The model alleviates two shortcomings that are present in
the current models of growing multiplex networks: homogeneity of connections,
and homogeneity of fitness. In this paper, we posit and analyze a growth model
that is heterogeneous in both senses.
