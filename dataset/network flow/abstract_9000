In this paper, we present a Mirroring Neural Network architecture to perform
non-linear dimensionality reduction and Object Recognition using a reduced
lowdimensional characteristic vector. In addition to dimensionality reduction,
the network also reconstructs (mirrors) the original high-dimensional input
vector from the reduced low-dimensional data. The Mirroring Neural Network
architecture has more number of processing elements (adalines) in the outer
layers and the least number of elements in the central layer to form a
converging-diverging shape in its configuration. Since this network is able to
reconstruct the original image from the output of the innermost layer (which
contains all the information about the input pattern), these outputs can be
used as object signature to classify patterns. The network is trained to
minimize the discrepancy between actual output and the input by back
propagating the mean squared error from the output layer to the input layer.
After successfully training the network, it can reduce the dimension of input
vectors and mirror the patterns fed to it. The Mirroring Neural Network
architecture gave very good results on various test patterns.
