We analyse the rotation of bright solitary waves formed of atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates with attractive atomic interactions. By employing a
variational technique and assuming an irrotational quadrupolar flow field, we
map out the variational solutions in the rotating frame. In particular, we show
that rotation has a considerable stabilising effect on the system,
significantly raising the critical threshold for collapse of the bright
solitary waves.
