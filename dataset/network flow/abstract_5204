We probe the three dimensional flow structure and rheology of gravitational
(non-density matched) suspensions for a range of driving rates in a
split-bottom geometry. We establish that for sufficiently slow flows, the
suspension flows as if it were a dry granular medium, and confirm recent
theoretical modeling on the rheology of split-bottom flows. For faster driving,
the flow behavior is shown to be consistent with the rheological behavior
predicted by the recently developed "inertial number approaches for suspension
flows.
