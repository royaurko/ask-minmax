The azimuthal anisotropies of the collective transverse flow of hadrons are
investigated in a large range of heavy-ion collision energy within the
Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) microscopic transport approach which
incorporates explicit partonic degrees of freedom in terms of strongly
interacting quasiparticles (quarks and gluons) in line with an
equation-of-state from lattice QCD as well as dynamical hadronization and
hadronic dynamics in the final reaction phase. The experimentally observed
increase of the elliptic flow $v_2$ with bombarding energy is successfully
described in terms of the PHSD approach in contrast to a variety of other
kinetic models based on hadronic interactions. The analysis of higher-order
harmonics $v_3$ and $v_4$ shows a similar tendency of growing deviations
between partonic and purely hadronic models with increasing bombarding energy.
This signals that the excitation functions of azimuthal anisotropies provide a
sensitive probe for the underling degrees of freedom excited in heavy-ion
collisions.
