We will consider a {\it $\tau$-flow}, given by the equation
$\frac{d}{dt}g_{ij} = -2R_{ij} + \frac{1}{\tau}g_{ij}$ on a closed manifold
$M$, for all times $t\in [0,\infty)$. We will prove that if the curvature
operator and the diameter of $(M,g(t))$ are uniformly bounded along the flow
and if one of the limit solitons is integrable, then we have a convergence of
the flow toward a unique soliton, up to a diffeomorphism.
