Single-particle spectra and two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation functions
are determined analytically utilizing a self-similar solution of
non-relativistic hydrodynamics for ellipsoidally-symmetric, expanding
fireballs, by assuming that the symmetry axes of the ellipsoids are tilted in
the frame of the observation. The directed, elliptic and third flows are
calculated analytically. The mass dependences of the slope parameters in the
principal directions of the expansion, together with the mass and angular
dependences of the HBT radius parameters, reflect directly the ellipsoidal
properties of the flow.
