We present the projected metallicity profiles for a sample of 17 rich galaxy
clusters observed by BeppoSAX. We find that the 8 non-cooling flow clusters
have flat metallicity profiles. On the contrary, a strong enhancement in the
abundance is found in the central regions of the cooling flow clusters. All the
non-cooling flow clusters present evidence of recent merger activity suggesting
that the merger events redistributes efficiently the metal content of the
intracluster medium. For the cooling flow clusters with better statistics and
available optical data (A85, A496, A2029 and Perseus) we have tested whether
the observed abundance excess is due to metals ejected from the galaxies
located in the cluster core. We find that at a resolution > 100 kpc the
observed projected abundance excess profiles are consistent with originating
from a deprojected metal excess distribution tracing the optical light
distribution. In the one case (i.e. Perseus) with higher resolution (~ 50 kpc),
we find that the observed metal abundance excess distribution is broader than
the predicted one. Such a difference can be reconciled if we assume that the
metals have drifted away from their parent ejecting galaxies by a few tens of
kpc, or, alternatively, if we assume that the cluster light profile has become
significantly more centrally peaked because of the formation process of the
central dominant cluster galaxy since the last major merger occurred.
