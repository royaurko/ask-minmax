Previous work has shown that the problem of learning the optimal structure of
a Bayesian network can be formulated as a shortest path finding problem in a
graph and solved using A* search. In this paper, we improve the scalability of
this approach by developing a memory-efficient heuristic search algorithm for
learning the structure of a Bayesian network. Instead of using A*, we propose a
frontier breadth-first branch and bound search that leverages the layered
structure of the search graph of this problem so that no more than two layers
of the graph, plus solution reconstruction information, need to be stored in
memory at a time. To further improve scalability, the algorithm stores most of
the graph in external memory, such as hard disk, when it does not fit in RAM.
Experimental results show that the resulting algorithm solves significantly
larger problems than the current state of the art.
