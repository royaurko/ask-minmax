In this paper, we concerned with the local existence of strong solutions to
the $k-\varepsilon$ model equations for turbulent flows in a bounded domain
$\Omega$$\subset$ $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. We prove the existence of unique local
strong solutions for all initial data satisfying some compatibility conditions.
