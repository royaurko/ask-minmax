A mesoscopic model of a diblock copolymer is used to study the stability of a
lamellar structure under a uniform shear flow. We first obtain the nonlinear
lamellar solutions under both steady and oscillatory shear flows. Regions of
existence of these solutions are determined as a function of the parameters of
the model and of the flow. Finally, we address the stability of the lamellar
solution against long wavelength perturbations.
