We revisit the unparticle interactions and propagators from the AdS-CFT point
of view, and we show how the contact terms and their renormalization group flow
appear in the context of the holographic renormalization. We study both vector
unparticles and unfermions, uncovering the relevant boundary conditions and
renormalization group flows.
