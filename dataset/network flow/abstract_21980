We consider complementary dynamical systems related to stationary Korteweg-de
Vries hierarchy of equations. A general approach for finding elliptic solutions
is given. The solutions are expressed in terms of Novikov polynomials in
general quais-periodic case. For periodic case these polynomials coincide with
Hermite and Lam\'e polynomials. As byproduct we derive $2\times 2$ matrix Lax
representation for Rosochatius-Wojciechiwski, Rosochatius, second flow of
stationary nonlinear vectro Schr\"{o}dinger equations and complex Neumann
system.
