The actual performance of video delivery over wireless networks is best
captured through experimental studies over real testbed, which is crucial to
uncover the technical problems and practical challenges of realizing the
proposed video delivery techniques. Network coding (NC) provides a paradigm
shift to optimize the network resources for enhancing the video quality as a
result of delivery over multi-hop wireless networks. In this paper, we propose
a novel framework for evaluating the performance of NC-based video delivery
over multi-hop wireless networks. Based on an experimental testbed
implementation of inter-layer video coding and delivery, we propose a new
generalized technique for multi-hop interlayer NC in enhancing video delivery
quality. We evaluate the trade-off between complexity of multi-hop NC, and
video quality gain. We provide clear recommendations for best design choices of
NC-based inter-layer video coding and delivery over multi-hop wireless mesh
network considering link conditions and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The
results show that using NC improves the layered video performance in single and
multi-hop network. The average number of decoded layers when using NC in single
hop outperforms that when using NC in multi-hop.
