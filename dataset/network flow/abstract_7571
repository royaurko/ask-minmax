We study the spatial patterns formed by interacting biological populations or
reacting chemicals under the influence of chaotic flows. Multiple species and
nonlinear interactions are explicitly considered, as well as cases of smooth
and nonsmooth forcing sources. The small-scale structure can be obtained in
terms of characteristic Lyapunov exponents of the flow and of the chemical
dynamics. Different kinds of morphological transitions are identified.
Numerical results from a three-component plankton dynamics model support the
theory, and they serve also to illustrate the influence of asymmetric
couplings.
