In this paper, a transmission strategy of fountain codes over cooperative
relay networks is proposed. When more than one relay nodes are available, we
apply network coding to fountain-coded packets. By doing this, partial
information is made available to the destination node about the upcoming
message block. It is therefore able to reduce the required number of
transmissions over erasure channels, hence increasing the effective throughput.
Its application to wireless channels with Rayleigh fading and AWGN noise is
also analysed, whereby the role of analogue network coding and optimal weight
selection is demonstrated.
