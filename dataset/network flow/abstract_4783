We show that oscillating flow of a simple fluid in both the Newtonian and the
non-Newtonian regime can be described by a universal function of a single
dimensionless scaling parameter $\omega\tau$, where $\omega$ is the oscillation
(angular) frequency and $\tau$ is the fluid relaxation-time; geometry and
linear dimension bear no effect on the flow. Experimental energy dissipation
data of mechanical resonators in a rarefied gas follow this universality
closely in a broad linear dimension ($10^{-6}$ m$< L < 10^{-2}$ m) and
frequency ($10^5$ Hz $< \omega/2\pi < 10^8$ Hz) range. Our results suggest a
deep connection between flows of simple and complex fluids.
