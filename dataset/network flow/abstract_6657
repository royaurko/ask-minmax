In the past years, network theory has successfully characterized the
interaction among the constituents of a variety of complex systems, ranging
from biological to technological, and social systems. However, up until
recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all
components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra
information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the
interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the
enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their
interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly
considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a
comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs
made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover
several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural
measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects
processes and dynamics.
