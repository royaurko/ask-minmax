In this paper we discuss the transport of toroidal magnetic field by a weak
meridional flow at the base of the convection zone. We utilize the differential
rotation and meridional flow model developed by Rempel and incorporate feedback
of a purely toroidal magnetic field in two ways: directly through the Lorentz
force (magnetic tension) and indirectly through quenching of the turbulent
viscosity, which affects the parametrized turbulent angular momentum transport
in the model. In the case of direct Lorentz force feedback we find that a
meridional flow with an amplitude of around 2 m/s can transport a magnetic
field with a strength of 20 to 30 kG. Quenching of turbulent viscosity leads to
deflection of the meridional flow from the magnetized region and a significant
reduction of the transport velocity if the magnetic field is above
equipartition strength.
