We study the harmonic flows, for example, the directed, elliptic, third and
fourth flow of the system of partons formed just after relativistic heavy ion
collisions. We calculate the minijets produced during the primary collisions
using standard parton distributions for the incomming projectile and target
nucleus. We solve the Boltzmann equations of motion for the system of minijets
by Monte Carlo method within only the perturbative sector. Based on the flow
data calculated, we conclude the simulation can not explain the experimental
results at RHIC and LHC so that the nonperturbative sector plays much more
important roles even from the earliest stage of heavy ion collisions.
