We study the BTW-height model of self-organized criticality on a square
lattice with some long range connections giving to the lattice the character of
small world network. We find that as function of the fraction $p$ of long
ranged bonds the power law of the avalanche size and lifetime distribution
changes following a crossover scaling law with crossover exponents 2/3 and 1
for size and lifetime respectively.
