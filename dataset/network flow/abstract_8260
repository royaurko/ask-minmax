We analyze the spreading of viruses in scale-free networks with high
clustering and degree correlations, as found in the Internet graph. For the
Suscetible-Infected-Susceptible model of epidemics the prevalence undergoes a
phase transition at a finite threshold of the transmission probability.
Comparing with the absence of a finite threshold in networks with purely random
wiring, our result suggests that high clustering and degree correlations
protect scale-free networks against the spreading of viruses. We introduce and
verify a quantitative description of the epidemic threshold based on the
connectivity of the neighborhoods of the hubs.
