A wire-array flux-compression cartridge installed on Sandia's Saturn pulsed
power generator doubled the current into a 3-nH load to 6 MA and halved its
rise time to 100 ns. The current into the load, however, was unexpectedly
delayed by almost 1 microsecond. Estimates of a plasma flow switch acting as a
long-conduction-time opening switch are consistent with key features of the
power compression. The results suggest that microsecond-conduction-time plasma
flow switches can be combined with flux compression both to amplify currents
and to sharpen pulse rise times in pulsed power drivers.
