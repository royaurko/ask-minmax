Let f be a smooth map between unit spheres of possibly different dimensions.
We prove the global existence and convergence of the mean curvature flow of the
graph of f under various conditions. A corollary is that any area-decreasing
map between unit spheres (of possibly different dimensions) is homotopic to a
constant map.
