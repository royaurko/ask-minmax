Bayesian networks provide an elegant formalism for representing and reasoning
about uncertainty using probability theory. Theyare a probabilistic extension
of propositional logic and, hence, inherit some of the limitations of
propositional logic, such as the difficulties to represent objects and
relations. We introduce a generalization of Bayesian networks, called Bayesian
logic programs, to overcome these limitations. In order to represent objects
and relations it combines Bayesian networks with definite clause logic by
establishing a one-to-one mapping between ground atoms and random variables. We
show that Bayesian logic programs combine the advantages of both definite
clause logic and Bayesian networks. This includes the separation of
quantitative and qualitative aspects of the model. Furthermore, Bayesian logic
programs generalize both Bayesian networks as well as logic programs. So, many
ideas developed
