The evolution of a pair of point vortices in whole space, subject to the
inviscid Euler equations for incompressible fluid flow, is solved exactly for
rotationally symmetric initial conditions. This exact solution shows that the
vortex strength for a pair of point vortices can either remain stable or blow
up in finite time, depending on the initial data.
