We show that the presence of electrically insulating graphite oxide (GO)
within a single wall carbon nanotube network strongly enhances electrical
conductivity, whereas reduced graphite oxide, even though electrically
conductive, suppresses electrical conductivity within a composite network with
single wall carbon nanotubes. Measurements of Young modulus and of Raman
spectra strongly support our interpretation of the indirect role of the oxide
groups, present in graphite oxide within the single wall carbon
nanotubes/graphite oxide composite, through electronic doping of metallic
single wall carbon nanotubes.
