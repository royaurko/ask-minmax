We study the scattering of a massless scalar field in a generic Kerr
background. Using the isomonodromy flow, we relate the scattering coefficients
to the behavior of the Painlev\'e V transcendent. We use the asymptotics of the
Painlev\'e V $\tau$-function to derive an expression of the scattering
coefficients for the near extremal case.
