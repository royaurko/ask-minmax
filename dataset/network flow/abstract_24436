As a result of the recent advances in physical (PHY) layer communication
techniques, it is possible to receive multiple packets at the receiver
concurrently. This capability of a receiver to decode multiple simultaneous
transmissions is known as multi-packet reception (MPR). In this paper, we
propose a simple Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for an MPR wireless
channel, where we modify the backoff procedure as a function of number of
ongoing transmissions in the channel. Our protocol is backward compatible with
the IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol. The performance analysis of the proposed protocol
is carried out using extensive simulations and it is compared with some of the
existing MPR MAC protocols. The proposed mechanism improves the throughput and
delay performance of the IEEE 802.11 DCF.
