While social network analysis often focuses on graph structure of social
actors, an increasing number of communication networks now provide textual
content within social activity (email, instant messaging, blogging,
collaboration networks). We present an open source visualization software,
GraphDuplex, which brings together social structure and textual content, adding
a semantic dimension to social analysis. GraphDuplex eventually connects any
number of social or semantic graphs together, and through dynamic queries
enables user interaction and exploration across multiple graphs of different
nature.
