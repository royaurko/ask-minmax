We report experimental measurements of Lagrangian accelerations in the bulk
of intense turbulent flows of dilute polymer solutions by following tracer
particles with a high-speed optical tracking system. We observed a significant
decrease in the acceleration variance in dilute polymer solutions. The shape of
the normalized acceleration probability density functions, however, remain the
same as in Newtonian water flows. We also observed an increase in the turbulent
Lagrangian acceleration autocorrelation time in these dilute polymer solutions.
