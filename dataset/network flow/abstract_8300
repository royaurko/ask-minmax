We investigate the effects of transmission delays on the formation of
temporally ordered states in networks of non-identical R\"ossler oscillators,
having SWN topology. We show that incorporation of two different types of
delay, length independent and length dependent, leads to dramatically different
temporal properties of the network. In the first case formation of global
random connections leads to increased temporal ordering, while in the second
case it annihilates locally ordered clusters and forms a disordered state.
