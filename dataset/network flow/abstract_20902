This paper presents a two-dimensional modal logic for reasoning about the
changing patterns of knowledge and social relationships in networks organised
on the basis of a symmetric 'friendship' relation, providing a precise language
for exploring 'logic in the community' [11]. Agents are placed in the model,
allowing us to express such indexical facts as 'I am your friend' and 'You, my
friends, are in danger'.
  The technical framework for this work is general dynamic dynamic logic (GDDL)
[4], which provides a general method for extending modal logics with dynamic
operators for reasoning about a wide range of model-transformations, starting
with those definable in propositional dynamic logic (PDL) and extended to allow
for the more subtle operators involved in, for example, private communication,
as represented in dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) and related systems. We provide
a hands-on introduction to GDDL, introducing elements of the formalism as we
go, but leave the reader to consult [4] for technical details.
  Instead, the purpose of this paper is to investigate a number of conceptual
issues that arise when considering communication between agents in such
networks, both from one agent to another, and broadcasts to socially-defined
groups of agents, such as the group of my friends.
