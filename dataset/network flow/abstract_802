A testbed for wireless vehicle communication based on a microscopic model in
the framework of three-phase traffic theory is presented. In this testbed,
vehicle motion in traffic flow and analyses of a vehicle communication channel
access based on IEEE 802.11e mechanisms, radio propagation modeling, message
reception characteristics as well as all other effects associated with ad-hoc
networks are integrated into a three-phase traffic flow model. Based on
simulations of this testbed, some statistical features of ad-hoc vehicle
networks as well as the effect of C2C communication on increase in the
efficiency and safety of traffic are studied.
