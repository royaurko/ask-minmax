We prove the existence of the flow by curvature of regular planar networks
starting from an initial network which is non-regular. The proof relies on a
monotonicity formula for expanding solutions and a local regularity result for
the network flow in the spirit of B. White's local regularity theorem for mean
curvature flow.
