The evolution of granular shear flow is investigated as a function of height
in a split-bottom Couette cell. Using particle tracking, magnetic-resonance
imaging, and large-scale simulations we find a transition in the nature of the
shear as a characteristic height $H^*$ is exceeded. Below $H^*$ there is a
central stationary core; above $H^*$ we observe the onset of additional axial
shear associated with torsional failure. Radial and axial shear profiles are
qualitatively different: the radial extent is wide and increases with height
while the axial width remains narrow and fixed.
