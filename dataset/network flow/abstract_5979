Consider the continuum of points on the edges of a network, i.e., a
connected, undirected graph with positive edge weights. We measure the distance
between these points in terms of the weighted shortest path distance, called
the network distance. Within this metric space, we study farthest points and
farthest distances. We introduce optimal data structures supporting queries for
the farthest distance and the farthest points on trees, cycles, uni-cyclic
networks, and cactus networks.
