The analysis of weak variations in the energetic particle flux, as detected
by neutron or muon monitors, can often be considerably improved by analysing
data from monitor networks and thereby exploiting the spatial coherence of the
flux. We present a statistical framework for carrying out such an analysis and
discuss its physical interpretation. Two other applications are also presented:
filling data gaps and removing trends. This study focuses on the method and its
various uses.
