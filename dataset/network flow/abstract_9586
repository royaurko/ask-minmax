We investigate a scheduling scheme incorporating network coding and channel
varying information for the two-way relay networks. Our scheduler aims at
minimizing the time span needed to send all the data of each source of the
network. We consider three channel models, time invariant channels, time
varying channels with finite states and time varying Rayleigh fading channels.
We formulate the problem into a manageable optimization problem, and get a
closed form scheduler under time invariant channels and time varying channel
with finite channel states. For Rayleigh fading channels, we focus on the relay
node operation and propose heuristic power allocation algorithm resemblant to
water filling algorithm. By simulations, we find that even if the channel
fluctuates randomly, the average time span is minimized when the relay node
transmits/schedules network coded data as much as possible.
