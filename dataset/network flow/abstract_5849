We study link scheduling in wireless networks under stochastic arrival
processes of packets, and give an algorithm that achieves stability in the
physical (SINR) interference model. The efficiency of such an algorithm is the
fraction of the maximum feasible traffic that the algorithm can handle without
queues growing indefinitely. Our algorithm achieves two important goals: (i)
efficiency is independent of the size of the network, and (ii) the algorithm is
fully distributed, i.e., individual nodes need no information about the overall
network topology, not even local information.
