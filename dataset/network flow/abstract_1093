We investigate the traffic flows of the Korean highway system, which contains
both public and private transportation information. We find that the traffic
flow T(ij) between city i and j forms a gravity model, the metaphor of physical
gravity as described in Newton's law of gravity, P(i)P(j)/r(ij)^2, where P(i)
represents the population of city i and r(ij) the distance between cities i and
j. It is also shown that the highway network has a heavy tail even though the
road network is a rather uniform and homogeneous one. Compared to the highway
network, air and public ground transportation establish inhomogeneous systems
and have power-law behaviors.
