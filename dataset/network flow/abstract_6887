A non-Newtonian flow of a polymer melt is discussed. The description of the
exponential decrease of the apparent viscosity by the well-known Eyring formula
with an activation energy reduction proportional to the shear stress does not
take into account specific features of the polymeric structure. We propose to
modify the description of the macromolecular flow mechanism by including
conformational changes of the polymeric chains. The elasticity of a strained
polymeric chain, having an entropy origin, can be the reason of the reduction
of the activation energy for the transition of a molecular-kinetic unit of the
chain into a new equilibrium state in the flow direction during the thermal
fluctuation. In that case, the activation energy of the transition should
decrease by a value proportional to the reversible high-elastic component of
the shear deformation caused by the flow of the polymer.
