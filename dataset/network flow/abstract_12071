This paper presents new methods enabling anonymous communication on the
Internet. We describe a new protocol that allows us to create an anonymous
overlay network by exploiting the web browsing activities of regular users. We
show that the overlay network provides an anonymity set greater than the set of
senders and receivers in a realistic threat model. In particular, the protocol
provides unobservability in our threat model.
