A new mathematical model for evolutionary games on graphs is proposed to
extend the classical replicator equation to finite populations of players
organized on a network with generic topology. Classical results from game
theory, evolutionary game theory and graph theory are used. More specifically,
each player is placed in a vertex of the graph and he is seen as an infinite
population of replicators which replicate within the vertex. At each time
instant, a game is played by two replicators belonging to different connected
vertices, and the outcome of the game influences their ability of producing
offspring. Then, the behavior of a vertex player is determined by the
distribution of strategies used by the internal replicators. Under suitable
hypotheses, the proposed model is equivalent to the classical replicator
equation. Extended simulations are performed to show the dynamical behavior of
the solutions and the potentialities of the developed model.
