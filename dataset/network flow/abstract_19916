On hydrophobic surfaces, roughness may lead to a transition to a
superhydrophobic state, where gas bubbles at the surface can have a strong
impact on a detected slip. We present two-phase lattice Boltzmann simulations
of a Couette flow over structured surfaces with attached gas bubbles. Even
though the bubbles add slippery surfaces to the channel, they can cause
negative slip to appear due to the increased roughness. The simulation method
used allows the bubbles to deform due to viscous stresses. We find a decrease
of the detected slip with increasing shear rate which is in contrast to some
recent experimental results implicating that bubble deformation cannot account
for these experiments. Possible applications of bubble surfaces in microfluidic
devices are discussed.
