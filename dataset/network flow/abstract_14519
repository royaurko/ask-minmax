In this study, over different scenarios we will simulate a week coupling of
hydromechanical loads in a long term CO2 injection with a hypothetical
reservoir while the effect of pore water pressure and then multi-phase flow
procedure has been ignored. In the first basic case the homogenous case has
been considered when the theory of poroelasticity was employed. Second case
covers the effects of directional heterogeneity, constructed by random faults,
on the flow paths of gas and other attributes of the system. Also, in the
latter case the impact of stress state as an active loads (body loads) has been
regarded. Thanks to multiple directional heterogeneity, which induces only one
heterogenic parameter (intrinsic permeability), distinguishable flow paths can
be recognized. In another process, the failure ability of system regard to
Mohr-Columb criterion is measured as well as options that, presumably, the
system has continuum faults (zero cohesion). The results over different cases
shows absedince of ground surface (heave), more probable propagation of failure
area and the role of directional heterogeneity to change the evolution path of
system.
