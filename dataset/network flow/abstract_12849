We present the results of three-dimensional simulations of supersonic Euler
turbulence with grid resolutions up to 1024^3 points. Our numerical experiments
describe nonmagnetized driven turbulent flows with an isothermal equation of
state and an rms Mach number of 6. We demonstrate that the inertial range
scaling properties of turbulence in this strongly compressible regime deviate
substantially from a Kolmogorov-like behavior previously recovered for mildly
compressible transonic flows.
