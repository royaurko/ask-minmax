Recently various new concepts for the construction of Dirac operators in
lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) have been introduced. These operators
satisfy the so-called Ginsparg-Wilson condition (GWC), thus obeying the
Atiyah-Singer index theorem and violating chiral symmetry only in a modest and
local form. Here we present studies in 4-d for SU(3) gauge configurations with
non-trivial topological content. We study the flow of eigenvalues and we
compare the numerical stability and efficiency of a recently suggested chirally
improved operator with that of others in this respect.
