It is well known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
entropy vector of a collection of n random variables and a certain
group-characterizable vector obtained from a finite group and n of its
subgroups. However, if one restricts attention to abelian groups then not all
entropy vectors can be obtained. This is an explanation for the fact shown by
Dougherty et al that linear network codes cannot achieve capacity in general
network coding problems (since linear network codes form an abelian group). All
abelian group-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors
generated by linear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the
Ingleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian
finite groups that yield characterizable vectors which violate the Ingleton
inequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group S_5 to
be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study of
the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to the
Ingleton-violating family PGL(2,p) with primes p > 3, i.e., the projective
group of 2 by 2 nonsingular matrices with entries in F_p. This family of groups
is therefore a good candidate for constructing network codes more powerful than
linear network codes.
