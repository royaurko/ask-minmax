This study presents several new observations from the study of a warm-core
ring (WCR) in the Gulf of Mexico based on the ECCO2 global ocean simulation.
Using Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) techniques to investigate this flow
reveals a pattern of transversely intersecting LCS in the mixed layer of the
WCR which experiences consistent stretching behavior over a large region of
space and time. A detailed analysis of this flow region leads to an analytical
model velocity field which captures the essential elements that generate the
transversely intersecting LCS. The model parameters are determined from the WCR
and the resulting LCS show excellent agreement with those observed in the WCR.
The three-dimensional transport behavior which creates these structures relies
on the small radial outflow which is present in the mixed layer and is not seen
below the pycnocline, leading to a sharp change in the character of the LCS at
the bottom of the mixed layer. The flow behavior revealed by the LCS limits
fluid exchange between the WCR and the surrounding ocean, contributing to the
long life of WCRs. Further study of these structures and their associated
transport behavior may lead to further insights into the development and
persistence of such geophysical vortices as well as their transport behavior.
