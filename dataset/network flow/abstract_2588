Previous work on ad hoc network capacity has focused primarily on
source-destination throughput requirements for different models and
transmission scenarios, with an emphasis on delay tolerant applications. In
such problems, network capacity enhancement is achieved as a tradeoff with
transmission delay. In this paper, the capacity of ad hoc networks supporting
delay sensitive traffic is studied. First, a general framework is proposed for
characterizing the interactions between the physical and the network layer in
an ad hoc network. Then, CDMA ad hoc networks, in which advanced signal
processing techniques such as multiuser detection are relied upon to enhance
the user capacity, are analyzed. The network capacity is characterized using a
combination of geometric arguments and large scale analysis, for several
network scenarios employing matched filters, decorrelators and
minimum-mean-square-error receivers. Insight into the network performance for
finite systems is also provided by means of simulations. Both analysis and
simulations show a significant network capacity gain for ad hoc networks
employing multiuser detectors, compared with those using matched filter
receivers, as well as very good performance even under tight delay and
transmission power requirements.
