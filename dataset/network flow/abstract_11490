We consider the network communication scenario, over directed acyclic
networks with unit capacity edges in which a number of sources $s_i$ each
holding independent unit-entropy information $X_i$ wish to communicate the sum
$\sum{X_i}$ to a set of terminals $t_j$. We show that in the case in which
there are only two sources or only two terminals, communication is possible if
and only if each source terminal pair $s_i/t_j$ is connected by at least a
single path. For the more general communication problem in which there are
three sources and three terminals, we prove that a single path connecting the
source terminal pairs does not suffice to communicate $\sum{X_i}$. We then
present an efficient encoding scheme which enables the communication of
$\sum{X_i}$ for the three sources, three terminals case, given that each source
terminal pair is connected by {\em two} edge disjoint paths.
