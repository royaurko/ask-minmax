We started two observing programs with the Korean VLBI Network (KVN)
monitoring changes in the flux density and polarization of relativistic jets in
gamma-ray bright AGNs simultaneously at 22, 43, 86, 129 GHz. One is a
single-dish weekly-observing program in dual polarization with KVN 21-m
diameter radio telescopes beginning in 2011 May. The other is a VLBI
monthly-observing program with the three-element VLBI network at an angular
resolution range of 1.0--9.2 mas beginning in 2012 December. The monitoring
observations aim to study correlation of variability in gamma-ray with that in
radio flux density and polarization of relativistic jets when they flare up.
These observations enable us to study the origin of the gamma-ray flares of
AGNs.
