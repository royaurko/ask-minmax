Solar subsurface zonal and meridional-flow profiles during the rising phase
of solar cycle 24 are studied using time-distance helioseismology technique.
The faster zonal bands in the torsional-oscillation pattern show strong
hemispheric asymmetries and temporal variations in both width and speed. The
faster band in the northern hemisphere is located closer to the equator than
the band in the southern hemisphere, and migrates past the equator when the
magnetic activity in the southern hemisphere is reaching maximum. The
meridional-flow speed decreases substantially with the increase of magnetic
activity, and the flow profile shows two zonal structures in each hemisphere.
The residual meridional flow, after subtracting a mean meridional-flow profile,
converges toward the activity belts and shows faster and slower bands like the
torsional-oscillation pattern. More interestingly, the meridional-flow speed
above latitude 30 degree shows an anti-correlation with the
poleward-transporting magnetic flux, slower when the following-polarity flux is
transported and faster when the leading-polarity flux is transported. It is
expected that this phenomenon slows the process of magnetic cancellation and
polarity reversal in the high-latitude areas.
