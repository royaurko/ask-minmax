This paper provides a prescription for the turbulent viscosity in rotating
shear flows for use e.g. in geophysical and astrophysical contexts. This
prescription is the result of the detailed analysis of the experimental data
obtained in several studies of the transition to turbulence and turbulent
transport in Taylor-Couette flow. We first introduce a new set of control
parameters, based on dynamical rather than geometrical considerations, so that
the analysis applies more naturally to rotating shear flows in general and not
only to Taylor-Couette flow. We then investigate the transition thresholds in
the supercritical and the subcritical regime in order to extract their general
dependencies on the control parameters. The inspection of the mean profiles
provides us with some general hints on the mean to laminar shear ratio. Then
the examination of the torque data allows us to propose a decomposition of the
torque dependence on the control parameters in two terms, one completely given
by measurements in the case where the outer cylinder is at rest, the other one
being a universal function provided here from experimental fits. As a result,
we obtain a general expression for the turbulent viscosity and compare it to
existing prescription in the literature. Finally, throughout all the paper we
discuss the influence of additional effects such as stratification or magnetic
fields.
