A control strategy is employed that modifies the stochastic escape times from
one basin of attraction to another in a model of a double-gyre flow. The system
studied captures the behavior of a large class of fluid flows that circulate
and have multiple almost invariant sets. In the presence of noise, a particle
in one gyre may randomly switch to an adjacent gyre due to a rare large
fluctuation. We show that large fluctuation theory may be applied for
controlling autonomous agents in a stochastic environment, in fact leveraging
the stochastic- ity to the advantage of switching between regions of interest
and concluding that patterns may be broken or held over time as the result of
noise. We demonstrate that a controller can effectively manipulate the
probability of a large fluctuation, thereby modifying escape times
exponentially; this demonstrates the potential of optimal control strategies
that work in combination with the endemic stochastic environment. To
demonstrate this, stochastic simulations and numerical continuation are
employed to tie together experimental findings with predictions.
