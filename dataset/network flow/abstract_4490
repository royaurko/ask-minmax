Security organizations often attempt to disrupt terror or insurgent networks
by targeting "high value targets" (HVT's). However, there have been numerous
examples that illustrate how such networks are able to quickly re-generate
leadership after such an operation. Here, we introduce the notion of a
"shaping" operation in which the terrorist network is first targeted for the
purpose of reducing its leadership re-generation ability before targeting
HVT's. We look to conduct shaping by maximizing the network-wide degree
centrality through node removal. We formally define this problem and prove
solving it is NP-Complete. We introduce a mixed integer-linear program that
solves this problem exactly as well as a greedy heuristic for more practical
use. We implement the greedy heuristic and found in examining five real-world
terrorist networks that removing only 12% of nodes can increase the
network-wide centrality between 17% and 45%. We also show our algorithm can
scale to large social networks of 1,133 nodes and 5,541 edges on commodity
hardware.
