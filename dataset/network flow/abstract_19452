We resolve discrepancies in previous analyses of the flow of collisionless
dark matter particles in the Sun's gravitational field. We determine the
phase-space distribution of the flow both numerically, tracing particle
trajectories back in time, and analytically, providing a simple correct
relation between the velocity of particles at infinity and at the Earth. We use
our results to produce sky maps of the distribution of arrival directions of
dark matter particles on Earth at various times of the year. We assume various
Maxwellian velocity distributions at infinity describing the standard dark halo
and streams of dark matter. We illustrate the formation of a ring, analogous to
the Einstein ring, when the Earth is directly downstream of the Sun.
