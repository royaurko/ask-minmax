We examine the phenomenon of dynamical heterogeneity in computer simulations
of an equilibrium, glass-forming liquid. We describe several approaches to
quantify the spatial correlation of single-particle motion, and show that
spatial correlations of particle displacements become increasingly long-range
as the temperature decreases toward the mode coupling critical temperature.
