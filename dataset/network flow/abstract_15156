In cognitive radio (CR) networks, the perceived reduction of application
layer quality of service (QoS), such as multimedia distortion, by secondary
users may impede the success of CR technologies. Most previous work in CR
networks ignores application layer QoS. In this paper we take an integrated
design approach to jointly optimize multimedia intra refreshing rate, an
application layer parameter, together with access strategy, and spectrum
sensing for multimedia transmission in a CR system with time varying wireless
channels. Primary network usage and channel gain are modeled as a finite state
Markov process. With channel sensing and channel state information errors, the
system state cannot be directly observed. We formulate the QoS optimization
problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A low
complexity dynamic programming framework is presented to obtain the optimal
policy. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
