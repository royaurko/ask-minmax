We present a novel technique for the investigation of local variations of the
critical current density in large bulk superconductors. In contrast to the
usual Hall probe scanning technique, the sample is not magnetized as a whole
before the scan, but locally by a small permanent magnet, which is fixed near
the Hall probe, during the scanning process. The resulting signal can be
interpreted as a qualitative measure of the local shielding currents flowing at
the surface.
