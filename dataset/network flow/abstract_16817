We show that finite-size, disordered molecular networks can mediate highly
efficient, coherent excitation transfer which is robust against ambient
dephasing and associated with strong multi-site entanglement. Such optimal,
random molecular conformations may explain efficient energy transfer in the
photosynthetic FMO complex.
