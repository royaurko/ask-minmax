We review the present status of the nucleon effective mass splitting $puzzle$
in asymmetric matter, with controversial predictions within both
non-relativistic $and$ relativistic approaches to the effective in medium
interactions. Based on microscopic transport simulations we suggest some rather
sensitive observables in collisions of asymmetric (unstable) ions at
intermediate ($RIA$) energies: i) Energy systematics of Lane Potentials; ii)
Isospin content of fast emitted nucleons; iii) Differential Collective Flows.
Similar measurements for light isobars (like $^3H-^3He$) could be also
important.
