We present first measurements of the $\phi$-meson elliptic flow
($v_{2}(p_{T})$) and high statistics $p_{T}$ distributions for different
centralities from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC. In
minimum bias collisions the $v_{2}$ of the $\phi$ meson is consistent with the
trend observed for mesons. The ratio of the yields of the $\Omega$ to those of
the $\phi$ as a function of transverse momentum is consistent with a model
based on the recombination of thermal $s$ quarks up to $p_{T}\sim 4$ GeV/$c$,
but disagrees at higher momenta. The nuclear modification factor ($R_{CP}$) of
$\phi$ follows the trend observed in the $K^{0}_{S}$ mesons rather than in
$\Lambda$ baryons, supporting baryon-meson scaling. Since $\phi$-mesons are
made via coalescence of seemingly thermalized $s$ quarks in central Au+Au
collisions, the observations imply hot and dense matter with partonic
collectivity has been formed at RHIC.
