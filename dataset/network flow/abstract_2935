Since proteins carry out biological processes by interacting with other
proteins, analyzing the structure of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
could explain complex biological mechanisms, evolution, and disease. Similarly,
studying protein structure networks, residue interaction graphs (RIGs), might
provide insights into protein folding, stability, and function. The first step
towards understanding these networks is finding an adequate network model that
closely replicates their structure. Evaluating the fit of a model to the data
requires comparing the model with real-world networks. Since network
comparisons are computationally infeasible, they rely on heuristics, or
"network properties." We show that it is difficult to assess the reliability of
the fit of a model with any individual network property. Thus, our approach
integrates a variety of network properties and further combines these with a
series of probabilistic methods to predict an appropriate network model for
biological networks. We find geometric random graphs, that model spatial
relationships between objects, to be the best-fitting model for RIGs. This
validates the correctness of our method, since RIGs have previously been shown
to be geometric. We apply our approach to noisy PPI networks and demonstrate
that their structure is also consistent with geometric random graphs.
