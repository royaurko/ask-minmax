We describe a Bayesian model for social learning of a random variable in
which agents might observe each other over a directed network. The outcomes
produced are compared to those from a model in which observations occur
randomly over a complete graph. In both cases we observe a nontrivial level of
observation which maximizes learning, though individuals have strong incentive
to defect from the societal optimum. The implications of such competition over
information commons are discussed.
