Let (P,<) be a finite poset and let G be its comparability graph. If cl(G) is
the clutter of maximal cliques of G, we prove that cl(G) satisfies the max-flow
min-cut property and that its edge ideal is normally torsion free. We prove
that edge ideals of complete admissible uniform clutters are normally torsion
free. The normality of a monomial ideal is expressed in terms of blocking
polyhedra and the integer decomposition property. For edge ideals of clutters
this property completely determine their normality
