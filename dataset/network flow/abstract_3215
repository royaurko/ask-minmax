The directed flow of protons and positive pions have been studied in 158 A
GeV Pb + Pb collisions. A directed flow analysis of the rapidity dependence of
the average transverse momentum projected onto the reaction plane is presented
for semi-central collisions with impact parameters of approximately 8 fm, where
the flow effect is largest. The magnitude of the directed flow is found to be
significantly smaller than observed at AGS energies and than RQMD model
predictions.
