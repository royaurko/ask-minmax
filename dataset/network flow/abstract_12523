This study examined how the correlation and network structure of 30 global
indices and 145 local Korean indices belonging to the KOSPI 200 have changed
during the 13-year period, 2000-2012. The correlations among the indices were
calculated. The results showed that although the average correlations of the
global indices increased with time, the local indices showed a decreasing trend
except for drastic changes during crises. The average correlation of the local
indices exceeded the global indices during the crises from 2000-2002, implying
a strong correlation structure among the local indices during this period due
to the detrimental effect of the dot-com bubble. The threshold networks (TN)
were constructed in the observation time window by assigning a threshold value
and determining the network topologies. A significant change in the network
topologies was observed due to the financial crises in both markets. The
Jaccard similarities were also determined using the common links of TNs. The
TNs of the financial network were not consistent with the evolution of the
time, and the successive TNs of the global indices were more similar than those
of the successive local indices. Finally, the Jaccard similarities identified
the change in the market state due to a crisis in both markets.
