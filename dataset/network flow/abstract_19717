The behavior of hadronic matter at high baryon densities is studied within
Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (URQMD). Baryonic stopping is
observed for Au+Au collisions from SIS up to SPS energies. The excitation
function of flow shows strong sensitivities to the underlying equation of state
(EOS), allowing for systematic studies of the EOS. Effects of a density
dependent pole of the $\rho$-meson propagator on dilepton spectra are studied
for different systems and centralities at CERN energies.
