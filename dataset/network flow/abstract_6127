Ultra network densification is considered a major trend in the evolution of
cellular networks, due to its ability to bring the network closer to the user
side and reuse resources to the maximum extent. In this paper we explore
spatial resources coordination as a key empowering technology for next
generation (5G) ultra-dense networks. We propose an optimization framework for
flexibly associating system users with a densely deployed network of access
nodes, opting for the exploitation of densification and the control of overhead
signaling. Combined with spatial precoding processing strategies, we design
network resources management strategies reflecting various features, namely
local vs global channel state information knowledge exploitation, centralized
vs distributed implementation, and non-cooperative vs joint multi-node data
processing. We apply these strategies to future UDN setups, and explore the
impact of critical network parameters, that is, the densification levels of
users and access nodes as well as the power budget constraints, to users
performance. We demonstrate that spatial resources coordination is a key factor
for capitalizing on the gains of ultra dense network deployments.
