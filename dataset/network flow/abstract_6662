Communication networks involve the transmission and reception of large
volumes of data. Research indicates that network traffic volumes will continue
to increase. These traffic volumes will be unprecedented and the behaviour of
global information infrastructures when dealing with these data volumes is
unknown. It has been shown that complex systems (including computer networks)
exhibit self-organized criticality under certain conditions. Given the
possibility in such systems of a sudden and spontaneous system reset the
development of techniques to inform system administrators of this behaviour
could be beneficial. This article focuses on the combination of two dissimilar
research concepts, namely sonification (a form of auditory display) and
self-organized criticality (SOC). A system is described that sonifies in real
time an information infrastructure's self-organized criticality to alert the
network administrators of both normal and abnormal network traffic and
operation.
