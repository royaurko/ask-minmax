An efficient method to price bonds with optional sinking feature is
presented. Such instruments equip their issuer with the option (but not the
obligation) to redeem parts of the notional prior to maturity, therefore the
future cash flows are random. In a one-factor model for the issuer's default
intensity we show that the pricing algorithm can be formulated as a Markov
Decision Process, which is both accurate and quick. The method is demonstrated
using a 1.5-factor credit-equity model which defines the default intensity in a
reciprocal relationship to the issuer's stock price process, termed
jump-to-default extended model with constant elasticity of variance (JDCEV).
