This work derives a distributed and iterative algorithm by which mobile
terminals can selfishly control their transmit powers during the
synchronization procedure specified by the IEEE 802.16m and the 3GPP-LTE
standards for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access technologies. The
proposed solution aims at maximizing the energy efficiency of the network and
is derived on the basis of a finite noncooperative game in which the players
have discrete action sets of transmit powers. The set of Nash equilibria of the
game is investigated, and a distributed power control algorithm is proposed to
achieve synchronization in an energy-efficient manner under the assumption that
the feedback from the base station is limited. Numerical results show that the
proposed solution improves the energy efficiency as well as the timing
estimation accuracy of the network compared to existing alternatives, while
requiring a reasonable amount of information to be exchanged on the return
channel.
