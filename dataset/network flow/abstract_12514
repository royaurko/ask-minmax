Large-scale networked environments, such as the Internet, possess the
characteristics of centralised data, centralised access and centralised
control; this gives the user a powerful mechanism for building and integrating
large repositories of centralised information from diverse resources set.
However, a centralised network system with GSM Networks development for a
hospital information systems or a health care information portal is still in
its infancy. The shortcomings of the currently available tools have made the
use of mobile devices more appealing. In mobile computing, the issues such as
low bandwidth, high latency wireless Networks, loss or degradation of wireless
connections, and network errors or failures need to be dealt with. Other issues
to be addressed include system adaptability, reliability, robustness,
extensibility, flexibility, and maintainability. GSM approach has emerged as
the most viable approach for development of intelligent software applications
for wireless mobile devices in a centralized environment, which gives higher
band width of 900 MHz for transmission. The e-healthcare system that we have
developed provides support for physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other
healthcare professionals, as well as for patients and medical devices used to
monitor patients. In this paper, we present the architecture and the
demonstration prototype.
