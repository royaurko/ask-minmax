In this work we study the asymptotic traffic flow in Gromov's hyperbolic
graphs. We prove that under certain mild hypotheses the traffic flow in a
hyperbolic graph tends to pass through a finite set of highly congested nodes.
These nodes are called the "core" of the graph. We provide a formal definition
of the core in a very general context and we study the properties of this set
for several graphs.
