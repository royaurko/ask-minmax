We study a system of an impurity spin coupled to a junction of several
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids using a renormalization group scheme. For the
decoupled S-matrix at the junction, there is a range of Kondo couplings which
flow to a multi-channel fixed point for repulsive inter-electron interactions;
this is associated with a characteristic temperature dependence of the
spin-flip scatterings. If the junction is governed by the Griffiths S-matrix,
the Kondo couplings flow to a strong coupling fixed point where all the wires
are decoupled.
