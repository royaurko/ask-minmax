In this paper, we propose an analog network coding scheme with differential
modulation (ANC-DM) using amplify-and-forward protocol for bidirectional relay
networks when neither the source nodes nor the relay knows the channel state
information (CSI). The performance of the proposed ANC-DM scheme is analyzed
and a simple asymptotic bit error rate (BER) expression is derived. The
analytical results are verified through simulations. It is shown that the BER
performance of the proposed differential scheme is about 3 dB away from that of
the coherent detection scheme. To improve the system performance, the optimum
power allocation between the sources and the relay is determined based on the
simplified BER. Simulation results indicate that the proposed differential
scheme with optimum power allocation yields 1-2 dB performance improvement over
an equal power allocation scheme.
