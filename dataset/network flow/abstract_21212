Using a stochastic algorithm introduced in a previous paper, we study the
finite size volume corrections and the fluctuations of the ground state energy
in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and the Edwards-Anderson models at zero
temperature. The algorithm is based on a suitable annealing procedure coupled
with a balanced greedy-reluctant strategy that drives the systems towards the
deepest minimum of the energy function.
