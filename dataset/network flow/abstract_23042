We extend our Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) analysis on the pionless
nuclear effective theory (NEFT) in the two-nucleon sector in two ways; on the
one hand, (1) we enlarge the space of operators up to including those of
$\mathcal{O}(p^4)$ in the $S$ waves, and, on the other hand, (2) we consider
the RG flows in higher partial waves ($P$ and $D$ waves). In the larger space
calculations, we find, in addition to nontrivial fixed points, two ``fixed
lines'' and a ``fixed surface'' which are related to marginal operators. In the
higher partial wave calculations, we find similar phase structures to that of
the $S$ waves, but there are \textit{two} relevant directions in the $P$ waves
at the nontrivial fixed points and \textit{three} in the $D$ waves. We explain
the physical meaning of the $P$-wave phase structure by explicitly calculating
the low-energy scattering amplitude. We also discuss the relation between the
Legendre flow equation which we employ and the RG equation by Birse, McGovern,
and Richardson, and possible implementation of Power Divergence Subtraction
(PDS) in higher partial waves.
