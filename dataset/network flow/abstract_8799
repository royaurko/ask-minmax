Plane symmetric perturbations are applied to an axially symmetric Kasner
spacetime which leads to no momentum flow orthogonal to the planes of symmetry.
This flow appears laminar and the structure can be interpreted as a domain
wall. We further extend consideration to the class of Bianchi Type I spacetimes
and obtain corresponding results.
