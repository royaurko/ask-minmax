We derive an energy landscape interpretation of dielectric relaxation times
in undercooled liquids, comparing it to the traditional Debye and
Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop pictures. The interaction between different local
structural rearrangements in the energy landscape explains qualitatively the
recently observed splitting of the flow process into an initial and a final
stage. The initial mechanical relaxation stage is attributed to hopping
processes, the final thermal or structural relaxation stage to the decay of the
local double-well potentials. The energy landscape concept provides an
explanation for the equality of thermal and dielectric relaxation times. The
equality itself is once more demonstrated on the basis of literature data for
salol.
