The mean curvature flow is the gradient flow of volume functionals on the
space of submanifolds. We prove a fundamental regularity result of the mean
curvature flow in this paper: a Lipschitz submanifold with small local
Lipschitz norm becomes smooth instantly along the mean curvature flow. This
generalizes the regularity theorem of Ecker and Huisken for Lipschitz
hypersurfaces. In particular, any submanifold of the Euclidean space with a
continuous induced metric can be smoothed out by the mean curvature flow. The
smallness assumption is necessary in the higher codimension case in view of an
example of Lawson and Osserman. The stationary phase of the mean curvature flow
corresponds to minimal submanifolds. Our result thus generalizes Morrey's
classical theorem on the smoothness of $C^1$ minimal submanifolds.
