We present a model for growing information networks where the ageing of a
node depends on the time at which it entered the network and on the last time
it was cited. The model is shown to undergo a transition from a small-world to
large-world network. The degree distribution may exhibit very different shapes
depending on the model parameters, e.g. delta-peaked, exponential or power-law
tailed distributions.
