MANET is a temporary connection of mobile nodes via wireless links having no
centralized base station. We developed a protocol with an enhanced route
discovery mechanism that avoids the pre-transmission delay. When a source node
wants to communicate with another node, it broadcast RREQ. EAODV give priority
to the source node of real time transmission. When RREQ packet send to neighbor
node, for real time transmission it accept route request on priority basis and
the drop ratio of packets decreased, then throughput increases by receiving
more packets at destination and delivery ratio also increased through these QOS
improved.
