Tortuosity ($T$) is a parameter describing an average elongation of fluid
streamlines in a porous medium as compared to free flow. In this paper several
methods of calculating this quantity from lengths of individual streamlines are
compared and their weak and strong features are discussed. An alternative
method is proposed, which enables one to calculate $T$ directly from the fluid
velocity field, without the need of determining streamlines, which greatly
simplifies determination of tortuosity in complex geometries, including those
found in experiments or 3D computer models. Numerical results obtained with
this method suggest that (a) the hydraulic tortuosity of an isotropic fibrous
medium takes on the form $T = 1 + p\sqrt{1-\phi}$, where $\phi$ is the porosity
and $p$ is a constant and (b) the exponent controlling the divergence of $T$
with the system size at percolation threshold is related to an exponent
describing the scaling of the most probable traveling length at bond
percolation.
