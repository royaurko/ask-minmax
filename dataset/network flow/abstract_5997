We derive properties of Latent Variable Models for networks, a broad class of
models that includes the widely-used Latent Position Models. These include the
average degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average path length and
degree correlations. We introduce the Gaussian Latent Position Model, and
derive analytic expressions and asymptotic approximations for its network
properties. We pay particular attention to one special case, the Gaussian
Latent Position Models with Random Effects, and show that it can represent the
heavy-tailed degree distributions, positive asymptotic clustering coefficients
and small-world behaviours that are often observed in social networks. Several
real and simulated examples illustrate the ability of the models to capture
important features of observed networks.
