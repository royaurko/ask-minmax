We investigate the response of an excitable medium to a localized
perturbation in the presence of a two-dimensional smooth chaotic flow. Two
distinct types of flows are numerically considered: open and closed. For both
of them three distinct regimes are found, depending on the relative strengths
of the stirring and the rate of the excitable reaction. In order to clarify and
understand the role of the many competing mechanisms present, simplified models
of the process are introduced. They are one-dimensional baker-map models for
the flow and a one-dimensional approximation for the transverse profile of the
filaments.
