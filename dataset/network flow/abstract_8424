We study the relationship between synchronization and the rate with which
information is exchanged between nodes in a spatio-temporal network that
describes the dynamics of classical particles under a substrate
Remoissenet-Peyrard potential. We also show how phase and complete
synchronization can be detected in this network. The difficulty in detecting
phase synchronization in such a network appears due to the highly non-coherent
character of the particle dynamics which unables a proper definition of the
phase dynamics. The difficulty in detecting complete synchronization appears
due to the spatio character of the potential which results in an asymptotic
state highly dependent on the initial state.
