The appearance of large geolocated communication datasets has recently
increased our understanding of how social networks relate to their physical
space. However, many recurrently reported properties, such as the spatial
clustering of network communities, have not yet been systematically tested at
different scales. In this work we analyze the social network structure of over
25 million phone users from three countries at three different scales: country,
provinces and cities. We consistently find that this last urban scenario
presents significant differences to common knowledge about social networks.
First, the emergence of a giant component in the network seems to be controlled
by whether or not the network spans over the entire urban border, almost
independently of the population or geographic extension of the city. Second,
urban communities are much less geographically clustered than expected. These
two findings shed new light on the widely-studied searchability in
self-organized networks. By exhaustive simulation of decentralized search
strategies we conclude that urban networks are searchable not through
geographical proximity as their country-wide counterparts, but through an
homophily-driven community structure.
