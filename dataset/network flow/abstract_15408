In the era of Internet of Things, all components in intelligent
transportation systems will be connected to improve transport safety, relieve
traffic congestion, reduce air pollution and enhance the comfort of driving.
The vision of all vehicles connected poses a significant challenge to the
collection and storage of large amounts of traffic-related data. In this
article, we propose to integrate cloud computing into vehicular networks such
that the vehicles can share computation resources, storage resources and
bandwidth resources. The proposed architecture includes a vehicular cloud, a
roadside cloud, and a central cloud. Then, we study cloud resource allocation
and virtual machine migration for effective resource management in this
cloud-based vehicular network. A game-theoretical approach is presented to
optimally allocate cloud resources. Virtual machine migration due to vehicle
mobility is solved based on a resource reservation scheme.
