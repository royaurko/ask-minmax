In this paper we prove the separation of source-network coding and channel
coding in wireline networks. For the purposes of this work, a wireline network
is any network of independent, memoryless, point-to-point, finite-alphabet
channels used to transmit dependent sources either losslessly or subject to a
distortion constraint. In deriving this result, we also prove that in a general
memoryless network with dependent sources, lossless and zero-distortion
reconstruction are equivalent provided that the conditional entropy of each
source given the other sources is non-zero. Furthermore, we extend the
separation result to the case of continuous-alphabet, point-to-point channels
such as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.
