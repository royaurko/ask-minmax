We propose a macroscopic traffic network flow model suitable for analysis as
a dynamical system, and we qualitatively analyze equilibrium flows as well as
convergence. Flows at a junction are determined by downstream supply of
capacity as well as upstream demand of traffic wishing to flow through the
junction. This approach is rooted in the celebrated Cell Transmission Model for
freeway traffic flow. Unlike related results which rely on certain system
cooperativity properties, our model generally does not possess these
properties. We show that the lack of cooperativity is in fact a useful feature
that allows traffic control methods, such as ramp metering, to be effective.
Finally, we leverage the results of the paper to develop a linear program for
optimal ramp metering.
