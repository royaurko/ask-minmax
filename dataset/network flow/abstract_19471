The behavior of a spheroidal vesicle, in a plane shear flow bounded from one
side by a wall, is analysed when the distance from the wall is much larger than
the spheroid radius. It is found that tank treading motions produce a
transverse drift away from the wall, proportional to the spheroid eccentricity
and the inverse square of the distance from the wall. This drift is independent
of inertia, and is completely determined by the characteristics of the vesicle
membrane. The relative strength of the contribution to drift from tank-treading
motions and from the presence of inertial corrections, is discussed.
