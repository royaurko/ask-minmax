We discuss the present collective flow signals for the phase transition to
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the collective flow as a barometer for the
equation of state (EoS). A study of Mach shocks induced by fast partonic jets
propagating through the QGP is given. We predict a significant deformation of
Mach shocks in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC and LHC energies as compared to
the case of jet propagation in a static medium. Results of a hydrodynamical
study of jet energy loss are presented.
