The article revisits spatial interaction and distance decay from the
perspective of human mobility patterns and spatially-embedded networks based on
an empirical data set. We extract nationwide inter-urban movements in China
from a check-in data set that covers half million individuals and 370 cities to
analyze the underlying patterns of trips and spatial interactions. By fitting
the gravity model, we find that the observed spatial interactions are governed
by a power law distance decay effect. The obtained gravity model also well
reproduces the exponential trip displacement distribution. However, due to the
ecological fallacy issue, the movement of an individual may not obey the same
distance decay effect. We also construct a spatial network where the edge
weights denote the interaction strengths. The communities detected from the
network are spatially connected and roughly consistent with province
boundaries. We attribute this pattern to different distance decay parameters
between intra-province and inter-province trips.
