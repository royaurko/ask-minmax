Supergranulation is one of the most visible length scales of solar convection
and has been studied extensively by local helioseismology. We use synthetic
data computed with the Seismic Propagation through Active Regions and
Convection (SPARC) code to test regularized-least squares (RLS) inversions of
helioseismic holography measurements for a supergranulation-like flow. The code
simulates the acoustic wavefield by solving the linearized three-dimensional
Euler equations in Cartesian geometry. We model a single supergranulation cell
with a simple, axisymmetric, mass-conserving flow.
  The use of simulated data provides an opportunity for direct evaluation of
the accuracy of measurement and inversion techniques. The RLS technique applied
to helioseismic-holography measurements is generally successful in reproducing
the structure of the horizontal flow field of the model supergranule cell. The
errors are significant in horizontal-flow inversions near the top and bottom of
the computational domain as well as in vertical-flow inversions throughout the
domain. We show that the errors in the vertical velocity are due largely to
cross talk from the horizontal velocity.
