In this paper, novel cooperative automatic repeat request (ARQ) methods with
network coding are proposed for two way relaying network. Upon a failed
transmission of a packet, the network enters cooperation phase, where the
retransmission of the packets is aided by the relay node. The proposed approach
integrates network coding into cooperative ARQ, aiming to improve the network
throughput by reducing the number of retransmissions. For successive
retransmission, three different methods for choosing the retransmitting node
are considered. The throughput of the methods are analyzed and compared. The
analysis is based on binary Markov channel which takes the correlation of the
channel coefficients in time into account. Analytical results show that the
proposed use of network coding result in throughput performance superior to
traditional ARQ and cooperative ARQ without network coding. It is also observed
that correlation can have significant effect on the performance of the proposed
cooperative network coded ARQ approach. In particular the proposed approach is
advantageous for slow to moderately fast fading channels.
