We live in a "global village" where electronic communication has eliminated
the geographical barriers of information exchange. With global information
exchange, the road is open to worldwide convergence of opinions and interests.
However, it remains unknown to what extent interests actually have become
global. To address how interests differ between countries, we analyze the
information exchange in Wikipedia, the largest online collaborative
encyclopedia. From the editing activity in Wikipedia, we extract the interest
profiles of editors from different countries. Based on a statistical null model
for interest profiles, we create a network of significant links between
countries with similar interests. We show that countries are divided into 18
clusters with similar interest profiles in which language, geography, and
historical background polarize the interests. Despite the opportunities of
global communication, the results suggest that people nevertheless care about
local information.
