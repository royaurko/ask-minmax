Complex networks with heterogeneous distribution of loads may undergo a
global cascade of overload failures when highly loaded nodes or edges are
removed due to attacks or failures. Since a small attack or failure has the
potential to trigger a global cascade, a fundamental question regards the
possible strategies of defense to prevent the cascade from propagating through
the entire network. Here we introduce and investigate a costless strategy of
defense based on a selective further removal of nodes and edges, right after
the initial attack or failure. This intentional removal of network elements is
shown to drastically reduce the size of the cascade.
