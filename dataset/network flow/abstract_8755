Lie symmetry group method is applied to study the boundary-layer equations
for two-dimensional steady flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid near a
stagnation point at a heated stretching sheet placed in a porous medium
equation. The symmetry group and its optimal system are given, and group
invariant solutions associated to the symmetries are obtained. Finally the
structure of the Lie algebra symmetries is determined.
