A novel, highly flexible capacitor fiber (with 100 nF m-1 typical capacitance
per length) having a multilayer periodic structure of dielectric and conductive
polymer composite films is fabricated by drawing technique. The fiber is used
to build a woven touchpad sensor. Then, we study the influence of the fiber
length, capacitance and volume resistivity on the touch sensing performance. A
theoretical ladder network model of a fiber network is developed. A fully woven
textile sample incorporating one-dimension array of the capacitor fibers is
fabricated. Finally we show that such an array functions as a two-dimensional
touch sensor.
