We consider active suspensions in the isotropic phase subjected to a shear
flow. Using a set of extended hydrodynamic equations we derive a variety of
{\em analytical} expressions for rheological quantities such as shear viscosity
and normal stress differences. In agreement to full-blown numerical
calculations and experiments we find a shear thickening or -thinning behaviour
depending on whether the particles are contractile or extensile. Moreover, our
analytical approach predicts that the normal stress differences can change
their sign in contrast to passive suspensions.
