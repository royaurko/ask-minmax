We study the ionization, thermal structure, and dynamics of AGN flows which
are partially shielded from the central continuum. We utilize detailed non-LTE
photoionization and radiative transfer code using exact (non-Sobolev)
calculations. We find that shielding has a pronounced effect on the ionization,
thermal structure, and the dynamics of such flows. Moderate shielding is
especially efficient in accelerating flows to high velocities since it
suppresses the ionization level of the gas. The ionization structure of
shielded gas tends to be distributed uniformly over a wide range of ionization
levels. In such gas, radiation pressure due to trapped line photons can
dominate over the thermal gas pressure and have a significant effect on the
thermal stability of the flow. Heavily shielded flows are driven mainly by line
radiation pressure, and so line locking has a large effect on the flow
dynamics. We show that the observed ``L_\alpha ghost'' is a natural outcome in
highly ionized flows that are shielded beyond the Lyman limit. We suggest that
high velocity AGN flows occupy only a small fraction of the volume and that
their density depends only weakly on the velocity field.
