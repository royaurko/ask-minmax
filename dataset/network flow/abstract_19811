Four-dimensional field equations are determined for perturbations of the
quotient seven-sphere size and squashing parameter in eleven-dimensional
supergravity. The quotient seven-sphere is a S^1-bundle over the CP^3 which is
regarded as a S^2-fibration over the base S^4. By analyzing the AdS_4
supergravity scalar potential, the holographic supersymmetric(or
nonsupersymmetric) renormalization group(RG) flow from N=1(or N=0) SO(5) x
U(1)-invariant UV fixed point to N=6(or N=0) SU(4)_R x U(1)-invariant IR fixed
point is obtained. The three-dimensional boundary theories are described by
superconformal Chern-Simons matter theories and a dual operator corresponding
to this RG flow is described.
