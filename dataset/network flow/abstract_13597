In this paper, we study the entropy of a Hamiltonian flow in restriction to
an enregy level where it admits a first integral which is nondegenerate in the
Bott sense. It is easy to see that for such a flow, the topological entropy
vanishes. We focus on the polynomial and the weak polynomial entropies. We
prove that, under conditions on the critical level of the Bott first integral
and dynamical conditions on the hamiltonian function, the weak polynomial
entropy belongs to {0,1} and the polynomial entropy belongs to {0,1,2}.
