We present a transparent conducting electrode composed of a periodic
two-dimensional network of silver nanowires. Networks of Ag nanowires are made
with wire diameters of 45-110 nm and pitch of 500, 700 and 1000 nm. Anomalous
optical transmission is observed, with an averaged transmission up to 91% for
the best transmitting network and sheet resistances as low as 6.5 {\Omega}/sq
for the best conducting network. Our most dilute networks show lower sheet
resistance and higher optical transmittance than an 80 nm thick layer of ITO
sputtered on glass. By comparing measurements and simulations we identify four
distinct physical phenomena that govern the transmission of light through the
networks: all related to the excitation of localized surface plasmons and
surface plasmon polaritons on the wires. The insights given in this paper
provide the key guidelines for designing high-transmittance and low-resistance
nanowire electrodes for optoelectronic devices, including thin-film solar
cells. For these latter, we discuss the general design principles to use the
nanowire electrodes also as a light trapping scheme.
