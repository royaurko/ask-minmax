We study the statistical properties of various directed networks using
ranking of their nodes based on the dominant vectors of the Google matrix known
as PageRank and CheiRank. On average PageRank orders nodes proportionally to a
number of ingoing links, while CheiRank orders nodes proportionally to a number
of outgoing links. In this way the ranking of nodes becomes two-dimensional
that paves the way for development of two-dimensional search engines of new
type. Statistical properties of information flow on PageRank-CheiRank plane are
analyzed for networks of British, French and Italian Universities, Wikipedia,
Linux Kernel, gene regulation and other networks. A special emphasis is done
for British Universities networks using the large database publicly available
at UK. Methods of spam links control are also analyzed.
