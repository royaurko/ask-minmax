For an ancient solution of the mean curvature flow, we show that each time
slice M_t is contained in an affine subspace with dimension bounded in terms of
the density and the dimension of the evolving submanifold. Recall that an
ancient solution is a family M_t that evolves under mean curvature flow for all
negative time t.
