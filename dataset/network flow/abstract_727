Large but rare cascades triggered by small initial shocks are present in most
of the infrastructure networks. Here we present a simple model for cascading
failures based on the dynamical redistribution of the flow on the network. We
show that the breakdown of a single node is sufficient to collapse the
efficiency of the entire system if the node is among the ones with largest
load. This is particularly important for real-world networks with an highly
hetereogeneous distribution of loads as the Internet and electrical power
grids.
