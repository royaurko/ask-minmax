The stage of evolution is the population of reproducing individuals. The
structure of the population is know to affect the dynamics and outcome of
evolutionary processes, but analytical results for generic random structures
have been lacking. The most general result so far, the isothermal theorem,
assumes the propensity for change in each position is exactly the same, but
realistic biological structures are always subject to variation and noise. We
consider a population of finite size $n$ under constant selection whose
structure is given by a wide variety of weighted, directed, random graphs;
vertices represent individuals and edges interactions between individuals. By
establishing a robustness result for the isothermal theorem and using large
deviation estimates to understand the typical structure of random graphs, we
prove that for a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model the fixation
probability of an invading mutant is approximately the same as that of a mutant
of equal fitness in a well-mixed population with high probability. Simulations
of perturbed lattices, small-world networks, and scale-free networks behave
similarly. We conjecture that the fixation probability in a well-mixed
population, $(1-r^{-1})/(1-r^{-n})$, is universal: for many random graph
models, the fixation probability approaches the above function uniformly as the
graphs become large.
