Protein structures can be studied as complex networks of interacting amino
acids. We study proteins of different structural classes from the network
perspective. Our results indicate that proteins, regardless of their structural
class, show small-world network property. Various network parameters offer
insight into the structural organisation of proteins and provide indications of
modularity in protein networks.
