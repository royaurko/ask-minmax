The equivalent resistance between the origin and the lattice site (2n,0,0),
in an infinite Face Centered Cubic network consisting from identical resistors
each of resistance R, has been expressed in terms of the complete elliptic
integral of the first kind, and . The asymptotic behavior is investigated, and
some numerical values for the equivalent resistance are presented.
