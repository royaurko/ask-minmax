Experimental data for hadron radial and elliptic flow are used to investigate
their influence on the shape of the thermal photon spectrum at RHIC. Leaving
alone the actual mechanism of photon production and its time evolution, we
concentrate on the spectrum shape. Radial and longitudinal flow of the bulk can
change significantly the observed photon energy spectrum via the Doppler
Effect. Experimental thermal photon data are described by local frame
temperature parameter which depends on the assumption of longitudinal and
radial flow. From the observed hadron elliptic flow we estimate the modulation
of radial flow parameter versus the angle relative to the reaction plane. Based
on this we calculate elliptic flow parameter for thermal photons, which was
found to be very close to that for hadrons. Considering very similar amplitude
for hadron elliptic flow at LHC and RHIC, we demonstrate that thermal photons
at LHC should show large elliptic flow as well. All of these considerations are
also valid for the low invariant mass dilepton pairs.
