The presence of surfactants has a pronounced effect on the surface tension
and, hence, on the stress balance at the phase separating interface of
two-phase flows. The transport of momentum induced by the local variations of
the capillary forces are known as Marangoni effects. Here we study a model,
which assumes the surfactant to be soluble in one of the adjacent bulk phases
and which represents a generalization of the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations.
Based on maximal Lp-regularity results for suitable linearizations we obtain
local well-posedness of this model. We employ recent results from the Lp-theory
of two-phase flows without surfactant.
