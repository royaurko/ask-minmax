Starting with a model conical K\"ahler metric, we prove a uniform scalar
curvature bound for solutions to the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow assuming a
semi-ampleness type condition on the twisted canonical bundle. In the proof, we
also establish uniform estimates for the potentials and their time derivatives.
