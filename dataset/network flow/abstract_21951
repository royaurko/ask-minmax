A form for the two-point third order structure function has been calculated
for three dimensional homogeneous incompressible slowly rotating turbulent
fluid. It has been argued that it may possibly hint at the initiation of the
phenomenon of two-dimensionalisation of the 3D incompressible turbulence owing
to rotation.
