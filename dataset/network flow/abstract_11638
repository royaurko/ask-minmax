Experiments have shown that elasticity of disordered filamentous networks
with compliant crosslinks is very different from networks with rigid
crosslinks. Here, we model and analyze filamentous networks as a collection of
randomly oriented rigid filaments connected to each other by flexible
crosslinks that are modeled as worm-like chains. For relatively large
extensions we allow for enthalpic stretching of crosslinks' backbones. We show
that for sufficiently high crosslink density, the network linear elastic
response is affine on the scale of the filaments' length. The nonlinear regime
can become highly nonaffine and is characterized by a divergence of the elastic
modulus at finite strain. In contrast to the prior predictions, we do not find
an asymptotic regime in which the differential elastic modulus scales linearly
with the stress, although an approximate linear dependence can be seen in a
transition from entropic to enthalpic regimes. We discuss our results in light
of the recent experiments.
