We present a detailed evaluation of procedures that exploit mobility
prediction and prefetching to enhance offloading of traffic from mobile
networks to WiFi hotspots, for both delay tolerant and delay sensitive traffic.
We consider empirical measurements and evaluate the percentage of offloaded
traffic, data transfer delay, and energy consumption of the proposed
procedures. Our results illustrate how various factors such as mobile, WiFi and
hotspot backhaul throughput, data size, number of hotspots, along with time and
throughput estimation errors, influence the performance and energy efficiency
of mobile data offloading enhanced with mobility prediction and prefetching.
