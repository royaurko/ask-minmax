Networks Unplugged: Towards A Model of Compatibility Regulation Between
Information Platforms This Article outlines a basic model for regulating
interoperability between rival information platforms. In so doing, it insists
that antitrust, intellectual property, and telecommunications regulation all
must follow the same set of principles to facilitate competition between rival
standards where possible, mandating or allowing cooperation only where
necessary to facilitate competition within a standard when network-level
competition is infeasible. To date, the antitrust regime best approximates the
type of model I have in mind, but sound competition policy requires that
telecommunications regulation and intellectual property law follow its basic
principles as well.
