The form of the stress tensor is investigated in smooth, dense granular flows
which are generated in split-bottom shear geometries. We find that, within a
fluctuation fluidized spatial region, the form of the stress tensor is directly
dictated by the flow field: The stress and strain-rate tensors are co-linear.
The effective friction, defined as the ratio between shear and normal stresses
acting on a shearing plane, is found not to be constant but to vary throughout
the flowing zone. This variation can not be explained by inertial effects, but
appears to be set by the local geometry of the flow field. This is in agreement
with a recent prediction, but in contrast with most models for slow grain
flows, and points to there being a subtle mechanism that selects the flow
profiles.
