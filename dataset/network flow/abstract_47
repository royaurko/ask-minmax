In this work we study the degree distribution, the maximum vertex and edge
flow in non-uniform random Delaunay triangulations when geodesic routing is
used. We also investigate the vertex and edge flow in Erd\"os-Renyi random
graphs, geometric random graphs, expanders and random $k$-regular graphs.
Moreover we show that adding a random matching to the original graph can
considerably reduced the maximum vertex flow.
