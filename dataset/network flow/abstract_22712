We study a model for the observed phenomenon of electron spin resonance (ESR)
at the Zeeman frequency as seen by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) via
its current noise. The model for this ESR-STM phenomenon allows the STM current
to flow in two arms of a nanoscopic interferometer, one arm has direct
tunneling from the tip to the substrate while the second arm has tunneling
through two spin states. We evaluate analytically the noise spectrum for
non-polarized leads, as relevant to the experimental setup. We show that
spin-orbit interactions allow for an interference of two tunneling paths
resulting in a resonance effect.
