There are several applications in computational biophysics which require the
optimization of discrete interacting states; e.g., amino acid titration states,
ligand oxidation states, or discrete rotamer angles. Such optimization can be
very time-consuming as it scales exponentially in the number of sites to be
optimized. In this paper, we describe a new polynomial-time algorithm for
optimization of discrete states in macromolecular systems. This algorithm was
adapted from image processing and uses techniques from discrete mathematics and
graph theory to restate the optimization problem in terms of "maximum
flow-minimum cut" graph analysis. The interaction energy graph, a graph in
which vertices (amino acids) and edges (interactions) are weighted with their
respective energies, is transformed into a flow network in which the value of
the minimum cut in the network equals the minimum free energy of the protein,
and the cut itself encodes the state that achieves the minimum free energy.
Because of its deterministic nature and polynomial-time performance, this
algorithm has the potential to allow for the ionization state of larger
proteins to be discovered.
