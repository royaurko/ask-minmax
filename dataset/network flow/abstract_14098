We revisit the issue of sensitivity to initial flow and intrinsic variability
in hot-Jupiter atmospheric flow simulations, originally investigated by Cho et
al. (2008) and Thrastarson & Cho (2010). The flow in the lower region (~1 to 20
MPa) `dragged' to immobility and uniform temperature on a very short timescale,
as in Liu & Showman (2013), leads to effectively a complete cessation of
variability as well as sensitivity in three-dimensional (3D) simulations with
traditional primitive equations. Such momentum (Rayleigh) and thermal
(Newtonian) drags are, however, ad hoc for 3D giant planet simulations. For 3D
hot-Jupiter simulations, which typically already employ strong Newtonian drag
in the upper region, sensitivity is not quenched if only the Newtonian drag is
applied in the lower region, without the strong Rayleigh drag: in general, both
sensitivity and variability persist if the two drags are not applied
concurrently in the lower region. However, even when the drags are applied
concurrently, vertically-propagating planetary waves give rise to significant
variability in the ~0.05 to 0.5 MPa region, if the vertical resolution of the
lower region is increased (e.g. here with 1000 layers for the entire domain).
New observations on the effects of the physical setup and model convergence in
`deep' atmosphere simulations are also presented.
