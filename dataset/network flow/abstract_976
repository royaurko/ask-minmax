We consider the capacity problem for wireless networks. Networks are modeled
as random unit-disk graphs, and the capacity problem is formulated as one of
finding the maximum value of a multicommodity flow. In this paper, we develop a
proof technique based on which we are able to obtain a tight characterization
of the solution to the linear program associated with the multiflow problem, to
within constants independent of network size. We also use this proof method to
analyze network capacity for a variety of transmitter/receiver architectures,
for which we obtain some conclusive results. These results contain as a special
case (and strengthen) those of Gupta and Kumar for random networks, for which a
new derivation is provided using only elementary counting and discrete
probability tools.
