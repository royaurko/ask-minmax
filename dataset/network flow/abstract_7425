The micropolar fluid mechanics and its transport coefficients are derived
from the linearized Boltzmann equation of rotating particles. In the dilute
limit, as expected, transport coefficients relating to microrotation are not
important, but the results are useful for the description of collisional
granular flow on an inclined slope.
