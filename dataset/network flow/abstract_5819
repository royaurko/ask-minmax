Least box number coverage problem for calculating dimension of fractal
networks is a NP-hard problem. Meanwhile, the time complexity of random ball
coverage for calculating dimension is very low. In this paper we strictly
present the upper bound of relative error for random ball coverage algorithm.
We also propose twice-random ball coverage algorithm for calculating network
dimension. For many real-world fractal networks, when the network diameter is
sufficient large, the relative error upper bound of this method will tend to 0.
In this point of view, given a proper acceptable error range, the dimension
calculation is not a NP-hard problem, but P problem instead.
