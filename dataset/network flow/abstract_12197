For a network consisting of a graph with edge weights prescribed by a given
conductance function $c$, we consider the effects of replacing these weights
with a new function $b$ that satisfies $b \leq c$ on each edge. In particular,
we compare the corresponding energy spaces and the spectra of the Laplace
operators acting on these spaces. We use these results to derive estimates for
effective resistance on the two networks, and to compute a spectral invariant
for the canonical embedding of one energy space into the other.
