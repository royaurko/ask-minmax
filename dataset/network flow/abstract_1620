We propose a mechanism of cell motility which is based on contraction and
does not require protrusion. The contraction driven translocation of a cell is
due to internal flow of the cytoskeleton generated by molecular motors. Each
motor contributes to the stress field and simultaneously undergoes biased
random motion in the direction of a higher value of this stress. In this way
active cross-linkers use passive actin network as a medium through which they
interact and self-organize. The model exhibits motility initiation pattern
similar to the one observed in experiments on keratocytes.
