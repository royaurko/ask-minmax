The application of Neural Networks in High Energy Physics to the separation
of signal from background events is studied. A variety of problems usually
encountered in this sort of analyses, from variable selection to systematic
errors, are presented. The top--quark search is used as an example to
illustrate the problems and proposed solutions.
