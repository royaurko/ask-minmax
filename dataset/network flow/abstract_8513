This work analyses methods for the identification and the stability under
perturbation of a territorial community structure with specific reference to
transportation networks. We considered networks of commuters for a city and an
insular region. In both cases, we have studied the distribution of commuters'
trips (i.e., home-to-work trips and viceversa). The identification and
stability of the communities' cores are linked to the land-use distribution
within the zone system, and therefore their proper definition may be useful to
transport planners.
