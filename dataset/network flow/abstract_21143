In this paper, we propose two new models of spatial correlations in sensor
data in a data-gathering sensor network. A particular property of these models
is that if a sensor node knows in \textit{how many} bits it needs to transmit
its data, then it also knows \textit{which} bits of its data it needs to
transmit.
