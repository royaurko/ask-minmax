We report a direct current transport study of the local intergrain
connections in a polycrystalline SmFeAsO0.85 (Sm1111) bulk, for which we
earlier estimated significant intergranular critical current density Jc. Our
combined low temperature laser scanning microscopy (LTLSM) and scanning
electron microscopy observations revealed only few grain-to-grain transport
current paths, most of which switched off when a magnetic field was applied.
These regions typically occur where current crosses Fe-As, which is a
normal-metal wetting-phase that surrounds Sm1111 grains, producing a dense
array of superconducting-normal-superconducting contacts. Our study points out
the need to reduce the amount of grain boundary-wetting Fe-As phase, as well as
the crack density within pnictide grains, as these defects produce a multiply
connected current-blocking network.
