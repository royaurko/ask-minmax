We present 13 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed in the restframe
near-infrared (NIR) from 0.02 < z < 0.09 with the WIYN High-resolution Infrared
Camera (WHIRC) on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope. With only 1-3 points per light
curve and a prior on the time of maximum from the spectrum used to type the
object we measure an H-band dispersion of spectroscopically normal SNe Ia of
0.164 mag. These observations continue to demonstrate the improved standard
brightness of SNe Ia in H-band even with limited data. Our sample includes two
SNe Ia at z ~ 0.09, which represent the most distant restframe NIR H-band
observations published to date.
  This modest sample of 13 NIR SNe Ia represent the pilot sample for
"SweetSpot" - a three-year NOAO Survey program that will observe 144 SNe Ia in
the smooth Hubble flow. By the end of the survey we will have measured the
relative distance to a redshift of z ~ 0.05 to 1%. Nearby Type Ia supernova (SN
Ia) observations such as these will test the standard nature of SNe Ia in the
restframe NIR, allow insight into the nature of dust, and provide a critical
anchor for future cosmological SN Ia surveys at higher redshift.
