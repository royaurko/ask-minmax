We measure the eddy viscosity in the outermost layers of the solar convection
zone by comparing the rotation law computed with the Reynolds stress resulting
from f-plane simulations of the angular momentum transport in rotating
convection with the observed differential rotation pattern. The simulations
lead to a negative vertical and a positive horizontal angular momentum
transport. The consequence is a subrotation of the outermost layers, as it is
indeed indicated both by helioseismology and the observed rotation rates of
sunspots. In order to reproduce the observed gradient of the rotation rate a
value of about 1.5 x 10^{13} cm/s for the eddy viscosity is necessary.
Comparison with the magnetic eddy diffusivity derived from the sunspot decay
yields a surprisingly large magnetic Prandtl number of 150 for the
supergranulation layer. The negative gradient of the rotation rate also drives
a surface meridional flow towards the poles, in agreement with the results from
Doppler measurements. The successful reproduction of the abnormally positive
horizontal cross correlation (on the northern hemisphere) observed for bipolar
groups then provides an independent test for the resulting eddy viscosity.
