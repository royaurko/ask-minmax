We study the stability of the dynamics of a network of n neurons intercting
linearly through a random gaussian matrix of excitatory and inhibitory type.
Using the aproach developed in a previous paper we show some interesting
properties of the dynamic of this system for large values of n. We got
sufficient conditions for getting diverging synchronized behavior or stability.
