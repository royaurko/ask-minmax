High-throughput computing projects require the solution of large numbers of
problems. In many cases, these problems can be solved on desktop PCs, or can be
broken down into independent "PC-solvable" sub-problems. In such cases, the
projects are high-performance computing projects, but only because of the sheer
number of the needed calculations. We briefly describe our efforts to increase
the throughput of one such project. We then explain how to easily set up a
distributed computing facility composed of standard networked PCs running
Windows 95, 98, 2000, or NT. The facility requires no special software or
hardware, involves little or no re-coding of application software, and operates
almost invisibly to the owners of the PCs. Depending on the number and quality
of PCs recruited, performance can rival that of supercomputers.
