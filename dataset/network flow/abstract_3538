Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are computer systems which monitor
a network with the aim of discerning malicious from benign activity on that
network. With the recent growth of the Internet such security limitations are
becoming more and more pressing. Most of the current network intrusion
detection systems relay on labeled training data. An Unsupervised CA based
anomaly detection technique that was trained with unlabelled data is capable of
detecting previously unseen attacks. This new approach, based on the Cellular
Automata classifier (CAC) with Genetic Algorithms (GA), is used to classify
program behavior as normal or intrusive. Parameters and evolution process for
CAC with GA are discussed in detail. This implementation considers both
temporal and spatial information of network connections in encoding the network
connection information into rules in NIDS. Preliminary experiments with KDD Cup
data set show that the CAC classifier with Genetic Algorithms can effectively
detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate. Training a
NIDWCA (Network Intrusion Detection with Cellular Automata) classifier takes
significantly shorter time than any other conventional techniques.
