In the presence of collective flow a new model potential describing the
interaction of the hard jet with scattering centers is derived based on the
static color-screened Yukawa potential. The flow effect on jet quenching with
detailed balance is investigated in pQCD. It turns out, considering the
collective flow with velocity $v_z$ along the jet direction, the collective
flow decreases the LPM destructive interference comparing to that in the static
medium. The gluon absorption plays a more important role in the moving medium.
  The collective flow increases the energy gain from gluon absorption, however,
decreases the energy loss from gluon radiation, which is $(1 - v_z )$ times as
that in the static medium to the first order of opacity. In the presence of
collective flow, the second order in opacity correction is relatively small
compared to the first order. So that the total effective energy loss is
decreased. The flow dependence of the energy loss will affect the suppression
of high $p_T$ hadron spectrum and anisotropy parameter $v_2$ in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions.
