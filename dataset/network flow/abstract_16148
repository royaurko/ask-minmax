We have made measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in six galaxy
clusters at z > 0.2 using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment (SuZIE II)
in three frequency bands between 150 and 350 GHz. Simultaneous multi-frequency
measurements have been used to distinguish between thermal and kinematic
components of the SZ effect, and to significantly reduce the effects of
variations in atmospheric emission which can otherwise dominate the noise. We
have set limits to the peculiar velocities of each cluster with respect to the
Hubble flow, and have used the cluster sample to set a 95% confidence limit of
< 1410 km/s to the bulk flow of the intermediate-redshift universe in the
direction of the CMB dipole. This is the first time that SZ measurements have
been used to constrain bulk flows. We show that systematic uncertainties in
peculiar velocity determinations from the SZ effect are likely to be dominated
by submillimeter point sources and we discuss the level of this contamination.
