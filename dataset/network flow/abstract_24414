This paper examines the international nature of science fiction. The focus of
this research is to determine whether science fiction is primarily English
speaking and Western or global; being created and consumed by people in
non-Western, non-English speaking countries? Science fiction's international
presence was found in three ways, by network analysis, by examining a online
retailer and with a survey. Condor, a program developed by GalaxyAdvisors was
used to determine if science fiction is being talked about by non-English
speakers. An analysis of the international Amazon.com websites was done to
discover if it was being consumed worldwide. A survey was also conducted to see
if people had experience with science fiction. All three research methods
revealed similar results. Science fiction was found to be international, with
science fiction creators originating in different countries and writing in a
host of different languages. English and non-English science fiction was being
created and consumed all over the world, not just in the English speaking West.
