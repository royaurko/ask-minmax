We take the method of anomaly cancellation for the derivation of Hawking
radiation initiated by Robinson and Wilczek, and apply it to the non-extremal
five-dimensional D1-D5 black hole in string theory. The fluxes of the electric
charge flow and the energy-momentum tensor from the black hole are obtained.
They are shown to match exactly with those of the two-dimensional black body
radiation at the Hawking temperature.
