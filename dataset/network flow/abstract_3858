A resonant guided wave network (RGWN) is an approach to optical materials
design in which power propagation in guided wave circuits enables material
dispersion. The RGWN design, which consists of power-splitting elements
arranged at the nodes of a waveguide network, results in wave dispersion which
depends on network layout due to localized resonances at several length scales
in the network. These structures exhibit both localized resonances with Q ~ 80
at 1550 nm wavelength as well as photonic bands and band-gaps in large periodic
networks at infrared wavelengths.
