Graph Theoretic Process Network Synthesis is described as an introduction to
biological networks. Genetic, protein and metabolic systems are considered. The
theoretical work of Kauffman is discussed and amplified by critical property
excursions. The scaling apparent in biological systems is shown. Applications
to evolution and reverse engineering are construed. The use of several
programs, such as the Synprops, Design of molecules, Therm and Knapsack are
suggested as instruments to study biological process network synthesis. The
properties of robust self-assembly and Self-Organizing synthesis are important
contributors to the discussion. The bar code of life and intelligent design is
reviewed. The need for better data in biological systems is emphasized.
