The phase diagram and the thermodynamics of the random field Ising model
(RFIM) defined on a family of diamond hierarchical lattices of arbitrary
dimension and scaling factor $b=2$ is investigated. The phase diagram is
studied considering the flow of the renormalized joint probability
distributions of couplings and fields. A continuous (Gaussian) and a discrete
(delta-bimodal) initial symmetric probability distributions for the random
fields with variance $H_{0}$ are particularly considered. The thermodynamics
properties (energy, specific heat and magnetization) are obtained by an exact
recurrence procedure and analyzed as function of the temperature and the random
field. Close and above the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition evidences of
the formation of rare but large field induced correlated clusters of reversed
spins are observed. For all studied properties no strong qualitative distinct
behavior is found whenever the continuous or the discrete distribution of
random fields are considered.
