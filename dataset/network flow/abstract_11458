We present a general theory to obtain linear network codes utilizing forms
and obtain explicit families of equidimensional vector spaces, in which any
pair of distinct vector spaces intersect in the same small dimension. The
theory is inspired by the methods of the contributor utilizing the osculating spaces
of Veronese varieties.
  Linear network coding transmits information in terms of a basis of a vector
space and the information is received as a basis of a possibly altered vector
space. Ralf Koetter and Frank R. Kschischang introduced a metric on the set af
vector spaces and showed that a minimal distance decoder for this metric
achieves correct decoding if the dimension of the intersection of the
transmitted and received vector space is sufficiently large.
  The vector spaces in our construction are equidistant in the above metric and
the distance between any pair of vector spaces is large making them suitable
for linear network coding.
  The parameters of the resulting linear network codes are determined.
