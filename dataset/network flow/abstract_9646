In this paper we propose a network aware approach for routing in graded
network using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. ABC has been used as a
good search process for optimality exploitation and exploration. The paper
shows how ABC approach has been utilized for determining the optimal path based
on bandwidth availability of the link and how it outperformed non graded
network while deriving the optimal path. The selection of the nodes is based on
the direction of the destination node also. This would help in narrowing down
the number of nodes participating in routing. Here an agent system governs the
collection of QoS parameters of the nodes. Also a quadrant is synthesized with
centre as the source node. Based on the information of which quadrant the
destination belongs, a search is performed. Among the many searches observed by
the onlooker bees the best path is selected based on which onlooker bee comes
back to source with information of the optimal path. The simulation result
shows that the path convergence in graded network with ABC was 30% faster than
non-graded ABC.
