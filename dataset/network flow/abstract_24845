We present a new algorithm for estimating the Personalized PageRank (PPR)
between a source and target node on undirected graphs, with sublinear
running-time guarantees over the worst-case choice of source and target nodes.
Our work builds on a recent line of work on bidirectional estimators for PPR,
which obtained sublinear running-time guarantees but in an average case sense,
for a uniformly random choice of target node. Crucially, we show how the
reversibility of random walks on undirected networks can be exploited to
convert average-case to worst-case guarantees. While past bidirectional methods
combine forward random walks with reverse local pushes, our algorithm combines
forward local pushes with reverse random walks. We also modify our methods to
estimate random-walk probabilities for any length distribution, thereby
obtaining fast algorithms for estimating general graph diffusions, including
the heat kernel, on undirected networks. Whether such worst-case running-time
results extend to general graphs, or if PageRank computation is fundamentally
easier on undirected graphs as opposed to directed graphs, remains an open
question.
