A content can be replicated in more than one node, in Information Centric
Networks (ICNs). Thus, more than one path can be followed to reach the same
content, and it is necessary to decide the interface(s) to be selected in every
network node to forward content requests towards such multiple content
containers. A multipath forwarding strategy defines how to perform this choice.
In this paper we propose a general analytical model to evaluate the effect of
multipath forwarding strategies on the performance of an ICN content delivery,
whose congestion control follows a receiver driven, loss-based AIMD scheme. We
use the model to understand the behavior of ICN multipath forwarding strategies
proposed in the literature so far, and to devise and evaluate a novel strategy.
The considered multipath forwarding strategies are also evaluated in a
realistic network setting, by using the PlanetLab testbed.
