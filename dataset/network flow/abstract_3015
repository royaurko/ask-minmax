We investigate the flow in a spherical shell subject to a time harmonic
oscillation of its rotation rate, also called longitudinal libration, when the
oscillation frequency is larger than twice the mean rotation rate. In this
frequency regime, no inertial waves are directly excited by harmonic forcing.
We show however that it can generate through non-linear interactions in the
Ekman layers a strong mean zonal flow in the interior. An analytical theory is
developed using a perturbative approach in the limit of small libration
amplitude $\epsilon$ and small Ekman number $E$. The mean flow is found to be
at leading order an azimuthal flow which scales as the square of the libration
amplitude and only depends on the cylindrical-radius coordinate. The mean flow
also exhibits a discontinuity across the cylinder tangent to the inner sphere.
We show that this discontinuity can be smoothed through multi-scale Stewartson
layers. The mean flow is also found to possess a weak axial flow which scales
as $O(\epsilon^2 E^{5/42})$ in the Stewartson layers. The analytical solution
is compared to axisymmetric numerical simulations and a good agreement is
demonstrated.
