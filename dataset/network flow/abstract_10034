In this paper we consider the Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$ (NS-$\alpha$) model
within a large-eddy simulation framework. An investigation is carried out using
fully-developed turbulent channel flow at a fairly low Reynolds number. This is
a flow where diffusion plays a prominent role, and presents a challenge to the
nonlinear model investigated here. It is found that when $\alpha^{2}_{k}$ is
based on the mesh spacing, the NS-$\alpha$ model has a tendency to tilt
spanwise vorticity in the streamwise direction, leading to high skin friction.
This is due to interaction between the spanwise vorticity, the model, and the
streamwise streaks. To overcome this problem $\alpha^{2}_{k}$ is damped in the
streak affected region. Results overall demonstrate the potential of the model
to reproduce some features of the DNS (helicity statistics and small-scale
features), but more work is required before the full potential of the model can
be achieved. In addition to the channel flow investigation, a derivation of the
governing using Hamilton's principle is given. The derivation is intended to be
clear and accessible to a wide audience, and contains a new interpretation of
the model parameter.
