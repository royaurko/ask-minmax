In this paper, we study the piezoresistive response and its anisotropy for a
bond percolation model of granular metals. Both effective medium results and
numerical Monte Carlo calculations of finite simple cubic networks show that
the piezoresistive anisotropy is a strongly dependent function of bond
probability p and of bond conductance distribution width \Delta g. We find that
piezoresistive anisotropy is strongly suppressed as p is reduced and/or \Delta
g is enhanced and that it vanishes at the percolation thresold p=p_c. We argue
that a measurement of the piezoresistive anisotropy could be a sensitive tool
to estimate critical metallic concentrations in real granular metals.
