Content distribution networks (CDNs) which serve to deliver web objects
(e.g., documents, applications, music and video, etc.) have seen tremendous
growth since its emergence. To minimize the retrieving delay experienced by a
user with a request for a web object, caching strategies are often applied -
contents are replicated at edges of the network which is closer to the user
such that the network distance between the user and the object is reduced. In
this literature survey, evolution of caching is studied. A recent research
paper [15] in the field of large-scale caching for CDN was chosen to be the
anchor paper which serves as a guide to the topic. Research studies after and
relevant to the anchor paper are also analyzed to better evaluate the
statements and results of the anchor paper and more importantly, to obtain an
unbiased view of the large scale collaborate caching systems as a whole.
