Many complex systems are characterized by broad distributions capturing, for
example, the size of firms, the population of cities or the degree distribution
of complex networks. Typically this feature is explained by means of a
preferential growth mechanism. Although heterogeneity is expected to play a
role in the evolution it is usually not considered in the modeling probably due
to a lack of empirical evidence on how it is distributed. We characterize the
intrinsic heterogeneity of groups in an online community and then show that
together with a simple linear growth and an inhomogeneous birth rate it
explains the broad distribution of group members.
