In three-dimensional turbulent flows energy is supplied at large scales and
cascades down to the smallest scales where viscosity dominates. The flux of
energy through scales implies the generation of small scales from larger ones,
which is the fundamental reason for the irreversibility of the dynamics of
turbulent flows. As we showed recently, this irreversibility manifests itself
by an asymmetry of the probability distribution of the instantaneous power $p$
of the forces acting on fluid elements. In particular, the third moment of $p$
was found to be negative. Yet, a physical connection between the
irreversibility manifested in the distribution of $p$ and the energy flux or
small-scale generation in turbulence has not been established. Here, with
analytical calculations and support from numerical simulations of fully
developed turbulence, we connect the asymmetry in the power distribution, {\it
i.e.}, the negative value of $\langle p^3 \rangle$, to the generation of small
scales, or more precisely, to the amplification (stretching) of vorticity in
turbulent flows. Our result is the first step towards a quantitative
understanding of the origin of the irreversibility observed at the level of
individual Lagrangian trajectories in turbulent flows.
