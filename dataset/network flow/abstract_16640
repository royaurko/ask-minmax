We measure electrical transport on networks of single wall nanotube of
different origin as a function of temperature T, voltage V and pressure P . We
observe Luttinger liquid (LL) behavior, a conductance T^alpha and a dynamic
conductance V^alpha . We observe a sample dependent P variation of the alpha
parameters, interpreted as fermi level changes due to pressure induced charge
transfer. We show how, through standard four-leads and crossed configuration
methods, it is possible to determine alpha_bulk and alpha_end, respectively. We
study and discuss the pressure and doping level dependences of the number of
channels N, the LL parameter g and the intra-rope tube-tube coupling constant U .
