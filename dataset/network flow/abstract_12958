A new vehicular traffic flow model based on a stochastic jump process in
vehicle acceleration and braking is introduced. It is based on a master
equation for the single car probability density in space, velocity and
acceleration with an additional vehicular chaos assumption and is derived via a
Markovian ansatz for car pairs. This equation is analyzed using simple driver
interaction models in the spatial homogeneous case. Velocity distributions in
stochastic equilibrium, together with the car density dependence of their
moments, i.e. mean velocity and scattering and the fundamental diagram are
presented.
