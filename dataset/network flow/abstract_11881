Cooperation among mobile devices and utilizing multiple interfaces such as
cellular and local area links simultaneously are promising to meet the
increasing throughput demand over cellular links. In particular, when mobile
devices are in the close proximity of each other and are interested in the same
content, device-to-device connections such as WiFi-Direct, in addition to
cellular links, can be utilized to construct a cooperative system. However, it
is crucial to understand the potential of network coding for cooperating mobile
devices with multiple interfaces. In this paper, we consider this problem, and
(i) develop network coding schemes for cooperative mobile devices with multiple
interfaces, and (ii) characterize the performance of network coding by using
the number of transmissions to recover all packets as a performance metric.
