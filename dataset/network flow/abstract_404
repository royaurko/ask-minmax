In this work, we explore the performance of backpressure routing and
scheduling for TCP flows over wireless networks. TCP and backpressure are not
compatible due to a mismatch between the congestion control mechanism of TCP
and the queue size based routing and scheduling of the backpressure framework.
We propose a TCP-aware backpressure routing and scheduling that takes into
account the behavior of TCP flows. TCP-aware backpressure (i) provides
throughput optimality guarantees in the Lyapunov optimization framework, (ii)
gracefully combines TCP and backpressure without making any changes to the TCP
protocol, (iii) improves the throughput of TCP flows significantly, and (iv)
provides fairness across competing TCP flows.
