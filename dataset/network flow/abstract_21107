We present a quantitative theory for the effects of correlated doping on the
ferromagnetism of diluted magnetic semiconductors. It predicts that room
temperature ferromagnetism should be possible in homogeneous, but correlated,
samples of Mn$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As. The theory predicts lower critical temperatures
for Mn$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N.
