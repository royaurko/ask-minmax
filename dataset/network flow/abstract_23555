Raman scattering from binary GexSe1-x glasses under hydrostatic pressure
shows onset of a steady increase in the frequency of modes of corner-sharing
GeSe4 tetrahedral units when the external pressure P exceeds a threshold value
Pc. The threshold pressure Pc(x) decreases with x in the 0.15 < x < 0.20 range,
nearly vanishes in the 0.20 < x < 0.25 range, and then increases in the 0.25 <
x < 1/3 range. These Pc(x) trends closely track those in the non-reversing
enthalpy, DeltaHnr(x), near glass transitions (Tgs), and in particular, both
DeltaHnr(x) and Pc(x) vanish in the reversibility window (0.20 < x < 0.25). It
is suggested that Pc provides a measure of stress at the Raman active units;
and its vanishing in the reversibility window suggests that these units are
part of an isostatically rigid backbone. Isostaticity also accounts for the
non-aging behavior of glasses observed in the reversibility window.
