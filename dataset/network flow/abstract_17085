Several studies demonstrate that there are critical differences between real
wireless networks and simulation models. This finding has permitted to extract
spatial and temporal properties for links and to provide efficient methods as
biased link sampling to guarantee efficient routing structure. Other works have
focused on computing metrics to improve routing, specially the reuse of the
measure of entropy. From there, rises the idea of formulating a new measure of
entropy that gives an overview of the spatiotemporal stability of a link. This
measure will rely on spatial and temporal properties of links and fed with the
efficiency of biased link sampling.
