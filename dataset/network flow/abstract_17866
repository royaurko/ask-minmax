A two-dimensional bistable lattice is a periodic triangular network of
non-linear bi-stable rods. The energy of each rod is piecewise quadratic and
has two minima. Consequently, a rod undergoes a reversible phase transition
when its elongation reaches a critical value. We study an energy minimization
problem for such lattices. The objective is to characterize the effective
energy of the system when the number of nodes in the network approaches
infinity. The most important feature of the effective energy is its "flat
bottom". This means that the effective energy density is zero for all strains
inside a certain three-dimensional set in the strain space. The flat bottom
occurs because the microscopic discrete model has a large number of deformed
states that carry no forces. We call such deformations still states. In the
paper, we present a complete characterization of the "flat bottom" set in terms
of the parameters of the network. This is done by constructing a family of
still states whose average strains densely fill the set in question.
  The two-dimensional case is more difficult than the previously studied case
of one-dimensional chains, because the elongations in two-dimensional networks
must satisfy certain compatibility conditions that do not arise in the
one-dimensional case. We derive these conditions for small and arbitrary
deformations. For small deformations a complete analysis is provided.
