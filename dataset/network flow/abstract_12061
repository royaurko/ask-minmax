A combination of a neural network with rule firing information from a
rule-based system is used to generate segment durations for a text-to-speech
system. The system shows a slight improvement in performance over a neural
network system without the rule firing information. Synthesized speech using
segment durations was accepted by listeners as having about the same quality as
speech generated using segment durations extracted from natural speech.
