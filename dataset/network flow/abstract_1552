The solid-on-solid model provides a commonly used framework for the
description of surfaces. In the last years it has been extended in order to
investigate the effect of defects in the bulk on the roughness of the surface.
The determination of the ground state of this model leads to a combinatorial
problem, which is reduced to an uncapacitated, convex minimum-circulation
problem. We will show that the successive shortest path algorithm solves the
problem in polynomial time.
