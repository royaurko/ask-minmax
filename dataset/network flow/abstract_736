We study how the choice of packet scheduling algorithms influences end-to-end
performance on long network paths. Taking a network calculus approach, we
consider both deterministic and statistical performance metrics. A key enabling
contribution for our analysis is a significantly sharpened method for computing
a statistical bound for the service given to a flow by the network as a whole.
For a suitably parsimonious traffic model we develop closed-form expressions
for end-to-end delays, backlog, and output burstiness. The deterministic
versions of our bounds yield optimal bounds on end-to-end backlog and output
burstiness for some schedulers, and are highly accurate for end-to-end delay
bounds.
