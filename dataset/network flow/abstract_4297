We study the detailed epidemic spreading process in scale-free networks with
weight that denote familiarity between two people or computers. The result
shows that spreading velocity reaches a peak quickly then decays representing
power-law time behavior, and comparing to non-weighted networks, precise
hierarchical dynamics is not found although the nodes with larger strength is
preferential to be infected.
