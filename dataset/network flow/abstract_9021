This paper considers the problem of optimally deploying omnidirectional
sensors, with potentially limited sensing radius, in a network-like
environment. This model provides a compact and effective description of complex
environments as well as a proper representation of road or river networks. We
present a two-step procedure based on a discrete-time gradient ascent algorithm
to find a local optimum for this problem. The first step performs a coarse
optimization where sensors are allowed to move in the plane, to vary their
sensing radius and to make use of a reduced model of the environment called
collapsed network. It is made up of a finite discrete set of points,
barycenters, produced by collapsing network edges. Sensors can be also
clustered to reduce the complexity of this phase. The sensors' positions found
in the first step are then projected on the network and used in the second
finer optimization, where sensors are constrained to move only on the network.
The second step can be performed on-line, in a distributed fashion, by sensors
moving in the real environment, and can make use of the full network as well as
of the collapsed one. The adoption of a less constrained initial optimization
has the merit of reducing the negative impact of the presence of a large number
of local optima. The effectiveness of the presented procedure is illustrated by
a simulated deployment problem in an airport environment.
