We study the consumption behaviour of an asymmetric network of heterogeneous
agents in the framework of discrete choice models with stochastic decision
rules. We assume that the interactions among agents are uniquely specified by
their ``social distance'' and consumption is driven by peering, distinction and
aspiration effects. The utility of each agent is positively or negatively
affected by the choices of other agents and consumption is driven by peering,
imitation and distinction effects. The dynamical properties of the model are
explored, by numerical simulations, using three different evolution algorithms
with: parallel, sequential and random-sequential updating rules. We analyze the
long-time behaviour of the system which, given the asymmetric nature of the
interactions, can either converge into a fixed point or a periodic attractor.
We discuss the role of symmetric versus asymmetric contributions to the utility
function and also that of idiosyncratic preferences, costs and memory in the
consumption decision of the agents.
