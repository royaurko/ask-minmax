We present the derivation, for these vacuum metrics, of the Painlev\'e VI
equation first obtained by Christodoulakis and Terzis, from the field equations
for both minkowskian and euclidean signatures. This allows a complete
discussion and the precise connection with some old results due to Kinnersley.
The hyperk\"ahler metrics are shown to belong to the Multi-Centre class and for
the cases exhibiting an integrable geodesic flow the relevant Killing tensors
are given. We conclude by the proof that for the Bianchi B family, excluding
type III, there are no hyperk\"ahler metrics.
