The energy flow, dE/d(eta), is studied at large pseudorapidities in
proton-proton collisions at the LHC, for centre-of-mass energies of 0.9 and 7
TeV. The measurements are made in the pseudorapidity range 3.15 < |eta| < 4.9,
for both minimum-bias events and events with at least two high-momentum jets,
using the CMS detector. The data are compared to various pp Monte Carlo event
generators whose theoretical models and input parameter values are sensitive to
the energy-flow measurements. Inclusion of multiple-parton interactions in the
Monte Carlo event generators is found to improve the description of the
energy-flow measurements.
