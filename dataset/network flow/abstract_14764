Following the experimental program at BNL RHIC, we perform a similar "energy
scan" using 3+1D viscous hydrodynamics coupled to the UrQMD hadron cascade, and
study the collision energy dependence of pion and kaon rapidity distributions
and $m_T$-spectra, as well as charged hadron elliptic flow. To this aim the
equation of state for finite baryon density from a Chiral model coupled to the
Polyakov loop is employed for hydrodynamic stage. 3D initial conditions from
UrQMD are used to study gradual deviation from boost-invariant scaling flow. We
find that the inclusion of shear viscosity in the hydrodynamic stage of
evolution consistently improves the description of the data for Pb-Pb
collisions at CERN SPS, as well as of the elliptic flow measurements for Au-Au
collisions in the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at BNL RHIC. The suggested
value of shear viscosity is $\eta/s\ge0.2$ for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=6.3\dots39$ GeV.
