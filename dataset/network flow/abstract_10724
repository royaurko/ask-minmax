In this article we study the asymptotic behavior of incompressible, ideal,
time-dependent two dimensional flow in the exterior of a single smooth obstacle
when the size of the obstacle becomes very small. Our main purpose is to
identify the equation satisfied by the limit flow. We will see that the
asymptotic behavior depends on $\gamma$, the circulation around the obstacle.
For smooth flow around a single obstacle, $\gamma$ is a conserved quantity
which is determined by the initial data. We will show that if $\gamma = 0$, the
limit flow satisfies the standard incompressible Euler equations in the full
plane but, if $\gamma \neq 0$, the limit equation acquires an additional
forcing term. We treat this problem by first constructing a sequence of
approximate solutions to the incompressible 2D Euler equation in the full plane
from the exact solutions obtained when solving the equation on the exterior of
each obstacle and then passing to the limit on the weak formulation of the
equation. We use an explicit treatment of the Green's function of the exterior
domain based on conformal maps, {\it a priori} estimates obtained by carefully
examining the limiting process and the Div-Curl Lemma, together with a standard
weak convergence treatment of the nonlinearity for the passage to the limit.
