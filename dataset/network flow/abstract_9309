We present an algorithm for boundary approximation in locally-linked sensor
networks that communicate with a remote monitoring station. Delaunay
triangulations and Voronoi diagrams are used to generate a sensor communication
network and define boundary segments between sensors, respectively. The
proposed algorithm reduces remote station communication by approximating
boundaries via a decentralized computation executed within the sensor network.
Moreover, the algorithm identifies boundaries based on differences between
neighboring sensor readings, and not absolute sensor values. An analysis of the
bandwidth consumption of the algorithm is presented and compared to two naive
approaches. The proposed algorithm reduces the amount of remote communication
(compared to the naive approaches) and becomes increasingly useful in networks
with more nodes.
