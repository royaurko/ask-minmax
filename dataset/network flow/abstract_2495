We have performed a simulation study of the social network arising from
dancing partner selection in Tango Argentino. Tango Argentino is a famous
intellectual dance which combines individualistic behaviour with consensual
social rules, generating complex patterns of network behaviour in time. We
quantify these patterns by time-dependent degree distributions and clustering
coefficients for the network structure, and by monitoring the evolution of the
individual dancers skill. In particular, we have investigated how successful
new dancers are in entering the network under the promotion of established
network members. Our approach allows us to predict the success of mentoring in
a social network.
