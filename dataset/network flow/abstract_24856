The past decade has seen many proposals for future Internet architectures.
Most of these proposals require substantial changes to the current networking
infrastructure and end-user devices, resulting in a failure to move from theory
to real-world deployment. This paper describes one possible strategy for
bootstrapping the initial deployment of future Internet architectures by
focusing on providing high availability as an incentive for early adopters.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world implementation, we show that with
only a small number of adopting ISPs, customers can obtain high availability
guarantees. We discuss design, implementation, and evaluation of an
availability device that allows customers to bridge into the future Internet
architecture without modifications to their existing infrastructure.
