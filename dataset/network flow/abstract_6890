We derive a logarithmic Sobolev inequality along the Ricci flow without any
restriction on time, which depends only on the initial metric via rudimentary
geometric data, assuming only that a certain first eigenvalue is positive. As a
consequence we obtain a uniform Sobolev inequality along the Ricci flow without
any restriction on time. One application of it is a uniform kappa-noncollapsing
estimate which holds true for all time. We also obtain similar results for
bounded time without assuming the eigenvalue condition. The results extend to
the Ricci flow with surgeries.
