The process that prevents the deposition of cooled gas in cooling flows must
rely on feedback in order to maintain gas with short cooling times, while
preventing the bulk of the gas from cooling to low temperatures. The primary
candidate for the feedback mechanism is the accretion of cooled and cooling gas
by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Despite some difficulties with this model,
the high incidence of central radio sources in cooling flows and the common
occurrence of radio lobe cavities, together, support this view. The Bondi
accretion rate for the intracluster gas onto the AGN depends on the gas
properties only through its specific entropy and that is governed directly by
competition between heating and cooling. This provides a viable link for the
feedback process. It is argued that the mass accreted between outbursts by the
central AGN is only sensitive to the mass of the black hole and the gas
temperature. Bondi accretion by an AGN leads to a simple expression for
outburst energy that can be tested against observations.
