Random matrix theory is finding an increasing number of applications in the
context of information theory and communication systems, especially in studying
the properties of complex networks. Such properties include short-term and
long-term correlation. We study the spectral fluctuations of the adjacency of
networks using random-matrix theory. We consider the influence of the spectral
unfolding, which is a necessary procedure to remove the secular properties of
the spectrum, on different spectral statistics. We find that, while the spacing
distribution of the eigenvalues shows little sensitivity to the unfolding
method used, the spectral rigidity has greater sensitivity to unfolding.
