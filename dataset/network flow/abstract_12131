Dynamical wiring and rewiring in neural networks are carried out by
activity-dependent growth and retraction of axons and dendrites, guided by
gudance molecules, released by target cells. Experience-dependent structural
changes in cortical microcurcuts lead to changes in activity, i.e. to changes
in information encoded. Specific pattens of external stimulation can lead to
creation of new synaptical connections between neurons. Calcium influxes
controlled by neuronal activity regulates processes of neurotrophic factors
release by neurons, growth cones movement and synapse differentiation in
developing neural system, therefore activity-dependent self-wiring can serve as
a basis of structural plasticity in cortical networks and can be considered as
a form of learning.
