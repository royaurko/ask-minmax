In this paper, we study certain geometric and topological properties of
online social networks using the concept of density and geometric vector
spaces. "Moi Krug" ("My Circle"), a Russian social network that promotes the
principle of the "six degrees of separation" and is positioning itself as a
vehicle for professionals and recruiters seeking each others' services, is used
as a test vehicle.
