In this note, we propose a new idea by analyzing the basic disturbance
equations, and give starting equations for understanding the instability
phenomena of laminar flows and transition to turbulence. It is considered that
there is an interaction between the disturbance and the base flow in the
process of disturbance amplification. The transition to turbulence is the
result of this interaction. The linearity of the disturbance in linear theory
is oversimplified the problem. It is pointed out that the development of
disturbance is subjected to the influence of the base flow, and these effects
must be included in the governing equations of the disturbance.
