Many communication networks consist of legacy and new devices using
heterogeneous technologies, such as copper wire, optical fiber, wireless and
power line communication (PLC). Most network simulators, however, have been
designed to work well with a single underlying link layer technology.
Furthermore, there are hardly any suitable models for network simulators of
PLC. In this paper we present extensions of the Contiki OS network simulator
Cooja: A device may support multiple interfaces accessing multiple PLC segments
or wireless channels and a simple PLC medium model is introduced describing
packet loss probability as a function of distance. We test our approach to
simulate a Smart Grid scenario of Ring Main Units equipped with PLC devices.
