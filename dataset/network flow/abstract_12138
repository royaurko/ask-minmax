We propose a Markov chain simulation method to generate simple connected
random graphs with a specified degree sequence and level of clustering. The
networks generated by our algorithm are random in all other respects and can
thus serve as generic models for studying the impacts of degree distributions
and clustering on dynamical processes as well as null models for detecting
other structural properties in empirical networks.
