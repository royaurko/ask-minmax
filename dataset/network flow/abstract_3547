The problem of controllability of the dynamical state of a network is central
in network theory and has wide applications ranging from network medicine to
financial markets. The driver nodes of the network are the nodes that can bring
the network to the desired dynamical state if an external signal is applied to
them. Using the framework of structural controllability, here we show that the
density of nodes with in-degree and out-degree equal to $0$, $1$ and $2$
determines the number of driver nodes of random networks. Moreover we show that
networks with minimum in-degree and out-degree greater than 2, are always fully
controllable by an infinitesimal fraction of driver nodes, regardless on the
other properties of the degree distribution. Finally, based on these results,
we propose an algorithm to improve the controllability of networks.
