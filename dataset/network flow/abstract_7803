This paper is devoted to study thermodynamic formalism for suspension flows
defined over countable alphabets. We are mostly interested in the regularity
properties of the pressure function. We establish conditions for the pressure
function to be real analytic or to exhibit a phase transition. We also
construct an example of a potential for which the pressure has countably many
phase transitions.
