The primary contribution of this work is to examine the energy efficiency of
pulse coupled oscillation for time synchronization in a realistic wireless
network environment and to explore the impact of mobility on convergence rate.
Energy coupled oscillation is susceptible to interference; this approach uses
reception and decoding of short packet bursts to eliminate this problem. The
energy efficiency of a commonly used timestamp broadcast algorithm is compared
and contrasted with pulse-coupled oscillation. The emergent pulse coupled
oscillation technique shows greater energy efficiency as well as robustness
with mobility. A proportion of the sensors may be integrated with GPS receivers
in order to obtain a master clock time.
