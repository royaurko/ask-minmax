In this paper we present a model for the growth and evolution of Internet
providers. The model reproduces the data observed for the Internet connection
as probed by tracing routes from different computers. This problem represents a
paramount case of study for growth processes in general, but can also help in
the understanding the properties of the Net. Our main result is that this
network can be reproduced by a self-organized interaction between users and
providers that can rearrange in time. This model can then be considered as a
prototype model for the class of phenomena of aggregation process in social
networks.
