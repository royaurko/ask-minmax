We revisit a problem first introduced by Francis Hama in his 1962 Physics of
Fluids article 'Streaklines in a Perturbed Shear Flow.' Using a nascent
computer, Hama calculated streaklines and pathlines for an inviscid shear flow
containing a non-amplifying, sinusoidal, traveling-wave perturbation. He found
that this simple flow field and perturbation produced intuitive pathlines, yet,
the resulting streaklines were non-obvious and much more complex than the
pathlines. He used this work to stress the importance of understanding the
difference between flow visualization and measurement techniques, and that
different techniques may reveal different information regarding the true
character or behavior of the flow. This work revisits the Hama Problem and
presents the original findings in a fluid dynamics video prepared for the 2013
Gallery of Fluid Motion.
