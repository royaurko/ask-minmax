Mixed traffic flow consisting of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise
control (ACC) and manually driven vehicles is analyzed using car-following
simulations. Unlike simulations that show suppression of jams due to increased
string stability, simulations of merging from an on-ramp onto a freeway have
not thus far demonstrated a substantial positive impact of ACC. In this paper
cooperative merging is proposed to increase throughput and increase distance
traveled in a fixed time (reduce travel times). In such a system an ACC vehicle
senses not only the preceding vehicle in the same lane but also the vehicle
immediately in front in the opposite lane. Prior to reaching the merge region,
the ACC vehicle adjusts its velocity to ensure that a safe gap for merging is
obtained. If on-ramp demand is moderate, partial implementation of cooperative
merging where only main line ACC vehicles react to an on-ramp vehicle is
effective. Significant improvement in throughput (18%) and increases up to 3 km
in distance traveled in 500 s are found for 50% ACC mixed flow relative to the
flow of all manual vehicles. For large demand, full implementation is required
to reduce congestion.
