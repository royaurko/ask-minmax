In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create
unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the
content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process
is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities.
However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face
recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of
biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we
introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates
artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural
representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary
images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images.
Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised
artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path
forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive
artistic imagery.
