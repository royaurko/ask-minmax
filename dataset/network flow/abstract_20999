The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising network architecture
for future mobile communications, and one practical hurdle for its large scale
implementation is the stringent requirement of high capacity and low latency
fronthaul connecting the distributed remote radio heads (RRH) to the
centralized baseband pools (BBUs) in the C-RAN. To improve the scalability of
C-RAN networks, it is very important to take the fronthaul loading into
consideration in the signal detection, and it is very desirable to reduce the
fronthaul loading in C-RAN systems. In this paper, we consider uplink C-RAN
systems and we propose a distributed fronthaul compression scheme at the
distributed RRHs and a joint recovery algorithm at the BBUs by deploying the
techniques of distributed compressive sensing (CS). Different from conventional
distributed CS, the CS problem in C-RAN system needs to incorporate the
underlying effect of multi-access fading for the end-to-end recovery of the
transmitted signals from the users. We analyze the performance of the proposed
end-to-end signal recovery algorithm and we show that the aggregate measurement
matrix in C-RAN systems, which contains both the distributed fronthaul
compression and multiaccess fading, can still satisfy the restricted isometry
property with high probability. Based on these results, we derive tradeoff
results between the uplink capacity and the fronthaul loading in C-RAN systems.
