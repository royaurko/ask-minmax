It is well known that in a gas-filled duct or channel along which a
temperature gradient is applied, a thermal creep flow is created. Here we show
that a mass and momentum flux can also be induced in a gas confined between two
parallel structured surfaces at different temperatures, i.e.
\textit{orthogonal} to the temperature gradient. We use both analytical and
numerical methods to compute the resulting fluxes. The momentum flux assumes
its maximum value in the free-molecular flow regime, the (normalized) mass flux
in the transition flow regime. The discovered phenomena could find applications
in novel methods for energy-conversion and thermal pumping of gases.
