The two-point correlation function of a Potts model on a graph $G$ may be
expressed in terms of the flow polynomials of `Poissonian' random graphs
derived from $G$ by replacing each edge by a Poisson-distributed number of
copies of itself. This fact extends to Potts models the so-called
random-current expansion of the Ising model.
