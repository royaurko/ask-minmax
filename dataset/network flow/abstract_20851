In order to determine the user's trust is a growing concern for ensuring
privacy and security in a cloud computing environment. In cloud, user's data is
stored in one or more remote server(s) which poses more security challenges for
the system. One of the most important concerns is to protect user's sensitive
information from other users and hackers that may cause data leakage in cloud
storage. Having this security challenge in mind, this paper focuses on the
development of a more secure cloud environment, to determine the trust of the
service requesting contributorities by using a novel VM (Virtual Machine) monitoring
system. Moreover, this research aims towards proposing a new trusted and
collaborative agent-based two-tier framework, titled WAY (Who Are You?), to
protect cloud resources. The framework can be used to provide security in
network, infrastructure, as well as data storage in a heterogeneous cloud
platform. If the trust updating policy is based on network activities, then the
framework can provide network security. Similarly, it provides storage security
by monitoring uncontributorized access activities by the Cloud Service Users (CSU).
Infrastructure security can be provided by monitoring the use of privileged
instructions within the isolated VMs. The uniqueness of the proposed security
solution lies in the fact that it ensures security and privacy both at the
service provider level as well as at the user level in a cloud environment.
