This paper studies the effect of linguistic constraints on the large scale
organization of language. It describes the properties of linguistic networks
built using texts of written language with the words randomized. These
properties are compared to those obtained for a network built over the text in
natural order. It is observed that the "random" networks too exhibit
small-world and scale-free characteristics. They also show a high degree of
clustering. This is indeed a surprising result - one that has not been
addressed adequately in the literature. We hypothesize that many of the network
statistics reported here studied are in fact functions of the distribution of
the underlying data from which the network is built and may not be indicative
of the nature of the concerned network.
