Differential elliptic flow and particle spectra are calculated taking into
account the finite transport opacity of the gluon plasma produced in Au+Au at
Ecm ~ 130 A GeV at RHIC. Covariant numerical solutions of the ultrarelativistic
Boltzmann equation are obtained using the MPC parton cascade technique. For
typical pQCD (~3 mb) elastic cross sections, extreme initial gluon densities,
dN/deta ~ 15000, are required to reproduce the elliptic flow saturation pattern
reported by STAR. However, we show that the solutions depend mainly on the
transport opacity, $\chi=\int dz \sigma_t\rho_g$, and thus the data can also be
reproduced with dN/deta ~ 1000, but with extreme elastic parton cross sections,
\~45 mb. We demonstrate that the spectra and elliptic flow are dominated by
numerical artifacts unless parton subdivisions ~100-1000 are applied to retain
Lorentz covariance for RHIC initial conditions.
