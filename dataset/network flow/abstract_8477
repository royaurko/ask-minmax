Application-layer multicast implements the multicast functionality at the
application layer. The main goal of application-layer multicast is to construct
and maintain efficient distribution structures between endhosts. In this paper
we focus on the implementation of an application-layer multicast network using
PlanetLab. We observe that the total time required to measure network latency
over TCP is influenced dramatically by the TCP connection time. We argue that
end-host distribution is not only influenced by the quality of network links
but also by the time required to make connections between nodes. We provide
several solutions to decrease the total end-host distribution time.
