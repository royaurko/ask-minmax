Stochastic network calculus is a newly developed theory for stochastic
service guarantee analysis of computer networks. In the current stochastic
network calculus literature, its fundamental models are based on the cumulative
amount of traffic or cumulative amount of service. However, there are network
scenarios where direct application of such models is difficult. This paper
presents a temporal approach to stochastic network calculus. The key idea is to
develop models and derive results from the time perspective. Particularly, we
define traffic models and service models based on the cumulative packet
inter-arrival time and the cumulative packet service time, respectively.
Relations among these models as well as with the existing models in the
literature are established. In addition, we prove the basic properties of the
proposed models, such as delay bound and backlog bound, output
characterization, concatenation property and superposition property. These
results form a temporal stochastic network calculus and compliment the existing
results.
