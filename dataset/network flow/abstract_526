In this paper we study a Gaussian relay-interference network, in which relay
(helper) nodes are to facilitate competing information flows over a wireless
network. We focus on a two-stage relay-interference network where there are
weak cross-links, causing the networks to behave like a chain of Z Gaussian
channels. For these Gaussian ZZ and ZS networks, we establish an approximate
characterization of the rate region. The outer bounds to the capacity region
are established using genie-aided techniques that yield bounds sharper than the
traditional cut-set outer bounds. For the inner bound of the ZZ network, we
propose a new interference management scheme, termed interference
neutralization, which is implemented using structured lattice codes. This
technique allows for over-the-air interference removal, without the
transmitters having complete access the interfering signals. For both the ZZ
and ZS networks, we establish a new network decomposition technique that
(approximately) achieves the capacity region. We use insights gained from an
exact characterization of the corresponding linear deterministic version of the
problems, in order to establish the approximate characterization for Gaussian
networks.
