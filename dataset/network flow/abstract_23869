A number of representation schemes have been presented for use within
Learning Classifier Systems, ranging from binary encodings to Neural Networks,
and more recently Dynamical Genetic Programming (DGP). This paper presents
results from an investigation into using a fuzzy DGP representation within the
XCSF Learning Classifier System. In particular, asynchronous Fuzzy Logic
Networks are used to represent the traditional condition-action production
system rules. It is shown possible to use self-adaptive, open-ended evolution
to design an ensemble of such fuzzy dynamical systems within XCSF to solve
several well-known continuous-valued test problems.
