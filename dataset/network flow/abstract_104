Anti-dynamo modes are usually found in spheromaks plasma devices experiments
due to the fact that Cowling anti-dynamo theorem is naturally applied to
axisymmetric devices and flows. In this paper full consideration is given to
the existence of slow dynamo modes in the case of compact Riemannian plasma
devices without boundaries, such as tokamaks, stellarators and torsatrons. It
is shown that a perturbed untwisted flow given by a decaying mode magnetic
field is able to generate a slow twisted dynamo plasma flow where the
unperturbed flow is also a steady flow. When the slow dynamo limit is obtained
for high Reynolds magnetic numbers $Rm$, the unperturbed plasma flow achieve
equilibrium as in spheromaks. The data of aspect ratio and other data obtained
from the Brazilian spherical tokamak at the National institute for space
research are used to obtain a numerical estimate for the maximum magnetic
growth rate of the magnetic field of the slow dynamo action as
${\gamma}_{1max}\approx{\frac{0.26}{a}{\times}\frac{v_{1{\theta}}}{B_{1s}}}$
for a toroidal initial magnetic field $B_{0}\approx{0.4T}$ and an aspect data
tokamak of 1.5. For a tokamak internal radius of $a\approx{0.2m}$ one obtains a
maximum growth rate for the slow dynamo as
${\gamma}_{1max}\approx{1.3{\times}\frac{v_{1{\theta}}}{B_{1s}}}$, where
$v_{1{\theta}}$ is the poloidal perturbed diffusive flow. The safety factor is
given by $q\approx{-1}$ which is $q<1$ implying stability of spherical tokamak
plasma.
