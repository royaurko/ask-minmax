Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) fasten the speed of packet forwarding by
forwarding the packets based on labels and reduces the use of routing table
look up from all routers to label edge routers(LER), where as the label switch
routers (LSRs) uses Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or RSVP (Resource
reservation Protocol) for label allocation and Label table for packet
forwarding. Dynamic protocol is implemented which carries a Updates packets for
the details of Label Switch Paths, along with this feedback mechanism is also
introduced which find the shortest path among MPLS network and also feedback is
provided which also help to overcome congestion, this feedback mechanism is on
a hop by hop basis rather than end to end thus providing a more reliable and
much faster and congestion free path for the packets.
