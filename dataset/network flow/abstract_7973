It is shown how a complete set of hydrodynamic equations describing an
unsteady three-dimensional viscous flow nearby a solid body, can be reduced to
a closed system of surface equations using the method of dimension reduction of
over-determined systems of differential equations. These systems of equations
allow determining the surface distribution of the resulting stresses on the
surface of this body as well as all other quantities characterizing the
hydrodynamic flow around it.
