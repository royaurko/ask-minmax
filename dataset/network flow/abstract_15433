To supervise and guarantee a network security, the administrator uses
different security components, such as firewalls, IDS and IPS. For a perfect
interoperability between these components, they must be configured properly to
avoid misconfiguration between them. Nevertheless, the existence of a set of
anomalies between filtering rules and alerting rules, particularly in
distributed multi-component architectures is very likely to degrade the network
security. The main objective of this paper is to check if a set of security
components are interoperable. A case study using a firewall and an IDS as
examples will illustrate the usefulness of our approach.
