The problem of anonymous networking when an eavesdropper observes packet
timings in a communication network is considered. The goal is to hide the
identities of source-destination nodes, and paths of information flow in the
network. One way to achieve such an anonymity is to use mixers. Mixers are
nodes that receive packets from multiple sources and change the timing of
packets, by mixing packets at the output links, to prevent the eavesdropper
from finding sources of outgoing packets. In this paper, we consider two simple
but fundamental scenarios: double input-single output mixer and double
input-double output mixer. For the first case, we use the information-theoretic
definition of the anonymity, based on average entropy per packet, and find an
optimal mixing strategy under a strict latency constraint. For the second case,
perfect anonymity is considered, and maximal throughput strategies with perfect
anonymity are found under a strict latency constraint and an average queue
length constraint.
