This paper explores the use of genetic algorithms for the design of networks,
where the demands on the network fluctuate in time. For varying network
constraints, we find the best network using the standard genetic algorithm
operators such as inversion, mutation and crossover. We also examine how the
choice of genetic algorithm operators affects the quality of the best network
found. Such networks typically contain redundancy in servers, where several
servers perform the same task and pleiotropy, where servers perform multiple
tasks. We explore this trade-off between pleiotropy versus redundancy on the
cost versus reliability as a measure of the quality of the network.
