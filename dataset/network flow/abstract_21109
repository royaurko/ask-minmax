For a finite dimensional spin-glass model we prove local order at low
temperatures for both local observables and for products of observables at
arbitrary mutual distance. When the Hamiltonian includes the Edwards-Anderson
interaction we prove "bond" local order, when it includes the random-field
interaction we prove "site" local order.
