Ecological systems can be seen as networks of interactions between
individual, species, or habitat patches. A key feature of many ecological
networks is their organization into modules, which are subsets of elements that
are more connected to each other than to the other elements in the network. We
introduce MODULAR to perform rapid and autonomous calculation of modularity in
sets of networks. MODULAR reads a set of files with matrices or edge lists that
represent unipartite or bipartite networks, and identify modules using two
different modularity metrics that have been previously used in studies of
ecological networks. To find the network partition that maximizes modularity,
the software offers five optimization methods to the user. We also included two
of the most common null models that are used in studies of ecological networks
to verify how the modularity found by the maximization of each metric differs
from a theoretical benchmark.
