We present results from a deep Chandra observation of Abell 2052. A2052 is a
bright, nearby, cooling flow cluster, at a redshift of z=0.035. Concentric
surface brightness discontinuities are revealed in the cluster center, and
these features are consistent with shocks driven by the AGN, both with Mach
numbers of approximately 1.2. The southern cavity in A2052 now appears to be
split into two cavities with the southernmost cavity likely representing a
ghost bubble from earlier radio activity. There also appears to be a ghost
bubble present to the NW of the cluster center. The cycle time measured for the
radio source is approximately 2 x 10^7 yr using either the shock separation or
the rise time of the bubbles. The energy deposited by the radio source,
including a combination of direct shock heating and heating by buoyantly rising
bubbles inflated by the AGN, can offset the cooling in the core of the cluster.
