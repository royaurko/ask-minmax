In a previous work, we have defined a Tanaka SDE related to Walsh Brownian
motion which depends on kernels. It was shown that there are only one Wiener
solution and only one flow of mappings solving this equation. In the
terminology of Le Jan and Raimond, these are respectively the stronger and the
weaker among all solutions. In this paper, we obtain these solutions as limits
of discrete models.
