Drawing on a large database of publicly announced R&D alliances, we track the
evolution of R&D networks in a large number of economic sectors over a long
time period (1986-2009). Our main goal is to evaluate temporal and sectoral
robustness of the main statistical properties of empirical R&D networks. We
study a large set of indicators, thus providing a more complete description of
R&D networks with respect to the existing literature. We find that most network
properties are invariant across sectors. In addition, they do not change when
alliances are considered independently of the sectors to which partners belong.
Moreover, we find that many properties of R&D networks are characterized by a
rise-and-fall dynamics with a peak in the mid-nineties. Finally, we show that
the properties of empirical R&D networks support predictions of the recent
theoretical literature on R&D network formation.
