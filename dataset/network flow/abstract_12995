We compare and discuss the dependence of a polynomial truncation of the
effective potential used to solve exact renormalization group flow equation for
a model with fermionic interaction (linear sigma model) with a grid solution.
The sensitivity of the results on the underlying cutoff function is discussed.
We explore the validity of the expansion method for second and first-order
phase transitions.
