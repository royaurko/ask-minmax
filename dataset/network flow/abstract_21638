We construct series expansions for the scaling variables (which transform
multiplicatively under a renormalization group (RG) transformation) in examples
where the RG flows, going from an unstable (Wilson's) fixed point to a stable
(high-temperature) fixed point, can be calculated numerically. The examples are
Dyson's hierarchical model and a simplified version of it. We provide numerical
evidence that the scaling variables about the two fixed points have overlapping
domain of convergence. We show how quantities such as the magnetic
susceptibility can be expressed in terms of these variables. This procedure
provide accurate analytical expressions both in the critical and
high-temperature region.
