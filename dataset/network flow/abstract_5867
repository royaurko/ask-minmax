Clustering, assortativity, and communities are key features of complex
networks. We probe dependencies between these attributes and find that
ensembles with strong clustering display both high assortativity by degree and
prominent community structure, while ensembles with high assortativity are much
less biased towards clustering or community structure. Further, clustered
networks can amplify small homophilic bias for trait assortativity. This marked
asymmetry suggests that transitivity, rather than homophily, drives the
standard nonsocial/social network dichotomy.
