We report proper motion measurements of water masers in the massive-star
forming region W51A and the analyses of the 3-D kinematics of the masers in
three maser clusters of W51A (W51 North, Main, and South). In W~51 North, we
found a clear expanding flow that has an expansion velocity of ~70 km/s and
indicates deceleration. The originating point of the flow coincides within 0.1
as with a silicon-monoxide maser source near the HII region W~51d. In W51 Main,
no systematic motion was found in the whole velocity range (158 km/s =< V(lsr)
=< -58 km/s) although a stream motion was reported previously in a limited
range of the Doppler velocity (54 km/s =< V(lsr) =< 68 kms). Multiple driving
sources of outflows are thought to explain the kinematics of W51 Main. In W51
South, an expansion motion like a bipolar flow was marginally visible. Analyses
based on diagonalization of the variance-covariance matrix of maser velocity
vectors demonstrate that the maser kinematics in W51 North and Main are
significantly tri-axially asymmetric. We estimated a distance to W51 North to
be 6.1 +/- 1.3 kpc on the basis of the model fitting method adopting a radially
expanding flow.
