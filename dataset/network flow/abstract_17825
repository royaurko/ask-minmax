This paper presents the foundational ideas for a new way of modeling social
aggregation. Traditional approaches have been using network theory, and the
theory of random networks. Under that paradigm, every social agent is
represented by a node, and every social interaction is represented by a segment
connecting two nodes. Early work in family interactions, as well as more recent
work in the study of terrorist organizations, shows that network modeling may
be insufficient to describe the complexity of human social structures.
Specifically, network theory does not seem to have enough flexibility to
represent higher order aggregations, where several agents interact as a group,
rather than as a collection of pairs. The model we present here uses a well
established mathematical theory, the theory of simplicial complexes, to address
this complex issue prevalent in interpersonal and intergroup communication. The
theory enables us to provide a richer graphical representation of social
interactions, and to determine quantitative mechanisms to describe the
robustness of a social structure. We also propose a methodology to create
random simplicial complexes, with the purpose of providing a new method to
simulate computationally the creation and disgregation of social structures.
Finally, we propose several measures which could be taken and observed in order
to describe and study an actual social aggregation occurring in interpersonal
and intergroup contexts.
