We present a model of predatory traders interacting with each other in the
presence of a central reserve (which dissipates their wealth through say,
taxation), as well as inflation. This model is examined on a network for the
purposes of correlating complexity of interactions with systemic risk. We
suggest the use of selective networking to enhance the survival rates of
arbitrarily chosen traders. Our conclusions show that networking with 'doomed'
traders is the most risk-free scenario, and that if a trader is to network with
peers, it is far better to do so with those who have less intrinsic wealth than
himself to ensure individual, and perhaps systemic stability.
