We have built an open-source software system for the modeling of biomolecular
reaction networks, SloppyCell, which is written in Python and makes substantial
use of third-party libraries for numerics, visualization, and parallel
programming. We highlight here some of the powerful features that Python
provides that enable SloppyCell to do dynamic code synthesis, symbolic
manipulation, and parallel exploration of complex parameter spaces.
