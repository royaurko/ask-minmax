We prove differentiability of certain linear combinations of the Lyapunov
spectra of a flow on a principal bundle of a semi-simple Lie group. The
specific linear combinations that yield differentiability are determined by the
finest Morse decomposition on the flag bundles. Differentiability is taken with
respect to a differentiable structure on the gauge group, which is a Banach-Lie
group.
