The formal chart of an organisation is designed to handle routine and easily
anticipated problems, but unexpected situations arise which require the
formation of new ties so that the corresponding extra tasks can be properly
accomplished. The characterisation of the structure of such informal networks
behind the formal chart is a key element for successful management. We analyse
the complex e-mail network of a real organisation with about 1,700 employees
and determine its community structure. Our results reveal the emergence of
self-similar properties that suggest that some universal mechanism could be the
underlying driving force in the formation and evolution of informal networks in
organisations, as happens in other self-organised complex systems.
