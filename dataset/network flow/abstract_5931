The newly appeared idea of Logical Stochastic Resonance (LSR) is verified in
synthetic gene networks induced by non-Gaussian noise. We realize the switching
between two kinds of logic gates under optimal moderate noise intensity by
varying two different tunable parameters in a single gene network. Furthermore,
in order to obtain more logic operations, thus providing additional information
processing capacity, we obtain in a two-dimensional toggle switch model two
complementary logic gates and realize the transformation between two logic
gates via the methods of changing different parameters. These simulated results
contribute to improve the computational power and functionality of the
networks.
