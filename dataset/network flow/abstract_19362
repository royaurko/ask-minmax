The heating of the solar corona and the puzzle of the slender high reaching
magnetic loops seen in observations from the Transition Region And Coronal
Explorer(TRACE) has been investigated through 3D numerical simulations, and
found to be caused by the well observed plasma flows in the photosphere
displacing the footpoints of magnetic loops in a nearly potential
configuration. It is found that even the small convective displacements cause
magnetic dissipation sufficient to heat the corona to temperatures of the order
of a million Kelvin. The heating is intermittent in both space and time - at
any one height and time it spans several orders of magnitude, and localized
heating causes transonic flows along field lines, which explains the observed
non-hydrostatic equilibrium of loops that are bright in emission measure.
