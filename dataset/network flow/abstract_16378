We discuss possible definitions for a stochastic slip velocity that describes
the relative motion between large particles and a turbulent flow. This
definition is necessary because the slip velocity used in the standard drag
model fails when particle size falls within the inertial subrange of ambient
turbulence. We propose two definitions, selected in part due to their
simplicity: they do not require filtration of the fluid phase velocity field,
nor do they require the construction of conditional averages on particle
locations. A key benefit of this simplicity is that the stochastic slip
velocity proposed here can be calculated equally well for laboratory, field,
and numerical experiments. The stochastic slip velocity allows the definition
of a Reynolds number that should indicate whether large particles in turbulent
flow behave (a) as passive tracers; (b) as a linear filter of the velocity
field; or (c) as a nonlinear filter to the velocity field. We calculate the
value of stochastic slip for ellipsoidal and spherical particles (the size of
the Taylor microscale) measured in laboratory homogeneous isotropic turbulence.
The resulting Reynolds number is significantly higher than 1 for both particle
shapes, and velocity statistics show that particle motion is a complex
non-linear function of the fluid velocity. We further investigate the nonlinear
relationship by comparing the probability distribution of fluctuating
velocities for particle and fluid phases.
