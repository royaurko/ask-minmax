The Monte Carlo HYDJET++ model, that contains both hydrodynamic state and
jets, is applied to study the influence of the interplay between soft and hard
processes on the formation of the elliptic flow in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC
and LHC energies. Jets are found to cease the hydro-like increase of the
elliptic flow with rising p_T. Since jets are more influential at LHC than at
RHIC, the v_2 at LHC should be weaker than that at RHIC. Violation of the
number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling is predicted. The decays of
resonances are found to enhance the low-p_T part of the elliptic flow of pions
and light baryons, and work toward the fulfillment of the NCQ scaling.
