In the Stackelberg Network Pricing problem, one has to assign tariffs to a
certain subset of the arcs of a given transportation network. The aim is to
maximize the amount paid by the user of the network, knowing that the user will
take a shortest st-path once the tariffs are fixed. Roch, Savard, and Marcotte
(Networks, Vol. 46(1), 57-67, 2005) proved that this problem is NP-hard, and
gave an O(log m)-approximation algorithm, where m denote the number of arcs to
be priced. In this note, we show that the problem is also APX-hard.
