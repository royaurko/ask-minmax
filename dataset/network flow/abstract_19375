As described in the review by Marek Abramowicz (these proceedings), accretion
theory is at something of a crossroads. Many theoretical descriptions of
observations have centered on the ``hydrodynamic'' approach of the ``standard''
Shakura & Sunyaev alpha-disk; however, recent MHD simulations of
(non-radiative) accretion flow have called into question the validity of this
approach. There has been a great deal of optimism that these simulations give
direct insight into current observations as similar phenomena appear in both;
e.g., jets, rapid high-amplitude fluctuations, etc. In comparison to real data
from black hole candidates (BHC), however, these similarities are in many ways
only superficial. In some aspects, simple theories agree with the observations
quite well. The observed rapid variability is much more highly structured than
found in simulations, and shows interesting correlations with spectra that have
been interpreted in terms of simple models. On the other hand, debates have
arisen over even the most basic phenomenological issues concerning, e.g., the
geometry and dominant radiation mechanisms of the accretion flow. In this
article I present my views of those observational properties of BHC states that
most urgently need to be addressed, and I briefly discuss some of the models
currently being debated.
