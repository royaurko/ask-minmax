A polar coding scheme for interference networks is introduced. The scheme
combines Arikan's monotone chain rules for multiple-access channels and a
method by Hassani and Urbanke to 'align' two incompatible polarization
processes. It achieves the Han--Kobayashi inner bound for two-user interference
channels and generalizes to interference networks.
