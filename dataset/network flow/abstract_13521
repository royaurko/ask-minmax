We study the size of nodal sets of Laplacian eigenfunctions on compact
Riemannian manifolds without boundary and recover the currently optimal lower
bound by comparing the heat flow of the eigenfunction with that of an
artifically constructed diffusion process. The same method should apply to a
number of other questions; for example, we prove a sharp result saying that a
nodal domain cannot be entirely contained in a small neighbourhood of a
'reasonably flat' surface. We expect the arising concepts to have more
connections to classical theory and pose some conjectures in that direction.
