We consider the long term behaviour of a Markov chain \xi(t) on \Z^N based on
the N station supermarket model. Different routing policies for the supermarket
model give different Markov chains. We show that for a general class of local
routing policies, "join the least weighted queue" (JLW), the N one-dimensional
components \xi_i(t) can be partitioned into disjoint clusters C_k. Within each
cluster C_k the "speed" of each component \xi_j converges to a constant V_k and
under certain conditions \xi is recurrent in shape on each cluster. To
establish these results we have assembled methods from two distinct areas of
mathematics, semi-martingale techniques used for showing stability of Markov
chains together with the theory of optimal flows in networks. As corollaries to
our main result we obtain the stability classification of the supermarket model
under any JLW policy and can explicitly compute the C_k and V_k for any
instance of the model and specific JLW policy.
