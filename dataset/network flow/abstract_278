We consider multi--hop networks comprising Binary Symmetric Channels
($\mathsf{BSC}$s). The network carries unicast flows for multiple users. The
utility of the network is the sum of the utilities of the flows, where the
utility of each flow is a concave function of its throughput. Given that the
network capacity is shared by the flows, there is a contention for network
resources like coding rate (at the physical layer), scheduling time (at the MAC
layer), etc., among the flows. We propose a proportional fair transmission
scheme that maximises the sum utility of flow throughputs subject to the rate
and the scheduling constraints. This is achieved by {\em jointly optimising the
packet coding rates of all the flows through the network}.
