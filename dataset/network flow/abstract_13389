Weakly nonlinear analysis of a two dimensional sheared granular flow is
carried out under the Lees-Edwards boundary condition. We derive the time
dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation of a disturbance amplitude starting
from a set of granular hydrodynamic equations and discuss the bifurcation of
the steady amplitude in the hydrodynamic limit.
