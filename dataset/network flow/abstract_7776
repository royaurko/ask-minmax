In system development life cycle (SDLC), a system model can be developed
using Data Flow Diagram (DFD). DFD is graphical diagrams for specifying,
constructing and visualizing the model of a system. DFD is used in defining the
requirements in a graphical view. In this paper, we focus on DFD and its rules
for drawing and defining the diagrams. We then formalize these rules and
develop the tool based on the formalized rules. The formalized rules for
consistency check between the diagrams are used in developing the tool. This is
to ensure the syntax for drawing the diagrams is correct and strictly followed.
The tool automates the process of manual consistency check between data flow
diagrams.
