We present time-dependent simulations of a two-phase accretion flow around a
black hole. The accretion flow initially is composed of an optically thick and
cool disc close to the midplane, while on top and below the disc there is a hot
and optically thin corona. We consider several interaction mechanisms as
heating of the disc by the corona and Compton cooling of the corona by the soft
photons of the disc. Mass and energy can be exchanged between the disc and the
corona due to thermal conduction. For the course of this more exploratory work,
we limit ourselves to one particular model for a stellar mass black hole
accreting at a low accretion rate. We confirm earlier both theoretical and
observational results which show that at low accretion rates the disc close to
the black hole cannot survive and is evaporated. Given the framework of this
model, we now can follow through this phase of disc evaporation time
dependently.
