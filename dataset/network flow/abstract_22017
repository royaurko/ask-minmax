An examination of the properties of many-electron conduction through
spin-degenerate systems can lead to situations where increasing the bias
voltage applied to the system is predicted to decrease the current flowing
through it, for the electrons of a particular spin. While this does not
necessarily constitute negative differential conductance (NDC) per se, it is an
example of negative differential conductance per spin (NDSC) which to our
knowledge is discussed here for the first time. Within a many-body master
equation approach which accounts for charging effects in the Coulomb Blockade
regime, we show how this might occur.
