We study packetized predictive control, known to be robust against packet
dropouts in networked systems. To obtain sparse packets for rate-limited
networks, we design control packets via an L0 optimization, which can be
effectively solved by orthogonal matching pursuit. Our formulation ensures
asymptotic stability of the control loop in the presence of bounded packet
dropouts.
