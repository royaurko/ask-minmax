In this paper we examine rigorously the evidence for dependence among data
size, transfer rate and duration in Internet flows. We emphasize two
statistical approaches for studying dependence, including Pearson's correlation
coefficient and the extremal dependence analysis method. We apply these methods
to large data sets of packet traces from three networks. Our major results show
that Pearson's correlation coefficients between size and duration are much
smaller than one might expect. We also find that correlation coefficients
between size and rate are generally small and can be strongly affected by
applying thresholds to size or duration. Based on Transmission Control Protocol
connection startup mechanisms, we argue that thresholds on size should be more
useful than thresholds on duration in the analysis of correlations. Using
extremal dependence analysis, we draw a similar conclusion, finding remarkable
independence for extremal values of size and rate.
