The aim of this paper is to discuss a relationship between total positivity
and planar directed networks. We show that the inverse boundary problem for
these networks is naturally linked with the study of the totally nonnegative
Grassmannian. We investigate its cell decomposition, where the cells are the
totally nonnegative parts of the matroid strata. The boundary measurements of
networks give parametrizations of the cells. We present several different
combinatorial descriptions of the cells, study the partial order on the cells,
and describe how they are glued to each other.
