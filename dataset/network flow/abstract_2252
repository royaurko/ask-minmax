We present a heuristic for designing vector non-linear network codes for
non-multicast networks, which we call quasi-linear network codes. The method
presented has two phases: finding an approximate linear network code over the
reals, and then quantizing it to a vector non-linear network code using a
fixed-point representation. Apart from describing the method, we draw some
links between some network parameters and the rate of the resulting code.
