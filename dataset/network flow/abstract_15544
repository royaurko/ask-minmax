We describe the operational capabilities of the Las Cumbres Observatory
Global Telescope Network. We summarize our hardware and software for
maintaining and monitoring network health. We focus on methodologies to utilize
the automated system to monitor availability of sites, instruments and
telescopes, to monitor performance, permit automatic recovery, and provide
automatic error reporting. The same jTCS control system is used on telescopes
of apertures 0.4m, 0.8m, 1m and 2m, and for multiple instruments on each. We
describe our network operational model, including workloads, and illustrate our
current tools, and operational performance indicators, including telemetry and
metrics reporting from on-site reductions. The system was conceived and
designed to establish effective, reliable autonomous operations, with automatic
monitoring and recovery - minimizing human intervention while maintaining
quality. We illustrate how far we have been able to achieve that.
