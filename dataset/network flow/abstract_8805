The max-flow and max-coflow problem on directed graphs is studied in the
common generalization to regular spaces, i.e., to kernels or row spaces of
totally unimodular matrices. Exhibiting a submodular structure of the family of
paths within this model we generalize the Edmonds-Karp variant of the classical
Ford-Fulkerson method and show that the number of augmentations is
quadratically bounded if augmentations are chosen along shortest possible
augmenting paths.
