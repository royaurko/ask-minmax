We have developed a method of solving for multi-species chemical reaction
flows in non--equilibrium and self--consistently with the hydrodynamic
equations in an expanding FLRW universe. The method is based on a backward
differencing scheme for the required stability when solving stiff sets of
equations and is designed to be efficient for three-dimensional calculations
without sacrificing accuracy. In all, 28 kinetic reactions are solved including
both collisional and radiative processes for the following nine separate
species: H, H+, He, He+, He++, H-, H2+, H2, and e-. The method identifies those
reactions (involving H- and H2+) ocurring on the shortest time scales,
decoupling them from the rest of the network and imposing equilibrium
concentrations to good accuracy over typical cosmological dynamical times.
Several tests of our code are presented, including radiative shock waves,
cosmological sheets, conservation constraints, and fully three-dimensional
simulations of CDM cosmological evolutions in which we compare our method to
results obtained when the packaged routine LSODAR is substituted for our
algorithms.
