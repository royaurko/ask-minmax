We discuss the application of the resolvent technique to prove stability of
plane Couette flow.
 Using this technique, we derive a threshold amplitude for perturbations that
can lead to turbulence in terms of the Reynolds number. Our main objective is
to show exactly how much control one should have over the perturbation to
assure stability via this technique.
