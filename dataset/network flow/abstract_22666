We find an exact expression for the current that is induced in a 3 site ring
during a multiple-path adiabatic crossing. The understanding of the dynamics
requires to go beyond the two-level phenomenology. In particular we highlight a
prototype process, "adiabatic metamorphosis", during which current is flowing
through a non-accessible site. This helps to understand the crossover from
coherent non-classical splitting to stochastic noisy-alike partitioning of the
current.
