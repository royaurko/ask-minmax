Spatial models for spread of an epidemic may be mapped onto bond percolation.
We point out that with disorder in the strength of contacts between individuals
patchiness in the spread of the epidemic is very likely, and the criterion for
epidemic outbreak depends strongly on the disorder because the critical region
of the corresponding percolation model is broadened. In some networks the
percolation threshold is zero if another kind of disorder is present, namely
divergent fluctuations in the number of contacts. We give an example, a network
with a well defined geography, where this is not necessarily so, and discuss
whether real infection networks are likely to have this property.
