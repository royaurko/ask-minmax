We investigate the contribution made by small loops from a cosmic string
network as seeds for large-scale structure formation. We show that cosmic
string loops are highly correlated with the long-string network on large scales
and therefore contribute significantly to the power spectrum of density
perturbations if the average loop lifetime is comparable to or above one Hubble
time. This effect further improves the large-scale bias problem previously
identified in earlier studies of cosmic string models.
