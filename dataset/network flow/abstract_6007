In this paper we use corona product to generate graphs that fits real-world
properties. We introduce recursive corona graphs (RCG) as a small-world network
model. We investigate critical characteristics of the network, namely, its
order and size, its degree distribution, average path length, clustering
coefficient, its number of spanning trees and Kirchhoff index. All properties
are derived in closed form and are rigorously proven. Further we study the
spectrum of the network, on its adjacent matrix as well as its Laplacian. We
give analytical results of all these quantities in order to obtain an indepth
observation on the network as a deterministic small-world network model.
