We consider a finite region of a lattice of weakly interacting geodesic flows
on manifolds of negative curvature and we show that, when rescaling the
interactions and the time appropriately, the energies of the flows evolve
according to a non linear diffusion equation. This is a first step toward the
derivation of macroscopic equations from a Hamiltonian microscopic dynamics in
the case of weakly coupled systems.
