Concentrated particulate suspensions, commonplace in the pharmaceutical,
cosmetic and food industries, display intriguing rheology. In particular, the
dramatic increase in viscosity with strain rate (shear thickening and jamming)
which is often observed at high volume fractions, is of strong practical and
fundamental importance. Yet manufacture of these products and their subsequent
dispensing often involves flow geometries substantially different from that of
simple shear flow experiments. Here we show that the elongation and breakage of
a filament of a colloidal fluid under tensile loading is closely related to the
jamming transition seen in its shear rheology. However, the modified flow
geometry reveals important additional effects. Using a model system with nearly
hard-core interactions, we provide evidence of surprisingly strong
viscoelasticity in such a colloidal fluid under tension. With high speed
photography we also directly observe dilatancy and granulation effects, which
lead to fracture above a critical elongation rate.
