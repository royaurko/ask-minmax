The MIMO wireless channel offers a rich ground for quality of service
analysis. In this work, we present a stochastic network calculus analysis of a
MIMO system, operating in spatial multiplexing mode, using moment generating
functions (MGF). We quantify the spatial multiplexing gain, achieved through
multiple antennas, for flow level quality of service (QoS) performance.
Specifically we use Gilbert-Elliot model to describe individual spatial paths
between the antenna pairs and model the whole channel by an N-State Markov
Chain, where N depends upon the degrees of freedom available in the MIMO
system. We derive probabilistic delay bounds for the system and show the impact
of increasing the number of antennas on the delay bounds under various
conditions, such as channel burstiness, signal strength and fading speed.
Further we present results for multi-hop scenarios under statistical
independence.
