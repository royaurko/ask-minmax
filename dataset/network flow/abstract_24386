Leaks represent a very important hazard for the buildings and they can affect
all sorts of building materials and specially wood due to its hygroscopic
properties. Excessive moisture content can affect in a negative way building
processes such as the installation of wooden floors or the use of wood as a
structural material. Moisture meters can provide prompt and non-destructive
determination of wood moisture, and as such are among the most useful tools
available to wood products manufacturers and scientists. However, a continuous
monitoring system is needed in order to avoid excessive moisture content which
can damage wooden floors as well as structural wood. Data and procedures are
presented in order to develop a suitable monitoring tool based on wireless
sensor networks to provide an electronic tool of active security both for the
installation of wooden floors and for the proper maintenance of existent
buildings which have a timber structure.
