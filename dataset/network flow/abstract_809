In this article we use real traffic data to confirm that vehicle velocities
follow Gaussian distribution in steady state traffic regimes (free-flow, and
congestion). We also show that in the transition between free-flow and
congestion, the velocity distribution is better modeled by generalized extreme
value distribution (GEV). We study the effect of the different models on
estimating the probability distribution of connectivity duration between
vehicles in vehicular ad-hoc networks.
