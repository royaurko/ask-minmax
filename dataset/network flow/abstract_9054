In large networks of Dirac spinors individual spinors show space-time
properties relative to quasi-classical clusters of spinors. Three forms of
relations between spinors and such clusters are identified. These constitute
three families of particle-like configurations, with a mass spectrum in close
agreement with the experimental lepton spectrum.
