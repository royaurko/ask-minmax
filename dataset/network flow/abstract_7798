The Ricci flow is a parabolic evolution equation in the space of Riemannian
metrics of a smooth manifold. To some extent, Einstein equations give rise to a
similar hyperbolic evolution. The present text is an introductory exposition to
Bianchi-Ricci and Bianchi-Einstein flows, that is, the restricted finitely
dimensional dynamical systems, obtained by considering homogeneous metrics.
