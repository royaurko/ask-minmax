Restructuring of the power market introduced demand uncertainty in
transmission expansion planning (TEP), which in turn also requires an accurate
estimation of demand not served (DNS). Unfortunately, the graph theory based
minimum-cut maximum-flow (MCMF) approach does not ensure that electrical laws
are followed. Nor can it be used for calculating DNS at individual buses. In
this letter, we propose a generalized load flow based methodology for
calculating DNS. This procedure is able to calculate simultaneously generation
not served (GNS) and wheeling loss (WL). Importantly, the procedure is able to
incorporate the effect of I2R losses, excluded in MCMF approach. Case study on
a 5-bus IEEE system shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach over
existing method.
