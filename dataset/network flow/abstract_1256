Diversity is a powerful means to increase the transmission performance of
wireless communications. For the case of fountain codes relaying, it has been
shown previously that introducing diversity is also beneficial since it
counteracts transmission losses on the channel. Instead of simply hop-by-hop
forwarding information, each sensor node diversifies the information flow using
XOR combinations of stored packets. This approach has been shown to be
efficient for random linear fountain codes. However, random linear codes
exhibit high decoding complexity. In this paper, we propose diversity increased
relaying strategies for the more realistic Luby Transform code in order to
maintain high transmission performance with low decoding computational
complexity in a linear network. Results are provided herein for a linear
network assuming uniform imperfect channel states.
