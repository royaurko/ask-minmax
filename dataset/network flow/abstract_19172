Rank weights and generalized rank weights have been proven to characterize
error and erasure correction, and information leakage in linear network coding,
in the same way as the Hamming weights and generalized Hamming weights describe
classical error and erasure correction, and information leakage in secret
sharing. Many similarities between both cases have been studied in the
literature. Although many definitions, results and proofs are similar in both
cases, it might seem that they are essentially different. The aim of this paper
is to further relate both weights and generalized weights, show that the
results and proofs in both cases are actually essentially the same, and see the
significance of these similarities in network coding. Some of the new results
in the rank case also have new consequences in the Hamming case.
