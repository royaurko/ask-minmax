Mapping a complex network to an atomic cluster, the Anderson localization
theory is used to obtain the load distribution on a complex network. Based upon
an intelligence-limited model we consider the load distribution and the
congestion and cascade failures due to attacks and occasional damages. It is
found that the eigenvector centrality (EC) is an effective measure to find key
nodes for traffic flow processes. The influence of structure of a WS
small-world network is investigated in detail.
