Any theory can be made Weyl invariant by introducing a dilaton. It is shown
how to construct renormalization group equations for gravity that maintain this
property. Explicit calculations are given only in the simplest approximation,
namely for the one loop beta functions of a dilaton conformally coupled to a
dynamical metric, but the results have wider validity. This formalism could be
used to define the meaning of a theory with a position-dependent cutoff: it is
equivalent to a theory with a constant cutoff, but a conformally related
metric.
