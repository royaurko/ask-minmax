In this work we present a review of the most popular depth-averaged models to
simulate dry granular flows such as aerial avalanches. The classical
Savage-Hutter model and recent ones using a $\mu(I)$-rheology law are studied.
The objective is firstly to point out the advantages of each such models and
secondly to understand how the hypothesis considered in the derivation process
influence on the final system.
