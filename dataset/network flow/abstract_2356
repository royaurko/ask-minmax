The distribution of energy loss due to viscosity friction in plane Couette
flow and Taylor-Couette Flow between concentric rotating cylinders are studied
in detail for various flow conditions. The energy loss is related to the
industrial processes in some fluid delivery devices and has significant
influence on the flow efficiency, flow stability, turbulent transition, mixing,
and heat transfer behaviours, etc. Therefore, it is important to know about the
energy loss distribution in the flow domain and to know its influence on the
flow for better understanding of the flow physics. The calculation or
methodology of calculating the energy loss distribution in the Taylor-Couette
flow between concentric rotating cylinders is not readily found in the open
literature. In this paper, the principle and the calculation are given for
single cylinder rotation of either the inner or outer cylinder, and counter and
same direction rotation of two cylinders. For comparison, the distribution of
energy loss in a plane Couette flow is also derived for various flow
conditions. Discussions of the effect of energy loss on the flow behaviour are
carried out from which some findings are suggested.
