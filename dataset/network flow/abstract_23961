We study the Kleinberg problem of navigation in Small World networks when the
underlying lattice is stretched along a preferred direction. Extensive
simulations confirm that maximally efficient navigation is attained when the
length $r$ of long-range links is taken from the distribution $P({\bf r})\sim
r^{-\alpha}$, when the exponent $\alpha$ is equal to 2, the dimension of the
underlying lattice, regardless of the amount of anisotropy, but only in the
limit of infinite lattice size, $L\to\infty$. For finite size lattices we find
an optimal $\alpha(L)$ that depends strongly on $L$. The convergence to
$\alpha=2$ as $L\to\infty$ shows interesting power-law dependence on the
anisotropy strength.
