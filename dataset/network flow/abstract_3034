In this study, the concept of small worlds is investigated in the context of
large-scale wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. Wireless networks are spatial
graphs that are usually much more clustered than random networks and have much
higher path length characteristics. We observe that by adding only few random
links, path length of wireless networks can be reduced drastically without
affecting clustering. What is even more interesting is that such links need not
be formed randomly but may be confined to a limited number of hops between the
connected nodes. This has an important practical implication, as now we can
introduce a distributed algorithm in large-scale wireless networks, based on
what we call contacts, to improve the performance of resource discovery in such
networks, without resorting to global flooding. We propose new contact-based
protocols for adding logical short cuts in wireless networks efficiently. The
new protocols take advantage of mobility in order to increase reachability of
the search. We study the performance of our proposed contact-based
architecture, and clarify the context in which large-scale wireless networks
can be turned into small world networks.
