We solve the ferromagnetic q-state Potts model on an inhomogeneous annealed
network which mimics a random recursive graph. We find that this system has the
inverted Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) phase transition for any $q
\geq 1$, including the values $q \geq 3$, where the Potts model normally shows
a first order phase transition. We obtain the temperature dependences of the
order parameter, specific heat, and susceptibility demonstrating features
typical for the BKT transition. We show that in the entire normal phase, both
the distribution of a linear response to an applied local field and the
distribution of spin-spin correlations have a critical, i.e. power-law, form.
