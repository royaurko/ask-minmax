An explicit rate indication scheme for congestion avoidance in computer and
telecommunication networks is proposed. The sources monitor their load and
provide the information periodically to the switches. The switches, in turn,
compute the load level and ask the sources to adjust their rates up or down.
The scheme achieves high link utilization, fair allocation of rates among
contending sources and provides quick convergence. A backward congestion
notification option is also provided. The conditions under which this option is
useful are indicated.
