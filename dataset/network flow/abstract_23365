We investigate a chain of oscillators with anharmonic on-site potentials,
with long range interparticle interactions, and coupled both to external and
internal stochastic thermal reservoirs of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type. We develop
an integral representation, a la Feynman-Kac, for the correlations and the heat
current. We assume the approximation of discrete times in the integral
formalism (together with a simplification in a subdominant part of the harmonic
interaction) in order to develop a suitable polymer expansion for the model. In
the regime of strong anharmonicity, strong harmonic pinning, and for the
interparticle interaction with integrable polynomial decay, we prove the
convergence of the polymer expansion uniformly in volume (number of sites and
time). We also show that the two-point correlation decays in space such as the
interparticle interaction. The existence of a convergent polymer expansion is
of practical interest: it establishes a rigorous support for a perturbative
analysis of the heat flow problem and for the computation of the thermal
conductivity in related anharmonic crystals, including those with inhomogeneous
potentials and long range interparticle interactions.
