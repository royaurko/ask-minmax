We extend the renormalization group transformation based on the two-lattice
matching to the complex inverse temperature plane for Dyson's hierarchical
Ising model. We consider values of the dimensional parameter above, below and
exactly at the critical value where the ordered low temperature phase becomes
impossible for a real positive temperature. We show numerically that, as the
volume increases, the Fisher's zeros appear to accumulate along lines that
separate the flows ending on different fixed points. We justify these findings
in terms of finite size scaling. We argue that the location of the Fisher's
zeros at large volume determine the phase diagram in the complex plane. We
discuss the implications for nontrivial infrared fixed points in lattice gauge
theory.
