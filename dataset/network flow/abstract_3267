The dynamics of non-spherical rigid particles immersed in an axisymmetric
random flow is studied analytically. The motion of the particles is described
by Jeffery's equation; the random flow is Gaussian and has short correlation
time.The stationary probability density function of orientations is calculated
exactly. Four regimes are identified depending on the statistical anisotropy of
the flow and on the geometrical shape of the particle. If {\lambda} is the axis
of symmetry of the flow, the four regimes are: rotation about {\lambda},
tumbling motion between {\lambda} and -{\lambda}, combination of rotation and
tumbling, and preferential alignment with a direction oblique to {\lambda}.
