In this paper, we investigate the joint optimal sensing and distributed
Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design problem for cognitive radio (CR)
networks. We consider both scenarios with single and multiple channels. For
each scenario, we design a synchronized MAC protocol for dynamic spectrum
sharing among multiple secondary users (SUs), which incorporates spectrum
sensing for protecting active primary users (PUs). We perform saturation
throughput analysis for the corresponding proposed MAC protocols that
explicitly capture the spectrum-sensing performance. Then, we find their
optimal configuration by formulating throughput maximization problems subject
to detection probability constraints for PUs. In particular, the optimal
solution of the optimization problem returns the required sensing time for PUs'
protection and optimal contention window to maximize the total throughput of
the secondary network. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate
developed theoretical findings in this paper and significant performance gains
of the optimal sensing and protocol configuration.
