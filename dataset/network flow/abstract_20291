In this paper we present some mathematical results obtained from the analysis
of a stochastic evolution equation which basically describes a Ginzburg-Landau
approximation of the system governing the nematic liquid crystals under the
influence of fluctuating eternal forces. We mainly prove the existence and
uniqueness of local a maximal nd global strong solution to the problem. Here
strong solution is understood in the sense of stochastic calculus and PDEs. By
a fixed point argument we firstly prove a general result which enables us to
establish the existence of local and maximal solution to an abstract nonlinear
stochastic evolution equations. Secondly, we show that our problem falls within
the previous general framework. Therefore we are able to establish the
existence and uniqueness of local and maximal strong solution for both 2D and
3D case. In the 2D case we prove nonexplosion of the maximal solution by a
method based on a choice of an appropriate energy functionals. Thus the
existence of a unique global strong solution in the 2D case.
