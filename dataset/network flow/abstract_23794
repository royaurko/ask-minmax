We consider decentralized multi-antenna cognitive radio networks where
secondary (cognitive) users are granted simultaneous spectrum access along with
license-holding (primary) users. We treat the problem of distributed
beamforming and rate allocation for the secondary users such that the minimum
weighted secondary rate is maximized. Such an optimization is subject to (1) a
limited weighted sum-power budget for the secondary users and (2) guaranteed
protection for the primary users in the sense that the interference level
imposed on each primary receiver does not exceed a specified level. Based on
the decoding method deployed by the secondary receivers, we consider three
scenarios for solving this problem. In the first scenario each secondary
receiver decodes only its designated transmitter while suppressing the rest as
Gaussian interferers (single-user decoding). In the second case each secondary
receiver employs the maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) to jointly decode all
secondary transmissions, and in the third one each secondary receiver uses the
unconstrained group decoder (UGD). By deploying the UGD, each secondary user is
allowed to decode any arbitrary subset of users (which contains its designated
user) after suppressing or canceling the remaining users.
