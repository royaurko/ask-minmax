In this paper we are proposing an algorithm which uses AES technique of
128/192/256 bit cipher key in encryption and decryption of data. AES provides
high security as compared to other encryption techniques along with RSA. Cloud
computing provides the customer with the requested services. It refers to
applications and services that run on distributed network using virtualized
resources and accessed by common IP and network standard. While providing data
services it is becoming important to provide security for data. In cloud
computing keeping data secure is an important issue to be focused. Even though
AES was designed for military purposes, now a days it is been commercially
adopted worldwide as it can encrypt most confidential document, as well as it
can work in most restricted areas, and offers good defense against various
attack techniques, and security level to protect data for next 2-3 decades.
