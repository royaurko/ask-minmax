Anisotropic flow of hadrons is studied in heavy ion collisions at SPS and
RHIC energies within the microscopic quark-gluon string model. The model was
found to reproduce correctly many of the flow features, e.g., the wiggle
structure of direct flow of nucleons at midrapidity, or centrality, rapidity,
and transverse momentum dependences of elliptic flow. Further predictions are
made. The differences in the development of the anisotropic flow components are
linked to the freeze-out conditions, which are quite different for baryons and
mesons.
