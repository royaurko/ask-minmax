We study the production of proton, antiproton and net-proton at \AGS, \SPS
and \RHIC within the framework non-uniform flow model(NUFM) in this paper. It
is found that the system of RHIC has stronger longitudinally non-uniform
feature than AGS and SPS, which means that nuclei at RHIC energy region is much
more transparent. The NUFM model provides a very good description of all proton
rapidity at whole AGS, SPS and RHIC. It is shown that our analysis relates
closely to the study of nuclear stopping and longitudinally non-uniform flow
distribution of experiment. This comparison with AGS and SPS help us to
understand the feature of particle stopping of thermal freeze-out at RHIC
experiment.
