This paper investigates the degrees of freedom of the interference channel in
the presence of a dedicated MIMO relay. The relay is used to manage the
interference at the receivers. It is assumed that all nodes including the relay
have channel state information only for their own links and that the relay has
M (greater than or equal to K) antennas in a K-user network. We pose the
question: What is the benefit of exploiting the direct links from the source to
destinations compared to a simpler two-hop strategy. To answer this question,
we first establish the degrees of freedom of the interference channel with a
MIMO relay, showing that a K-pair network with a MIMO relay has K/2 degrees of
freedom. Thus, appropriate signaling in a two-hop scenario captures the degrees
of freedom without the need for the direct links. We then consider more
sophisticated encoding strategies in search of other ways to exploit the direct
links. Using a number of hybrid encoding strategies, we obtain non-asymptotic
achievable sum-rates. We investigate the case where the relay (unlike other
nodes) has access to abundant power, showing that when sources have power P and
the relay is allowed power proportional to O(P^2), the full degrees of freedom
K are available to the network.
