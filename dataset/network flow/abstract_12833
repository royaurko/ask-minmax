Radiatively inefficient (or advection dominated) disks are discussed at an
introductory level. Ion supported and radiation supported flows are discussed,
the different consequences of advection dominated flows onto black holes vs.
solid surfaces (neutron stars, white dwarfs), hydrodynamics, the role of the
ratio of specific heats, and the possible connection between ADAFs and
outflows.
