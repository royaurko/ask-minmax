A new class of observables is introduced which aims to characterize the
superstructure of an event, that is, features, such as color flow, which are
not determined by the jet four-momenta alone. Traditionally, an event is
described as having jets which are independent objects; each jet has some
energy, size, and possible substructure such as subjets or heavy flavor
content. This description discards information connecting the jets to each
other, which can be used to determine if the jets came from decay of a color
singlet object, or if they were initiated by quarks or gluons. An example
superstructure variable, pull, is presented as a simple handle on color flow.
It can be used on an event-by-event basis as a tool for distinguishing
previously irreducible backgrounds at the Tevatron and the LHC.
