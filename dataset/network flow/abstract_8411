Let T be an infinite homogenous tree of homogeneity $q+1$. Attaching to each
edge the conductance $1$, the tree will became an electric network. The
reversible Markov chain associated to this network is the simple random walk on
the homogenous tree. Using results regarding the equivalence between a
reversible Markov chain and an electric network, we will express voltages,
currents, the Green fuction hitting times, transitions number, probabilities of
reaching a set before another, as functions of the distance on the homogenous
tree. This connection enables us to give simpler proofs for the properties of
the random walk under discussion.
