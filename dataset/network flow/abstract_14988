We account for lateral orderings of III-V nanostructures resulting from a
GaAs/InAs/InGaAs/GaAs sequence grown on GaAs by metallorganic vapour phase
epitaxy at two different temperatures. For both samples, the ordering is
induced by the stress field of a periodic dislocation network (DN) shallowly
buried and parallel to the surface. This DN is a grain boundary (GB) that
forms, between a thinGaAs layer (onwhich growthwas performed) and aGaAs
substrate joined together by wafer bonding, in order to accommodate a tilt and
a twist between these two crystals; both these misorientations are imposed in a
controlled manner. This GB is composed of a one-dimensional network of mixed
dislocations and of a one-dimensional network of screwdislocations. For both
samples, the nanostructures observed by transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM)
and atomic forcemicroscopy are ordered by the underlyingDNobserved byTEMsince
they have same dimensions andorientations as the cells of the DN.
