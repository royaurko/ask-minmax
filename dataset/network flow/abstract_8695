We give a geometric criterion that guaranteesa purely singular spectral type
for a dynamical system on a Riemannian manifold. The criterion, that is based
on the existence of fairly rich but localized periodic approximations, is
compatible with mixing. Indeed, we use it to construct examples of smooth
mixing flows on the three torus with purely singular spectra.
