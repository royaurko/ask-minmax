By means of two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we
investigate the process of driven magnetic reconnection at the termination
shock of relativistic striped flows. In pulsar winds and in magnetar-powered
relativistic jets, the flow consists of stripes of alternating magnetic field
polarity, separated by current sheets of hot plasma. At the wind termination
shock, the flow compresses and the alternating fields annihilate by driven
magnetic reconnection. Irrespective of the stripe wavelength "lambda" or the
wind magnetization "sigma" (in the regime sigma>>1 of magnetically-dominated
flows), shock-driven reconnection transfers all the magnetic energy of
alternating fields to the particles, whose average Lorentz factor increases by
a factor of sigma with respect to the pre-shock value. In the limit
lambda/(r_L*sigma)>>1, where r_L is the relativistic Larmor radius in the wind,
the post-shock particle spectrum approaches a flat power-law tail with slope
around -1.5, populated by particles accelerated by the reconnection electric
field. The presence of a current-aligned "guide" magnetic field suppresses the
acceleration of particles only when the guide field is stronger than the
alternating component. Our findings place important constraints on the models
of non-thermal radiation from Pulsar Wind Nebulae and relativistic jets.
