A steady-state analytical solution is given describing the temperature
distribution in a homogeneous massif perturbed by cold water flow through a
discrete vertical fracture. A relation is derived to express the flow rate in
the fracture as a function of the temperature measured in the surrounding rock.
These mathematical results can be useful for tunnel drilling as it approaches a
vertical cold water bearing structure that induces a thermal anomaly in the
surrounding massif. During the tunnel drilling, by monitoring this anomaly
along the tunnel axis one can quantify the flow rate in the discontinuity ahead
before intersecting the fracture. The cases of the Simplon, Mont Blanc and
Gotthard tunnels (Alps) are handled with this approach which shows very good
agreement between observed temperatures and the theoretical trend. The flow
rates before drilling of the tunnel predicted with the theoretical solution are
similar in the Mont Blanc and Simplon cases, as well as the flow rates observed
during the drilling. However, the absence of information on hydraulic gradients
(before and during drilling) and on fracture specific storage prevents direct
predictions of discharge rates in the tunnel.
