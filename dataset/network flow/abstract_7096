In this paper we study the relation between the size of an initial
sub-manifold and the size of its spatial and space-time track under weak mean
curvature flow, in arbitrary dimension and co-dimension. We show that the
space-time track of a mean curvature flow starting from an integral $k$-current
$T_0$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (in the precise sense of Ilmanen's undercurrent)
satisfies a Michael-Simon type parabolic isoperimetric inequality. More
precisely we show that the $k+2$ parabolic measure of the space-time track is
bounded by $C(k)\underset{=}{\mathbf{M}}[T_{0}]^{\frac{k+2}{k}}$ for some
universal constant $C(k)$. We further show that the spatial track of the mean
curvature flow, $S$, provides a good filling of $T_{0}$ in the
Gromov-Michael-Simon sense: $\underset{=}{\mathbf{M}}[S]\leq
\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}} \underset{=}{\mathbf{M}}[T_{0}]^\frac{k+1}{k} $, giving a
genuine very short proof of the isoperimetric inequality in arbitrary
co-dimension with a constant differing from the optimal one by a factor of only
$\sqrt{k}$. Comparing the filling $S$ to the optimal one, we also observe a
criterion for (quantitative) non-disappearance of Brakke flows starting from
cycles. We also study the geometric measure theory of Euclidean rectifiable
sets in parabolic space, and prove a co-area formula in that setting.
