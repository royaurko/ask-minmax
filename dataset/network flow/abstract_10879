We study in-gap electronic states induced by a nonmagnetic defect with
short-range potential in two-dimensional topological insulators and trace their
evolution as the distance between the defect and the boundary changes. The
defect located far from the boundary is found to produce two bound states
independently of the sign of its potential. The states are classified as
electronlike and holelike. Each of these states can have two types of the
spatial distribution of the electron density. The first-type states have a
maximum of the density in the center and the second-type ones have a minimum.
When the defect is coupled with the boundary, the bound states are transformed
correspondingly into resonances of two types and take up the form of the edge
states flowing around the defect. Under certain conditions, two resonances
interfere giving rise to the formation of a bound state embedded into the
continuum spectrum of the edge states flowing around the defect. We calculate
the spatial distribution of the electron density in the edge states flowing
around the defect and estimate the charge accumulated near the defect. The
current density field of the edge states flowing around the defect contains two
components one of which flows around the defect and the other circulates around
it.
