Compelling evidence associates the nuclei of active galaxies and massive
starbursts. The symbiosis between a compact nuclear starburst stellar cluster
and a massive black hole can self-consistently explain the properties of active
nuclei. The young stellar cluster has a profound effect on the most important
observable properties of active galaxies through its gravity, and by mass
injection through stellar winds, supernovae and stellar collisions. Mass
injection generates a nuclear ISM which flows under gravitational and radiative
forces until it leaves the nucleus or is accreted onto the black hole or
accretion disc.
  The radiative force exerted by the black hole--accretion disc radiation field
is not spherically symmetric. This results in complex flows in which regions of
inflow can coexist with high Mach number outflowing winds and hydrodynamic
jets. We present two-dimensional hydrodynamic models of such nISM flows, which
are highly complex and time variable. Shocked shells, jets and explosive
bubbles are produced, with bipolar winds driving out from the nucleus. Our
results graphically illustrate why broad emission line studies have
consistently failed to identify any simple, global flow geometry. The real
structure of the flows is _inevitably_ yet more complex.
