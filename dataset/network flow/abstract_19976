The properties of polymer liquids on hard and soft substrates are
investigated by molecular dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained bead-spring
model and dynamic single-chain-in-mean-field (SCMF) simulations of a soft,
coarse-grained polymer model. Hard, corrugated substrates are modelled by an
FCC Lennard-Jones solid while polymer brushes are investigated as a
prototypical example of a soft, deformable surface. From the molecular
simulation we extract the coarse-grained parameters that characterise the
equilibrium and flow properties of the liquid in contact with the substrate:
the surface and interface tensions, and the parameters of the hydrodynamic
boundary condition. The so-determined parameters enter a continuum description
like the Stokes equation or the lubrication approximation.
