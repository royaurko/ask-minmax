Intra-body communication (IBC) is a type of Body Area Network (BAN)that
utilizes human body as the medium for data transmission. Thelow power
requirements of intra-body communication (IBC) as compared to near field
electromagnetic waves showed that it can be a suitable solution for Medical
Body Area Networks (MBANs) in a mobile health care system.In this paper, we
investigate the transmission characteristics of the human body as a conductor
of signals by considering different data transmission rates of multi-point to
point network in order to reduce overall power consumption of the
BAN.Furthermore, we utilize IBC and propose a new scheme to combines Slotted
ALOHA, TDMA, and Reservation ALOHA together to increase the throughput and
decrease the delay. By using our new hybrid scheme with the movable boundary
designed for health status monitoring, we are able to increase the efficiency
of data transmission by prioritizing the more critical data from the sensors.
