We analyze the synchronous firings of the salamander ganglion cells from the
perspective of the complex network viewpoint where the network's links reflect
the correlated behavior of firings. We study the time-aggregated properties of
the resulting network focusing on its topological features. The behavior of
pairwise correlations has been inspected in order to construct an appropriate
measure that will serve as a weight of network connection.
