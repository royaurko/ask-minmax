The recently proposed discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) is a finite
volume method for deterministic solution of the Boltzmann model equation with
asymptotic preserving property. In DUGKS, the numerical flux of the
distribution function is determined from a local numerical solution of the
Boltzmann model equation using an unsplitting approach. The time step and mesh
resolution are not restricted by the molecular collision time and mean free
path. To demonstrate the capacity of DUGKS in practical problems, this paper
extends the DUGKS to arbitrary unstructured meshes. Several tests of both
internal and external flows are performed, which include the cavity flow
ranging from continuum to free molecular regimes, a multiscale flow between two
connected cavities with a pressure ratio of 10000, and a high speed flow over a
cylinder in slip and transitional regimes. The numerical results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the DUGKS in simulating multiscale flow problems.
