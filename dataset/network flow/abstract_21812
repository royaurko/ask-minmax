This article is based on the lectures given at the ``Ecole thematique de
theorie ergodique'', at the C.I.R.M. in Marseille, in April 2006. We give a
complete proof of a theorem of Kerckhoff, Masur and Smillie on the unique
ergodicity of the directional flow on a translation surface in almost every
direction. The proof follows the one presented in the survey of Masur and
Tabachnikov.
