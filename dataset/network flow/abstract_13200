A statistical method for calculating equilibrium solutions of the shallow
water equations, a model of essentially 2-d fluid flow with a free surface, is
described. The model contains a competing acoustic turbulent {\it direct}
energy cascade, and a 2-d turbulent {\it inverse} energy cascade. It is shown,
nonetheless that, just as in the corresponding theory of the inviscid Euler
equation, the infinite number of conserved quantities constrain the flow
sufficiently to produce nontrivial large-scale vortex structures which are
solutions to a set of explicitly derived coupled nonlinear partial differential
equations.
