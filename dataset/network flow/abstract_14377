We study phase transitions of a system of particles on the one-dimensional
integer lattice moving with constant acceleration, with a collision law
respecting slower particles. This simple deterministic ``particle-hopping''
traffic flow model being a straightforward generalization to the well known
Nagel-Schreckenberg model covers also a more recent slow-to-start model as a
special case. The model has two distinct ergodic (unmixed) phases with two
critical values. When traffic density is below the lowest critical value, the
steady state of the model corresponds to the ``free-flowing'' (or ``gaseous'')
phase. When the density exceeds the second critical value the model produces
large, persistent, well-defined traffic jams, which correspond to the
``jammed'' (or ``liquid'') phase. Between the two critical values each of these
phases may take place, which can be interpreted as an ``overcooled gas'' phase
when a small perturbation can change drastically gas into liquid. Mathematical
analysis is accomplished in part by the exact derivation of the life-time of
individual traffic jams for a given configuration of particles.
