A maximum entropy framework based on Tsallis entropy is proposed to depict
long tail behavior of queue lengths in broadband networks. Queue length
expression as measured in terms of number of packets involves Hurwitz-zeta
function. When the entropy parameter q in Tsallis entropy is less than unity,
the distribution of packets yields power law behavior. In the limit q tending
to unity, Tsallis entropy expression reduces to one due to Shannon and
well-known results of M/M/1 queuing system are recovered. Relationship between
Tsallis entropy parameter q and Hurst parameter H (measure of self-similarity)
is postulated. A numerical procedure based on Newton-Raphson method is outlined
to compute Lagrange's parameter b. Various relationships between traffic
intensity r and Lagrange's parameter b are examined using data generated from
mean number of packets from storage model due to Norros. It is found that best
fit corresponds to r being a linear combination of decaying exponential and
power exponent in b for different values of entropy parameter q. Explicit
expression for the probability that queue size exceeds a certain value is
derived and it is established that it asymptotically follows power law for q
less than one. The system utilization shows an interesting behavior when the
parameter r is varied. It attains lower values than that of M/M/1 system for
smaller values of r whereas situation reverses for higher values of r.
