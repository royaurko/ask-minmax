We develop a general theory for active viscoelastic materials made of polar
filaments. This theory is motivated by the dynamics of the cytoskeleton. The
continuous consumption of a fuel generates a non equilibrium state
characterized by the generation of flows and stresses. Our theory can be
applied to experiments in which cytoskeletal patterns are set in motion by
active processes such as those which are at work in cells.
