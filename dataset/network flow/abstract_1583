We investigate properties of two-dimensional finite-scale percolation systems
whose size along the current flow is smaller than the perpendicular size.
Successive thresholds of appearing multiple percolation channels in such
systems have been determined and dependencies of the conductance on their size
and percolation parameter $p$ have been calculated. Various experimental
examples show that the finite-scale percolation system is the natural
mathematical model suitable for the qualitative and quantitative description of
different physical systems.
