Transportation networks constitute a critical infrastructure enabling the
transfers of passengers and goods, with a significant impact on the economy at
different scales. Transportation modes, whether air, road or rail, are coupled
and interdependent. The frequent occurrence of perturbations on one or several
modes disrupts passengers' entire journeys, directly and through ripple
effects. The present paper provides a case report of the Asiana Crash in San
Francisco International Airport on July 6th 2013 and its repercussions on the
multimodal transportation network. It studies the resulting propagation of
disturbances on the transportation infrastructure in the United States. The
perturbation takes different forms and varies in scale and time frame :
cancellations and delays snowball in the airspace, highway traffic near the
airport is impacted by congestion in previously never congested locations, and
transit passenger demand exhibit unusual traffic peaks in between airports in
the Bay Area. This paper, through a case study, aims at stressing the
importance of further data-driven research on interdependent infrastructure
networks for increased resilience. The end goal is to form the basis for
optimization models behind providing more reliable passenger door-to-door
journeys.
