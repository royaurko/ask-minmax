In this paper we present a review of the existing typologies of Internet
service users. We zoom in on social networking services including blogs and
crowdsourcing websites. Based on the results of the analysis of the considered
typologies obtained by means of FCA we developed a new user typology of a
certain class of Internet services, namely a collaboration innovation platform.
Cluster analysis of data extracted from the collaboration platform Witology was
used to divide more than 500 participants into six groups based on three
activity indicators: idea generation, commenting, and evaluation (assigning
marks) The obtained groups and their percentages appear to follow the "90 - 9 -
1" rule.
