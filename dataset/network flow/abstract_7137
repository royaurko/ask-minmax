In perturbative consideration of the Yang--Mills gradient flow, it is useful
to introduce a gauge non-covariant term ("gauge fixing term") to the flow
equation that gives rise to a Gaussian damping factor also for gauge degrees of
freedom. In the present paper, we consider a modified form of the gauge fixing
term that manifestly preserves covariance under the background gauge
transformation. It is shown that our gauge fixing term does not affect gauge
invariant quantities as the conventional gauge fixing term. The formulation
thus allows a background gauge covariant perturbative expansion of the flow
equation that provides, in particular, a very efficient computational method of
expansion coefficients in the small flow time expansion. The formulation can be
generalized to systems containing fermions.
