A flow is homotopy continuous if it is indefinitely divisible up to
S-homotopy. The full subcategory of cofibrant homotopy continuous flows has
nice features. Not only it is big enough to contain all dihomotopy types, but
also a morphism between them is a weak dihomotopy equivalence if and only if it
is invertible up to dihomotopy. Thus, the category of cofibrant homotopy
continuous flows provides an implementation of Whitehead's theorem for the full
dihomotopy relation, and not only for S-homotopy as in previous works of the
contributor. This fact is not the consequence of the existence of a model structure
on the category of flows because it is known that there does not exist any
model structure on it whose weak equivalences are exactly the weak dihomotopy
equivalences. This fact is an application of a general result for the
localization of a model category with respect to a weak factorization system.
