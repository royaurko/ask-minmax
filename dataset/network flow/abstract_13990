We investigate the mapping of Dirac gaugino masses through regions of strong
coupling, focussing on SQCD with an adjoint. These models have a well-known
Kutasov duality, under which a weakly coupled electric UV description can flow
to a different weakly coupled magnetic IR description. We provide evidence to
show that Dirac gaugino mass terms map as lim_{mu->infty} mD/(g kappa^{1/(k+1}}
= lim_{mu->0} tilde{mD}/(tilde{g} tilde{kappa}^{1/(k+1}} under such a flow,
where the coupling kappa appears in the superpotential of the canonically
normalised theory as W \supset kappa X^{k+1}. This combination is an
RG-invariant to all orders in perturbation theory, but establishing the mapping
in its entirety is not straightforward because Dirac masses are not the
spurions of holomorphic couplings in the N=1 theory. To circumvent this, we
first demonstrate that deforming the Kutasov theory can make it flow to an N=2
theory with parametrically small N=1 deformations. Using harmonic superspace
techniques we then show that the N=1 deformations can be recovered from
electric and magnetic FI-terms that break N=2 -> N=1, and also show that pure
Dirac mass terms can be induced by the same mechanism. We then find that the
proposed RG-invariant is indeed preserved under N=2 duality, and thence along
the flow to the dual N=1 Kutasov theories. Possible phenomenological
applications are discussed.
