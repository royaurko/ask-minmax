The fastest known exact algorithms for scorebased structure discovery in
Bayesian networks on n nodes run in time and space 2nnO(1). The usage of these
algorithms is limited to networks on at most around 25 nodes mainly due to the
space requirement. Here, we study space-time tradeoffs for finding an optimal
network structure. When little space is available, we apply the Gurevich-Shelah
recurrence-originally proposed for the Hamiltonian path problem-and obtain time
22n-snO(1) in space 2snO(1) for any s = n/2, n/4, n/8, . . .; we assume the
indegree of each node is bounded by a constant. For the more practical setting
with moderate amounts of space, we present a novel scheme. It yields running
time 2n(3/2)pnO(1) in space 2n(3/4)pnO(1) for any p = 0, 1, . . ., n/2; these
bounds hold as long as the indegrees are at most 0.238n. Furthermore, the
latter scheme allows easy and efficient parallelization beyond previous
algorithms. We also explore empirically the potential of the presented
techniques.
