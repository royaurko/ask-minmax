We consider the multiple unicast problem under network coding over directed
acyclic networks when there are two source-terminal pairs, $s_1-t_1$ and
$s_2-t_2$. Current characterizations of the multiple unicast capacity region in
this setting have a large number of inequalities, which makes them hard to
explicitly evaluate. In this work we consider a slightly different problem. We
assume that we only know certain minimum cut values for the network, e.g.,
mincut$(S_i, T_j)$, where $S_i \subseteq \{s_1, s_2\}$ and $T_j \subseteq
\{t_1, t_2\}$ for different subsets $S_i$ and $T_j$. Based on these values, we
propose an achievable rate region for this problem based on linear codes.
Towards this end, we begin by defining a base region where both sources are
multicast to both the terminals. Following this we enlarge the region by
appropriately encoding the information at the source nodes, such that terminal
$t_i$ is only guaranteed to decode information from the intended source $s_i$,
while decoding a linear function of the other source. The rate region takes
different forms depending upon the relationship of the different cut values in
the network.
