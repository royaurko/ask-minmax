We explore discrete approaches in LQG where all fields, the gravitational
tetrad, and the matter and energy fields, are encoded implicitly in a graph
instead of being additional data. Our graph should therefore be richer than a
simple simplicial decomposition. It has to embed geometrical information and
the standard model. We start from Lisi's model. We build a trivalent graph
which is an F4 lattice of 48-valent supernodes, reduced as trivalent subgraphs,
and topologically encoding data. We show it is a solution for EFE with no
matter. We define bosons and half-fermions in two dual basis. They are encoded
by bit exchange in supernodes, operated by Pachner 2-2 move, and rest state can
be restored thanks to information redundancy. Despite its 4 dimensional nature,
our graph is a trivalent spin network, and its history is a pentavalent spin
foam.
