It is shown that in transient chaos there is no direct relation between
averages in a continuos time dynamical system (flow) and averages using the
analogous discrete system defined by the corresponding Poincare map. In
contrast to permanent chaos, results obtained from the Poincare map can even be
qualitatively incorrect. The reason is that the return time between
intersections on the Poincare surface becomes relevant. However, after
introducing a true-time Poincare map, quantities known from the usual Poincare
map, such as conditionally invariant measure and natural measure, can be
generalized to this case. Escape rates and averages, e.g. Liapunov exponents
and drifts can be determined correctly using these novel measures. Significant
differences become evident when we compare with results obtained from the usual
Poincare map.
