In this brief report, we study the synchronization of growing scale-free
networks. An asymmetrical age-based coupling method is proposed with only one
free parameter $\alpha$. Although the coupling matrix is asymmetric, our
coupling method could guarantee that all the eigenvalues are non-negative
reals. The eigneratio R will approach to 1 in the large limit of $\alpha$.
