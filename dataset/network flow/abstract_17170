The negative externalities from an individual bank failure to the whole
system can be huge. One of the key purposes of bank regulation is to
internalize the social costs of potential bank failures via capital charges.
This study proposes a method to evaluate and allocate the systemic risk to
different countries/regions using a SIR type of epidemic spreading model and
the Shapley value in game theory. The paper also explores features of a
constructed bank network using real globe-wide banking data.
