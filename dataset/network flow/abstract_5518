We consider protocols that serve communication requests arising over time in
a wireless network that is subject to interference. Unlike previous approaches,
we take the geometry of the network and power control into account, both
allowing to increase the network's performance significantly. We introduce a
stochastic and an adversarial model to bound the packet injection. Although
taken as the primary motivation, this approach is not only suitable for models
based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). It also covers
virtually all other common interference models, for example the multiple-access
channel, the radio-network model, the protocol model, and distance-2 matching.
Packet-routing networks allowing each edge or each node to transmit or receive
one packet at a time can be modeled as well.
  Starting from algorithms for the respective scheduling problem with static
transmission requests, we build distributed stable protocols. This is more
involved than in previous, similar approaches because the algorithms we
consider do not necessarily scale linearly when scaling the input instance. We
can guarantee a throughput that is as large as the one of the original static
algorithm. In particular, for SINR models the competitive ratios of the
protocol in comparison to optimal ones in the respective model are between
constant and O(log^2 m) for a network of size m.
