A model for slow radio pulsars is proposed which involves the entire
magnetosphere in the production of the observed radio emission. It is argued
that observations of pulsar profiles suggest that a feedback mechanism exists
between the star surface and the null charge surface, requiring particle flow
in both directions. In their flow to and from the surface the particles execute
an azimuthal drift around the magnetic pole, thereby creating a ring of
discrete `emission nodes' close to the surface. Motion of the nodes is observed
as the well-known subpulse `drift', but is interpreted here as a small residual
component of the real particle drift. The nodes can therefore move in either
direction, or even remain stationary. A precise fit is found for the pulsar
PSR0943+10. Azimuthal interactions between different regions of the
magnetosphere depend on the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes and
influence the conal type, as observed. The requirement of intermittent weak
pair-production in an outergap suggests a natural evolutionary link between
radio and gamma-ray pulsars.
