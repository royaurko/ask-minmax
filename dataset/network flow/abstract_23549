We study theoretically a model system of a transient network of microemulsion
droplets connected by telechelic polymers and explain recent experimental
findings. Despite the absence of any specific interactions between either the
droplets or polymer chains, we predict that as the number of polymers per drop
is increased, the system undergoes a first order phase separation into a dense,
highly connected phase, in equilibrium with dilute droplets, decorated by
polymer loops. The phase transition is purely entropic and is driven by the
interplay between the translational entropy of the drops and the
configurational entropy of the polymer connections between them. Because it is
dominated by entropic effects, the phase separation mechanism of the system is
extremely robust and does not depend on the particlular physical realization of
the network. The discussed model applies as well to other polymer linked
particle aggregates, such as nano-particles connected with short DNA linkers.
