The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as a classifier of digital
spectra is investigated. Using both simulated and real data, it is shown that
neural networks can be trained to discriminate between the spectra of different
classes of active galactic nucleus (AGN) with realistic sample sizes and
signal-to-noise ratios. By working in the Fourier domain, neural nets can
classify objects without knowledge of their redshifts.
