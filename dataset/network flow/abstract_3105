It is a great challenge to evaluate the network performance of cellular
mobile communication systems. In this paper, we propose new spatial spectrum
and energy efficiency models for Poisson-Voronoi tessellation (PVT) random
cellular networks. To evaluate the user access the network, a Markov chain
based wireless channel access model is first proposed for PVT random cellular
networks. On that basis, the outage probability and blocking probability of PVT
random cellular networks are derived, which can be computed numerically.
Furthermore, taking into account the call arrival rate, the path loss exponent
and the base station (BS) density in random cellular networks, spatial spectrum
and energy efficiency models are proposed and analyzed for PVT random cellular
networks. Numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the network spectrum
and energy efficiency in PVT random cellular networks.
