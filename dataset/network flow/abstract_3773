Transcritical flow of a stratified fluid past a broad localised topographic
obstacle is studied analytically in the framework of the forced extended
Korteweg--de Vries (eKdV), or Gardner, equation. We consider both possible
signs for the cubic nonlinear term in the Gardner equation corresponding to
different fluid density stratification profiles. We identify the range of the
input parameters: the oncoming flow speed (the Froude number) and the
topographic amplitude, for which the obstacle supports a stationary localised
hydraulic transition from the subcritical flow upstream to the supercritical
flow downstream. Such a localised transcritical flow is resolved back into the
equilibrium flow state away from the obstacle with the aid of unsteady coherent
nonlinear wave structures propagating upstream and downstream. Along with the
regular, cnoidal undular bores occurring in the analogous problem for the
single-layer flow modeled by the forced KdV equation, the transcritical
internal wave flows support a diverse family of upstream and downstream wave
structures, including solibores, rarefaction waves, reversed and trigonometric
undular bores, which we describe using the recent development of the nonlinear
modulation theory for the (unforced) Gardner equation. The predictions of the
developed analytic construction are confirmed by direct numerical simulations
of the forced Gardner equation for a broad range of input parameters.
