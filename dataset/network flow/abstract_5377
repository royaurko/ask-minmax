We introduce an application of a mobile transient network architecture on top
of the current Internet. This paper is an application extension to a conceptual
mobile network architecture. It attempts to specifically reinforce some of the
powerful notions exposed by the architecture from an application perspective.
Of these notions, we explore the network expansion layer, an overlay of
components and services, that enables a persistent identification network and
other required services. The overlay abstraction introduces several benefits of
which mobility and communication across heterogenous network structures are of
interest to this paper. We present implementations of several components and
protocols including gateways, Agents and the Open Device Access Protocol. Our
present identification network implementation exploits the current
implementation of the Handle System through the use of distributed, global and
persistent identifiers called handles. Handles are used to identify and locate
devices and services abstracting any physical location or network association
from the communicating ends. A communication framework is finally demonstrated
that would allow for mobile devices on the public Internet to have persistent
identifiers and thus be persistently accessible either directly or indirectly.
This application expands IP inter-operability beyond its current boundaries.
