The increasing reliance on online social networks for user engagement
motivates the need to understand and counter reputation manipulation
activities, such as boosting the number of likes of a Facebook page. This paper
presents an in-depth analysis of Facebook accounts used by a few Like Farms. We
crawl their timelines and compare their activities to a baseline sample of
normal users. Then, we retrieve the pages they like and cluster their activity.
We find that, compared to normal users, posts from Like Farms' accounts often
consist of re-shared content, have fewer words and poor vocabulary, are
targeted to a limited number of topics and generate more comments and likes.
Profiles used by Like Farms are also more likely to be tagged or tag their
friends and their likes are concentrated toward specific pages. While we
highlight the difficulty of currently deployed anti-fraud tools to detect
stealthy behavior, our analysis provides important insights that can be
incorporated in clustering algorithms to detect Like Farms networks.
