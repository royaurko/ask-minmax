We describe results of measurements of the orientational motion of glass
microrods in a microchannel flow, following the orientational motion of
particles with different shapes. We determine how the orientational dynamics
depends on the shape of the particle and on its initial orientation. We find
that the dynamics depends so sensitively on the degree to which axisymmetry is
broken that it is difficult to find particles that are sufficiently
axisymmetric so that they exhibit periodic tumbling ("Jeffery orbits").
