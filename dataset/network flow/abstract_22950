In an attempt to determine the outer scale of turbulence driven by localized
sources, such as supernova explosions in the interstellar medium, we consider a
forcing function given by the gradient of gaussian profiles localized at random
positions. Different coherence times of the forcing function are considered. In
order to isolate the effects specific to the nature of the forcing function we
consider the case of a polytropic equation of state and restrict ourselves to
forcing amplitudes such that the flow remains subsonic. When the coherence time
is short, the outer scale agrees with the half-width of the gaussian. Longer
coherence times can cause extra power at large scales, but this would not yield
power law behavior at scales larger than that of the expansion waves. At scales
smaller than the scale of the expansion waves the spectrum is close to power
law with a spectral exponent of -2. The resulting flow is virtually free of
vorticity. Viscous driving of vorticity turns out to be weak and
self-amplification through the nonlinear term is found to be insignificant. No
evidence for small scale dynamo action is found in cases where the magnetic
induction equation is solved simultaneously with the other equations.
