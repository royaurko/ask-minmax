We describe a formally exact method to calculate the optical conductivity of
a one-dimensional system with fluctuating order. For classical phase
fluctuations we explicitly determine the optical conductivity by solving two
coupled Fokker-Planck equations numerically. Our results differ considerably
from perturbation theory and in contrast to Gaussian order parameter
fluctuations show a strong dependence on the correlation length.
