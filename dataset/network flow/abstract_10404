Cell dynamics simulation is used to investigate the phase behavior of block
copolymer/homopolymer mixture subjected to a steady shear flow. Phase
transitions occur from transverse to parallel and then to perpendicular
lamellar structure with an increase of shear rate and this is the result of
interaction between the shear flow and the concentration fluctuation.
Rheological properties, such as normal stress differences and shear viscosity,
are all closely related with the direction of the lamellae. Furthermore, we
specifically explore the phase behavior and the order parameter under weak and
strong shear of two different initial states, and realize the importance of the
thermal history. It is necessary to apply the shear field at the appropriate
time if we want to get what we want. These results provide an easy method to
create ordered, defect-free materials in experiment and engineering technology
through imposing shear flow.
