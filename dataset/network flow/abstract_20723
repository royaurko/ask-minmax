Broadcasting algorithms are important building blocks of distributed systems.
In this work we investigate the typical performance of the classical and
well-studied push model. Assume that initially one node in a given network
holds some piece of information. In each round, every one of the informed nodes
chooses independently a neighbor uniformly at random and transmits the message
to it.
  In this paper we consider random networks where each vertex has degree d,
which is at least 3, i.e., the underlying graph is drawn uniformly at random
from the set of all d-regular graphs with n vertices. We show that with
probability 1 - o(1) the push model broadcasts the message to all nodes within
(1 + o(1))C_d ln n rounds, where C_d = 1/ ln(2(1-1/d)) - 1/(d ln(1 - 1/d)). In
particular, we can characterize precisely the effect of the node degree to the
typical broadcast time of the push model. Moreover, we consider pseudo-random
regular networks, where we assume that the degree of each node is very large.
There we show that the broadcast time is (1+o(1))C ln n with probability 1 -
o(1), where C= 1/ ln 2 + 1, is the limit of C_d as d grows.
