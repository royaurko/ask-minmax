We show how scale-free degree distributions can emerge naturally from growing
networks by using random walks for selecting vertices for attachment. This
result holds for several variants of the walk algorithm and for a wide range of
parameters. The growth mechanism is based on using local graph information
only, so this is a process of self-organisation. The standard mean-field
equations are an excellent approximation for network growth using these rules.
We discuss the effects of finite size on the degree distribution, and compare
analytical results to simulated networks. Finally, we generalise the random
walk algorithm to produce weighted networks with power-law distributions of
both weight and degree.
