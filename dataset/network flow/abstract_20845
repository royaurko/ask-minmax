Multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) systems promise enormous capacity
increase and are being considered as one of the key technologies for future
wireless networks. However, the decrease in capacity due to the presence of
interferers in MIMO networks is not well understood. In this paper, we develop
an analytical framework to characterize the capacity of MIMO communication
systems in the presence of multiple MIMO co-channel interferers and noise. We
consider the situation in which transmitters have no information about the
channel and all links undergo Rayleigh fading. We first generalize the known
determinant representation of hypergeometric functions with matrix arguments to
the case when the argument matrices have eigenvalues of arbitrary multiplicity.
This enables the derivation of the distribution of the eigenvalues of Gaussian
quadratic forms and Wishart matrices with arbitrary correlation, with
application to both single user and multiuser MIMO systems. In particular, we
derive the ergodic mutual information for MIMO systems in the presence of
multiple MIMO interferers. Our analysis is valid for any number of interferers,
each with arbitrary number of antennas having possibly unequal power levels.
This framework, therefore, accommodates the study of distributed MIMO systems
and accounts for different positions of the MIMO interferers.
