In this paper we consider the evolution of a graph-like hypersurface by
anisotropic mean curvature flow, under some restrictions on the anisotropic
area integrand. We find interior estimates (in both time and space) on the
gradient of such hypersurfaces, depending only on the height of the graph and
the anisotropic area integrand.
