We study a rarefied gas, described by the Boltzmann equation, between two
coaxial rotating cylinders in the small Knudsen number regime. When the radius
of the inner cylinder is suitably sent to infinity, the limiting evolution is
expected to converge to a modified Couette flow which keeps memory of the
vanishing curvature of the cylinders (ghost effect). In the 1-d stationary case
we prove the existence of a positive isolated L_2-solution to the Boltzmann
equation and its convergence. This is obtained by means of a truncated
bulk-boundary layer expansion which requires the study of a new Milne problem,
and an estimate of the remainder based on a generalized spectral inequality.
