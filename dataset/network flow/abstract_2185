We present an interface between the (magneto-) hydrodynamics code PLUTO and
the plasma simulation and spectral synthesis code CLOUDY. By combining these
codes, we constructed a new photoionization hydrodynamics solver: The
PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface (TPCI), which is well suited to simulate
photoevaporative flows under strong irradiation. The code includes the
electromagnetic spectrum from X-rays to the radio range and solves the
photoionization and chemical network of the 30 lightest elements. TPCI follows
an iterative numerical scheme: First, the equilibrium state of the medium is
solved for a given radiation field by CLOUDY, resulting in a net radiative
heating or cooling. In the second step, the latter influences the (magneto-)
hydrodynamic evolution calculated by PLUTO. Here, we validated the
one-dimensional version of the code on the basis of four test problems:
Photoevaporation of a cool hydrogen cloud, cooling of coronal plasma, formation
of a Stroemgren sphere, and the evaporating atmosphere of a hot Jupiter. This
combination of an equilibrium photoionization solver with a general MHD code
provides an advanced simulation tool applicable to a variety of astrophysical
problems.
