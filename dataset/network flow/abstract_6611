Mobile ad-hoc networks are temporary wireless networks. Network resources are
abnormally consumed by intruders. Anomaly and signature based techniques are
used for intrusion detection. Classification techniques are used in anomaly
based techniques. Intrusion detection techniques are used for the network
attack detection process. Two types of intrusion detection systems are
available. They are anomaly detection and signature based detection model. The
anomaly detection model uses the historical transactions with attack labels.
The signature database is used in the signature based IDS schemes.
  The mobile ad-hoc networks are infrastructure less environment. The intrusion
detection applications are placed in a set of nodes under the mobile ad-hoc
network environment. The nodes are grouped into clusters. The leader nodes are
assigned for the clusters. The leader node is assigned for the intrusion
detection process. Leader nodes are used to initiate the intrusion detection
process. Resource sharing and lifetime management factors are considered in the
leader election process. The system optimizes the leader election and intrusion
detection process.
  The system is designed to handle leader election and intrusion detection
process. The clustering scheme is optimized with coverage and traffic level.
Cost and resource utilization is controlled under the clusters. Node mobility
is managed by the system.
