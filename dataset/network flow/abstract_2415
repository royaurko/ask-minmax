Random finite sets (RFSs) has been a fruitful area of research in recent
years, yielding new approximate filters such as the probability hypothesis
density (PHD), cardinalised PHD (CPHD), and multiple target multi-Bernoulli
(MeMBer). These new methods have largely been based on approximations that
side-step the need for measurement-to-track association. Comparably, RFS
methods that incorporate data association, such as Morelande and Challa's (M-C)
method, have received little attention. This paper provides a RFS algorithm
that incorporates data association similarly to the M-C method, but retains
computational tractability via a recently developed approximation of marginal
association weights. We describe an efficient method for resolving the track
coalescence phenomenon which is problematic for joint probabilistic data
association (JPDA) and related methods (including M-C). The method utilises a
network flow optimisation, and thus is tractable for large numbers of targets.
Finally, our derivation also shows that it is natural for the multi-target
density to incorporate both a Poisson point process (PPP) component
(representing targets that have never been detected) and a multi-Bernoulli
component (representing targets under track). We describe a method of
recycling, in which tracks with a low probability existence are transferred
from the multi-Bernoulli component to the PPP component, effectively yielding a
hybrid of M-C and PHD.
