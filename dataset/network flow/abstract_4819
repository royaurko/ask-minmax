We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the two dimensional
incompressible Euler equations in the exterior of a curve when the curve
shrinks to a point. This work links two previous results: [Iftimie, Lopes Filho
and Nussenzveig Lopes, Two Dimensional Incompressible Ideal Flow Around a Small
Obstacle, Comm. PDE, 28 (2003), 349-379] and [Lacave, Two Dimensional
Incompressible Ideal Flow Around a Thin Obstacle Tending to a Curve, Ann. IHP,
Anl, 26 (2009), 1121-1148]. The second goal of this work is to complete the
previous article, in defining the way the obstacles shrink to a curve. In
particular, we give geometric properties for domain convergences in order that
the limit flow be a solution of Euler equations.
