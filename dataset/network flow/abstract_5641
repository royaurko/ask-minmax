In this paper, we study an adaptive spatial network. We consider an SIS
(susceptible-infectedsusceptible) epidemic on the network, with a link/contact
rewiring process constrained by spatial proximity. In particular, we assume
that susceptible nodes break links with infected nodes independently of
distance, and reconnect at random to susceptible nodes available within a given
radius. By systematically manipulating this radius we investigate the impact of
rewiring on the structure of the network and characteristics of the epidemic.
We adopt a step-by-step approach whereby we ?rst study the impact of rewiring
on the network structure in the absence of an epidemic, then with nodes
assigned a disease status but without disease dynamics, and ?nally running
network and epidemic dynamics simultaneously. In the case of no labelling and
no epidemic dynamics, we provide both analytic and semi-analytic formulas for
the value of clustering achieved in the network. Our results also show that the
rewiring radius and the network's initial structure have a pronounced e?ect on
the endemic equilibrium, with increasingly large rewiring radiuses yielding
smaller disease prevalence.
