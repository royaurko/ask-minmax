The effect of Prandtl number on the evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
billows and the amount of mixing they generate is studied through direct
numerical simulation (DNS). The results indicate that the time evolution of the
rate of mixing through different stages of the life-cycle of KH flow is
significantly influenced by the Prandtl number. As the Prandtl number
increases, the final amount of mixing increases for Reynolds that are too low
to support active three-dimensional motions. This trend is the opposite in
sufficiently high Reynolds number KH flows that can overcome viscous effects,
and develop significant three-dimensional instabilities. While the mixing
generated in the two-dimensional flows, uniform in the span-wise direction, is
not significantly dependent on the Prandtl number, the turbulent mixing induced
by three-dimensional motions is a function of the Prandtl number. The turbulent
mixing efficiency near the end of the turbulence decay phase approaches 0.2,
the commonly observed value in the ocean. A smooth transition in mixing is
observed by increasing the buoyancy Reynolds number.
