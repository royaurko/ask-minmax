We consider a system of two PDEs arising from modeling motility of eukariotic
cells on substrates. This system consists of the Allen-Cahn equation for the
scalar phase field function coupled with another vectorial parabolic equation
for the orientation of the actin filament network.
  The two key properties of this system are (i) presence of gradients in the
coupling terms (gradient coupling) and (ii) a mass (volume) preservation
constraint. We first prove that the sharp interface property of initial
conditions is preserved in time. Next we formally derive the equation of the
motion of the interface, which is mean curvature motion with an additional
nonlinear term that appears due to property (i). This novel term leads to
surprising features of the motion of the interface such as discontinuities of
the interface velocity and hysteresis.
  Because of the properties (i)-(ii), classical comparison principle techniques
do not apply to this system. Furthermore, the system can not be written in a
form of gradient flow, which is why recently developed $\Gamma$-convergence
techniques also can not be used. A special form of asymptotic expansion is
introduced to reduce analysis to a single nonlinear PDE: a one-dimensional
model problem. Further stability analysis reveals qualitative change in the
behavior of the system for small and large values of the main parameter of the
system.
