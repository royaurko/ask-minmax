Gossip algorithms have recently received significant attention, mainly
because they constitute simple and robust message-passing schemes for
distributed information processing over networks. However for many topologies
that are realistic for wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks (like grids and
random geometric graphs), the standard nearest-neighbor gossip converges as
slowly as flooding ($O(n^2)$ messages).
  A recently proposed algorithm called geographic gossip improves gossip
efficiency by a $\sqrt{n}$ factor, by exploiting geographic information to
enable multi-hop long distance communications. In this paper we prove that a
variation of geographic gossip that averages along routed paths, improves
efficiency by an additional $\sqrt{n}$ factor and is order optimal ($O(n)$
messages) for grids and random geometric graphs.
  We develop a general technique (travel agency method) based on Markov chain
mixing time inequalities, which can give bounds on the performance of
randomized message-passing algorithms operating over various graph topologies.
