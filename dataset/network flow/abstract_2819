We consider the local solution to the Calabi flow for C^\alpha initial
metric. We also prove that the Calabi flow on compact Kaehler surfaces can be
extended once the metrics along the flow are bounded in L^\infty sense. This
can be viewed as obtaining higher order derivative estimates from second order
derivatives for a fourth order nonlinear equation.
