We examine the RG flow of a candidate c-function, extracted from the
holographic entanglement entropy of a strip-shaped region, for theories with
broken Lorentz invariance. We clarify the conditions on the geometry that lead
to a break-down of monotonic RG flows as is expected for generic
Lorentz-violating field theories. Nevertheless we identify a set of simple
criteria on the UV behavior of the geometry which guarantee a monotonic
c-function. Our analysis can thus be used as a guiding principle for the
construction of monotonic RG trajectories, and can also prove useful for
excluding possible IR behaviors of the theory.
