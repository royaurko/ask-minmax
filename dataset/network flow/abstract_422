The problem of security against timing based traffic analysis in wireless
networks is considered in this work. An analytical measure of anonymity in
eavesdropped networks is proposed using the information theoretic concept of
equivocation. For a physical layer with orthogonal transmitter directed
signaling, scheduling and relaying techniques are designed to maximize
achievable network performance for any given level of anonymity. The network
performance is measured by the achievable relay rates from the sources to
destinations under latency and medium access constraints. In particular,
analytical results are presented for two scenarios:
  For a two-hop network with maximum anonymity, achievable rate regions for a
general m x 1 relay are characterized when nodes generate independent Poisson
transmission schedules. The rate regions are presented for both strict and
average delay constraints on traffic flow through the relay.
  For a multihop network with an arbitrary anonymity requirement, the problem
of maximizing the sum-rate of flows (network throughput) is considered. A
selective independent scheduling strategy is designed for this purpose, and
using the analytical results for the two-hop network, the achievable throughput
is characterized as a function of the anonymity level. The throughput-anonymity
relation for the proposed strategy is shown to be equivalent to an information
theoretic rate-distortion function.
