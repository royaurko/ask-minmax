Lees Edwards boundary conditions (LEbc) for Molecular Dynamics simulations
are an extension of the well known periodic boundary conditions and allow the
simulation of bulk systems in a simple shear flow. We show how the idea of LEbc
can be implemented in lattice Boltzmann simulations and how LEbc can be used to
overcome the problem of a maxinum shear rate that is limited to less than 1/Ly
(with Ly the transverse system size) in traditional lattice Boltzmann
implementations of shear flow.
