A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network is a collection of mobile nodes that are dynamically
and arbitrarily located in such a manner that the interconnections between
nodes are capable of changing on continual basis. Due to security
vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are
unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the
Black Hole Attack. In this paper, we give an algorithmic approach to focus on
analyzing and improving the security of AODV, which is one of the popular
routing protocols for MANET. Our aim is on ensuring the security against Black
hole attack. The proposed solution is capable of detecting & removing Black
hole node(s) in the MANET at the beginning. Also the objective of this paper is
to provide a simulation study that illustrates the effects of Black hole attack
on network performance.
