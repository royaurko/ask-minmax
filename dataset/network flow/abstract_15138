The availability of positional information is of great importance in many
commercial, governmental, and military applications. Localization is commonly
accomplished through the use of radio communication between mobile devices
(agents) and fixed infrastructure (anchors). However, precise determination of
agent positions is a challenging task, especially in harsh environments due to
radio blockage or limited anchor deployment. In these situations, cooperation
among agents can significantly improve localization accuracy and reduce
localization outage probabilities. A general framework of analyzing the
fundamental limits of wideband localization has been developed in Part I of the
paper. Here, we build on this framework and establish the fundamental limits of
wideband cooperative location-aware networks. Our analysis is based on the
waveforms received at the nodes, in conjunction with Fisher information
inequality. We provide a geometrical interpretation of equivalent Fisher
information for cooperative networks. This approach allows us to succinctly
derive fundamental performance limits and their scaling behaviors, and to treat
anchors and agents in a unified way from the perspective of localization
accuracy. Our results yield important insights into how and when cooperation is
beneficial.
