We propose an efficient framework for enabling secure multi-party numerical
computations in a Peer-to-Peer network. This problem arises in a range of
applications such as collaborative filtering, distributed computation of trust
and reputation, monitoring and numerous other tasks, where the computing nodes
would like to preserve the privacy of their inputs while performing a joint
computation of a certain function.
  Although there is a rich literature in the field of distributed systems
security concerning secure multi-party computation, in practice it is hard to
deploy those methods in very large scale Peer-to-Peer networks. In this work,
we examine several possible approaches and discuss their feasibility. Among the
possible approaches, we identify a single approach which is both scalable and
theoretically secure.
  An additional novel contribution is that we show how to compute the
neighborhood based collaborative filtering, a state-of-the-art collaborative
filtering algorithm, winner of the Netflix progress prize of the year 2007. Our
solution computes this algorithm in a Peer-to-Peer network, using a privacy
preserving computation, without loss of accuracy.
  Using extensive large scale simulations on top of real Internet topologies,
we demonstrate the applicability of our approach. As far as we know, we are the
first to implement such a large scale secure multi-party simulation of networks
of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges.
