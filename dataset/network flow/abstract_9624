Network models are widely used as structural summaries of biochemical
systems. Statistical estimation of networks is usually based on linear or
discrete models. However, the dynamics of these systems are generally
nonlinear, suggesting that suitable nonlinear formulations may offer gains with
respect to network inference and associated prediction problems. We present a
general framework for both network inference and dynamical prediction that is
rooted in nonlinear biochemical kinetics. This is done by considering a
dynamical system based on a chemical reaction graph and associated kinetics
parameters. Inference regarding both parameters and the reaction graph itself
is carried out within a fully Bayesian framework. Prediction of dynamical
behavior is achieved by averaging over both parameters and reaction graphs,
allowing prediction even when the underlying reactions themselves are unknown
or uncertain. Results, based on (i) data simulated from a mechanistic model of
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and (ii) phosphoproteomic data from
cancer cell lines, demonstrate that nonlinear formulations can yield gains in
network inference and permit dynamical prediction in the challenging setting
where the reaction graph is unknown.
