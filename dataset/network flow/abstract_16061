The virtualization and softwarization of modern computer networks enables the
definition and fast deployment of novel network services called service chains:
sequences of virtualized network functions (e.g., firewalls, caches, traffic
optimizers) through which traffic is routed between source and destination.
This paper attends to the problem of admitting and embedding a maximum number
of service chains, i.e., a maximum number of source-destination pairs which are
routed via a sequence of to-be-allocated, capacitated network functions. We
consider an Online variant of this maximum Service Chain Embedding Problem,
short OSCEP, where requests arrive over time, in a worst-case manner. Our main
contribution is a deterministic O(log L)-competitive online algorithm, under
the assumption that capacities are at least logarithmic in L. We show that this
is asymptotically optimal within the class of deterministic and randomized
online algorithms. We also explore lower bounds for offline approximation
algorithms, and prove that the offline problem is APX-hard for unit capacities
and small L > 2, and even Poly-APX-hard in general, when there is no bound on
L. These approximation lower bounds may be of independent interest, as they
also extend to other problems such as Virtual Circuit Routing. Finally, we
present an exact algorithm based on 0-1 programming, implying that the general
offline SCEP is in NP and by the above hardness results it is NP-complete for
constant L.
