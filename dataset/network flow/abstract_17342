We review recent developments in functional renormalization group (RG)
methods for interacting fermions. These approaches aim at obtaining an unbiased
picture of competing Fermi liquid instabilities in the low-dimensional models
like the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We discuss how these instabilities can
be approached from various sides and how the fermionic RG flow can be continued
into phases with broken symmetry.
