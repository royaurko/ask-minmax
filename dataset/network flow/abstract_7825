In the present paper we give a positive answer to some questions posed by
Viana on the existence of positive Lyapunov exponents for Hamiltonian linear
differential systems. We prove that there exists an open and dense set of
Hamiltonian linear differential systems, over a suspension flow with bounded
roof function, displaying at least one positive Lyapunov exponent. In
consequence, typical cocycles over a uniformly hyperbolic flow are chaotic.
Finally, we obtain similar results for cocycles over flows preserving an
ergodic, hyperbolic measure with local product structure.
