Cross-border access to a variety of data such as market information,
strategic information, or customer-related information defines the daily
business of many global companies, including financial institutions. These
companies are obliged by law to keep a data processing legal for all offered
services. They need to fulfill different security objectives specified by the
legislation. Therefore, they control access to prevent uncontributorized users from
using data. Those security objectives, for example confidentiality or secrecy,
are often defined in the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language that
promotes interoperability between different systems. In this paper, we show the
necessity of incorporating the requirements of legislation into access control.
Based on the work flow in a banking scenario we describe a variety of available
contextual information and their interrelations. Different from other access
control systems our main focus is on law-compliant cross-border data access. By
including legislation directly into access decisions, this lawfulness can be
ensured. We also describe our information model to demonstrate how these
policies can be implemented into an existing network and how the components and
contextual information interrelate. Finally, we outline an event flow for a
request made from a remote user exemplifying how such a system decides about
access.
