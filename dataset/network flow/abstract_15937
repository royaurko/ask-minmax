If a piece of information is released from a media site, can it spread, in 1
month, to a million web pages? This influence estimation problem is very
challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the problem and the issue
of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a
randomized algorithm for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion
networks. Our algorithm can estimate the influence of every node in a network
with |V| nodes and |E| edges to an accuracy of $\varepsilon$ using
$n=O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ randomizations and up to logarithmic factors
O(n|E|+n|V|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy influence
maximization algorithm, our proposed method is guaranteed to find a set of
nodes with an influence of at least (1-1/e)OPT-2$\varepsilon$, where OPT is the
optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the
proposed method can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while
significantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy
of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing
the influence.
