Multiclass FIFO is used in communication networks such as in input-queueing
routers/switches and in wireless networks. For the concern of providing service
guarantees in such networks, it is crucial to have analytical results, e.g.
bounds, on the performance of multi-class FIFO. Surprisingly, there are few
such results in the literature. This paper is devoted to filling the gap.
Specifically, a single hop deterministic case is studied, for which, delay and
backlog bounds are derived, in addition to guaranteed rate and service curve
characterizations that may be exploited to extend the analysis to network
cases.
