Network coding is famous for significantly improving the throughput of
networks. The successful decoding of the network coded data relies on some side
information of the original data. In that framework, independent data flows are
usually first decoded and then network coded by relay nodes. If appropriate
signal design is adopted, physical layer network coding is a natural way in
wireless networks. In this work, a network coding tree algorithm which enhances
the efficiency of the multiple access system (MAS) is presented. For MAS,
existing works tried to avoid the collisions while collisions happen frequently
under heavy load. By introducing network coding to MAS, our proposed algorithm
achieves a better performance of throughput and delay. When multiple users
transmit signal in a time slot, the mexed signals are saved and used to jointly
decode the collided frames after some component frames of the network coded
frame are received. Splitting tree structure is extended to the new algorithm
for collision solving. The throughput of the system and average delay of frames
are presented in a recursive way. Besides, extensive simulations show that
network coding tree algorithm enhances the system throughput and decreases the
average frame delay compared with other algorithms. Hence, it improves the
system performance.
