We have developed a high-precision code which solves the kinematic dynamo
problem both for given rotation law and meridional flow in the case of a low
eddy diffusivity of the order of $10^{11}$ cm$^2$/s known from the sunspot
decay. All our models work with an \alf-effect which is positive (negative) in
the northern (southern) hemisphere. It is concentrated in radial layers located
either at the top or at the bottom of the convection zone. We have also
considered an \alf-effect uniformly distributed in all the convection zone. In
the present paper the main attention is focused on i) the parity of the
solution, ii) the form of the butterfly diagram and iii) the phase relation of
the resulting field components. If the helioseismologically derived internal
solar rotation law is considered, a model without meridional flow of high
magnetic Reynolds number (corresponding to low eddy diffusivity) fails in all
the three issues in comparison with the observations. However, a meridional
flow with equatorial drift at the bottom of the convection zone of few meters
by second can indeed enforce the equatorward migration of the toroidal magnetic
field belts similar to the observed butterfly diagram but, the solution has
only a dipolar parity if the (positive) \alf-effect is located at the base of
the convection zone rather than at the top. We can, therefore, confirm the main
results of a similar study by Dikpati & Gilman (2001).
