Urban streets are hierarchically organized in the sense that a majority of
streets are trivial, while a minority of streets is vital. This hierarchy can
be simply, but elegantly, characterized by the 80/20 principle, i.e. 80 percent
of streets are less connected (below the average), while 20 percent of streets
are well connected (above the average); out of the 20 percent, there is 1
percent of streets that are extremely well connected. This paper, using a
European city as an example, examined, at a much more detailed level, such
street hierarchies from the perspective of geometric and topological
properties. Based on an empirical study, we further proved a previous
conjecture that a minority of streets accounts for a majority of traffic flow;
more accurately, the 20 percent of top streets accommodate 80 percent of
traffic flow (20/80), and the 1 percent of top streets account for more than 20
percent of traffic flow (1/20). Our study provides new evidence as to how a
city is (self-)organized, contributing to the understanding of cities and their
evolution using increasingly available mobility geographic information.
