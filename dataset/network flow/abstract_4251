Recent years have seen a growing interest in the modeling and simulation of
social networks to understand several social phenomena. Two important classes
of networks, small world and scale free networks have gained a lot of research
interest. Another important characteristic of social networks is the presence
of community structures. Many social processes such as information diffusion
and disease epidemics depend on the presence of community structures making it
an important property for network generation models to be incorporated. In this
paper, we present a tunable and growing network generation model with small
world and scale free properties as well as the presence of community
structures. The major contribution of this model is that the communities thus
created satisfy three important structural properties: connectivity within each
community follows power-law, communities have high clustering coefficient and
hierarchical community structures are present in the networks generated using
the proposed model. Furthermore, the model is highly robust and capable of
producing networks with a number of different topological characteristics
varying clustering coefficient and inter-cluster edges. Our simulation results
show that the model produces small world and scale free networks along with the
presence of communities depicting real world societies and social networks.
