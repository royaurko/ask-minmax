The dynamics of intermittent granular flow through an orifice in a granular
bin and the associated clogging due to formation of arches blocking the outlet,
is studied numerically in two-dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that
for small hole sizes, the system self-organizes to a steady state and the
distribution of the grain displacements decays as power laws. On the other
hand, for large holes, the outflow distributions are also observed to follow
power law distributions.
