We study the significance of T-duality in the context of the gravitational
description of gauge theories. We found that T-duality relates the deferents
points of the moduli of a given gauge theory always far from the conformal
fixed point. Also the described gauge theories seems to flow naturally to the
able conformal points, those that naturally saturate all the possible known
examples of near horizon geometries. Supersymmetry properties and T-duality
breaking of it are discuss.
