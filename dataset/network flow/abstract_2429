As the Internet becomes increasingly heterogeneous, the issue of congestion
avoidance and control becomes ever more important. And the queue length,
end-to-end delays and link utilization is some of the important things in term
of congestion avoidance and control mechanisms. In this work we continue to
study the performances of the New-AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative
Decrease) mechanism as one of the core protocols for TCP congestion avoidance
and control algorithm, we want to evaluate the effect of using the AIMD
algorithm after developing it to find a new approach, as we called it the
New-AIMD algorithm to measure the Queue length, delay and bottleneck link
utilization, and use the NCTUns simulator to get the results after make the
modification for the mechanism. And we will use the Droptail mechanism as the
active queue management mechanism (AQM) in the bottleneck router. After
implementation of our new approach with different number of flows, we expect
the delay will less when we measure the delay dependent on the throughput for
all the system, and also we expect to get end-to-end delay less. And we will
measure the second type of delay a (queuing delay), as we shown in the figure 1
bellow. Also we will measure the bottleneck link utilization, and we expect to
get high utilization for bottleneck link with using this mechanism, and avoid
the collisions in the link.
