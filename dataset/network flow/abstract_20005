The decay rate of isotropic and homogeneous turbulence is known to be
affected by the large-scale spectrum of the initial perturbations, associated
with at least two cannonical self-preserving solutions of the von
K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation: the so-called Batchelor and Saffman spectra. The
effect of long-range correlations in the decay of anisotropic flows is less
clear, and recently it has been proposed that the decay rate of rotating
turbulence may be independent of the large-scale spectrum of the initial
perturbations. We analyze numerical simulations of freely decaying rotating
turbulence with initial energy spectra $\sim k^4$ (Batchelor turbulence) and
$\sim k^2$ (Saffman turbulence) and show that, while a self-similar decay
cannot be identified for the total energy, the decay is indeed affected by
long-range correlations. The decay of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
modes follows distinct power laws in each case, which are consistent with
predictions derived from the anisotropic von K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation, and
with conservation of anisotropic integral quantities by the flow evolution.
