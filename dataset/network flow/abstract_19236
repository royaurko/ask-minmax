We extend the Markov additive methodology developed in [Ann. Appl. Probab. 9
(1999) 110-145, Ann. Appl. Probab. 11 (2001) 596-607] to obtain the sharp
asymptotics of the steady state probability of a queueing network when one of
the nodes gets large. We focus on a new phenomenon we call a bridge. The bridge
cases occur when the Markovian part of the twisted Markov additive process is
one null recurrent or one transient, while the jitter cases treated in [Ann.
Appl. Probab. 9 (1999) 110-145, Ann. Appl. Probab. 11 (2001) 596-607] occur
when the Markovian part is (one) positive recurrent. The asymptotics of the
steady state is an exponential times a polynomial term in the bridge case, but
is purely exponential in the jitter case. We apply this theory to a modified,
stable, two node Jackson network where server two helps server one when server
two is idle. We derive the sharp asymptotics of the steady state distribution
of the number of customers queued at each node as the number of customers
queued at the server one grows large. In so doing we get an intuitive
understanding of the companion paper [Ann. Appl. Probab. 15 (2005) 519-541]
which gives a large deviation analysis of this problem using the flat boundary
theory in the book by Shwartz and Weiss. Unlike the (unscaled) large deviation
path of a Jackson network which jitters along the boundary, the unscaled large
deviation path of the modified network tries to avoid the boundary where server
two helps server one (and forms a bridge).
