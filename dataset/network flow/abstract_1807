In this paper, we propose a new rate control algorithm for conversational
multimedia flows. In our approach, along with Real-time Transport Protocol
(RTP) media packets, we propose sending redundant packets to probe for
available bandwidth. These redundant packets are Forward Error Correction (FEC)
encoded RTP packets. A straightforward interpretation is that if no losses
occur, the sender can increase the sending rate to include the FEC bit rate,
and in the case of losses due to congestion the redundant packets help in
recovering the lost packets. We also show that by varying the FEC bit rate, the
sender is able to conservatively or aggressively probe for available bandwidth.
We evaluate our FEC-based Rate Adaptation (FBRA) algorithm in a network
simulator and in the real-world and compare it to other congestion control
algorithms.
