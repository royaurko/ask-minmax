This paper introduces an objective function that seeks to minimise the
average total number of bits required to encode the joint state of all of the
layers of a Markov source. This type of encoder may be applied to the problem
of optimising the bottom-up (recognition model) and top-down (generative model)
connections in a multilayer neural network, and it unifies several previous
results on the optimisation of multilayer neural networks.
