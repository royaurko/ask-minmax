A framework combining Yang-Mills dynamics of the pre-equilibrium glasma with
relativistic viscous hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma and
hadron gas phases is presented. Event-by-event fluctuations of nucleon
positions and color charges are taken into account, leading to negative
binomial fluctuations of gluon multiplicities. Experimental anisotropic flow
coefficients v2-v5 of charged hadron distributions in heavy-ion collisions at
the Large Hadron Collider are well described. Furthermore, event-by-event
distributions of v2, v3 and v4 measured by the ATLAS collaboration are
reproduced.
