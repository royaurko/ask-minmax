The effect of solar or stellar radiation on dust particles' trajectories (the
Poynting-Robertson drag) has been studied by a number of contributors and applied to
interplanetary dust dynamics in numerical computations. Meanwhile some
important features of dust flows can be studied analytically by implementing
our novel hydrodynamical approach to use the continuity equation written in the
particle's orbital elements as coordinates (Gor'kavyi, Ozernoy, & Mather 1997).
By employing this approach and integrating the continuity equation, we are able
to find two integrals of motion when the Poynting-Robertson drag dominates the
dissipative forces in the dust flow. These integrals of motion enable us to
explore basic characteristics of dust flows from any sources in the Solar
system (such as asteroids, comets, Kuiper belt, etc.) or in another planetary
system. In particular, we have reproduced the classical solution $n(r)\propto
r^{-1}$ that approximately represents the overall distribution of dust in the
Solar system. We have also investigated various factors that could be
responsible for the deviations of the power law index in $n(r)\propto
r^{\delta}$ from $\delta=-1$, including the influences of the orbital
characteristics of dust sources, the evaporation of dust particles, as well as
mixtures of dust particles of both asteroidal and cometary origin. We have
calculated the masses and number densities of asteroidal and cometary
components of the zodiacal cloud at different distances from the Sun.
