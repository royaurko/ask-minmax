The structure of a genetic network is uncovered by studying its response to
external stimuli (input signals). We present a theory of propagation of an
input signal through a linear stochastic genetic network. It is found that
there are important advantages in using oscillatory signals over step or
impulse signals, and that the system may enter into a pure fluctuation
resonance for a specific input frequency.
