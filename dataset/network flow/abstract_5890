Vehicular traffic is a foremost problem in modern cities. Huge amount of time
and resources are wasted while traveling due to traffic congestion. With the
introduction of sophisticated traffic management systems, such as those
incorporating dynamic traffic assignments, more stringent demands are being
placed upon the available real time traffic data. In this paper we have
proposed mobile agent as a mechanism to handle the traffic problem on road.
Mobile software agents can be used to provide the better QoS (Quality of
Service) in vehicular ad hoc network to improve the safety application and
driver comfort.
