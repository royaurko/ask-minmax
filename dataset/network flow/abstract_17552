The slope of the plasma density gradient at the separatrix is influenced by
the curvature of the density profile in the scrape-off layer (SOL). This
curvature is determined by the parallel flow loss rate and the ionization rate
in the SOL, which are influenced by the neutral gas density and electron
heating in that region. The radial electric field is also influenced by the ion
pressure gradient just inside the separatrix.
