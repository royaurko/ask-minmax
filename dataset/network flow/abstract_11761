In this research paper, an efficient routing protocol for all optical network
(AOL) is proposed. The technique uses wavelength division multiplexing (WDM).
The proposed one is different from the conventional AOL protocol in
transmission of data and control over optical fiber. A set of wavelengths is
reserved to transfer control information, which is defined as control
wavelengths. Control wavelengths are routed with packet routing scheme and the
others are routed with wavelength routing scheme. In connection oriented
network only the control packets are sent with the control wavelengths, data or
messages are sent with other wavelengths. On the other hand, in datagram
network, all the packets are sent with the control wavelengths. The allocation
of wavelengths may be fully dynamic.
