We investigate systems of interacting stochastic differential equations with
two kinds of heterogeneity: one originating from different weights of the
linkages, and one concerning their asymptotic relevance when the system becomes
large. To capture these effects we define a partial mean field system, and
prove a law of large numbers with explicit bounds on the mean squared error.
Furthermore, a large deviation result is established under reasonable
assumptions. The theory will be illustrated by several examples: on the one
hand, we recover the classical results of chaos propagation for homogeneous
systems, and on the other hand, we demonstrate the validity of our assumptions
for quite general heterogeneous networks including those arising from
preferential attachment random graph models.
