Many interactions between network users rely on trust, which is becoming
particularly important given the security breaches in the Internet today. These
problems are further exacerbated by the dynamics in wireless mobile networks.
In this paper we address the issue of trust advisory and establishment in
mobile networks, with application to ad hoc networks, including DTNs. We
utilize encounters in mobile societies in novel ways, noticing that mobility
provides opportunities to build proximity, location and similarity based trust.
Four new trust advisor filters are introduced - including encounter frequency,
duration, behavior vectors and behavior matrices - and evaluated over an
extensive set of real-world traces collected from a major university. Two sets
of statistical analyses are performed; the first examines the underlying
encounter relationships in mobile societies, and the second evaluates DTN
routing in mobile peer-to-peer networks using trust and selfishness models. We
find that for the analyzed trace, trust filters are stable in terms of growth
with time (3 filters have close to 90% overlap of users over a period of 9
weeks) and the results produced by different filters are noticeably different.
In our analysis for trust and selfishness model, our trust filters largely undo
the effect of selfishness on the unreachability in a network. Thus improving
the connectivity in a network with selfish nodes.
  We hope that our initial promising results open the door for further research
on proximity-based trust.
