In this proposition, we present a link management technique for pro-active
routing protocols for ad-hoc networks. This new mechanism is based on signal
strength hence cross layer approach is used. The hysteresis mechanism provided
by OLSR is improved upon by using signal strength in combination with the hello
loss based hysteresis. The signal power is used to determine if the
link-quality is improving or deteriorating while packet losses are handled
through the hysteresis mechanism specified in OLSR RFC. This not only makes the
link management more robust but also helps in anticipating link breakages
thereby greatly improving the performance.
