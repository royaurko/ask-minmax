We address surface solitons supported by the interface of optical lattices
imprinted in saturable media with surface-localized gain. The nonlinearity
saturation puts restrictions on the maximal energy flow carried by surface
solitons. As a consequence, the presence of thin amplifying layer near the
surface results in the controllable emission of solitons towards the lattice at
angles depending on the amplification rate and on lattice depth.
