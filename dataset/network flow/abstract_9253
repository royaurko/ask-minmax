A model of Boolean game with only one free parameter $p$ that denotes the
strength of herd behavior is proposed where each agent acts according to the
information obtained from his neighbors in network and those in the minority
are rewarded. The simulation results indicate that the dynamic of system is
sensitive to network topology, where the network of larger degree variance,
i.e. the system of greater information heterogeneity, leads to less system
profit. The system can self-organize to a stable state and perform better than
random choice game, although only the local information is available to the
agents. In addition, in heterogeneity networks, the agents with more
information gain more than those with less information for a wide extent of
herd strength $p$.
