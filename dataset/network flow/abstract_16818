The combinatorial optimization problem is one of the important applications
in neural network computation. The solutions of linearly constrained continuous
optimization problems are difficult with an exact algorithm, but the algorithm
for the solution of such problems is derived by using logarithm barrier
function. In this paper we have made an attempt to solve the linear constrained
optimization problem by using general logarithm barrier function to get an
approximate solution. In this case the barrier parameters behave as temperature
decreasing to zero from sufficiently large positive number satisfying convexity
of the barrier function. We have developed an algorithm to generate decreasing
sequence of solution converging to zero limit.
