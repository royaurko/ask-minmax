In this paper, we prove that if a continuous Hamiltonian flow fixes the
points in an open subset $U$ of a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$, then its
associated Hamiltonian is constant at each moment on $U$. As a corollary, we
prove that the Hamiltonian of compactly supported continuous Hamiltonian flows
is unique both on a compact $M$ with smooth boundary $\del M$ and on a
non-compact manifold bounded at infinity. An essential tool for the proof of
the locality is the Lagrangian intersection theorem for the conormals of open
subsets proven by Kasturirangan and the contributor, combined with Viterbo's scheme
that he introduced in the proof of uniqueness of the Hamiltonian on a closed
manifold \cite{viterbo2}. We also prove the converse of the theorem which
localizes a previously known global result in symplectic topology.
