Several distinct colour flow topologies are possible in multiparton
configurations. A method is proposed to find the correct topology, based on a
minimization of the total transverse momentum of produced particles. This
method is studied for three-jet $Z^0 \to q\overline{q} g$ and four-jet $W^+W^-
\to q_1\overline{q}_2q_3\overline{q}_4$ events. It is shown how the basic
picture is smeared, especially by parton-shower activity. The method therefore
may not be sufficient on its own, but could still be a useful complement to
others, and e.g. help provide some handle on colour rearrangement effects.
