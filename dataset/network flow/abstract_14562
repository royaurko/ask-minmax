The slow solar wind, or at least a significant part of it, originates from
the region bordering streamer helmets, where the flow tube geometry is distinct
from flow tubes rooted in the center of coronal holes. We examine whether this
particular tube geometry leads to standing shocks in the inner slow wind in
this region. To isolate the influence of tube geometry, a simple isothermal
wind model is employed and is solved in terms of the Lambert W function. In
addition to a continuous solution, the model may also admit solutions with
shocks, readily constructed with a graphical approach. When allowed, the shock
solutions appear in pairs, one with a shock located in the streamer stalk, the
other with a shock below the cusp along the streamer border. We show that
solutions with standing shocks exist in a broad area in the parameter space
characterizing the wind temperature and flow tube. In particular, streamers
with cusps located at a heliocentric distance $\gtrsim 3.2 R_\odot$ can readily
support discontinuous slow winds with temperatures barely higher than 1 MK.
