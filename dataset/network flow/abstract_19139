Reverse pricing has been recognized as an effective tool to handle the
uncertainty of users' demands in the travel industry (e.g., airlines and
hotels). To investigate its viability in cellular networks, we study the
practical limitations of (operator-driven) time-dependent pricing that has been
recently introduced, taking into account demand uncertainty. Then, we endeavor
to design the reverse pricing mechanism to resolve the weakness of the
time-dependent pricing scheme. We show that the proposed pricing scheme can
achieve "triple-win" solutions: an increase in the total revenue of the
operator; higher resource utilization efficiency; and an increment in the total
payoff of the users. Our findings provide a new outlook on resource management,
and design guidelines for adopting the reverse pricing scheme.
