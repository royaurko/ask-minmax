Non-interference is a semantic program property that assigns confidentiality
levels to data objects and prevents illicit information flows from occurring
from high to low security levels. In this paper, we present a novel security
model for global non-interference which approximates non-interference as a
safety property. We also propose a certification technique for global
non-interference of complete Java classes based on rewriting logic, a very
general logical and semantic framework that is efficiently implemented in the
high-level programming language Maude. Starting from an existing Java semantics
specification written in Maude, we develop an extended, information-flow Java
semantics that allows us to correctly observe global non-interference policies.
In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract
Java semantics that we use for secure and effective non-interference Java
analysis. The analysis produces certificates that are independently checkable
and are small enough to be used in practice.
