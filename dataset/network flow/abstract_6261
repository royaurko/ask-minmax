An algorithm for the calculation of the resistance between two arbitrary
nodes in an arbitrary distance-regular resistor network is provided, where the
calculation is based on stratification introduced in \cite{js} and Stieltjes
transform of the spectral distribution (Stieltjes function) associated with the
network. It is shown that the resistances between a node $\alpha$ and all nodes
$\beta$ belonging to the same stratum with respect to the $\alpha$
($R_{\alpha\beta^{(i)}}$, $\beta$ belonging to the $i$-th stratum with respect
to the $\alpha$) are the same. Also, the analytical formulas for two-point
resistances $R_{{\alpha\beta^{(i)}}}, i=1,2,3$ are given in terms of the the
size of the network and corresponding intersection numbers. In particular, the
two-point resistances in a strongly regular network are given in terms of the
its parameters ($v,\kappa,\lambda,\mu$). Moreover, the lower and upper bounds
for two-point resistances in strongly regular networks are discussed.
