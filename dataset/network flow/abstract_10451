This paper studies broadcasting and gossiping algorithms in random and
general AdHoc networks. Our goal is not only to minimise the broadcasting and
gossiping time, but also to minimise the energy consumption, which is measured
in terms of the total number of messages (or transmissions) sent. We assume
that the nodes of the network do not know the network, and that they can only
send with a fixed power, meaning they can not adjust the areas sizes that their
messages cover. We believe that under these circumstances the number of
transmissions is a very good measure for the overall energy consumption.
  For random networks, we present a broadcasting algorithm where every node
transmits at most once. We show that our algorithm broadcasts in $O(\log n)$
steps, w.h.p, where $n$ is the number of nodes. We then present a $O(d \log n)$
($d$ is the expected degree) gossiping algorithm using $O(\log n)$ messages per
node.
  For general networks with known diameter $D$, we present a randomised
broadcasting algorithm with optimal broadcasting time $O(D \log (n/D) + \log^2
n)$ that uses an expected number of $O(\log^2 n / \log (n/D))$ transmissions
per node. We also show a tradeoff result between the broadcasting time and the
number of transmissions: we construct a network such that any oblivious
algorithmusing a time-invariant distribution requires $\Omega(\log^2 n / \log
(n/D))$ messages per node in order to finish broadcasting in optimal time. This
demonstrates the tightness of our upper bound. We also show that no oblivious
algorithm can complete broadcasting w.h.p. using $o(\log n)$ messages per node.
