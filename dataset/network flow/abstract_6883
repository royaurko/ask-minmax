The incompressible boundary layer in the axial flow past a cylinder has been
shown Tutty et. al.(\cite{tutty}) to be stabler than a two-dimensional boundary
layer, with the helical mode being the least stable. In this paper the
secondary instability of this flow is studied. The laminar flow is shown here
to be always stable at high transverse curvatures to secondary disturbances,
which, together with a similar observation for the linear modes implies that
the flow past a thin cylinder is likely to remain laminar. The azimuthal
wavenumber of the pair of least stable secondary modes ($m_+$ and $m_-$) are
related to that of the primary ($n$) by $m_+=2n$ and $m_-=-n$. The base flow is
shown to be inviscidly stable at any curvature.
