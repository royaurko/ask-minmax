We consider dynamics of the FRW Universe with a scalar field. Using
Maupertuis principle we find a curvature of geodesics flow and show that zones
of positive curvature exist for all considered types of scalar field potential.
Usually, phase space of systems with the positive curvature contains islands of
regular motion. We find these islands numerically for shallow scalar field
potentials. It is shown also that beyond the physical domain the islands of
regularity exist for quadratic potentials as well.
