In this work the results of a bottleneck experiment with pedestrians are
presented in the form of total times, fluxes, specific fluxes, and time gaps. A
main aim was to find the dependence of these values from the bottleneck width.
The results show a linear decline of the specific flux with increasing width as
long as only one person at a time can pass, and a constant value for larger
bottleneck widths. Differences between small (one person at a time) and wide
bottlenecks (two persons at a time) were also found in the distribution of time
gaps.
