There is evidence that flying animals such as pigeons, goshawks, and bats use
optical flow sensing to enable high-speed flight through forest clutter. This
paper discusses the elements of a theory of controlled flight through obstacle
fields in which motion control laws are based on optical flow sensing.
Performance comparison is made with feedback laws that use distance and bearing
measurements, and practical challenges of implementation on an actual robotic
air vehicle are described. The related question of fundamental performance
limits due to clutter density is addressed.
