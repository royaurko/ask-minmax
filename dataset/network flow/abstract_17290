We consider the current flow in an accreting rotating neutron star (X-ray
pulsator) and propose that the active magnetosphere is limited by the Alfv\`en
surface. Formulae for the luminosity and torque due to currents circulating in
the neutron star are given, and astrophysical consequences for systems like Her
X-1 and LMXRB are shortly discussed.
