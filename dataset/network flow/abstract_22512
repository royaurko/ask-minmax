We give new characterisations of sets of positive reach and show that a
closed hypersurface has positive reach if and only if it is of class $C^{1,1}$.
These results are then used to prove new alternating Steiner formul{\ae} for
hypersurfaces of positive reach. Furthermore, it will turn out that every
hypersurface that satisfies an alternating Steiner formula has positive reach.
Finally, we provide a new solution to a problem by Hadwiger on convex sets and
prove long time existence for the gradient flow of mean breadth.
