We observed time evolution of dune fields in a water tank experiment and
simulated it by using a simple model without taking complex fluid dynamics into
account. The initial sand bed changed its form into transverse ripples, that
is, dunes with straight crest lines perpendicular to the flow direction. Then
the crescentic shaped dunes called barchans emerged from transverse ripples.
