There is an ever-increasing interest in investigating dynamics in
time-varying graphs (TVGs). Nevertheless, so far, the notion of centrality in
TVG scenarios usually refers to metrics that assess the relative importance of
nodes along the temporal evolution of the dynamic complex network. For some TVG
scenarios, however, more important than identifying the central nodes under a
given node centrality definition is identifying the key time instants for
taking certain actions. In this paper, we thus introduce and investigate the
notion of time centrality in TVGs. Analogously to node centrality, time
centrality evaluates the relative importance of time instants in dynamic
complex networks. In this context, we present two time centrality metrics
related to diffusion processes. We evaluate the two defined metrics using both
a real-world dataset representing an in-person contact dynamic network and a
synthetically generated randomized TVG. We validate the concept of time
centrality showing that diffusion starting at the best classified time instants
(i.e. the most central ones), according to our metrics, can perform a faster
and more efficient diffusion process.
