We study the phenomenon of evolution by horizontal mean curvature flow in
sub-Riemannian geometries. We use a stochastic approach to prove the existence
of a generalized evolution in these spaces. In particular we show that the
value function of suitable family of stochastic control problems solves in the
viscosity sense the level set equation for the evolution by horizontal mean
curvature flow.
