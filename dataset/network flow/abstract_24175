Fractal-like nanopatterned DNA thin films have been fabricated on mica
substrate by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Structures and components of DNA
nanopatterns were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of surface pressure on the
transferred DNA composite films has been studied. Scanning force microscopic
observations revealed that the surface structure and morphology of DNA
nanopatterns can be well controlled by changing the surface pressure. The
growth mechanism of the fractal-like nanopatterns is discussed in terms of the
diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model. The formation of large-scale DNA
networks provided a well-defined template for the construction of nanocomposite
films. Patterns of silver metal were prepared on DNA networks by subsequent
metallization process.
