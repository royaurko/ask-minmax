In a watt balance, stray capacitances exist between the coil and the magnet.
Since the electric current flowing in the coil originates a difference between
the coil and magnet electric-potentials, their electrostatic interactions must
be taken into account. This paper reports the results of a finite element
analysis of the forces acting on the coil.
