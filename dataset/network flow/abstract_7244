In an acyclic multicast network, it is well known that a linear network
coding solution over GF($q$) exists when $q$ is sufficiently large. In
particular, for each prime power $q$ no smaller than the number of receivers, a
linear solution over GF($q$) can be efficiently constructed. In this work, we
reveal that a linear solution over a given finite field does \emph{not}
necessarily imply the existence of a linear solution over all larger finite
fields. Specifically, we prove by construction that: (i) For every source
dimension no smaller than 3, there is a multicast network linearly solvable
over GF(7) but not over GF(8), and another multicast network linearly solvable
over GF(16) but not over GF(17); (ii) There is a multicast network linearly
solvable over GF(5) but not over such GF($q$) that $q > 5$ is a Mersenne prime
plus 1, which can be extremely large; (iii) A multicast network linearly
solvable over GF($q^{m_1}$) and over GF($q^{m_2}$) is \emph{not} necessarily
linearly solvable over GF($q^{m_1+m_2}$); (iv) There exists a class of
multicast networks with a set $T$ of receivers such that the minimum field size
$q_{min}$ for a linear solution over GF($q_{min}$) is lower bounded by
$\Theta(\sqrt{|T|})$, but not every larger field than GF($q_{min}$) suffices to
yield a linear solution. The insight brought from this work is that not only
the field size, but also the order of subgroups in the multiplicative group of
a finite field affects the linear solvability of a multicast network.
