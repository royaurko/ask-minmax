It was realized recently that the chordal, radial and dipolar SLEs are
special cases of a general slit holomorphic stochastic flow. We characterize
those slit holomorphic stochastic flows which generate level lines of the
Gaussian free field. In particular, we describe the modifications of the
Gaussian free field (GFF) corresponding to the chordal and dipolar SLE with
drifts. Finally, we develop a version of conformal field theory based on the
background charge and Dirichlet boundary condition modifications of GFF and
present martingale-observables for these types of SLEs.
